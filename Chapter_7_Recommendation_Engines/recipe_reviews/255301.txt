I was looking for a cupcake recipe that’s not like the typical super sweet sugar bomb.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great.  The half cup of chocolate chips was just right, adding little chocolate surprises to some bites.  To me, these are reminiscent of little carrot cakes or banana bread…more like that than the typical cupcake.  I’ll be holding onto this recipe!

Made these for my daughter's 8th birthday.  They turned out really well.  I always get a little OCD when quantities for bananas are given as just 'pieces', as the size of the fruit really does affect the end result sometimes.  In my case I think the bananas were a little too big (I used Cavendish) so my cupcakes took a lot longer to cook and got a little brown at the bottom (temp was spot on).  Otherwise the cupcakes themselves were perfect.  The frosting was way too sweet for me and most of our adult guests, but the kids loved it!

These were absolutely delicious! I didn't make this recipe for icing, I used Real Strawberry Frosting (from AR). I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted milk & sour cream. Will definitely make again! Delicious!

I'm always looking for ways to use up over-ripe bananas that is NOT banana bread. I love banana bread, but that is what I usually make when I have bananas that are past their prime . . . and let's face it, that gets a little tiring after awhile. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this recipe. My kids love banana and chocolate chips together, and these were so easy to make, and they really are more of a "cupcake" than banana muffin! The cream cheese frosting makes it even more special. I did end up adding just a tad bit more flour to the batter, as it seemed too loose. They turned out perfect, and the batter was the perfect amount for exactly 12 cupcakes. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I loved this recipe! It was delicious and a big hit at my party! The only thing  I did differently was that I added  2 pinches of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. That made it twice as good!

This was a hit at my work! Everyone loved the fact that there are real bananas in each bite. I adjusted the recipe to be half chocolate chips and half Reeses Pieces peanut butter chips and it was so tasty! I love recipes that have real fruit and this one is a winner.

Great recipe though a bit too sweet for my taste.  Others loved them as is, and I prefer them without frosting.  Would bake again; especially if I have overly ripe bananas on hand!

Very nice little cupcakes, and a thumbs up from the family for my daughter's birthday cupcakes.  I did not use the cream cheese recipe; instead, I used the Easy Cream Cheese Frosting from here.  Nothing against this frosting; I just grabbed the other frosting recipe while shopping and had those quantities of cream cheese.  These cupcakes are easy, make pretty much exactly 12 cupcakes if you put equal batter amounts in each tin, and baked up for me in 30 minutes.  They are moist with that pop of chocolate.  Might be even better with mini chocolate chips.  Since my daughter and husband loved them enough to ask for these for her party, I think they deserve 5 stars from us.  Thanks for sharing.!

These cupcakes were awesome, they were fluffy and the cream cheese frosting was really good. I will definitely make it again. I received many compliments on them.

Best cupcake recipe ever!! I made this a few times, you can leave the recipe as is,  but I tweaked it. I've also added more brown sugar, and I made my own buttermilk by adding a teaspoon of vinegar to the milk. The photo I posted, I decided to do Muffins with big tops and they turned out really well. All you have to do is fill your muffin liners full and add another big lump of batter on top and you get your big round tops! I used to make banana chocolate chip muffins and I switched to this recipe cuz I love cupcakes and man am I glad I ever did.

This is one of the best recipes I’ve found so far. I did make bars opposed to cupcakes but they worked great!

Definitely a keeper! Checks all the boxes for great cupcakes. The substitution of sour cream & milk for buttermilk worked great; I made the mixture quite thick.

Perfect sweetness with the added chips.
