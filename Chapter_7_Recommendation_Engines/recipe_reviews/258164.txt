I have never been to The Cheesecake Factory so I cannot compare but these were good. The recipe doesn't mention it but I definitely think they need a dipping sauce. I used sweet chili sauce and it was excellent with these.

Excellent first go around, I stuck to the recipe but next time I will add a little pico de Gallo and lime.

The idea of an avocado roll sounded good, but these were not. My avacado filling before I rolled and cooked them was amazing, but after cooking, they weren't good to me. I couldn't even finish them. I've never tried the actual appetizer at cheesecake factory, now I need to and hope they are better.
