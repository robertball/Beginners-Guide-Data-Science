This was great!  For simplicity's sake, I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and did not cook them.  I also didn't "really" measure the ingredients- I just threw in what I had of each item, and it still turned out great.   

And dare I say it- it was even better reheated the next day for lunch!  This one will be a regular in our house. 

(For uncooked noodles: Just layer as you normally would and add several TBSP of water to the each corners wrap tightly with foil and bake for about 50 min on 350.  When a knife easily slices thru the layers, it's finished.  Take off foil and broil for a few minutes to brown the cheese.)

I lightened things up with using ff cottage cheese, part skim ricotta cheese, egg beaters instead of eggs and one tablespoon evoo.  I also only had 1 lb of thawed spinach and that was too much for us.  Can't imagine it with any more.  Definitely needs more mushrooms too - more like 8 cups for our taste. I did not cook the noodles first and it cooked up fine with a bit of water added in the corner of my lasagna pan.  Will make again and change it up per our tastes.  The milk/flour ratio is spot on and the sauce thickened beautifully.  Nice change of pace.

This  was really delicious.  I halved the recipe and made a couple minor adjustments.  I used baby bella mushrooms and sauteed them in olive oil and butter.  I'm not a fan of ricotta cheese, so I only used about a quarter cup or so.  Everything else I did by the recipe.  I also  think that a little salt really added to the flavor so next time I will add salt as well as pepper.  It is perfect for mushroom lovers;  if you are not a hard core mushroom fan you will want to scale back on the amount you put in.  I will definitely add this one to my recipe book, thanks!

This was a very rich lasagna. It offers a suitable way to get a dose of spinach and mushrooms. All the flavors melt together as they bake with a blend of cheeses. The only change I made from this recipe was adding the salt. The original author left it out which was the main complaint that other reviewers had. Make sure you season your cheese blend and spinach mixture. Otherwise, pretty delicious!

Delicious. I will definitely make this lasagna again. I will definitely add salt next time, as the lasagna turned out a little bland.

This turned out better than I had hoped! The mushroom flavor makes its way through all the sauce, and it was the most well-structured spinach lasagna I've had. The sauce came together really easily and well, too!

I made this as is and it turned out great. I would have given it a 5 star but it was a little under salted.

Excellent.  The only thing I might add, although I was told it wasn't needed, is a little salt.  Fantastic the way it is, though :)

This is a great recipe however I found it a little bland. I also over cooked the noodles. I will take reviews advice next time and use uncooked and add water to the corners. Great recipe but will add more seasoning.

While I liked it, it was a little bland and dry.  I think it would benefit from some white wine added with the milk.

I added spinach and peppers and would probably add more garlic, but it still tasted great.

I was a little unsure how this would turn out but it was terrific! Everyone liked it. It held together well. I used no-cook noodles but that was the only adjustment.  Will definitely make this again!
