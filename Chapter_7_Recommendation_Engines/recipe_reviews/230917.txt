This is a great base recipe.  I used three different types of potatoes, including sweet and purple, and celery seed instead of stalks (bc I didn't have fresh celery). I added jalapeno and 2 additional sweet red peppers bc I have so many.  I used regular milk and added extra flour.  I made more than what was called for... I did not use exact measurements...  I did a lot of tweaking.

This was absolutely delicious and not difficult to make. It did take slightly longer than 15 minutes to prep, but that may have just been me taking my time. I used a good organic vegetable broth, and probably used 3 cups of that and 1 of water, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I used frozen  corn, and it was good, and left the skins on the potatoes for extra fibre and vitamins and for the pretty colour. I will make this again when soup seasone rolls around. Thanks very much!

I loved this recipe. I made some additional changes such as substituting water for stock. I added a little cayenne, celery salt, and dill to kick up the flavor. I know it sounds odd, but it was fantastic. I will be making this time and time again.

Made this last night...it was definitely more than 15 mins prep time, but more importantly it was very bland as the recipe stands.  I had to add more S&P and then grated cheddar cheese to make it something worth eating. With the additions, it was enjoyed, but would not make it without the cheese.

I used FF half-and-half, and as written, this was pretty bland.  I did have to thicken more to reach a chowder consistency, I added some chicken bouillon to boost the flavor, and as another reviewer mentioned, added a little shredded cheddar.  It ended up tasting pretty good, and I would make this again with these modifications.
