Wonderful!!  I wish I had read the reviews first, because I, too, found that the recipe didn't make enough for a 13x9x2" pan.  Next time, I will add another cup of cornflakes (4 total), and press into a 9" pan.  Thanks for the recipe!! -- I just made these for the 2nd time.  I used a 9" pan (worked much better!), and added 4 cups cornflakes instead of 3.  The bars fell apart and were hard to cut because there wasn't enough peanut butter mixture to hold them together.  Stick with the original recipe, using a 9" pan.

Very easy and super yummy!!!! You might have to make two batches right away because they are soooo addicting.  I love peanut butter so i put in a little more then a cup, it helps the bars stick together better.  Also i have made this a number of times and each time i have used a different cereal.  They all work the same i would just recommend that it is a plain cereal.

I found a similar recipe many years ago, in my son's, school, reading book. It was a mystery story and they were called, "Clue Cookies." (seems more a candy, I think) They actually gave the recipe and I just had to make them.
(they were made using 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of white corn syrup, instead of the brown sugar) I will definitely try this version, though.
 
Today, they are still a favorite of my kids and now my grandkids.

I use to make this when I was a kid we called them clue cookies?? My kids now enjoy them too. For chocolate & peanut butter lovers. Try adding 1/4c extra corn syrup, plus 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.

Really good and super easy to make. Next time I may add some chocolate chips or drizzle with chocolate like other reviewers said. Make sure you really squish down the mixture when putting it into your pan, that way it will hold together better.

I poured about 1/2 cup melted chocolate over the top and spread it smooth.  It was delicious and held the bars together a little better!
I will make these again!

Very good. I used Special K vanilia & almonds instead of corn flakes. I just did a light crushing of the cereal. These were very good, but are actually more of a candy than a cookie. I would make these again.

These are really great if you're looking for a quick, easy treat. They are addicting though so beware! I am a marshmallow addict, so I threw in a few handfuls of mini marshmallows after everything else was all mixed together, and I doubled the recipe so it would fit well into a 13x9. The whole family loved them! They're great chilled in the fridge!

My family absolutely love these.  We crushed 4 cups of cornflakes and it worked out great!  Used a 9x9 pan for thicker bars.  To dress them up, top with melted chocolate chips or melted canned chocolate fudge frosting....yummy!  These are the best Dawn, thanks for posting this.

YUM! I think I may have messed it up a little, too many corn flakes or something because it didn't hold together as well as I'd like but it was still really tasty!

I am not sure if I liked these or not.  My kids didn't really like them, but my nephew sure loved the "peanut butter lars" as he called them!  I just don't think that next time I am in the mood for something peanut-buttery that these will be the dessert I make...:(

My daughter went to make these once and was horrified to discover that we were out of corn syrup.  She subbed maple syrup and believe it or not, they were very tasty!  Awesome recipe!  We've used it for years without fail.

Great recipe for a fast treat.  I put the sugar and corn  syrup in the microwave to speed up the process.  I think any plain cereal would be good.  I will definitely make this recipe again

These bars were fantastic. I used a recipe for candy bar fudge from better homes & gardens and spread it over the top. Tastes like a homemade Butterfinger. =D

I'm having trouble waiting for the squares to cool they are very tasty! I used a 9 inch square pan as the 9x13 pan seemed to spread them too thin. It was quick and easy and I'll definately be making them again!

This recipe was sooooo easy! Measure the ingredients, bring the sugar and syrup to a boil, stir in the liquid ingredients and then the cereal. The results were outstanding. I used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of Cornflakes, though. I'm sure I'll make this again but maybe vary the cereal for extra fun:o)

My family and friends really love these bars.  I always get compliments when I make them.  The recipe is so quick and easy to make.  This recipe also works with Special K cereal, which I have used in a pinch.

These are very nice because the recipie is so simple, and I had everything already in my kitchen. I used the 13 X 9 pan, and it helps me to use wax paper to press it evenly into the pan. I also used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of corn flakes, and it turned out great. The only problem was when I cut them into squares and put them into a bowl, they stuck to eachother, so you may want to layer them with wax paper and keep them in the fridge to stay hard.

Wonderful! So easy to make! I didn't have corn flakes but substituted frosted flakes and omitted the brown sugar since the frosted flakes already were sweet. It turned out perfectly and so good!

My 12 year old daughter found this recipe and made these.  She loves them! However, you must use a 8 or 9 inch square pan or double the recipe because it does not make enough for a 9x13 inch pan.  These are simple and delicious and great for the kids to make.

At first I add 1/4 extra corn syrup after reading a review and some choclate chips. Trust me don't follow it it didn't set right. The second time I follow exactly as stated but I did add some choclate chip turned out great.

I made this with bran flakes, which was nice, but the recipe assumes we all use processed peanut butter instead of the natural all-peanut kind. All-natural pb doesn't melt like the processed kind, and the mixture is less sticky. Next time I'd have to use more corn syrup, perhaps double.

This will not fill a 9x13 pan.  So I dropped them by the spoonful and pressed down a little with the back of the spoon.  I also substituted about 1/2 cup of cornflakes with a flaxseed bran flake (trying to sneak in more nutrition than kids will know.)  They tasted great.  Speaking of nutrition,  Some melted chocolate spread over the top would be really good on these too.  This recipe is good, it is not overly  sweet as it might sound.

These bars were excellent.  My husband loved them.  The only bad thing about the recipe was that it did not make a full 9 x 13 pan for me.  Next time I'll try a double batch.  Very good otherwise!

Holy Wow! Fantastic! I used Special K because that's what I had on hand and spread in an 11x7 Pyrex dish, which I think was the perfect size. I also pressed done chocolate chips into the top before refrigerating. YUMMY!

The reason I gave this recipe 4/5 stars is because there is no way in heck it fits into a 9x13 pan!! I doubles the recipe and there still wasn't enough to fill to the thickness of what is shown in the picture. 

As for the recipe itself, it's great! I did make one small change, as I said I doubled the recipe but instead of 2 cups of PB I put 1.5 and a 1/2 cup of nutella! They are not hard yet but I did however lick the spoon and it was very yummy! 

If you are looking for a healthy bar this is NOT it!! 300 calories for a tiny little piece is by no means healthy lol

This was one of the best things I've made/eaten in a long time. As a peanut butter lover, I am sure to make these again. Thank you!! My only thought is to try the next batch with a little marshmallow fluff in addition to the peanut butter...

Fab. Much sweeter and more candy like than the traditional cereal bar (one cup white sugar, one cup corn syrup, one cup peanut butter, six cups cereal). I used 4 cups uncrushed corn flakes (didn't crush them after measure either) & a 9x9 pan.

Not really impressed with this recipe, I made it only because of the other good reviews. I don't think that I'll make them again, sorry.

I made this recipe for my daughters 2nd grade class.  I substituted Cocoa Puffs for Corn flakes.  The chocolate and peanut butter were a big hit.  Mine also didn't fill a 9x13 pan. Use a 9" and cut your bars smaller.
