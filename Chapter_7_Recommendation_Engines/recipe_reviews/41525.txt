I made this recipe and I thought the cookies were great. I didn't have any nutmeg so I used cinamon. I would have liked them better if I hadn't used anything but I was afraid they would have no taste. Definitely will bake again.

Simple? Yes. Tasty? Not a chance. This is the all-time worst recipe I have ever found on the internet. These sugar cookies, once baked, more closely resemble sugar biscuits. I should have known better since sugar cookie dough generally needs refrigeration. Next time, I'll skip the shortcuts and enjoy the end product a lot more.

This cookies had no flavor and were difficult to work with.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this recipe to someone wanting to cook with children.  Perhaps adding different spices would help, but I won't make the original recipe again.

This is a good, basic recipe.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract, because I knew I'd like it better.  The fact that you don't have to chill this puts it over the top!

This is a great quick recipe. I added cinnamon to the dough and it gave alot more flavor.
