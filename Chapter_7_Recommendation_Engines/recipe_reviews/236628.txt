Great recipe. I added another 8 ounces of tomato sauce and then fresh mozzarella slices on top of the peppers with 15 minutes cooking time left. Excellent.

I made it with lean ground turkey because I couldn't find Bison. Was very good. I'm gonna sub either the tomatoes or the tomato sauce with some picante next time to give it a little kick.

I found bison meat at Trader Joes and needed a recipe, so this was a great find. I diced up onion and mushrooms and sauteed them, then added it to the bison filling. I also used a shredded cheese blend on top (I think it's mozzarella and parmesan). Turned out great! I might try it with ground turkey next time.

I made with Bison, used Ancient Grains instead of rice and I added black beans.  I also added a slice of mozzarella cheese to the top of each pepper the last 15 minutes as noted by another review here and sprinkled so dried basil on top.  This was really good and will make again.  Thank you for the recipe. (Apologies for the duplicate pictures - first time adding pic)

It came out so awesome, the meat and rice and the spices were just right and the peppers were cooked with perfection not soft and not hard was just right, there was a crunch to the peppers and very easy to cut...My family Loved it!!

I added another 8 ounces of tomato sauce and sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese on top. It didnâ€™t need to cook for the full hour, just about 40 minutes depending on how soft you like the green peppers.  A lot more moist than ground turkey stuffed green peppers.
