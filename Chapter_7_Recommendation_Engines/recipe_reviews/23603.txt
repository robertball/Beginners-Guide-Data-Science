I think this recipe is really good and easy. A little rich because of the butter on top I think, but otherwise delicious.
If you're looking for a creamy "kraft mac and cheese" recipe, this isn't it. This is more of a pasta bake.

This was good. I cooked it for thanksgiving. It was easy to make. I did change it a bit though using spaghetti noodles instead and added dry mustard.

I was so excited to make homemade macaroni and cheese for the first time for my new husband when I tried this recipe. However, I was pretty disappointed with the results. Mine came out very dry and wasn't flavorful. Some spots were cheesy and others just had the egg mixture on it. It needs something to make it creamier and cheesier.

The recipe came out to be really dry and it seems like it needs more cheese...it wasn't cheesy enough.

I was a little nervous about this because I didn't have enough cheese on hand, but it still turned out really good and my picky six year old just loved it.

Not creamy at all. Cheese and mac didn't mix well. Maybe not enough cheese, or perhap's processed cheese may have worked better.

I tried this recipe last night and was disappointed.  After following the recipe to the tee and even baking it for less time than suggested, the dish came out extremely dry.  My suggestions would be to add more milk than just a 1/4 cup and add something else that will give it more flavor.

I make a similar dish, but I make the sauce in a separate pan where I melt extra sharp cheese into the milk with some cornstarch added and then add it to the pasta (I don't bother with egg or butter).  You can either bake it in the oven for 1/2 hour or serve right away.

The southern recipe I grew up with, passed along from generations before. Not that yucky creamy version at all, but the thick cheesy have to cut with a knife goodness

Fantastic. I used Colby-jack cheese instead. I sprinkled Parmesan on top. I also stored it all together before baking

I made this because I hadn't made baked mac and cheese in a while and needed a measurement reference. It's on point with what I've done in the past, with a couple of slight differences: Instead of using eggs, ( never used eggs in my Mac before), I used 1 1/2 cups milk. I always mix a couple dollops of sour cream in as well, to give it a little kick. Also, I stirred the Mac and cheese after baking for 30 minutes, and added more shredded cheese on top, then baked another 20 minutes. (It wasn't cheesy enough for our taste when I first made it, according to directions). Overall, simple and delicious!! Don't be afraid to add your own twist!!

I doubled the milk to 1/2 cup and only baked it for 20 minutes.  Doing this, we didn't find it dry and the adults enjoyed it.  Our child ate a full portion but said he would prefer noodles with a creamy sauce and no  cheese melted on top.  :-)

It's a good recipe easy and a little fun to make. I used fettuccine Noodles and used half of the recommended butter and mild cheese and it was good but a little flavor less.
