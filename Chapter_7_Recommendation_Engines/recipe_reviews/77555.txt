This tea was wonderful but I did cut the sugar to a little over one cup.  The only problem I had was when I poured the boiling water into the glass pitcher it cracked.  Thinking it was an old pitcher I bought a new one and the same thing happen again.  So I now disolve the sugar in the pan of hot tea and when that cools I pour it into a glass pitcher. NOTE: I only use a stainless steel pan to make my tea.

Would be 5 stars if the recipe toned down the sugar a bit.  I used 1-1/2 cups and even think I can get away with making it with 1-1/4 cups.  2 cups to me would be way too sweet.  I didn't have family size tea bags and used 4 regular size.   UPDATE- My Bf is in love with this tea he said its the best.

Anyone in the Souoth knows that sweet tea is the ONLY tea! However 2 cups of sugar for 1/2 gallon of tea is TOO much.(You don't want syrup)
Cut the sugar by half, at least and you will have good tea.

This was so good! I only made a 2-quart pitcher, so I used 2 tea bags and 1 cup of sugar and it was perfect! 
Thanks!

My daughter and I love this tea. Make no mistake, this tea is heavy on the sweet! I've cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and *still* get a very sweet, tasty tea. Don't worry if you don't have orange-pekoe tea on hand -  I've made this using 7 regular sized Liptons Natural Tea and the results were very still very good.

Thank GOODNESS for this recipe!  My husband and I moved from Tennessee to Illinois 3 years ago and can't get a glass of sweet tea ANYWHERE up here!  If we take a sip of this sweet tea and close our eyes, we could almost believe we were back in Knoxville!  I did cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 C, maybe because I've been living above the Mason-Dixon too long  :)

This makes authentic, southern iced tea...so authentic I had to cut the sugar down to one cup.  For the best results, use Luzianne brand tea bags and add a wedge of lemon.

This was a God sent .....We lived in  ,Wiconsin. A person can't find a great glass of tea anywhere.This recipe was an everyday thing!...No wonder why Wisconsonites drink so much beer. We're back in the South and we'll continue this recipe !

i wanted to drop a helpful hint in regards to the reviewer that cracked two pitchers with hot tea.i do not remember who told me this i just remember after cracking my first tea pitcher so many years ago,someone told me to put a butter knife into the pitcher before pouring in the hot tea. the metal attracts the heat and keeps it from cracking the glass.and i have not cracked one since. hope this helps yall too.

This how I've been making my swet tea for years.  3-2-1.  3  family size tea bags, 2c sugar, 1 quart water.  I bring the water just to a boil turn off the heat and add tea bags.  After removing I dissolve the sugar in the hot tea and pour the 1 quart of liquid into a 1/2 gallon or gallon container filled with ice.  Those who say its too sweet; you serve iced tea over a glasss full of ice so it dilutes it quite a bit.  If you cut the sugar too much in the beginning it will be very diluted by the time it gets to the glass

I give it a 5 because there just isn't any substitute for good, ol' Southern sweet tea! As with other reviewers, I also don't like mine quite this sweet, and a good bit stronger, so I use 8 regular sized Lipton tea bags and 1 cup sugar, to make 1 gallon of tea. If I have folks coming over that don't do sugar, I will make it without, but have a container of simple syrup made and ready (2 cups sugar dissolved in 1 cup hot/boiling water) so that each person who wants can then sweeten to their individual tastes.

Excellent tea with less sugar. Easier to steep the tea in a tea pot with a lid. Fewer tea bags are needed with this method. Steeping with a lid on makes a stronger tea.  The best way to prevent a glass pitcher from breaking when adding the boiling water, is to put a metal knife or other metal utensil in the pitcher first. My mother always did this and the pitcher will not break. Or, you could use a pyrex pitcher.

Note:  this recipe is for a gallon not a 1/2 gallon...married to an Alabama boy and this ratio is right for Alabama Sweet Tea. (2c to the gallon). Interestingly, this is the same ratio for Kool-Aid and McDonalds Sweet Tea.  Another thing is the importance of mixing the sugar in with the HOT tea then chilling.

I'm from the South and this is a good recipe.  However, I would recommend cutting back on the sugar.  I use 1 and 1/2 cups at the very most.  If you get cloudy tea, try letting the steeped tea cool for about 30 minutes before stirring it into the sugar.

I cut the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup and added it to the tea in the pot, then added 2 caps of lemon juice.  I let it come to room temp, then poured the mixture over lemon slices and chilled in the fridge for 1 hour.  I served at a party and everyone loved it!

This tea is great but I tweaked it a little, I took the 2 cups of sugar put it in a sauce pan and added 2 cups of water to it. Then brought it to a boil, stir until the sugar dissolves, let it cool and you have simple syrup. I store mine in a quart jar, it doesn't have to be refrigerated. Make the awesome tea as directed, chill and when you are ready to serve let everyone add their own simple syrup to their liking with some lemon. You don't have to worry about the sugar being too sweet or not enough. I make lemonade by the glass and use the ss, it works very well.  A northern  girl born and bred who now lives in Tennessee and loves it. It's a 5 star.

Someone said it was too much sugar for 1/2 gallon of tea. It isn't supposed to be just 1/2 gal when finished. You are supposed to make the tea with 1/2 gallon water and THEN once the tea is done, fill it up the rest of the way---to one gallon--- with water.

For those of you giving lesser ratings because of the sweetness, did you miss the part where it said "Southern" sweet tea?  As a Southern girl, born and raised, I EXPECT it to me almost unbearably sweet.  This tea was perfect.  Thank you, poster.

this is a good recipe, however, you forgot the LEMON! add the juice of about 6 good lemons and that's will make it better. also, i don't put ice in the pitcher - it dilutes it too much. if you pour the hot tea into a glass full of ice cubes, it's not too sweet - it's JUST right. add a sprig of mint, and you're really cooking with hot grease!

My husband is very appreciative of this recipe. He is from Georgia and loves his sweet tea. I, on the other hand, put almost no sugar in my iced tea... So he asked me to make this for him. I did a half-batch as I don't have a huge pitcher, and I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of a cup. At first he said it wasn't sweet enough, but after it sat in the fridge for an hour or two, he said it was much better. I tried it... and almost went into sugar-shock. And I love my sweets! Well, he can enjoy it, and I'll enjoy my hot tea. :) Thanks for sharing, LoveCats2001!

I love iced tea. I made the recipe as directed and no one could drink it due to sweetness.  Next time, I used 1 cup of sugar, 8 regular sized tea bads, and a gallon of water and thought it was still alittle sweeter than it should be. I think I will cut it to 3/4 of sugar to a gallon.

I have been searching for a sweet tea recipe. This one is wonderful...we got hooked on sweet tea living in TN. Now in TX can only find it at Chick fil a. This recipe tastes sooo very good! I easily found the pekoe tea at Kroger.
thanks for a good memory!

My boyfriend is a NC native and loves his sweet tea. The only change I made was I added less cold water to the final step, about 1.5 cups instead of 3. I only get about 3 qts of sweet tea total. As soon as I am finished making it I put it immediately in the fridge. This is also very good with lemonade to make awesome Arnold Palmer's! The niece and nephews love those.

I live in Colorado, and have loved sweet tea ever since my friend from Tennessee made me try some of hers. She moved back recently and I have been craving some real southern style sweet tea, and this was exactly what I have been looking for! thank you!

I grew up in Texas and now that I live in New Mexico realize how difficult it is to get a great cup of sweet tea.  This recipe took me back to many a hot day spent sipping on just such a cup.  Very refreshing and easy

I am from Texas and you can get the same excellent results by boiling 3 cups of water in the microwave with 4 (Luzianne is the best tea) family size tea bags.  Let steep for a few minutes, longer if you like your tea strong.  Put 1 - 1 1/2 cups of sugar per gallon of tea in a pitcher (More if you like it really sweet).  Remove and squeeze tea bags.  Pour hot tea over sugar and stir until dissolved.  Add water to fill pitcher.  I add cold water from my fridge, not from the tap, as it will make it too frothy.  Everyone LOVES this tea.

Having been born and raised in Alabama I have always considered my mother's sweet tea to be the best in the world.  But she does not re-boil her tea, after steeping, and only uses one cup of sugar per half gallon.  And her tea is plenty sweet...in more ways than one!  She also says that chilling the tea, before it has cooled to room temperature, will make it cloudy.  So, I would not want to add the ice to the pitcher.  Give it a little while to cool, then pour over ice.  Perfect!

I use Splenda instead of sugar and also cut it to 1 cup. I also use decaf tea. This is great for the grandkids who think they are special to have "Sweet Tea"

Absolutely delicious, teeth-hurting, tastes-like-home, sweet-tea. Just like my great-grandmother made it. I've cut down on the sugar these days and have even adulterated the holy brew with splenda, but this is the real thing bless your heart!

Ok, I don't know what Alabama the reviewer Samantha is from, but I'm also an Alabama girl and this truly is how sweet tea is supposed to taste! Good job on coming up with a recipe. We never had to use one *smile*

Maybe it's because I'm Canadian, but I'd never heard of sweet tea. I'd been looking for an iced tea recipe and came across the excellent ratings on this one. I put a sprig of mint in with Ginger Green tea and some lemon slices and this was a hit!  I've never heard of family sized tea bags so I'll add more bags next time and maybe use splenda because I could drink the whole pitcher to myself :)

I am southern also and used to make my tea with 2 cups, but I have reduced my sugar to 1 cup and make a full gal. with 5 regular or 3 family size tea bags.  I always get compliments on my tea. I sometimes drink it with no sugar. It is simply your choice on the sweetness.

I like this recipe but I had to make a couple of changes for my crew. I run ten cups of water through the coffee maker drop the tea bags in, shut the coffee maker off and let the tea brew for about an hour and a half. We like the stronger tea flavor. I also cut the sugar down to one and a half cups. Other than that I follow the rest of the directions.

Very good tea. As for all the complaints about too much sugar, I think that's more just a matter of taste. I was practically raised on VERY sweet tea, and this was just right.

Personally i like Luzianne(maybe because that is what my Grandmother uses in Mississippi) but i like to add an orange slice, it gives it a little different flavor to mix things up from time to time.

I used 1/2 cup of Splenda (I haven not used sugar for years) and added lemon juice, about four lemons. My cousin warned me never to order iced tea if I travel south because they serve it unsweetened and without lemon. Weird. I've never met anyone that drinks it without sugar and lemon. ;-)

Great recipe!  I followed other reviewer's advice and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups--I might reduce it a little more next time.  I love the sweet tea at Cracker Barrel, and this tastes very close.  Thanks!

This tea is awesome!  I made it with the 2-cups but found it to be too sweet for me.  But, if you like the Bojangle's super-sweet tea --- this is your recipe!  After using just 1-1/2 cups of sugar, it turned out awesome for us.  My mom made the best sweet tea in the world.  She's gone now and this recipe tastes just like hers.  Thanks for sharing.

As a "southern girl" I love some sweet tea! I gave this a 4 star because it's a little heavy on the sugar. I use about a cup and a quarter of sugar instead and I use lemon and orange slices too,  Yum-yum! I am so glad that the rest of the country is now enjoying what we "southerners" have always known is a delight......sweet refreshing tea!

Sweet Tea the way it was meant to be!  I noticed some of the other reviewers mentioned that they had trouble when pouring the hot tea into a glass pitcher.  To avoid this, there are a few different things one can try.  My Mom and Grandma both use ceramic pitchers that they bought in the NC mountains...the glazed clay pitchers don't break as easily as their glass counterparts, and can be ordered online these days (though a trip to the mountains to go pottery shopping is always fun!)  Or, if you prefer, you can add the sugar during the boiling process, and then SLOWLY pour the tea over a pitcher full of ice, thus cooling it as it goes in, and eliminate the need for the extra water!  Such a fantastic recipe!  Thanks!

This tea is awesome.  My 5 yr old always adds so much sugar so I tried this out and I am so glad I did.  I only added 1 1/4 cup of sugar and I used 3 family size tea bags of regular tea.  I then threw in 3 bags of raspberry zinger celestial seasonings and the hint of raspberry is awesome.  Next time I will try it with the orange tangerine and the balck cherry flavors.  But, even without the flavorings I know that this is a bomb tea.

I find this tea to sweet I used 1 cup sugar and it turned out just the right sweetness and I used a tea made for iced tea that does not cloud up a day after it was made.

I make mine with a Mr. Coffee ice tea maker and put the sugar in the pitcher that the tea is making in then stir, add to another picture and add water.

If this is what sweet tea tastes like, I'm glad I live in Washington state! This is tooth curling sweet. If you cut the sugar, then it really can't be called sweet tea, but that's what needs to be done to make this drinkable.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
i have been searching and searching for a sweet tea recipe.  This one is GREAT.
I do agree with some of the others, you might need to experment with the amount of sugar.  For me probabley 1/2.  I got adicted to Red Diamond, and this is every bit as good, and its avalible anytime.

This is definitely SWEET tea! I am from Boston, but went to college in the South and became addicted to sweet tea while I was studying for exams. I will cut the sugar in half next time. If you like extra super sweet tea though, this recipe is for you!

This is a great recipe honest-to-goodness Southern recipe, but as everyone else said - it's way too much sugar.  With half the amount of sugar it still tastes wonderful.  I like to use raw cane sugar (turbinado) instead of white sugar; it tastes better and isn't processed as much.  If you add lime instead of lemon it tastes almost exactly like "Arizona Iced Tea."

I am a pro at making the perfect sweet tea, thanks to my grandmother. She makes hers sweeter than mine and she uses about 2 cups. For the avg sweet tea you need a cup and a half of sugar - any more it's too sweet and any less it just is not sweet enough. Also, I use 4 tea bags and I put them in a pot of water, bring it to a boil and then turn off the eye and let it cool a little. Then I add the brewed tea to ice and sugar in the pitcher. Works perfectly every time.

I personally find this to be toothache inducing sweet.  Not so good at all.  But, I need to dispute the fact you can't get this up north.  I'm from PA and my family makes this ALL the time.  I myself do not like it, but it's been a staple at my family reunions since I was a little girl.  To make this even remotely appetizing, you need to at **least** half the sugar.

I followed the advice of others, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2c.  It was still VERY sweet, but the tea flavor was the perfect strength.  Next time I will go with 1 1/4c sugar.

Personally, I'm not a fan of Iced Tea.  But last summer I told some friends who was relocating from another city that I would take care of lunch for their moving crew.  I knew that several in the group liked tea, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've made it several times since.  I've always used the non-flavored tea bags, so I slice a lemon and put the lemon slices in the tea to add a little flavor.  My Dad is Diabetic and loves Iced Tea - so for our Father's Day cookout last year I substituted the Sugar with Splenda, so that he could enjoy a glass of Sweet Tea - and it again turned out great. (according to him)  I won't use any other recipe or canned mix again.

Experiment with the amount of sugar.  We were able to cut the sugar in half and it was still sweet enough for our taste.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I did take the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

This was very good.  I followed the other reviews and put in 1 1/2 cups of sugar. It was sweet but we liked it.

Absolutely perfect!  Being in New Zealand I've had such a hankering for sweet tea and this definitely eased my homesickness!  I definitely plan to make it when I get back home to North Carolina!

I'm a North Carolinian myself, and boy do I LOVE my sweet tea!  This person definitely suceeded in making sweet tea seem more complicated than it really is!  I throw two Lipton family-sized tea packets in water, let it boil for about five minutes or so, and then pour it in a pitcher.  I only add 1.5 cups (true sweet tea is probably around 2 cups) to the pitcher and stir, adding some cold water. When you fill it up, throw it in the fridge and you're done!  My bf is from South Dakota and he can't get enough of sweet tea!

This sweet tea is very good. Everyone loves it in our home! I did cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Sometimes I fill the remainder with just ice and not water and it tastes fine. I also use decaf. Thanks for the recipe!

The people being critical are not following the directions.  As M TUBB states, 2 cups sugar is too much for a 1/2 gallon.  The recipe makes 1 GALLON, not 1/2.  You use 1/2 gallon water then add water at the end to fill the gallon jug.  Please be mindful of what you are doing before you criticize

I love sweet tea but this recipe was just too sweet. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly as written (except for the pouring of the boiling water into a glass pitcher bit) but, after tasting it, I had to brew additional tea and add more water before we could drink anymore of it. The second time, I added only 1 1/4 cup sugar and it still tasted plenty sweet and was absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe!  I'm a South Dakota native now living in Texas.  Whenever we had guests they always wanted sweet tea, and I had never made it in my life.  I found this recipe and tried it and now every time I make it, I get lots of compliments on my great "sweet tea".  I do cut down the sugar some, as 2 cups sounded like way to much, but it's a great recipe, and I'll be making it often. Thanks!

The tea is delicious!  I did not add any ice cubes in between as the recipe stated.  I added ice cubes just before I took it outside in the heat.  Everybody seemed to enjoy it and it was gone within minutes (and I made three batches of it).  Also, I used decaf. tea.

I used six raspberry tea bags since it's all I had and I'm on bed rest. I also changed the sweetener to 5 packets of Truvia. Honestly, for my own Texas girl taste buds, I will use a couple more next time. However, all in all, great glass of tea!! Thank you!!

Good recipe but cut the sugar to a little over 1 cup, taste a little, then add more!!! You can always add more but you can’t take it out.

I like sweetened tea but this was a too sweet for me. The glory of making my own is being able to adjust the sweetness.

I make lots of sweet tea for home and church . Everyone loves it 
3- family size tea bags 
Bring a small boiler with water to a boil . Remove from heat drop in 3 family size tea bags . Cover for at least 5 - 20 mins . In a gallon pitcher put  one and one half cups of sugar in it , pour hot tea over the sugar . Add a pinch of baking soda and stir until sugar is dissolved. Fill with water to top to make one gallon . Keep in fridge .ENJOY

I come from Salisbury in the UK, but my dad and my step-mom live in Daphne, AL. I'm heart sick for the place atm so I made this tea to remind me of Mobile. I used natural sweetener instead of sugar (100g of Truvia). Omg, it's so very good, but I think I miss the place even more now!

ORANGE PEKOE IS THE KEY - IT MAKES A "CLEAR" TASTING TEA. THE SUGAR AMOUNT IS SIMPLY YOUR TASTE - JUST DON'T LEAVE IT OUT.  AGAIN ORANGE PEKOE MAKES THE BEST ICED TEA AND OF COURSE THE ONLY TEA FOR THE HOT SOUTH IS ICED. USED TO BE ABLE TO BUY TENDER LEAF ORANGE PEKOE, BUT NOW JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE TEA YOU USE IS ORANGE PEKOE AND DON'T MAKE IT POND WATER WEAK.

Was born and raised in Alabama. This is what I grew up drinking. But tea is like anything else. Sugar, mint, etc... Should be adjusted to suit your personal preferences. Make and enjoy. And if you don't want to try to make it, buy a gallon of Milo's.(made in Birmingham, AL)

Perfect as is. And it is what it is: southern sweet tea. The way we cut back the sweetness is NOT by reducing the sugar, but by adding a couple of lemon wheels or lemon wedges into your cup. (Not into the pitcher - the lemons will get soggy & gross.) 2 fresh lemon wedges added per serving cup. Squeeze one into the tea for its juice, and plop the other one in to soak. Use plenty of ice. Perfect!

A hint to the woman who cracked her glass pitchers-- my grandmother taught me to always place a stainless steel knife in the pitcher before pouring boiling water in it. It diffuses the heat!

This recipe was a nice addition to our annual Canada Day BBQ.  We did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and for an added twist added some fresh mint leaves from our garden along with a touch of vanilla extract and a few lemon slices. What I enjoyed most about this recipe was the building of the ingredients.

As an Alabama boy, born and bred, I can attest to the authenticity of this recipe. Just how grandma makes it! Several people have said the amount of sugar called for makes the tea too sweet, but when served in a tall iced tea glass filled with ice (and maybe a lemon wedge) it comes out perfect. Great recipe!

It was very good with 4 big bags.  Following the above recipe's directions this is what works best for me:
-1 gallon jug of "drinking water". Pour 2 cups off & save to top off, (needs room for 2 cups sugar) or use it for the ice cubes.
-4 Family Size Teabags (I use 5 for decaffeinated)
-Refrigerate if convenient till very cold. (That way it doesn't get
 watery from ice melting when served in a tall "iced tea glass".)
So, 2 cups sugar is perfect for a GALLON of finished product!

Note: Some areas in the south do make extremely sweet tea. But they generally add fresh squeezed lemon juice as well as the garnish of slices. You need the sugar then!

PS: A gallon can be a lot for 1 person. Sweet tea in the refrigerator becomes cloudy after a few days. Sweeten, to taste, by the glass and it will easily stay clear and fresh for a month.

Thank you! This recipe is great but I attempted it and it was WAY to sweet.
