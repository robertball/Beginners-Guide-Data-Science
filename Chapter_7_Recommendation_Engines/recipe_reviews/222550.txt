YUMMY!  I made these drinks for my BUNCO group.  They were a hit!  Didn't know where to purchase "Cream of Coconut" but found it in the liquor store.  Used 1/2 ounce of cr. of coconut instead of full ounce (on advice from the sales lady at the liquor store).  They were wonderful!  Start with 1/2 ounce of cr. of coconut and work up if you want more coconut flavor.  I love coconut and 1/2 was enough for me.

This is one drink that will keep you Cool in the summer time and transport you to PARADISE! ! My Sugar Bear and I went to the Yard House after the movies. I asked the waitress for one of these and Man was it Yummy! ! The only way to make it taste better would be if I was sipping it IN Hawaii :):) Thanks AR, its a Keeper!

This is one of my all-time favorite mixed drinks!  I usually don't add the pineapple slice or cherry, since it's just me and I don't need to impress, but it's yummy nonetheless!

We tweaked it a bit, because we are island girls.  We added a shot of simple syrup, shot of sprite, 1 1/2 oz coconut milk non sugar, tsp vanilla, 1 shot of sweet and sour, 2 shots of rum rather then one. 
It took it up a notch, and wow-ser it was great, delicious!!!!

This represents all things that are Hawaiian.  From the beautiful color of the ocean to the magical tropical flavors.  I used coconut flavored rum which gave it an added boost of coconut.  No Hawaiian party should be without one!

Did not have coconut cream, or light rum, so I used coconut rum, and the drink was perfect. Just like the one I get at Moxies.

This drink taste like vacation...it is very nice, has a subtle coconut flavor and is well-balanced.  I can only drink one (and I like to drink).

Very tasty, after making a pitcher my husband and I both decided it needed more of a punch and doubled the rum.

This drink is really good. To make it slushier  add 1.5 cups of crushed ice. Also really strong pineapple taste so I'd recommend using a little less creme of coconut.

I made 3 of them yesterday. Very good indeed. I didnt have the cherries or pineapple wedges, but the drink itself was excellent. Sat on my deck with a book and my Blue Hawaiian. Good times!

Substituted sorbe coconut juice for the coconut cream. Skipped the pineapple ring and cherry garnish. I did not really care much for the cura√ßao liquor flavor.  I was expecting more of a Kailua mudslide texture, but instead it was more foamy or frothy. Which could due to the sorbe coconut drink that I used.

Just mixed up a batch for Father's Day celebration in a ratio of 1:1:2 of Parrot Bay Coconut, blue Curacao and pineapple juice and it was delicious! Will be on to round 2 here soon so I thought I should write this review first. Yum!
