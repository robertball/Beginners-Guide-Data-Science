My family loves this recipe.  I made it twice now for dinner and served it over rice.  I will admit to cheating and using prepared frozen meatballs.  I make the sauce and then throw the meatballs in frozen and cook 3+ hours.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and have learn a few things.  Only let it cook 4 hours or less because the meatballs will become greasy after that.  I use red onion for a milder flavor.  I also use store bought frozen meatballs in the bag and double the sauce and that works well.  This is truely a great recipe to have.  Enjoy!

Made this recipe this afternoon, and it was great.
It was easy to make and so good.  Will definately make it for the Super Bowl Get together.

Such a good flavor!  I did double the sauce recipe because you can never have enough sauce espically when entertaining some people take a small amount of sauce others dredge their food in it.  meatballs were very tasty with the ranch mix.  worth making and not very time consuming.  Once the meatballs are done, put them in a crock pot and let them cook.  thanks for the recipe!

I always get tons of compliments on this recipe. I have made it 3 times--the first time I missed the ranch dressing package but it was still delicious so I just left it out. Otherwise I make it exactly as listed here and I always give people the link to the recipe!

Used frozen meatballs, brought them to a boil in a pan, then cooked them on med. heat for 20 min. in the pan, then transfered them to the preheated crockpot for 45 min. on low, and I doubled the sauce.  They were perfect!

I made these for the game and they were awesome! I used 1 lb ground pork and 1/2 lb ground beef and I added about 2 tbs grill seasoning and 1 tsp. minced garlic to the meat. The sauce was really good- but I doubled it and added about 2 tbs brown sugar and 1 tbs minced garlic.  Everyone loved them and I will adding them to my favorites. Thanks!

Gone within minutes!  I decided last minute that I wanted to add appetizer meatballs to my menu.  I didn't have cola so I used Dr. Pepper, and we added our own hot sauce (RefinersFireHotSauce.com).  It was a smash hit.  My guests kept asking about how to make them.

These were great, I didn't add the peppers and onions to the sauce because the kids would never eat them and I made these for my sons birthday party. I had to make copies of the recipes for 5 or 6 people. I loved them and I am not a meatball person. lol

I used Coke Zero as well as red pepper instead of green. I'm not the only person who ate these meatballs and thought there was WAY too much bread crumbs in this meatball. Even making it, I had to add a half cup of water to get the meatballs to make actual meat BALLS and not meat crumble. My son made the comment of "Mom, can you make meatballs next time with more meat and less ball, please?" Plus, the combination of the ranch dressing mix with the barbeque sauce was just not for us. I really won't be trying this again and most of this dinner was wasted.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit!  Even my husband liked the meatballs and he's a hard man to please when it comes to food!  I doubled the recipe, but next time I will cut back on the vinegar and black pepper, it was a little bitter and spicy.  Overall tho, a great recipe!

Made this for a party and I should have made two batches! Being lazy, I opted for heating up frozen Swedish meatballs rather than making them from scratch. Just heated them up according to package instructions and placed in slow cooker with the sauce.

I quadrupled the recipe for a party (but only doubled the amount for the green pepper), and it turned out pretty good!  It doesn't have the overly sweet sauce, so if you don't care for stuff too sweet, this is for you! I also used frozen Italian meatballs instead of making them from scratch.

I made the sauce exactly as the recipe calls for and got rave reviews from the potluck I took them to!  I did cheat and use pre-made meatballs because I was short on time.  It's a good, fast potluck dish that I'll for sure do again!

I made the sauce as written exactly and it was horrible.  I made 5 cocktail meatball recipes from this site and did a taste comparison.  This was the worst of all 5.  The best was sweet & sour meatballs.  Will not make again.

Like some other reviewers, I found myself using frozen meatballs simply to save on time during a busy work week.  I followed the other directions with the addition of some shallots in the sauce.  I will admit that during cooking, it had a very strong vinegar aroma, so I wasn't sure I would like it.  But the taste was good, so overall a good recipe.

I didn't make the sauce yet, but the meatballs were terrific. I omitted the grated onion and baked them as directed- quick and easy and good flavor.

These were a hit at our holiday party! I used frozen meatballs, and omitted the vinegar since some reviewers thought that the sauce was too vinegary. I doubled the amount of meatballs, and quadrupled the amount of sauce, since some reviewers had mentioned that there wasn't enough sauce. There probably would have been enough sauce if I had just tripled the sauce recipe. In any event, I got a lot of compliments on this recipe!

I would have to agree with being too vinagary.  We added some brown sugar and some garlic salt, and it turned out great.

Wow!  Always a hit. I doubled the sauce (I'm a saucey girl) and everyone gave rave reviews. I've made these several times, for different groups, and always run out.

I did not care for these meatballs at all!  Neither did the guests at my party -- no one went back for seconds and some had trouble eating the few on their plates.  I was totally embarrassed that I had made them!!  The only reason I am giving them two stars is they were very good plain, without the sauce.  The sauce had too much of a vinegar bite which stayed with me most of the evening -- I kept eating other food to try to get rid of it.  It goes without saying that I will not make these again.

This was excellent.  I am always on the lookout for fast and easy recipes that my family will actually eat, and this is going to the top of the list.  I put them in the slow-cooker, added some egg noodles just before serving, and man!  Was it a big hit!  FANTASTIC!!

This was okay. I couldn't taste the cola (although I added more than the recipe called for) - maybe I added too much black pepper, since it seemed to have a decent amount of heat to it and wasn't very sweet. No green pepper, about 1.75 cups of cola, and about 1/2 the vinegar as per the other reviews. Assembled the sauce and cooked it down for a good hour at a fast simmer, broiled the meatballs and added them to the sauce, simmering for about 30 minutes. Served over rice.

Used store bought meatballs.  They smelled great and tasted good.  The sauce was lighter than the traditional BBQ sauce we are used too - people were split 50/50 on which they liked better.  I will make these again.

This is really very good (and intriguing since it contains Pepsi). I have to reserve 5 star ratings for the really spectacular meals or else I would rate too many things 5 star. This is 4.5, so thanks a lot. I would comment that as a main dish, this recipe serves only about 8, not 18 (a typo I wonder? Or maybe 18 appetizer servings). Also, I don't have a slow-cooker, but it worked well in a normal pot simmering on low for about 40 minutes.

These were tasty but VERY sweet and the taste seems to stay with you for a long time. If I make these again I will use less vinegar too as they were tangier than I like.

These are great the first time around and even better the second!  I use any that are left (if any are left) to make sandwiches the next day.  I just warm them up in spegetti sauce and put them on bread and it is the best meatball sub!

I made this for a Girl scout meeting and despite the fact someone else had brought meatballs mine went very quickly.  I must admit I took the shortcut that many did and used the already prepared frozen meatballs but this gave a different flavor to the MB.  I do agree that it's not good over pasta but for an appetizer or buffet you go chef!!!

this was good, however I'm only giving it 3 stars because it would be a great appetizer, but I made to have as dinner, and the sauce was just too strong to eat for dinner. but I would make it again for an appetizer.

First, if the meat balls are to be covered in the sauce, you need to make twice the amount the recipe calls for. The only thing I did differently was to make twice the amount of sauce and I used about half a cup of BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup because I ran out of the ketchup. I don't know if it was the BBQ sauce or what but these didn't do it for me... If it was the BBQ sauce, I don't recomend subbing for the ketchup...

I thought this was a great recipe.  Its a kid friendly meal that you can serve as an appetizer or as a main course.  I made it with white butter rice and peas.  I like the tang and my kids love the sweet.  Will make again for sure.

It turned out to be pretty darn good meatballs! I took a short-cut by using precooked meatballs, but the sauce was great just using minimum ingredients. More kid-friendly taste than for grown-ups, I guess.

This was a great recipe.  I tweaked it a bit - I put 2tbsp of brown sugar in it and added about 1tbsp of chile powder.  Everyone loved it.  It definitely tasted better when I let it sit for about 15 minutes without heat and the sauce thickened up.  I received rave reviews from everyone!

these meat balls are very nice   but i don't care for the sweetness in the sauce   so if you can substitute a nice sauce that would be yummy.

The taste turned out pretty great considering I'm an "easy" cooker.  The only thing I would change the next time would be to exclude the bell peppers (am not a big fan).  But the party liked this recipe!!

This recipe was a great hit at a party. I thought I made more than enough meat balls (100) however I ran out very fast. Gave the recipe to most of the guests.

This is a great addition to my meatball recipes. I love baked meatballs, and find this recipe a way to sauce them up so they go good with rice or mashed potatoes, as a meal.

Sorry, but I did not think this recipe was anything special...no distinct flavor, nothing great. Neither my husband nor I cared for it. I make Meatballs in a Wine Sauce that is much better than this. Just kind of blah.

Made this recipe for Super Bowl Sunday.  The meatballs were the best ever.  Just finished them off today in a meatball sandwich.  Try them, you're definitely going to like them.

I followed this recipe exactly (very easy to make), and it turned out great.  It simmered on low for approx. 5 hours before I tasted it, and they were hot and yummy.  They were a hit at the Super Bowl party, and I will definitely use this recipe again.

These were excellent. I baked them in a 250 oven for about 3 hours as I don't have a slow cooker. Would make extra sauce next time.

My husband liked these although I wasn't all that impressed.  (I like the Cajun Appetizer meatballs from this website  much, much better!)  I increased the sauce by half and, as others mentioned, the sauce did have a slight vinegar taste.

BBQ Cola Meatballs does not pretend to be haute cuisine...but I gave it 5 stars because it perfectly fits the bill for a good, everyday crowd pleaser. I doubled the sauce recipe and used a frozen pack of 36 meatballs - so I guess my rating is only good for the sauce. In any case, this is good stuff!

Excellent. I made double the sauce which I think was a good idea. I also made entree sized meatballs. We put them on sub rolls & enjoyed them. The meatballs are also very good by themselves. A keeper.
