I would have rated this 5 stars but the crust could have been better. My spirals were a little too dense. I prefer something lighter. Just my own preference.
The filling was excellent. I did add a small amount of thyme to it and had some leftover brown chicken gravy that I mixed with the chicken stock,flour etc.
Overall, it is worth giving it a try.
Good comfort food!

I would have also rated this 5 stars, but for the crust.  The filling is delicious!!  I just used a tea biscuit recipe for the crust the second time I made it and it turned out amazing!  Great for leftover turkey.

It took some time to make, but was worth it.
