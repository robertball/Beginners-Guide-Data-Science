I didn't find it too sweet with just the two tablespoons of honey. I did add more chopped green onion. I made this last night and let the pork chops sit overnight in the marinade. We all enjoyed this, there were no leftovers. If I were to make this again, I'd add just a little more honey and garlic.

I made about 100 chicken kabobs using this marinade for my brother's birthday and his guests LOVED them, there were none left...

I used 1 heaping tablespoon brown sugar instead of honey.  It tasted very good, not too sweet as was mentioned in a previous review.  I will surely use this recipe for pork tenderloin.

I tried marinating deer steak in this.  I made it with no sweetener and additional 1/3 c oil. It made the best stir fry ever. I chopped my entire three inch piece of ginger and 4 cloves of garlic...wasn't too spicy. Excellent!

Just delicious! I marinated 2 lbs of jumbo shrimp for about 2 hours and grilled on skewers. Love the sesame flavor and the fresh garlic and fresh ginger...I did omit the sesame seeds since I had none on hand. Will make again and try using other meats to marinate. Thanks!

It is the only way we marinade steak now. Of course we made a few changes to make it our own!

Great recipe for grilling.  Marinated chicken breasts for several hours.  Very tasty. I'll definitely use this marinade several times this summer.  I think next time I will try with salmon.

I used this recipe on chicken breasts.  It was pretty good.  I think it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  If I make it again I will add some chili powder to give it a kick and even out the sweetness.  The kids loved it though.

We did steaks and grilled veggies with this marinade.  No time to let it sit so I just doused everything on the grill.  The husband said it's a keeper!

Very tasty!  I chose green onions over shallots for both flavor and color.  I marinated chicken breasts for a day and then grilled.  Everyone loved it - even the kids.  Thanks for the recipe!

I like more of an "umami" flavor so I add 2 T of fish sauce and reduce the honey. If you have never tried it, you will be amazed at how addictive it makes the final dish, much more complex and delicious especially for boring chicken.  I have made this several times, and usually tinker with the ratio of onion, garlic and ginger. I've also found I can use chopped or mashed-ginger that comes in a jar, it tastes fine and if I'm in a hurry it's so much easier than grating fresh ginger or if you don't have any on hand. I usually omit the sesame seeds but it's good either way. I've also tried a spicier version, throwing in some red pepper flakes or chiles.

this turned out pretty tasty.. i used this on 3 thighs and 2 drumsticks and marinated for 8 hours.. to my surprise i only had 1 T of sesame oil left and no rice vinegar so i used what i had on hand.. the 1 T and subbed white wine vinegar.. i followed homschlrmom's modifications of using a 3 inch piece of ginger and 4 cloves of garlic.. i left out the honey and sesame seeds and totally forgot the pepper (doh!).. we cooked this on the grill (basting all the way through) and totally enjoyed the final product.. ty for the recipe

Love this marinate for GRILLED TOFU!  First found it when I was trying to find something to feed a guest who was vegetarian during summer lake vacation.  Everyone loved it, even the meat eaters who said they hated tofu.  It was devoured & we had to make it the next night.  This is now a regular dish we serve from the grill.  AWESOME

Awesome marinade recipe!  I used it to marinade cod for about 1 hour before baking in the oven. The fish was moist and very flavorful.

12/3/15  I just used this recipe as a marinade for tofu prior to stir-frying and used a little of it to stir-fry in rather than using a lot of oil.  Worked great!

This was GREAT on pork tenderloin!  I left out the green onion (didn't have any) and sesame seeds (thought they would burn on the grill) and used Sriracha instead of ground pepper.

I made this recipe. Marinated pork chops for 2 hours but I did a dry rub prior to grilling to kick it up a notch prior to the grill. I did brown sugar, 5 spice, ginger, garlic and sesame seeds. It brought out the flavor! So good

I made it with more ginger because we like that zip in our flavours and loved it.  Marinade for veggies on kabobs.  We will be using this again.

I put in less honey but it was divine.  Unfortunately, I cooked it at too high a temperature so the sauce in the bottom of the roasting pan burned a bit.  I'll try a rack and water in the bottom next time.

Marinated some chicken and baked it, then chopped up the chicken to put on some salads, with Ginger Asian dressing (also from this site).  I love the flavors, and I did not have to marinade for long (only 7 hours).  Great recipe!

Wonderful marinade! I marinated boneless pork chops for about an hour and they turned out fantastic. I pan seared them, then finished cooking them in the oven. Would definitely use this recipe again.

I made this per the recipe this afternoon and used it to marinade Mai Mai. The fillets marinated approximately 3 hours.It was Ok but not exactly what I was looking for. I used another sesame ginger marinade that was better but unfortunately i didn't book mark it and can't find it now.

This was very good.  I skipped the ginger since I didn't have fresh.  Had more than 1T of green onion, but it was still very good.

I used this as a marinade for tofu. I thought it was a bit strong in the vinegar and ginger. Overall, it was ok and the tofu stirfry I made with it was good.
