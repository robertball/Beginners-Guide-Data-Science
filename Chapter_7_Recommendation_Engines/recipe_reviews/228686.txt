Thought this was a refreshing way to eat sweet potato (this is on page 4 of search results for 'sweet potato', with the other 4 pages being sweet potato casserole recipes). It took a while longer to cook. Eased up on the brown sugar as I don't love candied sweet potatoes.  Great side dish to dinner with a super healthy veggie!

Good starting point, but it tasted a little bland to me.  More Cajun seasoning is needed.  I used 1 tsp. Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, but added a few shakes of garlic powder, cayenne pepper and black pepper.  I baked it on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 375 degrees using the convection oven setting.

I've made a very similar version for years, omitting the brown sugar, and simply cutting the sweet potatoes in half, rubbing with a little oil and sprinkling on the Cajun seasoning.  It's a more diabetic friendly version and absolutely delicious.  I'm sure the brown sugar in this recipe would work well also.

Loved this recipe.  Very easy to make.  It wasn't really spicy, so you want spicy you have to add more of the Creole Spice or Cayenne Pepper.
It was perfect complement to the Chicken Marsala and steamed rice I made.

When I made these, my husband asked, “can you please make these 1000 more times?” Which means it’s a success in my book. Based on other reviews, I halved the brown sugar and went heavy on the Cajun seasoning and it was perfect

These were delicious and a great change from sweet sweet potatoes.  Next time I would double the Cajun seasoning.  I ended up adding more seasoning when the potatoes were almost done, as they tasted a little bland (not bad, just not as flavorful as I wanted).

This recipe sounded wonderful but I didn't have  Cajun seasoning or much time.  So I microwaved my cubed sweet potatoes for 5 min, threw them in a baking pan, added 2 tbsp of browns sugar,  1 tbsp of Chipotle pepper,  garlic salt and olive oil.  Then I just mixed it and added about 3 tbsp of water to the pan and roasted uncovered for about 35 min.  My  whole family loved the sweet and smokey (Not too hot) taste... Next time I will try a mild Cajun version... Thank you.

These were ok, but I have several other recipes that are similar but better we think.

This was a great side. Love the cayenne kick. Might have overcooked slightly, but I guess it all depends on the size of your cubes.

My husband loved this (so did I!).  Normally I make sweet potatoes very sweet - with maple syrup, brown sugar, etc.  This was a very nice change from that.  I was trying it out to see if we should do this for Thanksgiving this year and he said "YES"!  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe.  Like the others, I omitted the brown sugar altogether and it was amazing.  I put the potatoes on a low broil setting in the last 2 minutes to crisp them up.  They were a HUGE hit!!!

I didn't have any cajun seasoning on hand so substituted it for a smokey mesquite seasoning I had.  Still turned out amazing. Will make again!
