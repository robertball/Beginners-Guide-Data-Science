This was a nice marinade.  The basting, while adding an extra step, really did impart more flavor, so I'm glad I didn't skip it.  THANKS for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe for yellowfin tuna and this one had great reviews. But when I looked at the ingredient list, based on my past experience, this type of flavour on fish wasn't my cup of tea. I couldn't find anything else and my family thought it sounded good so I made it. The only thing I did differently was to use olive oil since I didn't have vegetable oil. And it only sat in the marinade for about 10 minutes because that's all the time I had. I was completely blown away. This TOTALLY works on tuna. In fact it was perfection. Can't wait to make this again. Definitely a keeper!

I tasted and loved this recipe, as is, and our tuna steaks were excellent.  I added for personal taste, brown sugar and the juice of one orange.  Saved half the marinade for a dipping sauce once I broiled the steaks.  Also, only used 1/3 of cup of oil.  I usually cut oils down just to cut calories.

The recipe was absolutely wonderful. I followed the ingredients exactly. I forgot to prick the steaks with the fork but it didn't seem to affect the juiciness of the fish. I marinaded it for a little over three hours which didn't seem like it was a problem.  I did not grill the fish. i only had 2 6-ounce steaks and hated lighting up the entire grill just for that. I oiled a cast iron skillet and heated it to medium and then still followed the grilling recipe.

Wonderful marinade!!  Definitely a keeper and I will now use this again and again.  I did not have dijon mustard so I used regular mustard with some horseradish. I added some ginger as well. It was a big hit in this house.

I mostly followed the recipe using minor substitutes since I didn't have the exact ingredients (different oil, mustard, etc). We both thought it was really good. Will use again in the future.

I made this last night. Our friend went fishing and caught some yellowfin tuna. He gave some of it to my husband. I had no idea what to do with it, so I tried this recipe. As others mentioned, I basted the fish while it was on the grill. He LOVED it ! When my husband tries something new, he usually says "it's ok ". I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't try it. This time he RAVED! He even had me print the recipe so he could give a copy to his fisherman friend. I am going to try this marinade with sushi grade Ahi & give it a quick sear.

Three minutes per side was perfect. Crispy outside, pink inside. Marinade was also good on rice.

The marinade tasted delicious. I did not have time to make lemon rind so I omitted it. I also halved the oil and used olive oil instead of regular veg. oil. Otherwise, all the ingredients were the same. I fried then placed a lid to steam a bit the fish as I didn't have a grill. I will make it again. I wonder what it would be like with other fish.

Following others' suggestions, I reduced the lemon juice from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup; spouse doesn't like strong lemon flavors, and this adjustment was perfect. Also cooked only 3 minutes per side, which left them perfectly light pink in the middle. I did not baste with the boiled marinade (flare ups from the oil???), but did ladle some of the boiled marinade over the finished steaks which was perfect. Will definitely do again.

I had 2 small tuna steaks.  I halved this recipe, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  This marinade was great for the heavier flavor of tuna.  I made this on Christmas Eve, so no grilling outside for me in the cold.  Instead, I used my cast iron grille on the stove.  I may have over cooked the tuna, slightly, but even so, I give it 5 stars.

Like  previously mentioned way to much lemon,  and 5 to 6 minutes cooking on each side is way to much.  I would suggest cooking to medium rare, otherwise the tuna becomes tough.

The marinade is fantastic, marinaded for 3 1/2 hours!  we cooked 1 1/4 inch steaks for 2 minutes per side.  It was the best grilled tuna that we have ever had!

This is quick, easy and really delicious!  I wouldn't marinate it more than 30 minutes though as the lemon will cook the tuna.  I used less oil and more garlic.

This turned out amazing. The only thing I added was fresh minced ginger to the marinade. Grilled fresh off the boat tuna and served to our friends and it was a hit! So good!

Cut the oil by 1/2 otherwise followed the recipe. We never had Yellowfin Tuna before, but this will be another of our go to recipes. Thank you.

Wow. I happened upon several pounds of barracuda, which I decided to serve to a large party of guests. I had no idea how to cook it! I hesitated to make this recipe because there weren't very many reviews yet, but I'm so glad I decided to give it a try... It was remarkable! I made only a couple minor adjustments (other than the type of fish), which were to use 1 tsp. of ginger-garlic paste instead of the 1 garlic clove, and I have no grill so I blackened the fish in a cast iron skillet instead. The end result was glorious and my guests raved. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

This is now our go-to recipe for tuna. Love it. Over time, I have made a few modifications: 
Oil - For flavor accent, we use a mixture of half vegetable oil, half sesame oil
Soy sauce - To reduce saltiness, we use low-salt soy sauce.
Lemon - We use lemon juice, but leave out lemon peel and lemon wedges
Marinade - We don’t cook the marinade that was used on the raw fish. We make extra marinade. We marinate the fish, then use some of the fresh marinade for basting and on the table as an extra sauce. If you cook the fish rare, you don’t really need sauce on the table.

A neighbor gave us some fresh caught yellow fin tuna upon return from a fishing trip.  I tried this recipe and it was simple, quick and very tasty.

I just pulled some of the same fish which I had to freeze, and I’m currently marinated more fish using this same recipe.  Although I didn’t have any fresh lemon, so substituted some high quality citrus olive oil (from a local source) for the vegetable oil and fresh lemon juice.

It was very tasty, however, i had to ignore the cooking times.  Way too long, unless you like it very well done and dry.

Make sure that the sides of the tuna are still red when you take it off the heat to let it rest. It will continue to cook a bit more. You really want it to be red in the center to have tender tuna.

I would have cooked the tuna steaks for about 4 minutes on each side instead of 5-6 minutes,  I like my tuna rarer than this recipe calls for, but it was delicious!

The lemon was present but not overpowering. Balanced out nicely with the salt in the soy sauce. Marinaded the steaks for about 1 1/2hr. I didn't want the marinade to take over the taste of the tuna. I saved the marninade and boiked it in a sauce pan just like the recipe called for and brushed it on the steaks while grilling. Grilled the tuna steaks over hot coals turning once at 4 minutes and cooking another 4. PERFECT! The wife loved this recipe and we'll def do this again, probably with guests.

We had a bunch of yellow fin tuna steaks left over from a fishing trip and we wanted to try a new twist on them so I tried out this recipe and it was delicious. Followed the instructions and didn’t change a thing except the fact that I only marinated the steaks for an hour. Next time I will make a little extra sauce for dipping! Great recipe.

Would have put a little less soy sauce and more lemon juice. Came out a little saltier than I had hoped. I broiled It for 5 minutes, which is was medium rare. Would have only done broiled for 4 minutes though since I like It more rare

awesomely delicious! Made it once will definitely make it again. I did not have any lemons so did not add the lemon rind, next time will have lemons on hand. Cooking the marinade and using it for basting and dipping sauce provided extra zip to the tuna.

Made this tonight after reading a few reviews. I added horseradish to taste and cooked in a iron skillet. It was really good and my husband liked it so it's a keeper.
