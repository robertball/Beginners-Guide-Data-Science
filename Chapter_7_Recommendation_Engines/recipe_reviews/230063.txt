I made this recipe using leftover chicken and gravy. I was a little skeptical when I started mixing the shredded meat in with the cheese, and almost abandoned the effort midway through. I'm glad I didn't; it was quite different, but in a good way.

This was down right delicious and an excellent way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers. After it is all combined and pulsed you end up with a mousse texture filling for the shells. We both enjoyed this and it is one I will make every time I have leftover turkey. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a way to use up the Thanksgiving leftovers so I tried this one. It was really delicious! I didn't have sherry in the house so I omitted it. My husband went back for seconds and is taking them in his lunch tomorrow!  This one is a hit!

Really good, really! Like the other reviewer, I almost abandoned ship during prep and I did have a back up plan but thankfully we did neither. This was a nice change from the norm and a unique way to use our leftovers. Delish!
