This was very tasty and filling, I didn't have arrow root so I just used fine white flour.  I needed to put the burner to halfway between medium high and low, about 3.5 on my burner knob.  The reason why was because they burn very easily, so just cook at a lower temp for longer, as they are very healthy and quite tasty and worth a little extra time!
