Omit the ketchup and substitute tomato sauce for ketchup (do this with everything involving ketchup to avoid 'high fructose' corn syrup) and you have a winner!

This recipe is delicious as written. If you are worried about too much sugar, simply omit the brown sugar. Changing the ketchup to tomato sauce totally alters the taste.

I'm from NE PA so I really though this was real barbecue growing up.  This is just like my mother's recipe and a staple at all of our family gatherings.  So easy with great results AND you basically always have these ingredients on hand.  As some other reviewers added, green peppers are a good addition if you have on hand but not a necessity.

I have been making this recipe for years (except that I also add 1.5 T of worchestershire sauce) and it is a family favorite.

Fantastic!  Came across this recipe when I was bored with making hamburgers and spaghetti sauce.  It's a sloppy-joe like meal, but with a totally different taste.  Very sweet/sour, will definitely make again!

Well, this was a surprise. Except for the vinegar, the sauce of this "barbecue" is the same mixture my mother always used atop her meatloaves. Just that little touch of vinegar turned the corner from meatloaf topping to barbecue! Will make again.

Terrific barbecue sandwiches! This isn't the typical barbecue beef we are used to as it isn't tomatoey, smoky, or peppery, but it is great. I let this simmer about an hour and only used 1/2 an onion and added 1/2 tsp onion powder to make up the difference. I had to use cider vinegar instead of white. So much better than manwich as my husband said. He even ate two!

This meal is what we in the south call a "Sloppy Joe".  I have tried several recipes that my 3 year old and myself liked but my husband wasn't crazy about.  BUT, this one was a hit for all of us!  It is by far my favorite and my husband actually likes it!  The only change I made (bc my hubby doesn't like pieces of onions) is I use onion powder instead of onions.  YUMMY!  5 stars!

I made this a few months back (weird, my review seems to have vanished) for my boys (as in husband and two kids) as they like any kind of meat dish you slap into a bun. I did add a mess of fresh minced garlic but I made no other changes. My husband thought it could use a little more "umph" but the two boys liked it okay. This is pretty much a simple sloppy joe. If I made this again, I'd play around with the recipe a bit.

I was skeptical about this one because my kids HATE Manwich type stuff. However, they ate this up and loved it.

For my family this is just fine as written. There is no need to change a thing.  This is much like a Sloppy Joe, but not as sloppy.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll use this often.

This recipe came to my attention through the All Recipes email newsletter.  Perfect timing!  I had a pound of hamburger in the fridge, trying to decide what to do with it and low and behold, there was this recipe.  Being from Pennsylvania myself, the title naturally caught my attention.  All of the ingredients were standards in the pantry and the recipe itself is simple.  The taste though is anything but simple.  This is Absolutely Delicious!  I wouldn't change a thing on the recipe!  This is just the perfect mixture of sweet and sour flavors.  It comes together quickly and everyone in the family just loved it!  I really recommend this for the busy Mom or Dad or anyone.   THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!

If you omit the ketchup and substitute tomato sauce then you are not making barbeque.  I have used homemade ketchup but thats what makes it.  Its a Pa Dutch recipe often made in large batches for gatherings. Also must use apple cider vinegar to be genuine.

Used ground turkey instead of beef, added a few dashes of worcestershire & a tsp of minced garlic.  Really tasty, I prefer it over the manwich in a can. Update: I used Dijon & it was even better. Also, I think the brown sugar is essential & doesn't make it too sweet.

I have to say, this surprised me.  I had a pound of ground beef thawed for chili and no one felt like it, so I made these instead.  The only thing I added was a dash of worstishire.  My Manwich loving hubby thought they were great and my non-Mamwich loving 5 yr old son thought they were great also.

This was good for a quick sloppy-joe type meal.  I would have added some extra veggies such as celery, carrot, etc., diced quite small.  Would have made 1 lb of hamburger stretch further and I think given it a bit more flavor.  I did follow the recipe exactly.

This is the exact recipe my mom made for us when we were growing up & I've made for my own family since the 1970's.  And when I remember, I'll add a dash or two of worcestershire sauce.  We love it!  Goes great with potato salad and corn on the cob!

I've lived in coal-cracker country in PA all my life and this is a great, what we call here, Sloppy Joe. A little further up in northern PA they call it a wimpie.  Whatever you call it, it's great!

I will never buy pre-made sloppy joe mix again.  Recipe can be tweaked easily per your preference but going by recipe as stated it is very good.   This is a regular in our house and I make large batches of it when ground beef goes on sale and freeze in 1lb portions.

Made thisrecipe many years...from the coal regions. I found some years ago that adding a Bell pepper with the onion makes it just a little tastier, but that is only if you like Bell peppers.

All six people in my family gave this rave reviews. Their only complaint was I didn't make enough.

Loved it because it was so quick and easy to make. Brought back memories of my grandmother cooking when I was little. I always have wondered why sloppy jo's have never quite hit the spot for me. Now I realize that this is what I was always craving. I followed the recipe exactly.

These were pretty good, even though I do not generally like sloppy joes. Not BBQ though, not anything like BBQ.

We loved these, they tasted so good! With the vinegar and brown sugar it had a slight sweet/sour taste, which was delicious. Very easy and quick to prepare, and made with ingredients that I usually have around the house, and that makes it cheap too. Even better! Would be great to make on a busy weeknight because it's so quick. The only thing to point out is that it makes less than 8 servings. For us it makes about 6, and we're not big eaters either. Thanks for posting this recipe, Mollyspitcher.

I prepared this according to the directions; only change, was to add 1/4 teapoon cayenne pepper to mixture (we like things spicy). will definitely make this again.

Just like my mom used to make growing up..only a little sweeter, which my family loved.  Next time will add a little more kick.

Good stuff. This is the same recipe my mom always made. I am from PA. LOL. I think she used to put a dash of Worcestershire sauce in it though also. I never used to be crazy about it when I was a child, but I do get cravings for it sometimes now that I'm older. Sometimes I throw pepper pieces into the meat along w the onion and that's really good too, or chopped tomato pieces. If you're having company and want to make a lot, you can put it in the slow cooker after you brown and drain the beef. You can keep it on low for hours. And, it stays moist as long as your guests don't leave the lid off of the slow cooker! I have added honey instead of sugar before also, and that was good as well.

We love this very much; this past week we made it for the 2nd time (usually I review right away but I forgot). The flavor is perfect and unique, and it's so quick & easy.

Sadly this was disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, but it was far too sweet, even with only 2 tsp of brown sugar and overwhelmingly ketchup flavoured.

I'll admit, I like Manwich.  It's a lazy-night-staple in our house.  This is so much better, and really just as easy.  I like the sweet/sour taste.  I used a whole large onion, as we love onion, but followed the recipe otherwise and everyone ate it up and went back for seconds.  I won't be buying sloppy-joe mix anymore, as I always have these ingredients in the house, and all this requires is chopping an onion.  Thanks for a great twist on a boring-old favorite.

I made this to the recipe. The mustard came through a little strong for me. The end product was also very dry. I much prefer the Sloppy Joes II recipe by Tamara. They are very similar so I don't know why this one was so dry. Thanks anyway.

I wish I could give 4.5 stars, because it's not quite a 5 for me but not quite as low as a 4. It came out a little too sweet for my taste, so I added extra vinegar and mustard. I also doctored it up with about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and a dash of ancho chile powder and plenty of salt and pepper. Next time, I'll reduce the sugar to just one tablespoon, increase the vinegar to 2 tablespoons and the mustard to 2 teaspoons. But this was a great, EASY, and cheap recipe for a homecooked meal where you don't want to shop for fancy ingredients.

Visiting my Gram's farm in NW Iowa was always a treat because this is what she made, only we called it Taverns, and it was my favorite.  I've been married 25 years and this is something I often made for my family as well.  I sometimes alter the recipe depending on my mood.  If I want a kick, I add horseradish, if I want it sweeter I add more ketchup and brown sugar (and please don't exchange the ketchup for tomato sauce or you'll just ruin the effect).  This is really good, quick, fast and uses ingredients you already have.  So what are you waiting for?

I made this in less than twenty minutes and the family loved it.  For a very simple dish it was satisfying and tasty.  As others have suggested, I cut the amount of onions, which was definitely the right thing to do.

This gets five stars not only for ease but also for taste. The mustard is the secret - my family doesn't like mustard, but never realized it was in there and loved the kick it added. To make this healthier I used ground chicken instead of beef and subbed half the ketchup with tomato paste.

We liked these! Ok....I did use extra lean ground chicken instead of beef....but they were delicious! I also added a diced green pepper and a diced vidalia onion.  Served on whole wheat sandwich thins (Arnold brand). Served with cucumber salad and corn on the cob from the farm . Easy, quick and tasty. Thanks!

I am not a fan of barbecue. I know it's unamerican and I am sorry. :) Anyway my husband and kids liked them but said it was a little heavy on the ketchup flavor. I added an extra Tbsp of vinegar and brown sugar and he said it was better. Nice recipe just adjusted to favor hubby likes.

Pretty good. Will make again. Did add Worcestershire sauce. Hubby was expecting it to taste like sloppy joes and I never let on that it wasn't. He was surprised when he took his first bite. Said we need to keep this one around.

Very good, simple and tasty. My sons both loved it with rippled chips and salad. I used all organic products in the recipe and really enjoyed how frugal a meal it really could be!

Just like my grandma makes, we do sometimes sub the ketchup with salsa if none is in the house or not enough.

Super Easy, Super Hit with two little Super Kids..... If it's Kid Approved it's 5 Star!  Hit with us adults too. Followed exactly and thought it much better than manwich and the envelope sloppy joe mixes.

My husband says it is better than Manwhich (and he is a huge fan of that).  I used tomato sauce as recommended by another reviewer.  Also I made about 1/4 extra of the sauce and cooked it a bit longer to let the flavors really set (in the 1/4 sauce batch I used a bit less sugar).  Yum.

This is a great Sloppy Joe recipe. Put it on a fresh, soft hamburger bun, with a thin slice of Vidalia onion, and you've got a fantastic sandwich.

Ran out of ketchup, tried tomato paste. No go. Totally changes the end result. I'm originally from the coal country area of Pennsylvania(near Pine Grove) and once I did the recipe with the ketchup, then it brought back memories of my childhood.

So easy and good!  I used ground turkey and a little molasses and 1 1/2 T. Worcestershire sauce.  Also, there wasn't enough sauce to simmer for 15 minutes--I just added a little water and heated the mixture through.  I would say it serves 4, not 8...  Yum.

This recipe is AWESOME.  The only change I made was to add a chopped green bell pepper, because my husband loves them.  If I could give this more then 5 stars, I would.  After eating it as a sandwich, I decided to try putting it over cooked noodles,   Yummy,  I am not sure which way I like it better.

Very good recipe.  I followed recipe exactly except that I used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and I added onion powder since I didn't have enough onion on-hand.  Much much better than the canned stuff!!

Made this last night for picky son.  Used chopped red onion because that's all I had.  Tasted the sauce as I made it - added about 2 tsp of worchestershire sauce, some onion powder, some garlic powder, and about 2 tsp of spicy brown mustard in place of regular yellow mustard to cut the taste of ketchup.  I thought it was much better than the canned sloppy joe stuff and my son ate two, so he must have agreed with me.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great weeknight dinner.  I used 1/2 regular ketchup and 1/2 hot and spicy ketchup because that is what I had on hand.  Delicious, easy supper.  Served with pickles, fresh corn.  Chips would have been nice, but didn't want the calories, so I made a salad.

This is how we have always made our hot dog chili for our hot dog cook-outs in South Carolina. We have some family members that eat it in the bun with out the dog, easy to eat in a hot dog bun, does not fall out every where.

Amazingly easy and tasty!  Kids usually balk at sloppy joes, but they gobbled this all up!  This is a keeper!

Awesome! We loved it. I substituted cider vinegar for white and onion powder for chopped onion.

this was soooo good. salt and pepper are a must also added garlic powder, all season salt, a little more brown sugar and a small amount of velveeta cheese. let it simmer so that it was well mixed. my kids loved it and so did i and a few of us don't like sloppy joe so this a great alternative.

Our family and guests love this recipe.  I did add extra vinegar to make it more sour and onion powder to make it just right for our palates.  It does freeze well also.

WOW!!! This dish really had my taste buds going wild with the flavors of SWEET AND TANGY at the same time. At first, I wasn't sure if I liked it because of the strong tangy flavor then all of a sudden you tasted the sweet.   A very nice fun balance of flavors {****}, compliment it with a COLD BEER and it rates {*****} Great job  Mollypitcher, and thank you for the COAL-PACKER Barbecue recipe.

This was wonderful...I grew up with Man-Wich...and my husband grew up with just ketchup and meat....This was a perfect blend of both...I have been sauteing onions, bell pepper & fresh garlic in a tbs of sesame oil. Then putting that aside and brown the the beef, after draining of the fat....you mix back in the onions and bell pepper mix. It retains the juice so they dont get drained off with the fat....

Really quite tasty.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, half a white onion (finely chopped) and 1 T each of mustard, vinegar and brown sugar.  I just used whatever ketchup was left in the bottle.  My picky daughters (8 & 10) both ate it, and my 10 year old (who melted a little American cheese on hers) really liked it (which is amazing considering she doesn't like meatloaf, onions, mustard, ketchup, vinegar or anything else with flavor).  Will definitely be making this again.

The two 11 year olds and 17 year old in the house loved this.  I have been trying different "sloppy joe style" recipes lately and this was one of the favourites so far. I might add a dash of liquid Hickory Smoke flavour next time.  I'd add this to the list of easy dinners for kids who are learning to cook.

it was pretty good, but not a huge hit. I added garlic salt and curry powder. I also added frozen corn to the mixture which added a nice crunch. I served on whole wheat buns with shredded colby jack cheese. The brown sugar added a nice sweetness to it, but I think next time I will cut back to 1/2-1 tablespoon.

I made this mid-morning and left it for my husband's lunch since I would be out all day.  He ate it all before I came home!  It must have been good (smile).  I did add a couple tablespoons of barbecue sauce and a dash of Worcestershire because it seemed a little flat.  Also, used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow, as mentioned by other reviewers.  I used 96% lean ground beef so it was fairly healthy from a fat content perspective.  This was so quick and easy--will be a go-to recipe for those days when I just need something fast and simple.

This is authentic Pennsylvania Coal Region BBQ, I must agree!  I grew up on a very similar recipe.  For the reviewer who said her husband never heard of it..Pittsburgh is not the coal region.  That would explain why he never heard of it.  It's a local favorite and is always served at our family reunions.  Only difference is that I never heard of it being made with brown sugar..we always use regular granulated sugar.

I really liked this recipe...I tend to prefer a sweeter Sloppy Joe than Manwich, and the vinegar in this gave the sweetness a nice zip.  I was a little put off by the onion-to-beef ratio however; if I make this again I'd use way less chopped onion than it calls for.  Also, the portions are totally off!  I made 1lb. of ground beef's worth and it just fed two of us, I have no idea how it's supposed to be enough for 8!

My go to recipe for barbecue.  My mom would make a recipe from a 4-H cookbook.  I didn't have her recipe so I went searching online for a simple recipe that used ketchup and mustard and no other tomato base.  I'm pretty certain this is a same recipe as  I grew up loving.  I tend not to like a sweet sauce so I cut back greatly on the brown sugar.

This is easily one of the best BBQ (Sloppy Joe) recipes you can make. Double the recipe, and drop it into a crock pot for a picnic or party. Simple, quick, and delicious.

Great easy fast tasty. What more is there to say? I subbed Shallots for onions as it’s all I had and it was great. I cut sugar and ketchup by one third each. Also added a tablespoon of Better Than Bouillon. My kids wanted more!

As someone has already said, the ingredients on the canned sloppy joe mix are pretty awful. This is something you can make and feel good about eating.  I made it as directed. I did use no-sugar added ketchup because of the brown sugar. It was really good.

I don't know what constitutes pa coal region but I grew up in sw Pennsylvania surrounded by coal and this just like what we grew up eating. We added worcesterchire sauce as well and we just called it sloppy joes.   I never understood why most people didn't like sloppy Joe when I left Pa but then I tasted theirs. This recipe is world's above!!

I never liked Sloppy Joes using the canned variety but my husband does so I thought I'd try them by scratch.  I used this recipe and added some Worcestershire and a  splash of liquid smoke which really gave it a bbq flavor.  It was great and I'll make it often.

Loved it. My grandparents are from the northeast PA coal regions, and made one very similar to this...it just had an additional 2T of King syrup, which of course made it a little sweeter. Really enjoyed this one...good amount of sweet/tangy.

This was really good and quick. No more Manwich for me. I probably should have chopped the onions a little finer though. Maybe difficult to keep on a bun.

Great starter dish. I didn't have much, but this recipe utilized basics that I had on hand. I have a huge family and had to triple the recipe. Since I didn't want to use all of my ketchup, I used 1 can tomato sauce in replace of 1/3 of the ketchup. Worked out. I also added bell pepper, fresh tomato, and bacon for flavor. We liked it better than the expensive canned sloppy joe mix. Thank you so much for sharing. It was a lifesaver and will be again.

I'm a former Pittsburgher who made this recipe for my family from Cleveland. Everyone loved it, which makes me very happy. It's always nice to have a good tasting, fast, healthy and inexpensive meal to rely on during busy weeks. We will make this again!

I made this with the hopes that my boys would eat this, being 5 and 8 as well as somewhat picky eaters. They liked it!!!!!  I did add worchestershire  sauce as suggested.  If you taste the sauce before you put it in the ground meat don't change anything until it has been heated up with the meat, it changes the flavor. Being in PA I remember this dish and didn't have a recipe to make it until now. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome basic recipe.  Made as directed first time.  Then tweaked to my own taste.  I double all the sauce ingredients, except brown sugar.  Use only two tablespoons (should be three double).  Add minced garlic when frying hamburger with red peppers and onions.(garlic, red peppers and onions not in original recipe).  Add a few dashes of Worchester sauce.  Off the charts for me and mine.  Great to freeze.

I took the advice of other reviews and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup. I also added ~1/2 tbs crushed red pepper and minced garlic. It was very satisfying.

So easy and absolutely delicious!  Once you buy the ingredients for this, you'll have them on hand to make this at anytime, you'd just have to pick up hamburger buns and a pound of beef.  Tastes great reheated.  I usually make this for lunch for my husband and I and then we have leftovers later if we get hungry again or to eat for dinner.   Goes good with potato chips!

I made this tonight for family of four. They're not very picky eaters but my 13 yo took one bite, said that he didn't like it and refused to eat more. I thought it was ok. I added Worcestershire sauce and a little garlic powder. I loved that I had everything here already and that it was easy to throw this meal together. I don't think I'll be making again though. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious and easy to make. A bit on the sweet side, will use tomato sauce instead of ketchup next time for a healthier version.

Made this recipe with no changes except that I doubled it, and everyone loved it. So easy to make, and so very tasty. My father's family is from the Pennsylvania anthracite coal region, and this recipe does indeed come from there.  My mom used to make something very similar when we were kids, which she called "chuck burgers".  Took some of this over to my parents, and they both loved it.  Great taste mixed with a bit of nostalgia = fantastic!  Thank you MOLLYSPITCHER!

Our go to BBQ recipe!  Everyone loves it, even my picky kids!  We make this several times a month.  I leave out the onions(my kids don't like them), but I'll add a little onion powder.  Other then that we make as is.  We always top it with whatever kind of cheese we have on hand.  Sharp cheddar is my favorite.

I've been making this recipe ever since I can remember. I grew up in PA, of course. Now, when I'm looking for a taste of home, I throw some of this "barbecue" together and serve it up with some pierogies. The whole family loves it!

The whole family loved this! It's a quick and easy sloppy joe recipe without the packets. Will definitely be making this again. I was a little worried about letting it simmer for 15 minutes because there wasn't much liquid left, but I never had any issues. Perfect flavor and not too runny that it soaks into the bun! Great with homemade shells and cheese!

I make this all the time! But I just eyeball the ingredients-- I don't really measure and it always comes out great. I add green peppers to cook with the onion so they are soft as well. Because these sloppy joes are so messy I usually serve them on an open bun. Corn on the cob is a popular side with this!

We enjoyed this for a quick meal--over organic blue chips with some cheese and a little ranch dressing.  Not the usual tomato base BBQ or sloppy joe--definitely easier on the stomach.  Liked the contrast in the flavors.

This really is pretty good! It is a sloppy joe cousin. The key is definately to let it simmer with the ketchup, etc.

If you are expecting something spectacular this recipe isn't for you.  Has a nice flavor, is quick and easy.  I used the instructions to get it started but then put it in the slow cooker for the flavors to meld all day.  Just couldn't get the nice dark color in the photo. Nice reminder that a good meal doesn't need to be complicated.

Great recipe!  I will have to delete any other sloppy joe recipe because this one is the best by far.  The whole family loved it.  My son was happy that there were leftovers because he wanted it again the next day!  Thank you.

Our family thought this was very good.  My husband said it was the best "sloppy joe" I have ever made and my daughter, who hates this type of thing, actually commented that "it's a little good" so that is a good thing.  I followed the recipe exactly and with good results.  It was quite yummy!

I grew up in PA eating a similar barbeque.  I use a bottle of chili sauce in place of the ketchup, add a half of a green pepper and a Tbls of worchestershire sauce.  Easy and good!

I've been making this for years, we call it Beef BBQ. Learned the recipe from my mom she used to make it all the time. I think it blows regular sloppy joes out of the water!  Yes, I'm from PA btw ;-)

This is our family Sloppy Joe recipe- the only way I've ever known Sloppy Joes to be.  And holding true to the name, I'm the proud grand-daughter of 2 PA coal miners. We most often substitute onion powder for the chopped variety but everything else is the same.  Great also between 2 slices of store bought white bread.  Guaranteed crowd pleaser!

Hey Hezzy_tant_cook, do we have the same mom?  I grew up with this and it is a family favorite passed on to my own grown children now.  This is "bbq" in our house.  I no longer live in PA so can't call it bbq any more because people expect something very different if I do.  But it will always be bbq to me.

Yup, this is how hamburger barbaque is done where I grew up in PA. Didn't know you made it another way. I use venison so I add a touch of oil when I brown the meat and extra vinegar cause my family likes it sour. Didn't know there were 'other ways' of doing it until I went to college. Manwich is gross, make your hamburger bbq this way and you'll never go back!

My youngest son and husband gave ratings of 5.  I rated a four but that was just because I thought it was a little sweet but still very good.  Loved the simplicity of this meal.

I live in PA, and while we don't have any coal mining in my area that I know of, the next town over is a steel town, where my mother lived for a while growing up.  She makes a BBQ very similar to this one (though she doesn't add vinegar).  It had very good flavor, and was super quick, easy, and cheap to make for our lunch yesterday.  We both liked it, though I think I might have preferred a touch more vinegar.

I wanted to surprise my husband with a "hometown" dish (he is from Scranton, PA).  I followed the recipe except I used tomato paste instead of ketchup and it turned out excellent.  We will definitely be making this again.

In a family of five, two people rated it a 5 and 3 people rated it a 4.  I increased the mustard to 1 T, and decreased the sugar to 3/4 T. and substituted tomato sauce for the ketchup.  Then, I doubled the recipe - we had very little left over.  It was a hit, and I loved it because it was super easy and quick for a hectic night.

This is a great alternative to purchasing those overpriced sloppy joe packets, especially when most households have most of these ingredients in the house anyway.  I did add more brown sugar, and ketchup. The good thing about this recipe is that you can add more ingredients if needed once you taste it, and customize it. I think I have seen the last time that I purchase the packets, Thanks!!

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit! My husband was apprehensive, as the ingrediants were pretty simple and few, but he LOVED IT! I didnt have buns so we used bread, or just ate it as is. I added 2 tbsp more brown sugar, and I used ketchup as written. I liked it with the ketchup, as it is sweeter and my family LOVES ketchup! Thanks!

This is EXCELLENT!!  Our family loved this.  My 2 year old doesn't like bread but ate 3 huge spoonfuls.  Next time I will double the recipe so I have leftovers.  My husband ate his on a buns, but I ate mine on rice and let me tell you what, that is very, very good.  It doesn't taste like sloppy joes at all.  We really enjoyed this and I will be making it a lot in the future.  The only change was adding 1 TBSP water to it because it seemed to thick.

I'm a sloppy joe fanatic. I have a half-dozen recipes for it, but this one shot to the top and I'm throwing several out. I took a taste as it was cooking, and was worried that it would be too sweet. But after it simmered and the flavors combined, it was fine.

Wow! I will never look at a can of Manwich the same way again. I ate my share of "sloppy joes" as a kid; I always found the sauce to be overpowering, gloppy and too tomato-y. This recipe, however, has just the right amount of moisture and a really nice combination of flavors. I did have to use spicy brown mustard in lieu of yellow, since I was out. Next time I will add hot sauce for more kick--though I don't think you really need to add or omit anything from this simple, fabulous dish. I served this on toasted/lightly buttered English muffins, which is the way I've always eaten my Manwich. My only complaint is that I didn't make enough!

These were very good, especially coming from someone who does not care for regular sloppy joes.  The sweet and sour flavor was delicious and to add a little something, I served mine with a slice of cheese.

UPDATE:  I've made this numerous times and it's always good EXCEPT for the last time I made it. I didn't have white vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar. NOT A GOOD IDEA.  It gave it a really strange, unpleasant taste and smell.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was very good.  My family of five just doesn't like the canned versions of sloppy joes (we've tried them all!) I've also tried some others from this site with no success. This recipe had a very nice taste, not too tangy, not too sweet.  I'll definitely keep this recipe on hand for a quick meal idea that doesn't require a run to the store.

Quick and excellent! Used spicy mustard and served on sesame seed buns with cheddar cheese and onion. They are kinda messy so I wrapped them in wax paper. So yummy!

This is a staple at our house. Instead of onions, I use red bell peppers, and instead of white vinegar, I use cider vinegar. I also substitute spicy brown mustard for regular mustard. Even my picky 7 year old stepson will eat it, which says a lot!

Fabulous! I wanted to find a recipe for Sunday lunch that would use up some of these staples: ground beef, white bread and a half jar of leftover spaghetti sauce. I doubled the recipe which was  quick, easy and tasty. I added 1/2 cup of ketchup to the spaghetti sauce to thicken and extend the sauce. We served lunch with potato chips, sweet pickles and baby carrots.

I grew up in central Pa and always knew this and only this as a sloppy joe.  It wasn't until I moved to Fl that I realized this wasn't so. I fed this to my boyfriend (who claimed he HATED sloppy joes) and my Dad.  My Dad said it tasted like home and my boyfriend has a new found appreciation for sloppy joes.  Awesome recipe!

This was good, but the kids didn't like it as much as I thought they would.  It was an easy and quick fix, though, so supplied us a hearty meal on a busy night.  Thanks!

I thought this was pretty darn good.  I added a little bit of Garlic powder and a dash of Mrs. dash for some extra flavor.  My husband gave it three stars, but he's pretty darn hard to please.  I'll probably make it again and maybe experiment with some other flavor combinations.  It was fast, easy, pretty tasty and darn cheap.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was introduced to this by my in-laws in PA.  This is so easy and delicious too!  My go-to meal when I have a pkg. of ground beef, little time and want something the kids (and we) will love. This was the first thing I ever taught my teenage son to make.  Cooking 101 at it's finest!

We all really loved this recipe, from the 1 year old to the oldest member of the family.  Quick, easy and family friendly.  Another great use for hamburger.  Serve it on sandwich rolls with some macaroni and cheese on the side and the kids were thrilled.  Will definitely make again and again.

Tastes a lot like the BBQ I grew up eating at pool parties and picnics. I only used a 1/2 Tbsp of the vinegar otherwise it is much too much.

This was a very good recipe. My children gobbled it up and thanked me for not putting any gumbo soup into their barbecues. I added a bit of soy sauce to offset the sweet.

Really good, my husband is from the Pittsburgh area and wasn't familiar with this concoction.  Could use some spicing up (maybe more mustard).
