AWESOME! I really LOVE this take on the traditional cobb salad! I made my own falafel using 'Pan-Fried Falafel' from this site, and it was great. I made the falafel pretty small and cut them in 1/2 before putting on the salad so it would be easier to eat. I couldn't fit the feta in a row on the plate (it was too full, lol), so I just sprinkled it over top the falafel. I really, REALLY enjoyed this salad and so did my girls...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this was ingenious and delicious! I don't use the mix,but had some of Sean's Falafel (from this site) uncooked in my freezer. What a great recipe. Thank you, Jenn T.! Please post more of your creations, you kitchen goddess!
