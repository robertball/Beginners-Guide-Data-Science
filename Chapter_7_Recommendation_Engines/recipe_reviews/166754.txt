These are GOOD but SWEET!  If I make them again, which I probably will, I will use COCOA rice krispies for the top instead of regular mixed with the melted chocolate.  Also, it won't look like you have enough crust to spread in the pan, but you will.

This are so good!!!  I usually make something similar to this but the addition of the rice krispies gave it a whole new twist.  I love the soft inside with the crunchy crust and topping!

Oh wow.  I thought these were TO DIE FOR!!!  I didnt think I would get 16 squares out of it, only 9, figuring that we would want to eat bigger pieces...but after I cut out a small piece just to try it at first I realized that it will definately make 16 due to how rich it is, there's no way we could eat bigger pieces than that!  This one is a keeper - YUM!!!

These are so delicious!!  I wasn't sure while I was making it, but they are so good.  Next time I would probably add a bit more of the chocolate and rice krispies on the top.

I made these to take to work as a Valentine's Day treat.  Personally, I thought they were OK - very sweet.  However, my co-workers enjoyed them and a few asked for the recipe.  I made these the night before and stored them the refrigerator.  I would advise letting the dessert come closer to room temperature to make the cutting easier and for the true flavor to come out.  They are not very good right out of the refrigerator.
