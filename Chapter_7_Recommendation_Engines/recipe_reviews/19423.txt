I only give it 3 stars as written because of two things -- 375 for an hour is too hot so your top will BURN (I did 350 for an hour and that was perfect), and it needs at least double the cheese.  With these two alterations you'd have a five star classic mac-n-cheese recipe that will be delicious.

I thought this was great, but I made some changes.  Reduced cooking temp to 350, used 12oz of noodles instead of a pound, used half mild cheddar and half Kraft Deluxe American Cheese (sandwich slices), and increased the amount of evaporated milk.  This was a homerun for all three kids and it reminded me of the way it used to taste when I was growing up.

Finally, a recipe for the mac and cheese I grew up with! I followed other reviewer's advice and doubled the cheese and evaporated milk. I also melted the butter and evenly coated each layer of macaroni. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes uncovered which was a little too long...next time I will either lower the temperature to 350 or shorten the bake time. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I'll be making this again; it was wonderful!

I have tried so many mac and cheese recipes that my family panics when I say I'm trying another one. They have all been failures.

But after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I didn't measure anything and only used what I had on hand. 2% milk (and prolly not enough), american slices, grated colby. I didn't add the dry mustard...just the salt and pepper.  I did make it in 2 pans.  My kids raved, the hubby went back for more. One pan is empty and the other was hit hard.  This is an absolutely incredible, fail-proof recipe. Ooey-gooey, the way gramma made it, macaroni and cheese at it's best.

YUMMY!  Out of all the mac n' cheese recipes my famiy has tested this one wins the prize! I followed the advice of another review and used 12 oz. of elbow noodles, reduced the temp to 350', used 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 Kraft Deluxe American and increased the evaporated milk to about 15-16 ozs. I also covered the top so I wouldn't end up with some "hard" noodles on top.  I think the layering really helped.

Wonderful! This was exactly how I had Mac and Cheese growing up.  I used fresh milk since my evaporated milk had gone bad and it worked out just fine. My father used to use fresh milk too.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This is a good skeleton. I definitely altered things on a got-it-don't-got-it basis. The main reason I like this recipe is because of the execution. Layering hard cheese & then pouring some milk (I actually used 6oz half & half with 6oz buttermilk leftover from a cake) over it was novel to me because my family did the heated up milk-egg-cheese combo poured over the noodles. I might have sneaked an egg into the cream and milk just because it didn't seem right without it. The proportions are way off, though. I'll have to make it again just to get it exactly right because I had to put some of the extra noodles & cheese in a smaller dish. The butter was unnecessary for me. I used sliced cheese and shredded cheese ('cause I had it) the sliced was American while the shredded was provolone, cheddar, Monterey Jack, and mozzarella. I also lowered the oven temp. like reviewers suggested and didn't really bother with a cook time since there seemed debate on the topic. Did maybe 30 minutes initially and just kept adding ten or so depending on how it looked.

This recipe tastes great. The problem I had with this recipe is that it calls for a 2qt dish. Here's a tip - use a 3 quart dish. Cooking in a 2qt dish caused a major spill-over in my oven. I can only give this recipe 3 stars due to the mess it caused in my oven. When I use a larger dish next time it will prob get 4 or 5 stars. Now....when will the person who wrote this recipe be over to my house to clean my oven?

Love this macaroni and cheese! It's like the old-timey macaroni-and-cheese pie, baked to a golden, crusty delicousness. The flavor and texture of the cheese really comes through in thsi simple recipe. (I could see trying this recipe using a ripe Camembert or Brie -- yum.) The evaporated milk gives the dish a nice tang. I use two 12-ounce cans because I like my mac and cheese extra rich. This is real comfort food!

This recipe is a great template, but I made lots of changes other reviewers suggested and it turned out great!  I used 12 oz macaroni, 8 oz lowfat shredded Italian-blend cheese, about 10 oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and about 18 oz fat-free evaporated milk.  Instead of layering the butter, I mixed in about 2 T light butter to the cooked macaroni.  In a medium bowl, I mixed the cheeses together, and added to that a mix of dry mustard, garlic salt, paprika, salt, and white pepper.  I made it in 4 layers, as the recipe calls for.  I baked it in a 3-quart casserole at 350F, covered for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered for the last 35 minutes.  (Next time I will cook it covered for less time to get a better baked crust.  You can see my result in my photo.)  Everyone but my 3-year old loved it; he expected the stuff from the box.  I'll definitely make this again!

How did this get a four star rating?  Someone suggested this to me, as I was not in my own kitchen, and did not have the ingredients to make a roux for my own baked maccaroni and cheese.  So I thought I would give this a go.  I was leery from the beginning, and my concerns were all validated.  First off, because a roux was not made, the cheese and milk did not make a sauce, but simply went grainy and coagulated.  The evaporated milk still had a metallic taste from the tin.  The temperature on the oven was too high, and the macaroni on the top browned and dried to where it was inedible (I had to throw the top away.) this was way underseasoned.  I am reluctant to say a recipe is not salvageable, but this one is not.

We liked this recipe, but were not crazy about it.  I added crushed saltines on top for the last 20 minutes, and that helped, but it just was not creamy enough for my taste.  If I use this recipe again, I will definitely shred the cheese instead of slicing, so that it will cover the whole dish more evenly.(I just made this again over the weekend using a SHREDDED blend of four cheeses, two and a half cups, alternating layers of the macaroni and cheese, then topping it off with the milk and crackers, it turned out SO MUCH BETTER, and much creamier!  I will be making this variation of this recipe often!)

This is the easiest and yummiest mac & cheese ever!  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 american as my famiy prefers the creaminess over the sharpness. I melt the butter over the macaroni so that it is all lightly coated, then salt and pepper.  This is the third time that I have made this and this time I covered with foil so that it wouldn't get crispy.  I have picky kids!  Thanks for this great new recipe!

After trying a different recipe on here that called for all sorts of ingredients, like sour cream and cottage cheese... I decided to try a more "normal" recipe because my family really didn't like the other one.  They said this is how mac and cheese should taste. :) I took a couple suggestions from the ppl on here and used 1/2 kraft cheddar and 1/2 kraft american cheese... and cooked it at 350, covered the dish as well when I baked it.  Turned out great!

My husband doesn't like mac & cheese in general, but he loved this recipe.  I'd been searching for a good home-made recipe for years, and tend to find most either not cheesy enough, or just plain bland.  But we both loved this one!  I altered the recipe slightly, using shredded cheese, adding an extra half pound of cheese and adding an extra can of evaporated milk.  I cooked for 45 minutes on 350.  Any hotter and the top will definitely burn.  Enjoy!

To me, there's two kinds of mac and cheese: the firm, drier kind, and the creamy kind. When I tried this recipe, I got a firm, drier result. That's fine, but I wish I'd read the reviews first - it definitely needs more cheese and a lower baking temperature. Mine is extremely crisp on the top and sides, but the middle is moist and firm. I might try this again, but I'll probably use one can of evaporated milk, then a can of regular milk.. and I'll double the cheese and use half sharp/half medium cheddar. It could also use a bit of onion. It's easy enough that it's worth messing around with.

Great with modifications:   used half mild cheddar and half colby, cut into cubes, replaced evap milk with 8 oz. of sour cream, added two eggs, and sprinkled about two handfuls of shredded colby/monterey jack on top, during the last 10 minutes.  Last, but not least, lowered the temp to 350.

Absolutely Delicious!  The recipe was perfect!  Very easy.  I used a mixture of colby and sharp cheddar..dreamy!
3/2/07
Just prepared this for the second time, using colby, sharp cheddar, and a mild gouda (total weight of cheese, about a pound and a half!!  Not lowfat or heart healthy, but perfect for lent ;)  Try to use the elbows with ridges!   I also increased the evaporated milk to *2* cans, and will cover the casserole for half of the recommended baking time.  Mmmm....my mouth is watering!!

Excellent!  I did alter the recipe a bit according to other reviews, by doubling the cheese and lowering the oven temperature to 350.  Other than that, this was the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted and will make from now on.

Excellent! Just like Mother used to make, except for the oven temp. 350 is a better temp for baking this. I added a little onion, and a tad more cheese. Also added a little more regular milk to keep it moist. Ummmmm, good!

So simple but amazingly delicious. As others have noted the cooking time may need adjusting; I usually just pull it out whenever it is bubbly and golden. We love this!

I made this recipe for a family cookout and my Grandaughters loved it.  It was easy but I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 2 cans of evaporated milk and drizzled melted butter over each layer and used a pound of shredded cheddar instead of sliced.  It was great and the leftovers were wonderul too.

Ok this was my first time making the mac & cheese.  The macaroni is too much, the cheese is too little and the time is too long (I followed the recipe to a T and my mac almost burned).  However it DID have a good flavor and with a few adjustments for next time, this will be an awesome and easy meal to make.

I made this and it is the best ever.  I used less macaroni as there are only 2 of us and I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of slices.  I also baked it at 350 for 45 minutes and that was just the perfect amount of time.  Love this recipe.

This is my all-time favorite macaroni and cheese recipe.  Growing up, my mom and grandmother never made this dish, so one holiday season I went on a search through all of their cookbooks for the perfect recipe.  We tried it and everybody loved it.  Immediately it was my grandmother's favorite recipe and she quickly became known for her excellent home-made mac and cheese.  I was thrilled to find the recipe on allrecipes.com and I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving.  The kids and adults both loved and praised the dish.  With that being said, I want to add that I did cover the casserole for the first 30 minutes and then took it out and sprinkled shredded chedder cheese on top and backed it uncovered for the next 30 mins.  The top still came out a little bit crispy so I may keep it covered longer the next time I make this.  Also, I added about 1/4 cup of cheese to the recipe and it was just right  Enjoy!

Following the lower temperature definitely helps make the dish what it is. I've made this for quite a few people and needless to say, they've all loved it.

This was the BEST  Mac and Cheese I have had in a long time.  I don't like creamy mac and cheese so I specifically chose this one since the picture looked like the type I prefer.  I followed the recipe as given and it turned out perfectly and my boyfriend LOVED it!  I definitely plan to make this again.

I have always tried to find a simple mac & cheese that tasted just like the one my mom made for me when I was little... this one is BETTER!  Thanks for sharing!  Only thing I did different was shred the cheese & mix with the macaroni before I put it in the casserole dish.

I cooked for 30 minutes at a lower temp as suggested by others.  The top still got too hard.  I think when I do it in the future I will make sure to cover the top with cheese completely, whether that be shredding the cheese or just saving more cheese for the top layer.  Love the ease and taste.

You are correct when you say this is the ''Classic Mac & cheese''. I too grew up eating it like this at the supper table in the South during Thanksgiving and Christmas and all super's in between. This was the way my family has always made it.  I have ventured and tried other recipes made with a flour roux and didn't care for it as much as this classic.

I love this recipe and have made it many, many times since discovering it here. I use more cheese than they say - just coz I like cheese. I cook it at 350 and I cover it for all but 20 minutes of the cooking time. Everyone loves this dish and asks for it all the time. Also, it's very easy to do which is great for a beginning cook like me. This last time, I put crushed up garlic cloves into the butter and melted them together. Really good if you like garlic.

Wasn't a fan. I added some extra cheese and milk and tried it on 350 like everyone else said but it still came out really dry and flavorless. I prefer a more creamy mac and cheese

Wonderful recipe, exactly what I wanted and so easy!  I added dry mustard, a dash of cayenne and an egg (I don't think the egg was necessary), and used half sharp cheddar and half Mexican mix.  I did not double the cheese or evaporated milk and love the consistency and baked at a lower temp for less time.  Comfort food and memories from childhood, thank you!

This was my first attempt at making homemade mac and cheese and I must say, I am happy with it. There were a few changes I made (following advice from other on the site), like changing to a 3 qt dish, turning over to 350 and cooking about 40 minutes, and it does need more evaporated milk. I did a combo of colby jack, mild cheddar and Kraft Deluxe American slices. Next time I may omit the cheddar since it didn't melt well and maybe use a bit of Velveeta. Overall, I was very pleased with the dish and will use it again!

I have tried for years to duplicate my Grandma's recipie for Mac and Cheese and have always failed.  Grandma always tells me "I use a little of this, when it looks right then I know." I need more specifics when I cook.  This recipie was easy to follow and I got it right the first time, my husband ate 2 helpings. Due to others suggestions I used 1.5 lbs of cheese. Also, I shredded the cheese instead of using sliced cheese.  I thought that it would melt better through out the dish, and it did.  For a final touch, I placed bacon strips on top, just like Grandma does!

It was good, and I really liked the no-eggs in it, as we have egg allergies, but we did find it to lack a bit in flavor.  We have tried a bunch of different mac & cheeses, some are too try, some are too zingy (mustard)... this one was GOOD, it just needed a bit more cheesiness, I think.  We added some American and Monterey Jack to the leftovers (which save very well, by the way! :) ) and it was even better than the first time around!

My husband has been begging me to make homemade mac and cheese for years, so when this came to my in box, I decided to give it a try.  Overall, it was pretty good.  I will say that the advice another reader gave to add mustard powder was EXCELLENT, although, I will add much more next time -- it's pretty lifeless without it.

My recomendation is to make it with shredded cheese and to mix it up before baking so the cheese is more evenly distributed.  I also tried it out in the slow cooker and it came out pretty well. WARNING -- this is not meant for an all day cook!  Don't put it on in the AM before work and expect a great meal at dinner.  If you want to do the crock pot, put it on after lunch on med heat and STIR.  Don't pre-cook the noodles either and add a bit more liquid (I added a little more milk).

My husband and kids liked this. I used half mild and half sharp cheese as that is what I had. I thought it was ok. Seemed a little bland and dry.

I did mine like the other viewer suggested but thought it was awful. The cheese coagulated and was grainy. It did not have much flavor. I won't make it again.

Awesome!  This is my perfect idea of homemade Mac & Cheese and easy enough for me.  I did one minor change because I know how my oven works in my altitude and oven. I cooked on 350 for 50 min.

Great classic mac  and  cheese . Please  note it is  not supposed to be creamy. My boyfriend and I grew up on this kind  not the  one  in  the box . We just season  our portion with salt and pepper when done so not as bland. And we always  use Cracker Barrel  cheddar . Goes great with meatloaf . For  you box lovers  Its like saying  Dominos  is  good  Italian food .

I agree with many other reviewer's. Yuck. Not creamy at all. Take the time and make the sauce in another recipe. This shortcut does not work, unless like some you like our mac and cheese substandard. Classically awful..better things to do on a Sat night than make this recipe.

Delicous, and wonderfully easy. I used two cans of evaporated milk and the onion, and it was perfect. I also mixed cheddar and swiss cheese, for some extra bite. The only change I would make was the two quart pan was a bit small, I was grateful for the cookie sheet I placed under the casserole pan. 

Great recipe, enjoy!

I made a few changes using some of the previous suggestions.  I used 2 cups shredded mild cheddar and 2 cups shredded casserole blend      (cheddar, american, monterey jack and mozzarella cheeses). Instead of evaporated milk, I used 3 cups 1% milk. I baked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  I took my macaroni and cheese to a cookout and it was a big hit.  Everyone went back for seconds and the bowl came home empty.  I had many requests for copy of the recipe.

I've never made macaroni and cheese before with evaporated milk, and I was surprised at how good this was!  The only changes I made were that I melted the butter and mixed it with the pasta, and I crumbled the cheese and mixed it in instead of slicing it.  Before I baked it, I covered the top of the casserole dish with a mixture of bread crumbs and grated cheese, and it made a really nice crunchy golden brown crust at the top.  The evaporated milk gave it such a good, creamy taste, and my daughter, who can be really picky, loved it.  I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes until it was no longer liquid inside.

The perfect balance of cheese and macaroni - rich without being over the top. I modified this recipe by adding Parmesan cheese and baked it at 325 for 40 minutes.

I made this for the first time at Christmas and the only thing that I did not do was make enough. The whole family loved it, and scrapped the dish clean. Fantastic job. I do tweak it a bit by following what the other reviews say, add more evaporated milk and more cheese minor details.

LOVE this recipe. I have previously rarely made macaroni & cheese because cleaning the cheesy pan is a pain. Cleaning up after this dish is a breeze! Will make this often.

This is the way my mom always made mac and cheese, and it's probably my fave...I've made it many ways...and this is by far the easiest & has the least amount of ingredients. Definate "comfort food". I lived on this when I was nursing my 2nd daughter as everything I ate seemed to bother her:)

Pretty good "guideline" recipe, which I altered--it's a basic starting point for great mac n cheese!!  I am not big into cheese n mac, so I ended up using about 30oz of pasta.  I used sharp cheddar, smoked swiss and cheddar, and colby jack to equal a pound of cheese.   I baked at 350 for 10-15 min, then 375 for 30 min, stirring before the last 10 min to keep the top from getting overly crunchy.  I did not add the butter or salt or pepper.  Wicked Good!

very good. im not the best cook, but this came out very delicious and my husband loved it too. I didn't have evaporated milk, so i used whole milk instead. I also used shredded cheese throughout it and only 2 slices of cheese in the center. Cooked for 30 min on 350.

I am giving this four stars even though I changed the recipe a good bit.  It was a nice base and I appreciated that- my four stars are for it's basic-ness and flexibility.  I used a shredded "mexican mix" of cheese along with some mozzarella instead of cheddar.  After cooking the pasta (I had whole wheat penne) I put all of the ingredients into a sauce pan and melted them.  I added the in pasta, stirred, and then transfered it to the casserole dish.  I topped the dish with a mixture of butter, panko bread crumbs, cheez-its, and crackers before baking at 350 for 15min  It was a little dry, but I didn't have any milk sitting at the bottom like other reviewers.  I took others advice and added dried mustard, garlic, and onion to the recipe as well.  We all liked it.

We really liked this! I 1/2'd the macaroni (b/c we are a small family), used the full amount of cheese, which I shredded--1/2 sharp cheddar, and 1/2 mild). I used 3/4 of the can of milk. I also used some bread crumbs on top and cooked at 350 for about 40 mins.  Turned out great--even my extremely picky husband liked it.

This was a good base recipe. Other reviewers are correct - three simple changes make this dish a winner: (1) cook at 350F instead of at 375 otherwise the top will be super hard and badly burnt. (2) use 12 oz of pasta instead of 16 oz (3) up the evaporated milk to about 15 oz to ensure a moist dish. In order to make this a full meal instead of a side dish I added a package of lean turkey smoked sausage which I diced and sauteed, as well as about 12 oz of broccoli florets which I steamed. I cooked them both while the pasta was cooking and just mixed both in with the pasta before layering (3x rather than 4) in a 9x13 dish so there was no extra time required, and very little extra work. I loved how easy this was to prepare, and even my husband who does not normally like "comfort food" complimented it. With the sausage and broccoli this made 6 full hearty-appetite-sized dinner portions. I'll definitely make this again!

I baked this for my family for dinner tonight and we didn't like it at all.  It was so bland.  Also, the macaroni on top were way overdone and hard.  I think the oven temp and bake time in this recipe is off.  My kids are not picky and they wouldn't even eat it.  I'm sorry that I wasted good sharp cheddar cheese on this recipe.  I will not be making it again.

I've used this recipe several times but always with the mozzarella/cheddar combo and oven temp at 350 for an hour instead of 375 (burned my top the first time).

Easy recipe for this novice cook right here and always a winner with the wife.

I thought this was a good recipe. I made just a few changes because I made this on a whim and didnt have everything. I used about a pound of cheddar, 6 sleces of american, layared it, forgot the butter on the inside layers, so i just put some extra on top. I also sprinkled the top generously with parmesean. I didn't have evaporated milk so i mixed some thickish dry milk up and added a few tablespoons of mayo an mixed it really well. It made it a little more creamy, so that turned out ok. Good recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for! It was delicious. It made more than I expected so next time I might half it. I just changed a few things: I baked at 350 for 1 hour, uncovered for only the last half hour, and I used half sliced extra sharp cheddar and half shredded cheddar. This recipe is not supposed to be creamy or like the box stuff at all. Spectacular!

doubled the evaporated milk, used 8 oz cheddar and 12 oz American slices, added some red pepper flakes and ground cayenne, covered it and baked  at 350 for an hour, uncovering for the last 15 minutes.  Used a full pound of  Barilla enriched pasta; could have used more macaroni or less cheese.

If your looking for that old fashioned mac & cheese look not further, AWESOME!!!!  I have made several but they we're always missing something and I think it was the evaporated milk. I used some sharp shredded and a couple slices of sharp block cheese and I think I did a couple layers, anyways its great!! Now my husband likes his mac and cheese more creamy (like with american cheese) so I told him next time I'll just make him some Kraft mac & cheese and I'll eat all the good stuff. Thank you, Thank you

The evaporated milk gives it a distinct taste.  Very boring/tasteless dish.  Very curdly.  Noodles were WAY too much, cut the amount in half.

I had been lookin for a recipe like this for a long time. I was having a BBQ for 20 at my house and thought I would give it a try. I did take the advice of others and made a few changes.

Double the sharp cheddar cheese and use half of it to layer with. Spray the bottom and sides of your casserole dish with pam for easy clean up.

All in all it is worth the time and I was asked by several guest for the recipe.

Pay no attention to those individuals who say this is "bland."  Kraft dinner is NOT real mac and cheese.  I thought this was great, but I still prefer mild cheddar to the sharp cheddar.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING. Everything on it is perfect, except the cook time is too long. 45 minutes is good for someone who likes a little hard macaroni, but 30 or less is a lot creamier :)

I have made this every year for the past several years for special occasions, holidays, and company potlucks. It's a true custard style Mac & cheese recipe. For people that grew up on this style, it's the best. I do add mustard powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian bread crumbs dotted with butter on top. This just adds a little more flavor and a breaded topping. I also use a large oval 7 quart slow cooker & double the recipe. When I bring it to work, I plug it in there and cook on low for 3 hours. By the time it's ready, it's hot and good to go. I get many complements and requests for this at work & home. It's never been a disappointment.

I was looking for a good "basic" mac and cheese recipe without a lot of frills and this one really worked. It was creamy and delicious. I listened to the comments and reduced the oven temp to 350 and the cooking time to 45 minutes and it was perfect.

Made it tonight and it was my first time ever, making homemade mac and cheese.  Everyone loved it!  I made a 9x12 pan and doubled the recipe, I also used Kraft Deluxe American cheese and shredded mild cheddar cheese.  I melted my butter and mixed in ground mustard, white pepper and salt.  Mixed that in with the pasta, then layered it with the cheese.  I poured over two cans of evaporated milk and covered it with foil.  I baked it on 350 for about 45 minutes.  Will definitely be making this again and again!

This was a great recipe.  The recipe asks the chef to bake for one hour at 375--I found that at the 40-minute mark I had to turn the temperature down to 350; otherwise, it was clear that the top would have burned.  There was a little bit of boiling over, so put something underneath whatever you're cooking this recipe in so that any run-over gets caught and doesn't soil your oven.  I added some diced tomatoes and they were so good that I'll be adding more next time (obviously not recommended if you dislike tomatoes).  Oh, and for those that are counting, the nutritional information for the entire recipe (not per serving) is as follows:  Calories=3146, Total Fat=118.4g, Saturated Fat=70g, Cholesterol=405.8mg, Sodium=1802.4mg, Carbs=368g, Fiber=15.8g, Sugars=46.6g, Protein=138g.  This means that if six people eat this creation, divide these numbers by six.  As you can see, this meal packs quite a wallop.  About 50% of the calories come from the actual pasta itself.  Unsurprisingly, it's the milk, butter and cheese that are responsible for 97.8% of the fat.

Gave this a 3 star rating. It's good but I followed advice of others and doubled the cheese, if you don't it's definitely not going to work out right! In addition also cooked at 350 about 45-50 min and I think that was too long considering the pan stays hot and continues to cook a little. Definitely cover the mac n cheese if you don't want crunchies on top! Over all very inexpensive and easy recipe to put your own twist on!

I used penne instead of macaroni and, like the suggestions, doubled the cheese and evaporated milk and baked at 350. I thought it came out ok, but I was not overjoyed with the results. Maybe it was because I used penne, but for some reason there were pockets of cheese and pockets of no cheese, so it was a mix of bland and flavorful. Also, doubling the evaporated milk made it a bit runny, so I ended up cooking it more and making the top harder than I would have lied. I will probably try it again with regular macaroni.

This was so easy to make and both my boys LOVED it!!!! this was the first time I used cheese slices instead of grated cheese, and I think this makes a difference, the cheese melted more evenly than when I used the grated kind. I doubled the cheese and the milk- it was perfect!

This pretty good. The family enjoyed it. I used sharp cheddar and american cheese.  Turned the temp down. The top still hardened. I would just add some more seasoning next time. I put it in an 8x8 pan and used 1 1/2 cans of evap milk. It set up nice and creamy!

So good.  I used 16 oz. of macaroni, a little less than a lb. of cheddar & montery jack, everything else the same.  Baked for 35 mins at 350.  Excellent, creamy mac & cheese without the extra step of making a cheese sauce.

oh my my my..... i made this last night for my house full of boys and they loved it!!! The only two things are thatthe time should be cut in halfso 30 minutes, and i added(about 1 tbsp of each) some seasoned salt, some ground mustard, and black pepper in a small container and mixed them together and sprinkled on top of each layer of noodles(so a tsp on each layer).  Any self respecting southern woman who makes homemade mac'n'cheese from scratch knows that the flavor that cant be explained is ground mustard.  But this takes like an hour less to make and the clean up is fool proof. Not like "Grandma's" but its something to be proud of.

350 degrees worked much better and I used a little more butter and substituted regular milk. The good thing about this is it's so easy there is room for variation.

I took the advise of the other reviews and cooked it at 350 for 1 hour and added tons of cheese. I used cheddar, sharp and extra sharp cheeses. I also added one egg.  It turned out really good.

I didnt have enough Cheddar cheese, so I substituted with other shredded cheeses.  I think it would probably have been better if I had only used cheddar.  However it was still good.  I will try it again with only cheddar.

This was just the recipe I was looking for!  I can't say I'm reviewing THIS recipe, in all fairness.  I didn't use evaporated milk, instead I used fresh whole milk.  And I like to use various cheeses (Monterey Jack and New York Extra Sharp, plus a little American) but it was just the recipe I needed to make my own changes to.  I did put it in a 3 qt. casserole dish like another reviewer suggested and it was perfectly sized with no bubbling over.  I made a roasted chicken to go with it and was surprised no one even touched it!  The best part had to be the zombie-like "I'm so full" stares from the whole family who normally is so chatty during dinner but tonight they were oddly quiet while shoveling in this delicious mac n cheese as fast as they could.  Thank you Cordi Tierno for a recipe I'm sure I'll be making often this winter!

I had never made Mac and Cheese in unmixed layers - had a can of evaporated milk on hand that needed to be used - so thought I'd give this a try.  I did toss the cooked pasta with butter before adding it to the baking dish and layering it with the shredded cheddar cheese.  Used a little more than 1 cup of evaporated milk for half the recipe.  Be sure to let this "rest" a little after taking it out of the oven before serving.  Guess I'll have to buy another can of milk now so I can make this again...

I have been making this recipe for years now.  The only difference is that I use shredded cheese instead of slices.  It is always a hit.  I bake it at 360 degrees for 40 minutes.  That seems to be the perfect combination for my oven.  It is also an easy recipe to make ahead of time.  I quite often assemble it the night before (minus the milk), add the milk when I am ready to cook it, and throw it in the oven.  It makes what is already a simple recipe even easier, at least for me.  I cook it in a 13x9 pan.  A glass dish seems to work better than a metal dish to keep everything moist.

This is very much like my childhood mac and cheese also.  Only thing my mom did differently was to beat an egg in with the milk and we shredded the cheese.  Very basic mac and cheese, let the top cheese layer (we add extra) bake to a golden crust.....yum.

This is good recipe for a BAKED macaroni and cheese.  If you are looking for macaroni and cheese with a creamy sauce, this is not for you.  I did add more cheese than called for since I really like it cheesy!  Would also be good with some diced ham or sausage added.

I thought it would be a little bit creamier.  I also did it at 350 for an hour and it kind of turned out a little bit bland and rubbery for my taste.  I would maybe add something else liquid to this recipe.  I don't think I will make it again, sorry!

Super simple and delicious. I've made this with whole wheat pasta too, and it's the only way I've been able to make whole wheat pasta edible). The only thing I do differently is to cover it with foil for about 2/3 of the cook time, to keep it from browning too much on top.

Probably my husband's FAVORITE meal!  He requests this one weekly!  I don't use quite as much butter & then I think it's better b/c it's not as rich.  This recipe is super easy & SO yummy!  It's a keeper!  Thanks for posting!

This is an excellent base (meaning you can let loose with your imaginiation, try using risotto with different cheeses!) Mac and Cheese recipe - Truly an old fashioned recipe and the ONLY thing the prevents me from giving it 5 stars is I knew better than to cook it at more than 350 degrees.  I used a mixture of American and Brie cheeses and soda crackers, adjusted the recipe for to serve 4 (and still had enough to serve 6!) and my family was beside themselves.  FINALLY, a true 'classic' mac and cheese recipe on allrecipes....BRAVO.

Should have halved it as this recipe made a lot - 2 huge casseroles. I love this kind of dish and, keeping in mind it's the 'drier' version i doubled the cheese & the evap milk but it was still a little dry so in the end, I made tuna gravy/sauce (Melted 8tbsps butter and sauteed 1 finely chopped onion in it & added 4 cans of flaked tuna, season w salt & quite a bit of freshly ground black pepper & cooked til all sauteed fragrantly; added 12tbsps plain flour and 2litres milk and some shredded cheese; cooked until all thickened nicely) and then mixed it up w the pasta. Gave this a try but I think I prefer the creamy sort.

I doubled the cheese and the evaporated milk (per other reviewers suggestions) and it was VERY VERY good.  My kids only eat boxed until now.  Also, use 3 quart casserole.  It really does make ALOT.

Simple which is always nice! The recipe was a little bland but not bad. I might add a minced onion next time for more flavor. I also might double the condensed milk as another reviewer did, to make the recipe creamier.

This was the by far the BEST Mac And Cheese I have EVER had in my life!!! After making this recipe, I could not believe how horrible some of them were. They were not accurate in my mind. Although I did end up adding some sour cream, tabasco, chicken baste, and chile powder.

Followed advice of reviews and added extra cheese (1-1/2C), milk (1-3/4C) and butter (2Tbsp) in a 3 quart casserole dish since I am of the belief that cheesier is usually better. I didn't think all of the milk (used 2% milk instead of evap milk) would be absorbed but it was after baking at 350 for 45 min. Result was excellent! This is the Mac & cheese recipe I've been searching for! Family loved it except we could do without the crunchy top so next time I'll cover it in the oven until the last 5-10 min. Bonus is that 1 serving (1/8 of the dish) equals only 8 weight watchers points!!

I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and my family thought it was delicious.  We are not fans of super-  creamy and saucy mac & cheese, so this was perfect. It cooks up so that you can virtually cut it into "bars."  It was SO EASY to make, as well.  Unlike other reviewers, we loved how it got brown and a bit crunchy on the top.  YUM.

thanks so very much! I've been cooking for 54 years. My beloved mother in law taught me, and she used to make this.. I didn't make it for so long I didn't remember exactly how much of what to put in it. Its my husbands favorite way of having mac and cheese. I'm making it tonight and he will be so surprised. This is a great recipe, and again, I thank you so much.

This was amazing!  I will definitely make again.  I reduced down to 350 and only heated for 35 minutes.  I took it out a couple of times and stirred and then put back in the oven.  Definitely a keeper.

bake in glass loaf dish, when cooled I slice into pieces to put in sandwich bag and freeze.  Fry it any morning  with your eggs or lunch time nuke it with left over stewed tomatoes.

I had high hopes for this recipe. Sadly I didn't enjoy it. The cheese was clumped around and not creamy at all. It was pretty tasteless.

It came out looking good but lacked the creaminess that I was after. The cheese didn't stick to each noodle as I wanted. Over all it was good but not what I was looking for.

I made this recipe exactly as submitted. I was so looking forward to eating it. However, when it was all done, we didnt like it. Perhaps we just dont like baked mac n cheese, but I expected it to be creamy and it wasnt. The taste was ok, but there was something about the cheese that turned us off.

my husband is not a mac&cheese fan but he loved this. I used grated cheddar cheese as well as a little velveeta, could have used more. I reduced temp to 350 degrees, and then last 10 minutes on broil. I also sprinkled some progresso bread crumbs over the top. Was a little dry so next time I will use more evaporated milk. Oh, I also put some ground mustard in it, this made my husband give it a thumbs up.

This was my first time making baked mac & cheese, and it was delicious!  I melted the butter in the noodles and mixed it before putting it in the dish.  I used 16oz mini penne pasta, and I had 5 different kinds of sliced cheese leftover from a party that I needed to use- not sure exactly how much- probably close to 16oz.  I used one 12oz can of evaporated milk.   Didn't add salt or pepper so that we could season our own serving.  I made 2 layers in a 4 quart Corning Ware baking dish.  We had some friends over and they ate almost all of it!  Simple, easy recipe I will make again.

Simple recipe.  Great results!!  My daughter went for 2nds which is rare.  I added additional milk (most of 1 can of Carnation Evaporated milk) as suggested.  I also made a bread crumb and paprika topping.  I also mixed 1 Tbsp. each  of ground mustard, pepper, and seasoned salt as I feared the recipe would be bland and we don't care for bland food.  The only thing I would do different is to try 4 more oz. of cheese or a little less macaroni.  In our opinion could have used some more cheese flavor.  I baked at 375 on the top rack of the oven for about 40-45 minutes and the top was perfect!!!    This will NOT turn out like box Mac and Cheese just to manage expectations.

I did something very wrong here. Mine was horrible and I don't know why. I used the sliced cheddar and the 12oz of elbow macaroni. I had to use 2% milk since the store had no evap milk.  My cheese was major clumpy and didn't melt into the noodles at all. It was just gobs of goo. I cooked this for an hour. Still nothing. Anyone have any ideas? I'd love to make it this way instead of having to go back to the old method of a double boiler and a rue.  Thanks

I added a T dry mustard and a few shakes of garlic powder, dash cayenne pepper. Also used shredded reduced fat sharp cheddar and 1 12oz can evaporated milk + a 5oz can. Finally, I reduced the temp to 350 and cooked for 45 min. Tastey!

A really good recipe, though I found I only needed to bake this for 30 min, not one hour. I also used shredded cheddar instead of slices since that's what I already had on hand. Yum-o!

This was really bland and had an unappetizing texture.  I'm only giving it a star because the man of the house ended up eating it all but I think it was due to there being little else to snack on at the time.

I cannot give this recipe five stars since I didn't follow it with fidelity but with the changes I made it definitely would be! This was my first attempt at making Mac n cheese from scratch: I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese and velveeta instead of the sliced cheese and set the oven to 350 like others recommended and baked for 1 hour. The end product was DELICIOUS! Everyone went back for seconds. This one is a keeper!

Just like most of the reviews I've read...I thought it was a little dry and bland, but I think it's worth trying again.  Next time I'm going to use a little extra evaporated milk or maybe just regular milk.  I also added French fried onions on top and that really added a lot of flavor...definitely will do that again as well.  :)  Oh yeah, stirred it half way through and that seemed to help it come together because mine definitely was a cohesive sauce.

This was the worst mac and cheese I've ever made. I followed the directions to a tee. Not creamy at all, the cheese was sort of grainy. I'll never use this recipe again.

I made according to recipe and didn't have any problems with it being dry.  I did halve the reciped as there is only two of us.  Big mistake, making it tonight and will make full batch!  Boyfriend gave a great review and he makes his own mac & cheese!

Not quite as good as my regular mac & cheese recipe, but it's a close second and much easier and faster to prepare.  I used shredded cheddar instead of slices and sprinkled buttered bread crumbs on top.

My entire family LOVED this recipe.  Made a few changes based on other reviewers tips. Reduce cooking temp to 350, added another half can of evap milk, used 4 tablespoons butter threw in some mexican blended cheese and top it off with some bread crumbs mixed with melted butter.

The 375 temp was too high and the time was also too long. The top scorched and I agree with the person who wrote that the cheese and evaporated milk didn't create a sauce ... just sat there, curdled. In short, mac & cheese is a simple dish and I'm going back to the simple boxed kind -- quick, creamy and foolproof. Since I don't make it frequently, the additives aren't going to kill us.

This is a really good recipe, except it could definitely use more cheese. Also, the lower temp (350 degrees) for an hour is plenty - it still produces the crisper top layer without burning, and a creamy cheesy middle.

That's a lot of cheese. and butter. and calories and cholesterol. since i'm not american, i've always been wondering what the mac and cheese fuss is about - now that i see the recipe, i know kids would love it, but a responsible parent can NOT feed this to a child. look up the nutritional values before making this, seriously..

IM ONLY GIVING THIS 4 STARS B/C IT SHOULD BE BAKED AT 350 AND COVERED FOR THE FIRST 1/2 OF BAKING. I STARTED MINE OUT AS THE RECIPE SAID AND IT GOT TO BROWN ON TOP. SO I COVERED IT AND REDUCED THE OVEN TEMP TO LET IT FINISH BAKING.I USED AMERICAN SLICES AND MONTEREY JACK SLICES. MY GRANDMA SAID IT WAS THE BEST I EVER MADE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD BUT ITS NOT THE PERFECT MAC AND CHEESE I WAS LOOKING FOR

It tastes like it needs some other flavour besides the sharp cheddar.  Perhaps adding a different kind of cheese or even chunks of ham / hotdog would liven this recipe up.

Considering that the only mac and cheese I have ever had was made by Kraft, this was great! I used the supermarket's own basic grated cheese, because it was all I had. Also, once I had drained the pasta, I added oregano and a touch of garlic powder and stirred it through. I loved this!

WOW!  An awesome recipe!!  I used just half the cheese to cut down on the fat and it was still out of this world!  My super picky 3 year old said, and I quote, "I love this mac n cheese, mommy!"  That says it all!  :o)

My husband is not a macaroni and cheese
fan but he loved this recipe. He just
asked me to cook it again.  I gave it
to my daughter to try.  She has 5 kids,
and they love the box macaroni & cheese,
just imagine what they will think of this one.  Thanks!

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!  I have tried 3 different macaroni and cheese recipes and none of them got a thumbs up from my family until this one!  My 3 and 7 year old boys loved it, as did my hubby who is a chef!  I used a mixed cheddar cheese as well as a reduced fat american cheese and thought is came out perfectly!

This is by far the best home-made mac & cheese I've ever had.  I use half cheddar and half muenster though, add ham cubes and only bake for about 45 minutes.  I've taken it to two carry-ins and just love the recipe!

My Kids like the boxed mac & cheese and my husband and I hate it.  I was looking for something that we would all enjoy.  This was good although I made some variations to it.  I doubled the cheese and used regular milk(that was all I had in the house)  I also put garlic and herb bread crumbs on the top. Very tasty.

I used whole wheat elbows and added bacon, onion and broccoli.  I also used shredded cheese instead of sliced.  Turned out great!  Sharp cheddar is a must.

This macaroni and cheese recipe was definitely below average.  Not the worst I have ever tasted but nowhere near the best.  It was way too dry, bland and flavourless.  It just was not cheesy or creamy.  The search continues...

I should have read the reviews. I made this exactly as the recipe called for. It was awful. Absolutely awful. Everyone that reviewed it made changes to the recipe. Perhaps you could take this down or redo it  with the modifications

I am giving this 4 stars because the cooking temp and ingredient ratios are off for our taste. We like more cheese and milk. I love, love, love the fact that you don't make a cheese sauce to poor over the noodles before baking.  I remember my mother making this dish without making a separate sauce. I have made this about 5 times now. I use 1lb of cubed cheese and 1lb of shredded cheese. The type of cheese varies depending on what I have on hand. I mix the cheeses and macaroni in a 9x14 glass dish, then I beat a couple of eggs, 3 cups of milk, garlic, and pepper (no salt) to pour over the mixture and bake covered with aluminum foil for 1 hour. Our preference is to also add a topping of breadcrumbs or crushed crackers with a little melted butter and bake another 15 minutes. I encourage you to play with the ratios until you get it just the way your family loves it.

yummy!!!! This was my fist time making home made mac and cheese, it was so easy and so good! I did follow some of the other's advice and added more cheese, baked at 350 for 1hr, and used 1 1/2 cans of condensed milk, it came out perfect. My family were fighting for seconds and thirds

I am new at this thing called coolking.  I like the recipe and will try again.  The only reason I did not give it four stars is the warming up of the dish.  I missed the chunks you get with adding egg.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I am learning and this was a good first try at it.  Next time I will add two eggs to get more of the dish to be chunky.  The only thing I did change was turning down the temp to 350.

This is the macaroni and cheese I grew up with.  Maybe my mother put an egg in sometimes, but I don't think she did on a regular basis.  She just poured the milk (fresh milk, usually) in the baking dish until it was about half way up the macaroni in the dish.  I can't imagine twice the cheese or twice the milk as one reviewer suggested.  The amount of cheese in the recipe seems right to me. I did cook at 350 until bubbly and a bit browned at the edges.

I thought this was good. I used all the same ingredients, except I doubled the cheese. I also did not have time to bake it, so I boiled the noodles and then added everything into the pot and stirred until the cheese was melted. It was much quicker, although next time I will try it baked. It did taste MUCH better the next day, adding a little milk when reheating.

I followed the suggestions of other people.  Cooked on 350 for about 45 minutes, used deluxe american slices and sharp cheddar cheese, 18 oz evaporated milk, and placed in a 3 quart dish.

So creamy & delicious!  I followed the reviewer recommendations to bake @ 350 for one hour (covered for 45 minutes, uncovered for 15).  I put in almost 1 lb of Cheddar & about 6 Velveta slices.  Towards the last 15 minutes, I added 2 more Velveta slices torn apart and put them on the top.

I used others suggestions to bake for one hour at 350.  I also doubled the cheese and evaporated milk.  By adding some bread crumbs that were drizzled with melted butter made the perfect crispy topping.

This was very similar to the kind of mac-and-cheese I had when I was a kid.  I'm looking for something much creamier and this wasn't it.  Was it edible?  Yes, it was but still not what I was seeking.

the only problem is that its too much milk only use half of the can or even regular milk is easier if you like your mac and cheese milk or droopy.

Mine turned out dry. Part of the problem is putting it into the cassarole dish. This would be better in a 9x11. The problem is that all the evaporated milk went straight to the bottom while the noodles on top got hard and dry. Also, my cassarole dish was full that in order to even try to stir it all up, I had to take some out. Which, in my case kind of helped since I threw away the top quarter of the dish.  **I also want to add that this tasted even worse the next day** Dry and lacking flavor.

I got started making this and realized that I did not have any evaporated milk left so I used cream and some 1% milk and also realized that I was out of cheddar cheese so I used mozzarella and some kraft sandwich cheese. I came out really creamy and yummy and there was none left. I know it may sound like a heart attack waiting to happen but I normally NEVER make homemade mac and cheese. I served this with restaurant style buffalo wings and mahogany chicken wings from this sight. I got great reviews so thank you for the base!!!

I chose this recipe because I thought it would be easy and delicious and thankfully, I was right!  :)  My kids, who are lovers of mac and cheese, really dug into this and ate three helpings each.  My only recommendation would be to increase the amount of condensed milk to make it creamier.  I will try this next time I make the recipe.  Overall, delicious, simple, and it makes a good deal of food to feed the family!

Followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did  take the advice by lowering the temp to 350. I didn't have sharp cheddar cheese, so I used Kraft American cheese and block of cheddar cheese.  I cubed the cheddar cheese and sprinkled it with cubed ham. Not too shabby! Will make again :]

Tried this recipe because my boyfriend wanted to try something different, I don't usually cook from scratch or anything like this. Well it was really easy and simple, I used a little too much butter but other than that followed everything to the T. I put a little garlic powder and some breadcrumbs on the top which were a nice touch and gave it a kick. My boyfriend and his mom and dad loved it, as did my puppy after he got a taste from some falling on the floor. I definitely recommend this recipe and thanks to everyone else for all the good advice and input!

Ruthie (my mom) would be proud. I always loved her mac and cheese but never knew the proportions. (She always tipped the dish to tell how much milk to add. ) This recipe was wonderful and comforting. Both my husband and I loved it.  The only change I made was to use regular milk. I shorten the cooking time by 15 minutes. Thank you for this classic recipe.

This is a great recipe, that anyone can change to their own liking. I choose white and orange cheddar, i shreeded it instead, and also added double of what the instructions said. I added a dash of paprika and a dash of garlic and mixed everything together. Before it went into the oven i sprinkled a layer of cheese on top! It was delicious!!

We really enjoyed this.  It was a late decision after a busy work day and it was so easy and turned out really great.  Everyone wanted seconds.  I made mac and cheese from this site a few weeks ago and we liked this more and it actually cost less to make than the earlier one we tried.  Changes were... added bread crumbs and fried onions to the top.  As suggested by others... cooked at 350.  The only problem was that the evap. milk didn't get absorbed and swam at the bottom of the pan???  Perhaps I didn't cook it long enough??  Not sure.  Will be making this again!!

Was a hit with the family.  I would probably put it on 350 next time, the top got really REALLY crispy...  I also mixed in leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and put some french fried onions on top...  VERY good!

this was delicious the only thing i would add is to season the pasta with garlic powder, seasoning salt {lawreys} ground black pepper. use an egg and for butter i cant believe its not butter. that butter is delicious. also i didnt drain the pasta cuz it can become dry. leavn the water makes it creamer.

I was really excited to try this one because of all the positive feed back.  I was kind of disappointed, though.  It was bland, and not all that cheesy.  I had to switch to a 3-qt dish half way through assembly because I was running out of room in the 2-qt.  Even my 5 year old mac n cheese queen didn't think that much of it!

This is a great, simple recipe. I did make some changes. I used half cheddar cheese and half parmesan and I added 1/2 cup skim milk. After a half hour I put on two slices of American cheese and let it brown. My whole family enjoyed it and asked that I make it again.

I followed the advice of the other commenters... more cheese and lower temperature.  Turned out pretty good and fed me and 3 roommates and still had plenty of leftovers.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was extremely disappointing, it was too sweet, Mac & Cheese shouldn't taste like dessert. It was awful! My suggestion would be to not use evaporated milk, double the cheeese & use Half & Half or milk.

Very good - very easy!  I agree with previous reviewers, 375 degrees for 1 hue s way too much - I baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Also, I didn't have evaporated milk, used 12 oz of skim milk instead.

It was great!  The only thing I changed was the cheese.  Instead of using the slices I got Tilamook's sharp cheddar and shredded it.  It was more work, but I really think it added to the flavor.

My husband loves this recipe and it gets me out of dinner with his mom so I am thrilled!  This is your basic, homemade recipe - it's very nostalgic for him.  The top does get very crusty but that's what he LOVES.  I make this on a regular basis for him and his brother, too.

Really delicious! I changed a few basic things that didn't take away from how good this was. Used shredded sharp cheddar instead of sliced, and layered it all in a deep-dish 9x11 casserole, which worked out perfectly. Baked for 30 minutes uncovered, stirred it all, and then just another 15 minutes with foil over it, and it was perfect! Oh, also used two cans of evaporated milk for that extra richness. My husband has already requested I make this at least once a week! Thanks for a great idea.

Loved the results, but had a problem with the details of this recipe.  I used a 2-quart Corelle casserole dish, and could only fit about 2/3 of the macaroni in it.  With that amount, plus all of the cheese, it only took 30 minutes to bake.  I used New York sharp Cheddar, and thought the flavor was great.  I also liked slicing the cheese instead of grating it, like most recipes.  Super easy!

We love this recipe and have made it several times.  It's delicious, and easy - I've tried other mac and cheese recipes where I've had a hard time making a sauce - not required here.  My husband likes this a lot baked with smoked sausage mixed in.

I made this for my daughters second birthday party, and everyone loved it, including the picky kiddies. I used the sharpest cheddar I could find and didn't think it was bland at all. I grated the cheese instead of slicing.

This was very bland and actually quite disgusting. No real cheese flavor at all. I guess my family just likes the "real" Macaroni and Cheese that comes in a box.

I liked this, but my husband did not.  He said it was too bland.  Next time I'll try a mixture of different cheeses.  I really liked the texture, a little greasy though (when reheated).  I only needed to cook this for 45 minutes.

My daughters and I enjoyed this dish but my husband did not. I like the idea of slicing the cheese rather than grating it, because it is easier. If I make this recipe again, I will add more cheese, some sauteed onion and more seasoning, as it was kind of bland.

I thought this tasted okay, but my two daughters didn't care for it at all...they like the creamier "boxed" variety..and this wasn't that creamy at all.  It was also little bland, but probably because I used mild cheddar (sharp is definitely prefered).

Overall a good recipe--my whole family enjoyed it.  Very easy to prepare--could use a little more cheese through the center, but otherwise very good.

First of all, it is very good. I should have added more milk and covered it so it would be more creamy.

OK so when I made this I was honestly expecting a little bit more, this recipe was not as cheesy as I would’ve liked it. There wasn’t very much flavor. However, the flavor that was there was amazing. If you ever make this not only should you add more cheese but different chesses as well.

I made this recipe and baked it in an 11x13 pan.  I was a little skeptical that it would all come together, but it did, and it was good!  Next time I will double the milk for a little extra creaminess.  I found this recipe to be much easier and far better than many recipes I've tried that are far for complicated.  Thanks for sharing!

I really wasn't sure how to rate this, because although the taste was delicious, the sharp cheddar cheese that I shredded, didn't melt correctly to cover the elbow macaroni I used, it just kind of 'clumped' here and there. I followed the recipe closely, but based on other reviews, added about 1/2 cup extra milk to the evaporated milk. I've come to the conclusion that it was the less expensive supermarket brand of cheddar that I used, a whole pound of it.  I'm not a novice cook, so these results were somewhat unexpected. Also, there were copious amounts of grease that pooled on the top of the casserole.  Moral: your results are only as good as your ingredients.  To save this I'll just put it in a larger dish and mix in some velveeta, but when I make it again, I'll make sure I have top notch ingredients.

To fill a 2½-quart casserole dish or a 9x9 baking pan, I suggest using 8 oz. of small elbows (2 cups), not 1 lb., plus 8 oz. of cheddar (which you grate/shred yourself) & a 12 oz. can of evap. milk. But whisk into the milk 1 tsp. paprika, ½ tsp. of mustard powder, & ¼ tsp. each of ground black pepper, red pepper (cayenne) & garlic powder. Before grating the cheddar into the cooked elbows, stir 8 oz. of whipped cream cheese into them (for richness & to prevent clumping of the cheddar). The heat of the elbows will start melting the cream cheese. Then add the seasoned milk & stir until the cream cheese is completely melted. Next, grate/shred the cheddar into the mix, stirring as you go. It'll melt in the oven. Suggested extras: 2 hot dogs sliced into coins; 1 cup of frozen baby peas, 1/3 cup each of diced scallions & green pepper (or 1/4 cup of diced jalapenos!). Bake at 350 for ½ hr., covered; then 325 for ½ hr., uncovered. BTW, a 2-qt. dish or 8x8 pan will be too small for this.

My family loved this. I used an additional 6 oz. can of evaporated milk, and also reduced the temperature to 350 degrees. Using the recommendation of Kraft Deluxe slices and mild cheddar made this a great dish!

Temperature is too high. The top will burn. Also lacked the creaminess that really good mac and cheese has. It looks easy because you can skip making a roux but that is really the secret o creamy delicious mac n cheese.

This is a super easy recipe with only a few ingredients, which is great. However, I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because my macaroni and cheese came out a bit dry and I think I know why. Instead of following this recipe and cooking the macaroni uncovered, cook it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for only 15, or less. That way you get a crust but not dry mac and cheese.

Like most people who made this, I loved it! A few tips: Oven temperature should be 350F. Use only half the cheese that is asked, and if you have no idea what "evaporated milk" is just use 3 cups of regular fresh milk. And of course any type of noodles would work! ( I used Kraft mac'n cheese and took out the cheese powder. It says in the recipe to use a 2 quart casserole pan/dish. DO NOT make that mistake. You must use a 3 quart!! If you used a 2, it would make a huge mess in the oven, (as said in a review.) It would serve 3-5 hungry people!

I made this last week and loved it. Agree to turn to 350 though. I also used four different types of cheese; cheddar, velveta (processed) & a bit of Parmesan. Made it rich but incredible.

The recipe is very easy to make. My daughter and I found it bland where as my son and his girlfriend really liked it. It was cheesy and creamy. I used gluten free pasta because my son's girlfriend has Celiac disease. It wasn't bland because I substituted the pasta It needed some spices. I would make it again, but I would add some spices. I have to figure out what they will be. I think I will check other mac & cheese recipes on this site for answers. Also, I took the advice of others that have made this recipe and baked it at 350 for 45minutes, covered.

This gave me inspiration to make my first mac n cheese. With a few modifications it came out great!! I looked at other reviews and decided to go for 350 at 1 hour AND covered with foil. Very nice crust on top, but not too much. Added a ton of cheese and a tad bit of almond milk over the top. Love!

Close to what I'm looking for in a mac and cheese recipie but it's missing something. I proably was too light handed on the salt. Addition of extra milk as other reviewers suggested would help as well.

I made this but I did it at 350 for around 45min and covered it also after every layer of macaroni and cheese I put a little bit of butter and at the end I put half a cup of Italian bread crumbs then poured the evaporated milk over it.

Very nice recipe for a juicy mac&cheese.

Followed the comments and baked 40 mins on 180• but the last 20 turned on 200 degrees.
I've made my own evaporated milk by reducing full fat milk on a very low heat until its size was twice reduced and I may say the result was fabulous.
Also, made only two layers since my ikea dish was very small ;)) my husband is normally very picky but this time had nooo comments at all ;)) Bon appetite and thank you for the nice dinner!

I will definitely make this again! I did add a couple ounces more of the condensed milk, and I added a little bit of dry cornbread stuffing mix on the top of the mac & cheese for a little crunch. I tried a bite of the mac & cheese on the underside, and it was delicious. I liked the stuffing on top, but it didn't need it because it is delicious by itself! Since I'm not a fan of sharp cheddar, I used 8 oz medium cheddar and 8 oz Monterrey cheese - both sliced.

I used 12 oz of noodles because that's how they were packaged.  I took heed of the other reviewers and decreased the oven temp to 350.  I didn't worry about the amount of cheese.  I just eyeballed it.  I used the Kraft Deluxe American cheese along with the cheddar.  Very good.  Nice and creamy.  A perfect traditional mac n cheese.

Great! How ever i did make a few changes. I did two layers insted of four, used shredded cheese and put in at 350 degrees. I found that when cooking at 375 it burnt on the top.

I used shredded sharp cheddar & a couple slices of American per layer. It was dry, clumpy & oily. Definitely needs more milk.

I grew up on this Mac and cheese my dad made it all the time but along with the evaporated milk he used a large can of stewed tomatoes broken up by hand along with the juice and I also added regular milk just to the top of macaroni then bake until done to this day it is still my all time  favorite

This is very good plain mac and cheese. I used slices and shredded cheese. Also recommend cooking it with a pan under the casserole dish. It didn't leak out for me but other reviewer's had this problem. Better safe than sorry.

This was my first time making homemade Macaroni and Cheese and I thought this recipe was very good! The next time however I will add a little more cheese and instead of using macaroni noodles I tried it with shells. It was a nice twist on shells and cheese! :)

I gave this recipe four stars because of the calorie content.  The recipe was very good tho and had it been lower in calories I'd have given it a 5.

I thought this was excellent. I used 8 oz sliced sharp cheddar and about 8-12 oz of other sliced cheese I had on hand...havarti and mozzarella. Put it in oven at 200 for about 2 hours so it would be ready when we walked in from church. Perfect. Will def. make again.

Wasn't fantastic, wasn't horrible (hence the mediocre rating).  Kids didn't like it and wanted the "real" mac n' cheese (Kraft).  Was a bit grainy and needed some tweaking with more pepper and some garlic salt.  Would've SURELY been overcooked if kept in the oven as long as recipe states.  Did take other's advice and added another can of evaporated milk.  Not worth making again.

This was too dry on top and had an oily not creamy consistency.  It was edible and maybe it is a matter of taste or what you are used too.

This was an interesting change from my usual mac n cheese (which involves a flour/butter roux). I had leftover fettucine noodles and frozen evaporated milk cubes, so I thought, let's try it. I didn't have cheddar; instead I used a mixture of Swiss and Monterey Jack. I sprinkled a little ground mustard on top of my noodles when I sprinkled the pepper & salt on. I also made a bread crumb & bacon topping, because it just isn't mac n cheese to us without that. The evaporated milk cooked into a sort of white custard that was noticeable, though not unpleasant. The chunks of custard are something I have always tried to avoid in my mac n cheese recipes and for that reason I'm unlikely to make this particular recipe again. It is also my opinion that "salt and pepper to taste" on noodles you'd probably rather not taste in their sauceless state is a bit too vague for most cooks. With that said, this is a great base recipe to start off from--but I think a novice cook would be better served with another, more specific recipe.

My husband LOVED it!  I made only 1/2 the batch and used a different noodle. But all in all, it was VERY yummy!!!

Great recipe!  Adults loved it as much as the kids.  I changed a couple of things...I doubled the cheese and used Velveeta only.  I doubled the milk and baked for 1 hour on 350.  Perfect!!

This was very good.  I didn't have evaporated milk so I used some half and half.  I cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us and it was cooked in 30 minutes.  I will being making this again.

Maybe it's because I made it the night before, but...this recipe was not all it was cracked up to be for me. The cheese was definitely NOT creamy, but rather clumpy. The flavor was fine but not fantastic.   I'll keep searching for a mac n cheese recipe....

Really yummy!  I followed the other reviewer's suggestion of decreasing temp to 350 and added more evaporated milk.  Definitely let it sit out for a little bit before digging in.  I know it's hard but it's worth it!  Plus, makes excellent, excellent leftovers!!

So simple and sooo good! I used 75% reduced-fat cheddar cheese and fat-free evaporated milk, and I omitted the butter.  My family couldn't tell the difference.  So yummy, I have made it this way many times.  A keeper, thanks!!

This is easy and delicious! I used Dairyland fat-free Creama and I topped the mixture with Kellogg's Corn Flake Crumbs. Turned out great! I baked for 40 mins at 375.

I am giving it only 4 stars b/c I changed it up some.  I love to make macaroni with velveeta and "by accident" I purchased mexican velveeta.  I added the whole 2lb package cut into slices and then added about 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese to each layer.  I did top it off with 12 oz of evaporated mild but also added 1/2 cup whole white milk.  It tasted so good and my husband even loved it.  If you like things with a kick you will love using the mexican velveeta.

By far one of my favorite quick and easy meals.  We didnt have the cheese that the recipe called for so we just used 3 different types that we had in the fridge but it was still deliscious. I've never really cared to re-heat pasta dishes for left overs but this dish did well being reheated. It was still moist and cheesy.

I made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it! Despite it being really unhealthy, it was good for a nice, every once in a while treat. I used less noodles (about 12 oz.) and more cheese (mild cheddar and american)and more evaporated milk (about 16 oz.)Reheated well, too. Yum!

Although the recipe calls for sharp cheddar I used Tillamook medium cheddar the first time I made it and it turned out great. I used sharp cheddar the second time and it seemed a bit more grainy in texture. The key is to not add too much butter or else it will get oily. Also, be liberal with salt, pepper, or any spices you are going to use. This is a large, dense dish and needs a little more to flavor it. I love sprinkling in some hot sauce or Tabasco to add some kick. Overall, very good recipe.

I used shredded cheddar instead cause I found it easier to deal with and where I shop lower in price.  I used the can of evaporated milk put in the over @ 350 for 30 min. and then removed added a little milk and put in the oven for another 30 min. It was perfect.  I didnt use any salt or pepper cause Sharp Cheddar is already very salty.

Honestly, I will stick to prepackaged Velveeta shells and cheese. Just didn't care for this at all.

For people who love a classic mac and cheese, this is pretty good (and simple!). 
I usually prefer more substance to mine, so I would prefer a recipe with  onions, tomatoes, garlic, etc...

I didn't read other reviews before trying this recipe, but I wish I had because my dish ended up a little too dry as other said.  Reheating I add some water and cover, and it seems to be okay.  The virtue in this recipe is mostly that there are so few ingredients and that it is really easy to follow.  It's nothing gourmet, but classic and very quick to do.  I will definitely make this again.

Yum Yum!! Good old fashioned mac & cheese just like momma used to make. To me this is the perfect macaroni & cheese, tho my grandaughter thinks it's horrible. She rather have that blue box stuff. When I'm in the need of real comfort food, this is what I always make.
