Oh my, this is crazy good!  Don't care that it's quinoa, it tastes just like delicious rice pudding.  I didn't have whole milk on hand, so I used a combination of skim milk and some FF half-and-half.  Also, used Trader Joe's light coconut milk in place of the full fat version.  IMO the banana flavor is the superstar in this recipe, and one that I've never seen before in rice pudding.  You can taste all the different layers of flavor working with each other harmoniously.  Theresa787,  I haven't eaten a whole lot of quinoa, but your pudding has persuaded me to try to incorporate more of it into my diet.

Like other cooks who have commented here, I used ingredients I had on hand and this quinoa pudding was OUTSTANDING!  I used 1c. unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1c. whole goat milk, 1 large ripe plantain, 1 T. of maple syrup (instead of so much honey), and added more salt (2 pinches more).  This has a salted caramel flavor now.  I am used to quinoa so the flavor is just delicious, I my opinion.  Thank you for a wonderful, rainy-day dessert!  I am sharing this with all my cooking buddies!

Can't wait to try this! Can you sub soy or almond milk for the coconut milk? I don't like coconut flavor. Does the original recipe taste coconut-y?

I prefer it warmed up a little bit with some chopped pecans. Makes a good breakfast.

I only used 1 banana because that's all I had - added 1/3 cup of coconut sugar - omitted the whole milk and honey and used 1 13.66 oz can lite coconut milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla which made up the 2 cups . Yum

Made once and I will probably make again when it runs out. So easy to make. Filling and healthy. Good preworkout snack. I add 3 tablespoons of hemp seeds per serving (not mixed in) for some added protein, omega 3s, and an extra nutty flavor.

Yeah, not bad for quinoa.  Used pumpkin and cream and didn't cook it the second time, because I like  these types of dishes a little more toothsome.  Turned out quite nice.

This banana quinoa pudding is amazing! The texture and flavor are delectable. It has the perfect blend of banana and cinnamon, & it isn't overly sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't noticeable. 

I used 1% milk in mine, & it worked well. I cooked it a little longer than 10 minutes to thicken it more, & it seems fine.

the whole family didn't care for this one. It wasn't sweet enough to be a dessert and  it had the consistency of baby food.

This is great, so easy to make, and delcious. 
But my daughter missed her rice and said that real rice pudding is  still a lot more satisfying ??

I love this pudding! It makes a great breakfast. I usually sub the whole milk with skim just because it’s what I always have available. I also use reduced fat coconut milk and light butter. I can’t tell you whether the outcome is the same as the original recipe (because i’ve never made the original), but the taste is wonderful!

I'm giving this 4 stars, I like it and am eating it as a breakfast dish, I add a drizzle of maple syrup and some chopped nuts.  My picky teenage, gluten free son, that I actually made it for does not like it at all, nor did my husband.

I've had quinoa pudding that I really enjoyed so I thought this recipe would be great, but I was definitely let down. I ended up throwing most of it away. I took it to a family party and most people tried it and no one liked it.

I made this a few days ago and did not care for it. Neither my husband nor I thought the quinoa was a good idea. It tasted nothing like rice pudding.

Used a whole 13 oz can of coconut milk and 1/2 cup skim milk.  Also didn't have any butter, so used a tsp of vegetable oil instead.

This is delicious!!!

I have a super picky little guy and am always looking for ways to sneak healthy food in him.  It was rough getting him to try it, but once he did he ate the whole bowl. It was a little sweet, but everyone loved it from Grampa down to 2 year old. We served it with fresh raspberries and blueberries. Yum!!

I followed the recipe completely and it was delicious! I will be making this again but may follow some of the other's suggested alterations.  I'm not a big fan of quinoa but this was excellent! Thank you for submitting.

This was excellent. My picky one year old scarfed it down! Only change I made was 1.5 cups of coconut milk and half a cup of half and half. Will make this again for sure.
