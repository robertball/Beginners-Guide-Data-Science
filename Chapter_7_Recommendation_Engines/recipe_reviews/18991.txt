At first, I thought this recipe was a joke, too.  It lacks sugar...add 1/2 cup sugar.  It also needs twice as much milk...use three cups.  Then, it is actually a great recipe!

RUN AWAY!!  Why, oh why didn't I read the reviews before making this recipe?  I was so caught up in finding a stovetop recipe using flour & eggs like my mom used to, that I failed to notice there was NO SUGAR in this recipe.  And the flour to milk ratio was WAY off.  The mixture turned to paste on the stove long before it reached boiling.  I managed to add enough milk & sugar to make it somewhat palatable, but it still wasn't good at all.  I think the person who submitted this might have made some typing errors.

I took the advice of another cook and added sugar and it helped alot.  Also, I'm quite partial to graham crackers so I added those instead at it was great!  This is alot better than you might think!

This was awful. I added extra sugar and milk, like other people suggested, but we did not care for it.

I added 1/2 cup of sugar like others recommended, but also took the flour (i used whole wheat) to 1/2 cup and added a total of 2 cups of milk.  I mashed up the bananas and added it to the mixture and used vanilla animal cookies.  It was good and the kids loved it.  I'd make it again with these changes.

I personally thought this was good even without the sugar. When I tasted a little bit after I poured it over my nilla wafers it dawned on me I hadn't added sugar. In my opinion the cookies and bananas sweetened it up just enough. I am a cancer patient so I didn't need any added sugar

Very simple recipie.  The natural sweetness of the bananas is a wonderful surprise; not to mention having real pieces of fruit rather than just artificial flavor.

Ok, so I didn't read the reviews 1st....I was in a hurry. I didn't notice there was no sugar until I was finished?? It does get way too thick before i boils, but I just kept stirrin & folded in bananas (which I only was able to get in 2) & cookies. It tasted like bland banana paste......BUT, today (the next day) it has sweetened by the bananas & cookies, so it's not THAT bad. However, I won't make it again.  :(  & this was my 1st EVER attempt at banana pudding.....disappointmet :(

I should have read the reviews first, and it should have raised a flag that there was no sugar in it! i added sugar and much more milk and it came out good, but this recipe is not one I would reccommend.

this recipe tastes like flavored roux......I read the comments and added sugar but I should have known by the amount of flour compared to the liquid that something was wrong......would not recommend this recipe to anyone.....

I believe the submitter had to have forgotten the sugar.  No way could you make a vanilla pudding mixture without some sugar.  That being said I added 1/2 cup of sugar, and another full cup of milk.  Followed directions, which makes for a messy looking dessert, but it tasted pretty good.  I don't think I'll make it again as I would rather layer my banana pudding in a pretty bowl, and add either whipped topping or sour cream to my pudding.

I noticed this recipe didn't ask for sugar, but I wanted a stovetop pudding. So, I used one 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 cups of regular milk. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon to the milk mixture. I used 4 bananas instead of six. After the pudding thickened and was removed from the heat, I still had to add a splash more milk to get it to pudding texture.  With all these modifications, it was pretty good!!

If you make sure to add the sugar, this recipe is really good and fairly easy to make. I wanted to make 'nana puddin' for the first time and I chose this recipe because it was the only one where I had all the ingredients already on hand. My family loved it!

Okay, I should have known better, but I am 5 months pregnant and a diabetic when I am so I thought I would try this.  I added 3/4 cup granulated splenda and an egg yolk but the flour and egg whites made it lumpy:(

This was really nasty and tasted like flour and bananas and water. I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone, I would reccommend a recipe that you make instant pudding to add to it. I give this recipe one star, zero if I could.

I agree with the comments by the two that said add sugar and lots more milk. 

I had some bananas that were going to go rotten, and very little in the cupboard and fridge, so I found this recipe and took a chance on it. Be carefull about burning the pudding to the pan--it happens fast, especially if you don't add more milk. (I imagine a little bit of water wouldn't hurt either.) 

With mine, I added a few chocolate chips to give a swirl in the pudding, and it really increased the flavor.

If you get the right thickness, this would also be a good pudding pop. :)
