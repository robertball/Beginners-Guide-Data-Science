When I make this, as I've done for years, I use only the Cream Cheese (*Okay, secret's out:  I use Neufchatel*) and Hormel Chili - NO Beans.  Everyone goes bananas for it, with just those two ingredients.  Serve with Scoops chips, and you may want to make at least a double batch.  There's NEVER any left.

Superb!  We make this for office carry-ins and large gatherings--triple or quadruple for a slow cooker and it is a huge hit everywhere.  I bought the institutional size can of chili yesterday and added 2 packages of cream cheese and a tiny can of the green chiles and it was great.  FYI--that huge can fills the larger slow cookers almost to the top and is a nice shortcut to remember for a large party.

I liked this, but not as much as the recipe I usually use:  I layer the cream cheese and chili (instead of mixing it) and add a layer of cheddar on top.  I also wasn't crazy about the sugar.  I've also made it with veg chili and vegan cheeses; tastes just as good.  Great with fritos or with those gold tostitos

Delish! First time I had this was at a friends house, wanted to share. All she did was heat the cream cheese and chili, mix to combine, and serve with chips! Amazing how two simple ingredients can combine into something so good! Will try with the chili powder and sugar this recipe calls for next time, but even without this is so good...

This was good, but next time I'll leave out the sugar.

I had to review since I make this all the time.  It's so yummy!!  I left out the sugar since I use Cincinnati chili, which is already sweet on its own.  6 stars if you melt some shredded cheddar cheese on top!

It was so good!!!! The only changes I made was only half a teaspoon of sugar, I added red peppers, I put a little more chili pepper because my family likes spicy food. Next time I might add green onions and maybe queso cheese.  I will make this at every party!!
