I made this recipe for a baby shower gathering. I borrowed a friend's bundt pan, which is a standard size. It didn't even occur to me the recipe was to serve 6. (What cake ony serves 6?)The cake mix barely filled the pan. It was the tiniest cake ever. I followed the directions exactly on the cake, but my mother needed to alter the glaze by thining it down. She thought it was too thick to drizzle.
All in all it turned out nice, but I was still surprised how little the recipe made. I had to back it up with 2 other desserts.

Thank goodness I read the reviews!  A bundt cake that only serves SIX!  How can that be?  I'm a baker's daughter and have never seen a bundt cake that serves six.  Delicious as this recipe may be, it certainly needs a cautious reading.

Because of the serving size, I altered.  Used a box of white cake mix making according to directions substituting orange juice for the water, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp orange extract.  Recalculated the glaze to serve 10 and it was perfect.

I absolutely LOVED this bread!! first time I baked it and it turned out DELICIOUS!!! I did the glaze differently, I used half an orange w 1/2 cup conf. sugar n brushed the glaze on the bread, I used a butterfly bundt pan. I was thinking of poking holes on the bread & pouring the glaze & then brush the glaze on it..but since Im not much of a risk taker w my breads, I just glazed it...but next time I'll poke holes n pour the glaze so it could have more of an orange flavor... I do recommend this recipe, it is a KEEPER!! Thanks for the RECIPE!!  =)

Loved it. I doubled the recipe and used a regular cake pan. However, I think it needs a little more citrusy taste... I used 2 different glazes... First, I used a bit of butter mixed with Tia Maria (I wanted to use brandy but didn't have any on hand) and orange juice and sugar. It's a bit watery, but it soaks into the cake and makes it taste amazing. Then, on top of that, I mixed confectioners sugar with a little bit of the first glaze to give it more of an icing constistency, and poured that over the whole thing. It was a huuuuge hit with my fiance's family.

This was the best!  I was amazed at how delicious and flavorful it was.  I didn't have lemon extract, so used orange.  I also didn't have whole eggs, so used two eggs' worth of my husband's carton of egg whites.  As others recommended, I also used more orange juice than the recipe called for in the glaze to make it drizzle.  Needless to say, this cake didn't last long because it was so good!  I was glad it only served six, otherwise I would've ate more than I did.

Other than using a honeybell instead of an orange, I followed this recipe exactly.  The batter made 6 delicious mini bundt cakes.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  I did however skip the glaze.  I didn't care for the way it tasted and decided the cake was perfect the way it was.

This is a very easy little cake and find that freshly grated lemon rind is better than lemon extract. Complaints here that it only serves 6 - just reading the ingredients tells you it is not a large cake.   Luckily I own a small bundt pan (there are only 2 of us) which is ideal for a cake such as this. Please do not substitute margarine for butter and do cream very, very well and you should produce a nicely textured and flavorful cake.

I followed the instructions exactly and the cake was perfect.My son said he thought it was too sweet but that was due to the glaze, not the cake itself, because I hadn't made the glaze properly. My egyptian inlaws (who are excellent cooks) loved it. The best recipe I've had for a long time,thanks Melissa

This turned out really good.  The almond scent is stronger than the taste of almond.  I only didn't give it 5 because I wanted a more orange taste, and was hoping the grated rind would provide that.  My test subjects (co-workers) liked it alot and said not to change anything.  I'm sure it's just personal taste.

I like this recipe a lot.  I added poppy seeds and incorporated them into the cake that gave it an added extra texture.  Delicious.

My husband's new favorite desert! Lemon and almond extract are not available where I live so I add about 2 tbsp fresh squeeze lime juice. I also add a few tsp of lime to the glaze. Gives it a tart zig which we love! Very easy to make. I now make this cake at least twice a month!

I just made the glaze from this recipe to top another bundt recipe. It was great! We used fresh squeezed orange juice from an orange, which we used a little extra to get the extra orange flavor. I recommend using some orange zest if you do this.

Didn't care much for this recipe.  Wanted a small cake with lots of flavor.  I substituted the almond extract (which we don't like) for orange extract & found the cake to be overall quite bland.  It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked but the texture was nice.  May make some adjustments since we liked the quantity.  We got 8 very large cupcakes (I only have a standard size Bundt pan).  Would likely have gotten 10 regular sized cupcakes.  I frosted them with our favorite buttercream (Rick's from this site) but in the future, I might even add orange extract to the frosting.

Sorry but I had to give this a low score.  I tried it twice...it was very dry.  And the glaze didn't work right either.

I just made this for my husband and my son and me, of course, and it is delicious.  I put a little of my leftover orange zest in my glaze.  It is so moist and is just the right size for our family of three!

I chose this recipe for my birthday. Originally, I was going to bake it because I enjoy baking and this recipe sounded very dilicious but my Dad insisted on baking it because it was my birthday. My Dad doesn't bake. I haven't seen him bake in...years. He enjoys cooking and always left the baking to the women.  I went out sledding and came back to an impressive orange bundt cake, with white icing.  After dinner, my entire family wanted to try my Dad's creation and so he served it. I tasted it first and automatically loved it. The cake doesn't have a too strong citrus taste, it's very light and spongy. The icing is very sweet and tart and complimented the cake. The cake and icing went very well together. Tonight I'm making it again but this time I'm going to serve it warm, with Breyer's vanilla ice cream. A diliciously simple cake. Thank you!

I doubled the recipe to make a full sized bundt cake.  I was very dissapointed.  It was a very light batter, and I had high hopes, however it fell in the middle of baking and the inside was mushy and raw.  Maybe becuase I used organic cane sugar in place of nromal granulated sugar?  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the sugar. I sifted the flour and baking powder. Measured everything exactly. I will not be making this again.

yummm I love the citrusy flavour in cakes, so i used 10 grams of grated orange peel and it turns out wonderful! also used 75 grams of margarine to make it healthier; doesnt affect the taste though.

So tasty.  The texture is solid and yet smooth.  Not at all tough.  I added orange zest a bit more zip!

Great cake, but does not work in a bundt pan. I baked mine in a loaf pan, lined with parchment (grease proof) paper. I also added fresh orange juice and orange essence to the mixture along with the milk. Worked a treat and was delicious!

This was great, and I was so pleased to find a small 6-serving bundt cake... Most of my family is diabetic so sweets & large portions do not work.  I used splenda instead of sugar and 100 ml of liquid egg whites instead of the 2 eggs.   For the glaze, I used my diabetic powdered sugar instead of confectioners sugar.  Everyone loved it.
