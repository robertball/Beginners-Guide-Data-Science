I just pulled my "apple sheet cake" out of the oven about an hour ago and already had a piece.  It was delicious! The crust is not like your ordinary pie crust - it's more biscuit like (probably because there is baking powder in the crust). I think the crust might be a tad bit better if it had some sugar in it.  It's plenty sweet with the apple filling & icing but the edges by themselves are not sweet enough. I made 1 1/2 recipes of the pastry because I suck at rolling out pie dough and I thought that rolling it out to the size of a jelly roll pan would be difficult for me.  1 1/2 recipes turned out to be perfect for me! I had enough dough to really get a nice looking edge to my crust that I could crimp nicely. It prevented any leaks of the filling and did not brown too much.  The only small change I made in the recipe is to add one more tablespoon of flour in the filling because I was worried about it being too thin. I cut it when the pie/cake was still very warm and it did not ooze at all.  Sliced very nicely.  I prepared my filling before I started on my crust and so my filling had a chance to produce alot of juice at the bottom of the bowl which I left in the bowl as I scooped the apples into the crust. I've had so many pies with soggy bottom crusts that I tried hard to prevent it from happening again.  I used 3 different kinds of apples and didn't weigh them but used about 7 or 8 medium apples.  I sliced them very thinly because 30 minutes in the oven is not a long time

This reminds me of a apple slice pastry I used to buy by the slice from 7-11..when I was a kid, it would be delievered from some bakery in Chicago.. I have made this many of times now  everyone always loves it....sometimes i will add rasins(golden rasins) and walnuts....but its great as is too. I double dough recipe and used 12 x 18 sheet pan & had alittle left over dough,but I like having anuff to work with..its a easy dough to work with on a flour dusted table..I use flour to dust and roll the dough...I like it best with granny smith apples, I wash and core them,then just slice them up, with the peel on them..(big time saver)no one ever knows differance...if you use red apples you will have to peel them, otherwise you will have bits of red, not pretty...I also but alittle cinn and brown sugar in the dough...I use this recipe for pot luck dinners, its always a number 1 dessert, ice cream is good on top also. love it. Note if you dont want it watery...use granny smith apple , they hold their juices.....poeple always love it!

I find this easier than apple pie and it is great for a crowd. I took it to a pot luck and got LOTS of requests for the recipe. I have made this using both butter and shortening for the dough, butter makes a more tender crust. It is a job rolling it out to fit into the pan but the dough is easier to handle than regular piecrust. Definitely a hard to categorize dessert, it's not a "cake", more of a pie in a sheet pan. My husband said "It's like a cross between an apple pie and a danish... but better." I'll be making this one again. The icing's called for amounts frosts the dessert VERY generously, you could get away with half as much (if you wanted to!).

As previously noted this was tough to roll out to the proper thickness and size, but the crust was good. I did doctor up the filling a bit with extra cinnamon, brown sugar and nutmeg.
Came out good and it freezes and defrosts well. I'll make this again.

This was more like a sheet apple pie.  It was really very good!  I followed what another reviewer said and rolled out the dough between parchment paper.  Best idea ever!!!  I will now be doing this with any rolled pie or cookie.

This is not a cake, but a pie, and oh what a pie!  I didn't have the 10 X 15 pan, so I used a 9 X 13 cake pan.  I did not take time to do the icing, either, and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  We all agreed it was wonderful for an early morning coffee.  I will definitely make it again!

i was very excited about this recipe. i had high hopes, only to be sorely disappointed :( first of all, the "cake" part was more like a pie crust. i don't do pie crust. i added sugar and cin to the crust as did some other reviewers.  the filling was lovely, but wasted between a really bad crust.  i will ask on the exchange if anyone can figure out what went so wrong with this recipe and maybe give it another try.

This is a kick butt recipe I love it(so does everyone else)!  I made it in a 9X13 Baking pan instead, baking time is the same, makes it a little thicker.  Added a 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon to the pastry.  I'm not sure why everyone else says there is not enough pastry though, I can still make it fit a 10X15 cookie pan.  I found that rolling the pastry out on parchment paper worked out well, if you don't roll it out thin enough the pastry is to thick, and didn't make the "frosting".  This is definitely apple pie on a bigger scale, you certainly get a lot more pieces, this hasn't lasted long in my house.

Incredible-favorite of everyone.  My 5 year old has been requesting these for months now.  I call these 'apple pie bars'.  This is the only recipe I ever spend the time making home-made dough for & it is well worth it.  It's a big pan, but they get eaten fast!  Let's be realistic, it takes time peeling/slicing apples & rolling out the crust if you're not used to it (I bought a tupperware rolling sheet & that helps me a ton).  I usually cut the frosting amount in half-it's just too much.  These are just as good refrigerated as they are fresh.  Forget apple pie & move on up to this recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to get rid of a whole bunch of extra apples I had, so I tried this one out.  I used a 4" x 3 1/2" x 4 3/8 depth bread pan instead of the recommended 10 x 15 inch pan.  (I'm in Germany, so I had to improvise.)  I also added about 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the filling.  I also used butter instead of shortening, which made the cake taste nice and buttery.  It turned out great!  It tasted like an applely cinnamon roll.  It's best eaten warm, by the way.

A wonderful dessert!  It was enjoyed by all.  Like a few of the previous reviewers I added cinn. & a 1/4 c. sugar to the crust and I'm glad I did.  The frosting made it extra special--kind of a cross between an apple pie and a danish.  Glad I found this recipe at the start of the apple season.

Wonderful Recipe!   Like an apple tart with wonderful 'crust'!  I  rolled the dough out between two sheets of waxed paper and it took some effort but will fit the recommended pan!  I halved the "frosting" and made a thin glaze for the top.  This "cake" got rave reviews from my family and our dinner guest!  Definately a keeper!

Just happened to be perusing the dessert recipes and found this- wonderful dessert. My kids could hardly wait for it to come out of the oven, and the whole family loves it.  Used Darlene1's idea of rolling between wax paper-great idea- it really allows you to roll it out thin.  My pan was bigger then 10x15-so I did 1 1/2 recipe,could have used just a little more. I ended up rolling the crust in pieces and pasted it together; it still didn't leak through.  Used 1/2 the frosting as others suggested, that was plenty.  This is so very good.  It's a shame to call this apple sheet cake-as I would bet a lot more people would try it if it were called something like apple dapple surprise. Definately a keeper

I LOVE THIS... I put sugar and cinnamon in the dough as sugested to do by other reviewers. I would sugest putting 1/2 of a cup of flour in the apple mix. This would be 5 if I did not have to do so much to it.

This was so yummy!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  My only complaint was it overflowed and dripped all over the bottom of my oven causing alot of smoke and a small fire in the bottom of my oven.  That won't stop me from making it again.  Next time I will be better prepared and put foil down!

This is a great recipe!  I did substitute brown sugar instead of white, but that's the only change I made.  The crust is fantastic!  It is sticky, so I just spread it in the sheet pan by hand and it worked great.  I will definitely make this again!

This was just wonderful.  My husband made me make for his work and within 10 min. it was gone.  My brother doesn`t like apples so i added blueberry`s and it was just as good.  It reminded me of a toaster strudel with the icing.  I am so glad I found this recipe.

Excellent.  It is nice to have so many pieces from a pie.  My 5 year old grandaughter(picky eater) keeps asking when I will make it again.
I also cut the frosting in 1/2 & had plenty.

My husband really liked this, but I wasn't so thrilled with it. Too much crust for me. I used Jonathan apples, but 30 minutes of cooking didn't cook them down enough to my liking. Not sure what other apple to use, but one that cooks down quickly would be my preference. I added chopped cranberries which made a nice color and tartness to apple mixture. I baked it in a 9x13 baking pan. I will definitly make this again, but will tweek what I didn't care for and think it will be as tasty as my hubby (and his finicky brother) thought it was.

This turned out beautiful to take for a Christmas Dinner Celebration at my son's house today 12/19/09. This is my second Apple Sheet Cake that I have made. I add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon & a 1/4 cup of sugar to the pastry mixture. Extra flour was also needed to be able to make it into a large ball to separate. This rolled out very easy on my Tupperware pastry sheet & transferred well into a 9x13 sheet cake pan. I used a mixture of 2 apples sweet & tart. I thought it presented well with added candy/cookie sprinkles on top to make it more festive & make a nice picture to add to Allrecipes. Thank you for the recipe. This was a request for today's celebration from my daughter who sampled the 1st one I made in October.

This is the dessert most often requested by my coworkers. I made the following changes to improve the flavor and simplify the preparation: Double the dough (no tearing/patching/rolling issues). Double the salt and add cinnamon or cardamom to the dough to taste. Add 1/4 cup sugar to the dough (take it out of the amount suggested for the filling; most apples are sweet enough not to need a full cup). Roll out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper, and lay the paper with the dough for the bottom crust right in the pan to prevent sticking and leaking. Half the glaze is more than enough. Prepare for compliments!

I am subtracting one star because I needed a bit more flour in order to be able to roll out this dough comfortably (I used buttermilk instead of milk, but this should have required less flour than milk).  For the filling, I halved the sugar, because I drizzled caramel sauce over the apples (which was probably a mistake, because the caramel and apple juice boiled out of the pan a bit).  Other than that - this is a great recipe.

I thought this was good but nothing special. It was kinda boring actually. I added 1/4c sugar and 1/2t cinnamon to the crust like others suggested. I felt it was lacking something and had too much crust. Maybe it gets better as it sits but not totally impressed with what i have tried so far.

I don't know what I did wrong but my dough was only enough for about a 10 inch square pan.  So it turned out to be 2 inches thick but it was just so good I didn't care.  Everyone loved it.  I'll try again and make 1 1/2 or 2 times the dough.

This is a nice recipe and it has a great taste, but the crust was difficult to work with. It was sooo sticky ;) I had to add more flour in order to roll it into the pan. I'm horrible at making my own pie crusts, so it was probably me. Therefore, I am giving it 5 stars.   Great recipe for a potluck or party :) Thanks for sharing.

YUMMY. It was delish. I added a little more sugar, and also mixed a little brown sugar and cinnamon in the crust. Not a piece left!

definitely a keeper.  The pastry seemed so sticky, I was not expecting a very good crust from it, but it turned out wonderfully.  It was not difficult to role, either, which I was very concerned about.  I only had ingredients for half the icing, so made only a half recipe of the icing, honestly, I don't know where I would have used the rest, half a recipe was plenty.  Delicious.

I made this using gluten free flour. It was fantastic!!! My family gobbled it up.  I used 420 GM gluten free pastry flour & 1 1/2 tsp zanthan gum. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour mix. Other than that the cake part was the same. For the filling I layered the apple slices on top of the bottom crust then sprinkled with brown sugar. The rest was the same. I used 1/4 cup gf flour instead of 2 TB because I wasn't sure how it would thicken. Next time I'm going to try cornstarch. I'll be making this many times & when peach season comes around I'm going to try it with them!

Made it for the free breakfast for the homeless and needy and they LOVED it.  I will DEF make it again for them. It went over REALLY REALLY well. I used fresh apples (cut into pieces) and  cream cheese frosting instead of the basic confectioners sugar frosting.

This apple dessert is wonderful.  The crust was easy to work with and was flakey and stood up to app!e pie filling well.  I used two cups of confectioners sugar in the icing and the remaining ingredients as written. Was ample. Definitely will make again.

A great recipe to make and eat. The dough is easy to make and work into a top and bottom crust. The finished product is very tasty, fruity with fresh apples, and a frosting that just fits. Will make it again.

I would had given this five stars, but the dough recipe does not fit the pan size...I should had read the reviews prior to making this and I would had increased the dough by half.

Good tasting, and I will make it again for sure.  Thank you :-)

Excellent recipe!!! I pretty much followed the instructions except I added two teaspoons of cinnamon. I agree with other reviews that the pastry was hardly enough. You have to roll it very very thin to get it all covered. As it was I didn't have enough to put up the sides of the pan. I did feel the crust was lacking flavor but the filling made up for it! Next time I will tweek the pastry as others have recommended. It only lasted two days at my house since my son-in-law took home half the pan! :)

I've tried other apple sheet "pies" and this is, by far, the easiest and best.  The dough rolls out beautifully without crumbling up and breaking apart like other doughs I've tried. In fact, this is the reason for my high star rating - the dough.  Also, you don't need all that butter on top of the apples.  I used 1/4 cup the second time I made this and couldn't tell any difference.

This dessert was good...not knock your socks off, but good. I will use butter next time in the crust instead of shortening, less sugar in the filling, and apple pie spice in place of half the cinnamon...I also halved the icing part....I must say for someone who doesnt care for cooked apples, this was a good recipe...

These were good but I think the frosting is a little too sweet for my taste.  Even my DH said What is in it that taste soo sugary?  I would make again but maybe with less frosting and more apples.

I hate apple pie and I hate most cake BUT THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER. Its easy, everything came out perfect; the apples, the icing and the most perfect dough for the crust. I do have a kitchen aid to do all my mixing and whipping. Thank you Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was much better and easier than making a pie.  The pastry was very easy to work with.  The frosting sends it over the top!  I used 1/2 Granny Smith apples and 1/2 Golden delicious for a nice mix of sweet and tart.  Best served warm.

Made this pie exactly as the recipe states, and it was absolutely amazing.  Tastes just like a cinnamon bun.
