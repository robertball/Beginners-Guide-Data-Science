I used these in my bridesmaid's tea.  Half of the guests liked them and the other half didn't touch them.  They are a hard, very heavy bisquit.  So if you like bisquits, you will probally like them. They are best with marmalade or jam.  Next time I think I will try putting some raisins or other fruit in them.

I do like these, but I found that I have to eat them with jam or butter.  I was more hoping for a scone that didn't require any embellishments.  Extremely tasty though, with a dollop of applebutter.

This recipe was quick, easy, and really convenient.  I added craisins to the dough to add some additional flavor.

I read the reviews before making and decided to use 1/2 c. cream so they wouldn't be dry, also only use unbleached flour and no salt (BP diet). We loved them. They are heavy, but so good! Love them with just butter, or with apple butter, or maple cream. Got lots of compliments. Today I made a triple batch to use up some cream. I beat my eggs well and added the cream blending well in one bowl, dry ingred. in another bowl, cut in the butter, then combine wet and dry, mixed with hands. Divided the dough onto 2 parchment lined sheets and patted into a circle for one and rectangle for the other. Cut into scones. I separated the scones before baking and they came out wonderful. Nicely browned and "flakey looking" like layers. I don't top with the egg wash and sugar, but I do use 2 T. sugar in the dry ingredients. And I do have to bake 18-20 minutes to get them done in the middles as mine are larger scones. Triple batch gave us 17 scones today. This is our favorite scone recipe at the moment!

They are very tasty.  I reduced the amount of whole wheat flour and increased the amount of white flour.  I also combined the dry ingredients first and then the liquids and then mixed the two. I didn't use the egg white topping and the sugar topping because I was using the scones in place of potatoes or other carbs at supper.  I added raisins to half of the scones which I saved for bedtime snack.

This makes a lot of dough and I found that 8-10 was a low number for how much dough there really is.  I would recommend breaking it down into smaller scones so that they will cook all the way through.  Otherwise, they are delicious!
