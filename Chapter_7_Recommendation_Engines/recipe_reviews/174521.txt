I love tortellini and shrimp so I decided to give this try when my mom came in to visit.  The combination of marinara sauce and chicken broth scared me a little but it smelled WONDERFUL when everything started boiling.  I only gave it 4 stars because I had quite a bit left over, even though 4 adults ate. I guess no one wanted seconds.  I'll try it again in a few months.
