This is a 10 star recipe, no doubt! I thought that only having walnuts and vanilla as the primary flavoring might be a bit 'blah', but boy, was I glad to be wrong! It's delicious! You get a very nice nutty flavor (that I'm sure you could intensify by toasting the walnuts before adding them to the cake, which is something I did not do), with a hint of vanilla, and the perfect amount of sweetness! I made the cake exactly as stated, and it's awesome, and very forgiving too! I accidentally dropped it on my parchment paper, and it didn't crack or break at all! It's easy to roll out and handle. I did use powdered sugar in place of granulated sugar in the cream filling, and added a bit of vanilla. I might also chop the walnuts a bit finer next time, just to make cutting the cake a bit easier. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! Fantastic recipe, and so easy to make too! Thank you!

Great recipe. I did toast the walnuts before chopping them, and chopped them fine. One tip - don't bake too long. You don't want any crispness in the cake. If it does get a bit crispy around the edges, trim this off.  I also added a little vanilla to the whipped cream. Easy to make, and very attractive to serve.
