I am going to give this 3 stars right now but that may change once I fix it again but only a littl differently.  I had to do some research on what Hard Dry Cider and I found out is something like an apple wine, the "Hard" is a way of saying that it is an alcoholic drink so since I did not have any of that I used a dry white wine and did not change the amount.  This is what I will do different next time...use a different wine and cut down the amount, cook the pasta only 7 minutes and then add the shrimp and let it cook.  Reason why is because the pasta was over cooked at 15 minutes and the extra cooking time for the shrimp just added to the over cooking.  My husband like it so I will fix it again with these changes.

Thanks

This recipe is GREAT!  It reminds me of a pasta I get from a restaurant called Pizza Mizza.  I added in a few extra garlic cloves and bacon to the recipe and omitted the celery.  I must say again it was fabulous!

I made this for Valentines Day, and overall it was pretty good! I used whole wheat pasta, and instead of celery I used zucchini (my partner hates celery). He has requested this again!

This was suprisingly tasty, really quite good - will make again.  I thought it might be soupy with the liquid ingrediants - but not at all, just a nice sauce!

This recipe was easy and quick to make. I used half prawns and half salmons, which turned out delicious. I also added basil which added a nice bit of flavor. Would definitely recommend trying this one!

Prawn and cider, great combo. I would use bottled artichokes and add at the end. Would probably do away with the celery and didn't use bell pepper. Lots of fresh parmesan on top made all the difference.

This was great. Although a lot of people agreed that the prawns in a cream based dish would have suited it better, that it tastes amazing. I added 500grams of Penne pasta to feed 4 people, onions, 3 cloves of garlic, 3 sticks of celery, 1 carrot, 1 can of corn kernels, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, paprika, salt and pepper and curry powder. It tasted amazing!

I made this for my boys and husband tonight for dinner tonight.  I will admit I was a little leary of the hard cider.  I tested the pasta before adding the shrimp and I was surprised how good it was.

i give it 5 star but i used chicken and chorizo instead of prawn, it gave it a bit of spice and the chicken soaked up the cider making it so juicey. hope you try this.
