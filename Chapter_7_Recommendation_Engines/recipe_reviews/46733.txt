This sauce is really good, but not after you put it with the spaghetti. My husband and I ended up picking the chicken out of the pasta. The sauce tastes like barbecue sauce - I don't think that pasta belongs with barbecue sauce.

I give it 4 1/2 stars but my husband gave it 3 1/2, so it's four starts for us.  I thought it was very good and a really nice change from our regular spaghetti.  I used shredded chicken instead of cutting it into chuncks.  It was fantastic!  We didn't put any green peppers in it.

it was very good, i like the spiciness, so i appreciated that, but it was a little sweet too. I did not have green peepers, so i just doubled the onions in my recipe, and i used 3 chicken breast for a 1/2 a serving as opposed to a whole chicken

This was surprisingly good -- my husband and I both loved it!  I left out the green pepper and added a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper to give it a little bite to balance the sweetness.  This recipe is a KEEPER!

After making the sauce, it was a bbq sauce, not one I would put on pasta.  I ended up cooking the chicken in it and making a bbq chicken dinner.  The left over sauce was made into a base for chicken chili.

Very tasty recipe. Great that it's made of all ingredients I almost always have on hand too! Very comforting on a cold winters night. Thanks for this recipe :)

Whether you like this or not is definitely going to depend on how you feel about BBQ sauce and noodles. I wasn't sure if my family would like it, so I made just 1 serving for myself. I liked it OK, but I thought the sauce had too much Worcestershire sauce, and I knew it would be too sweet for me, so I cut WAY back on the brown sugar, only using 1 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp. for my 1 serving. I thought it was good, not very spicy, but a different kind of meal. I don't think my family would like it though, so I'll pass on making a big batch. You'd really just have to try it to see if you like it. Thanks to the submitter for the idea.

I tried this dish because I had some left over grounded chicken that I wanted o spruce up. I pretty much followed the recepie and it turned out to be very good but was a bit spicy. I will make it again
