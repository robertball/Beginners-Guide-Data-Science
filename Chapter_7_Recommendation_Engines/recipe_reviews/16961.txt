After making this recipe once(trying to cut the loaf into layers and the filling way too thin) I threw the recipe away.  I only let my family taste the messy result and they kept saying how much they enjoyed it. I printed the recipe again and made a few changes and it is a big hit with everyone.  I only slice the loaf in half and in the filling I only add 1/2 the juice to the creme cheese with some powdered sugar and vanilla instant pudding to help thicken it.

I also did not split the bread but used the filling as a frosting on top.  There was some left that I, too, used as a spread.  It was pretty thin and I thought it would make the bread too soggy if I layered it.

This bread is awesome, I will definately double the cream cheese next time, and it is not at all too runny to put between the bread!

I just adore this bread! I could eat the entire recipe by myself. I didnt find my filling runny at all and did put it between layers. I shared loaves with friends and they all found it wonderful, as did my husband.

this was a wonderful tasting bread. i made it for bread day at my daughters school as well as a christmas party and everyone asked for the recipe. I have made this bread several times the only time the filling came out runny was when I used low or no fat cream cheese if you use Philidelphia original cream cheese it is perfect. Also I use two brick of cream cheese but the same amount of juice

This was just so-so. The bread was kind of dense, I was hoping it would be a little lighter, fluffier, more cake-like I suppose. My cream cheese also got too runny, and I just tossed it and used another cream cheese frosting recipe entirely. I probably won't make this again.

The bread is delicious.  I made the batch into mini-loaves so that I could share.  I experimented with the cream cheese on one loaf.  I only added half of the called-for liquid, so it wouldn't be so thin.  Also, I thought it a little odd to be using an unsweetened cream cheese mixture on a fruit bread, so I added 3 or 4 Tbl. powdered sugar.  All in all, I'm glad I only used the filling on one loaf, I think it's unneccesary.  The bread is good without it, but it was o.k. with it as well. Next time I think I'll try to mix it in the batter as one other reviewer did, and see how it turns out.

Sent one loaf to work with my hubby and served the other at a picnic.  Everyone LOVED them and several people asked for the recipe.  I .liked the filling in the middle....it made this bread extra special.  Thanks Saundra.

I was so excited to make this bread, and delighted to eat it. I used fresh strawberries in the bread, and also just added some finely chopped berries to light cream cheese and it worked very well....not runny at all. My one concern when making the bread was the large amount of oil, however it does seem to work well, but takes a long time to make sure it is not to doughy in the centre when finished baking. I really liked this....definitely a keeper.

I was pleased with the cream cheese filling, however, this bread is WAY too sweet. You can't even taste the strawberries. I will try it again and maybe cut the sugar in half.

This turned out bad. Doesn't taste very good and doesn't look very good. Not easy to cut and spread either. I could hardly taste the strawberries.Sorry, but won't do again. Thanks anyway.

The cream cheese filling was way too thin to hold the bread together so I ended up using it like a spread.  Time consuming but it has good flavors.

I was a little unsure at first, however once the bread was in the fridge for a while it was excellent.  Very different and refreshing.

This reminded me of shortcake.  We ate ours with some strawberries and glaze on top.  Next time, however, I'd say double the filling.

This bread was fabulous.  I didn't have any frozen stawberries so I used 1 lb. of fresh strawberries and smashed them up before I added them to the batter.  For the filling, I mixed about 1/2 cup homemade frozen strawberry jam with the cream and it was delicious.  Everyone loved this at our quilting club meeting.

Looking for a recipe that uses FRESH strawberries. Frozen will have more water, so I'm not sure if I can just substitute.

This recipe was nice!  I changed it a little though...I added a small amount of strawberry yogurt and confectioner's sugar to the spread.  I also used fresh strawberries for the bread.

This is pretty good; it's kind of tangy and cinnamony.  I expected it to be much sweeter, but I preferred the result.  I only made one loaf, but the same amount of filling, so it worked out well since many reviewers mentioned there wasn't enough filling.  The filling came in handy, too, when the loaf cracked in half, and I had to cement it back together.  I used fresh  mashed-up strawberries, and I also added some sugar to the filling, about two small teaspoons.  Good, but messy.  I will have to eat mine with a fork.  Thank you.

To make this more dynamic, after I cut it horizontally I put a layer of strawberry jam, sliced strawberries, and cream cheese spread.  I did the same on the top. Very yummy!

Oh, and I also used a hand. mixer to smooth out the lumps in the spread....

The recipe was very moist. The only problem was the filling. The strawberry juice mixed in with the cream cheese was too creamy and watery. For a substitution I would suggest strawberry cream cheese already mixed together.  Overall it was good and I would make it again.
