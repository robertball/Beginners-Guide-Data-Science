This is quick and easy as well as flavorful. I made mine with sole filets in a tagine so it left a lot of juice. In fact, next time I'll only use half the seasonings and butter for the original amount of fish. The seasonings were a bit much for sole, but I would imagine for cod they would be right. Thank you for the recipe.

Really good.  Agree with other reviewers to use a basting brush 
otherwise the cod fillets were to cold and made the butter herb mixture freeze up and made it hard to coat fish.  Also noticed that it was a little bland.  Seems like it needed salt.
Otherwise flavor was mild but good.  I would just up the herbs more and add a dash of salt.  (I didn't have any seasoned salt) so didn't use any salt.  Probably why my fish was a little bland.   Also helps to ensure the fish fillets are all uniform size so they all cook at the same rate!

This simple fish recipe was great!  My husband came home with some beautiful cod fillets, and this recipe was the perfect way to prepare them.  I did add some special Passion Fruit Chili Pepper seasoning we found In Hawaii - the result was delicious!

We thought it needed much more flavor, I will try different seasonings next time ,I might try garlic infused olive oil.
I also brushed the butter mixture on as suggested by another reviewer.

The recipe was simple and easy to follow. I loved tr. The only adjustment I made was to sprinkle seasoned bread crumbs over the fish before putting into oven.

Simple, but tasty recipe to out together. I subbed with Earth Balance butter, but otherwise made the recipe as written. it is delicious, but felt next time I would reduce the amount of butter by at least half. Also, I would just brush the butter on both sides of the fish. The amount of dill was perfect for us and didn't seem overwhelming, but there was too much butter for us and seemed to take over the fish and other seasoning. Will make this again for a great and easy recipe to prepare cod or another white fish. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great starting point and a recipe I've made several times, to the delight of my roommates. I do cut the salt in half as it's a bit overpowering otherwise, and since I often start with frozen fish I spoon the mixture over the fish rather than laying the fish in it--otherwise the butter will immediately harden and become difficult to work with.

It was very easy. Good for a quick meal  and the ingredients don't over over the cod.  The second time I did it, I used half the butter and it was just fine. The edges were a little crispier, which I really liked! I'm sure this would be great with any white, mild fish.
