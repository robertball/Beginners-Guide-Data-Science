I put 2 lbs. carrots, and 3 lbs. potatoes (both cut up small), in the bottom of the crock pot before adding the chicken and gravy.

It worked quite well, and made a complete meal. Picky hubby gave it 2 thumbs up! :)

p.s. creamy gravies do tend to break down in slow-cooking, thus the 'watery' result some mentioned.  cooking for less time on high, instead of all day on low, may help.  also, try only adding 8-12 oz. gravy initially, and saving the rest only for last hour, or just to add at the end.

So easy to make! I didn't have a jar of turkey gravy, so I used a package of dry gravy mix and added a cup of water to the crock pot. The chicken was so moist it fell apart when I tried to pick it up! Served over mashed potatoes with a side of corn.

My son and I thought this was terrific.  My son was real excited when I told him what we were having for dinner.  (He asked me what it was, because it smelled so good.) My husband liked it, but he wasn't as excited about it. It's hard to please him with chicken! This is so easy to make that I will definitely make it again.

Quick, easy and delicious!  The whole family loved this and I loved the fact there was hardly any preparation.  I put the chicken breasts in straight from the freezer and cooked them on high for 4 hours.  Very tender and flavorful!

I was SO suprised this tasted as good as it did..I was leary about about it at first..I used the Mrs. Dash salt free garlic & herb seasoning.
I love garlic, but this blend is not overpowering on the garlic...It made the apt. smell wonderful!  Brown rice goes awsome with this.
THANKS!

I left out the soy sauce and used two packs of "dry gravy". It made more than enough gravy.

Yum!  It made my house smell so good when we came home from church.  I made this because I was looking for quick simple recipes to used on days I work.  It's a keeper since my family loved it.  I used five frozen breasts,a huge can of turkey gravy, 2 cups of sliced carrots and 1 cup celery. I added salt, pepper, thyme, garlic and onion powder.  I served it with stuffing and mashed potatoes.  We like how the gravy became thin.  Will make again. So easy.

May have solved the "needs something" comment from some previous reviewers.  I added McCormicks Herb Chicken Seasoning and some onions!  (I'm sure any poultry seasoning would work.) The sauce was pretty runny but nothing a little cornstarch couldn't fix.  Overall, this is a quick, easy meal with almost no prep and all kinds of possible variations.  This one is a keeper!

I used gravy packets because,like another reviewer mentioned and it came out so watery and the chicken was very dry.  I have to assume something went wrong because of all the good reviews this recipe has gotten, but I'm too afraid to bother trying again, that's how bad it was....sorry.

Awesome. Perfectly tender. Ideal to go over rice, and with any veggie. Or use it in a mexican burrito! It's true- it smells great cooking, and is about as easy to get going as one could hope :)

I put a few chopped vegetables in the bottom of the slow cooker: 3 small potatoes, 2 medium carrots, a stalk of celery, and half an onion. I only had 2 chicken breast halves on hand so that's what I used, and I put them in frozen, without thawing. Instead of jarred gravy, I used a pouch of powdered  turkey gravy mix prepared with 1 cup of cold water. I didn't have any "salt-free herb seasoning blend", so I substituted "coarse ground garlic salt with parsley". I omitted the soy sauce since I'd added garlic salt, and I also added 1/2 tsp each of thyme and rosemary. I cooked it for 1 hour on high and 4 hours on low, then turned off the heat and let it sit for another hour until dinner time. Just before serving, I prepared a second pouch of turkey gravy in a serving bowl. I removed the chicken from the slow cooker, shredded it, and mixed it into the freshly-prepared gravy.   I served the chicken & gravy over cornbread dressing with the vegetables on the side. The chicken had a mild flavor; some might find it a bit bland. It probably depends a lot on the flavor of the gravy you use. The texture is very nice, though; it's fall-apart tender and very easy to shred. The vegetables turned out to have a good texture and flavor, too. My family thought this dish was pretty good, though nothing spectacular. It is very simple and quick to prepare, and I like being able to use frozen chicken breasts straight from the freezer.

Very flexible recipe!  I was out of jar gravy, so I popped an envelope of the powdered stuff, with a cup of cold water, in the bottom of my slow cooker and wisked it together with soy sauce and seasoning.  Everything else was to the recipe.  My slow cooker is calibrated a little high, so it took only 2.5 hours on high.  There are so many ways you could dress this simple recipe up - Mushrooms, sauted onions and peppers, lemon zest with garlic, etc...

Although this was very easy to throw together, I did not feel that it was too spectacular.  I served this with egg noodles and broccoli and the picky eaters liked it but I felt like it needed "more".  Overall, good basic simple recipe that I didn't have to do any special ingredient shopping for.

I thought the taste of this was only worth 3 stars but I have to give it 4 because of how easy & quick it was. I do have to say that the chicken was extremely tender. I'll definitely make this again only next time I will play with more spices.

This was great. I had to alter it some since I didn't have everything I needed--I only had a 10oz jar of turkey gravy and no paprika or herb seasoning. So I added a can of cream of onion soup, 2 tsp soy sauce instead of 1 tsp, and a teaspoon or so each of garlic powder & chili powder and sprinkles of thyme and rosemary. Paired it with some "instant" mushroom rice and it turned out wonderfully.

This is a tasty, easy meal I love to make when I know I'm going to be out all day and not able to cook! It reminds me of Thanksgiving. :) I like to serve it with mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.

excellent- so easy- I made this as is- no modifications- to freeze for later, but ended up just eating a little of the chicken & gravy before I shredded it as my dinner. So good! Will make again- can't wait to see what my husband says about it.

For a really easy meal this was great. I added 2 packets of  brown gravy mix with 1 and 1/2 cups of water and doubled the spices i also added mushrooms, carrots, and onions. Was delicious!

I would give this b/n 3.5 to 4.0 stars. I read many reviews. I added 4 red potatoes as someone suggested and adjusted the spices. I added extra spices and an extra jar of gravy. It tasted better the next day. I am on the fence if I will make it again.

This was quick, but not very tasty. I followed the directions exactly as far as ingredients. I used the Heinz Home-Style gravey and while it did get thin, it was easy enough to remove the chicken, and toss in some noodles to cook in the "broth". I may use this again, but I will be adding other ingredients. Might be worth taking a few minutes to read what others have done to make-over this dish!

This was wonderful! Hubby loves gravy so this was perfect for his tastes. I added 1 tsp Mrs Dash salt free garlic/herb seasoning mix & 1/2 tsp worch sauce. The gravy was a little thin so I thickened it with 1 tsp cornstarch. Gravy is great over mashed potatoes. Cooked on low 6 hrs & it was so tender it was falling apart! Great for a weekend dinner.

Very good and easy to prepare.  Used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  Next time I will either use breasts or reduce the cook time slightly as they were a tad bit dry.

This was very moist and delicious. Not to mention super easy. Just throw frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with a few ingredients and a very good dinner will be awaiting you. Serve with rice or mashed potatoes.

This is a winner.  I doubled the recipe and used chicken gravy, Ms Dash, pepper and some extra soy sauce.  This blend gave the dish a nice change of flavor from a cream soup based meal.  Goes nice over egg noodles.  I will be making this again.

This one is hard to rate.  It was so easy.  I just didn't like the taste at all.  However my family LOVED it.  I would have given it maybe two stars and they would have given it five.  I did cut the chicken into small pieces before I put it in the crock pot.

This was eh.  I put carrots and onions in the bottom of the crock under the chicken.  Added the seasoning, gravy, and soy sauce.  I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. The chicken came out tender and moist, but the gravy was really watery and we felt like it was just missing something.  Maybe if I'd served it over mashed potatoes or something...we will eat the leftovers but I won't make this again.

Easy enough and the chicken was quite moist but as others have said not much flavor. My husband really liked it though. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn. He said it reminded him of Thanksgiving. I would definately make it again since he liked it so much and also cuz it was so easy to throw together.

I doubled the gravy part, used 2 dry packages of gravy and doubled the water.  It was very tasty.  My husband said that this would make the absolute best Chicken Tortilla soup.  I have to agree and have re-labeled it as such in my cookbook.  We took leftover chicken meat the next day and threw it in the leftover "gravy" with some tortillas and had a great soup!  Thanks.  The actual chickent was good, too.  Very moist.  But I'm keeping this filed with the soups.

This is a good recipe but I omit the jarred gravy and add potatoes. When about 1/2 hour from being done I open a can of biscuits and place on top. They come out tasting like dumplings.

i took this recipe as a good starting point and tweaked it.  I used two chicken breasts...one can/jar of chicken gravy...about 1/4 cup of kethcup (add or take away depending on how much you like ketchup) two heaping teaspoons of Dijon mustard and a teaspoon of sugar (any kind work...splenda...white sugar...brown sugar) and it was FANTASTIC.  I searved it over instant mashed and it was a hit...will definetly make again.

I thought it was OK, but if I make it again, I'll try using Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the canned mushroom gravy.  I quartered 4 red potatoes and had those in the bottom of the crock, so maybe that's why the flavor just wasn't there in the chicken.  Also, I cooked on low heat with frozen breasts and it was done in 4-5 hours, max.

The only thing I changed about this recipe as listed was to use mushroom gravy instead of turkey (because I'm not a big turkey fan, but my boyfriend loves mushrooms on anything) and it was fantastic! Very flavorful, great as leftovers, and SO easy! Thanks so much!

Great! Another recipe off this great site my family ate! This was so easy and delicious! I used pork gravey, it was less calories and served it over whole wheat no yolk noodles. I think next time I will use another jar of gravey just for more gravey! Thanks for the easy recipe!

This meal is great!  It tastes just like Thanksgiving dinner.  I've made it twice so far and served it over rice and mashed potatoes.  Great either way!

This was fantastic! Super easy, inexpensive, and healthy. My husband loved this, and we both had two plates! I served it over an herbed rice that I made, and it was delightful. We will definitely make this again!

We loved this recipe.  I had homemade leftover chicken gravy which I used, forgetting that it was a little salty and used seasoning salt in the recipe.  My fault entirely so will try it again very soon with low-sodium seasonings.  I used 4-oz. breasts & cooked on high in slow cooker for 3 hours and it was perfect.  Makes great hot chicken sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

This meal was absolutely wonderful!!! As per many other reviewers, my husband is not a chicken lover either. . .(what's up with that???) Anyway, about once a month we do "breakfast for dinner" and I decided to try this out.  I cooked chicken on medium for 6 1/2 hours. Used Heinz Chicken Gravy (2 jars) and served over hash brown potatoes with diced onions.  I did add salt and pepper, but otherwise cooked chicken exactly as per recipe.  Served with fried eggs, over-medium. The runny yolk just added an incredible flavor to the chicken and gravy and hash browns. Also served with frozen biscuits to "sop" up all the wonderful gravy!!  YUM!!! Oh. . .and by the way. . .my hubby had seconds and would have had thirds had there been any left!!  Definitely a keeper from this Southern Girl!! and the best part is the crock pot did most all the work!

My family LOVES this recipe. I use 2 cans of gravy if we are having potatoes. I have been making this for a few years now and I always get compliments, even from company. LOVE IT! I use frozen chicken and on high it only takes my crockpot about 3 hours to cook, but my crock seems to cook faster than most recipes call for.

So simple.  My fussy husband even liked it.  I did not use soy sauce, didn't have any.  Should have.  I added carrots at the beginning  and peas at the last minute.  Served over rice.  Will do this one again.

Used beef gravy and added some additional seasonings.   This was a huge hit in our house.  Our 3 and 5 year olds both loved it.  All said 'definitely need to make this again'.

i liked this recipe. it was easy to make and very comforting. i would probably not make this when company comes around but it's perfect for a lazy day meal with just the hubby and me. i didn't do much to tweak it except i didn't have enough gravy so i added a little corn starch and chicken broth mix. served it over mashed potatoes.

Edible but bland. It was good to learn that chicken could be cooked this way in the slow cooker (I'm figuring out how to use mine), but I won't make it again.

We did not like this at all. The chicken was very dry. I cooked for a little over 6 hours. Next time I will try to cook less or even start with frozen chicken breats.

Very good.  I used 2 packages of chicken gravy & 2 cups water.  I added whole baby carrots to the bottom.  Everything was very tender.  This will become one of may staple meals.  Thanks.

This was THE BEST chicken!  It was so tender and flavorful!  When I told my husband what was for dinner, he wasn't too enthused...he's not a big chicken person.  But, when he tried it, he ate 2 helpings and told me to save this so I can make it again.  Easy and VERY economical!  I served egg noodles and a salad with it and the meal was just wonderful.

What a wonderful autumn meal!  So E-Z.  I could not find any fault with the original recipe.  I used a 12oz jar of turkey gravy and 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  The extra insertions I put in just as recommended.  I served it with boxed stuffing, mashed potatoes and green beans and lovely rolls.  There was lotza gravy and plenty leftover for tomorrow's lunch.  This is a definite keeper.

Yummy!!!!!!  I had a busy Saturday, so it was nice to know that this would be waiting in the cooker when I got home. The whole house smelled delicious when we came in from an autumn day out! I used dry gravy mix with 1 cup of water, and added a can of mushroom pieces.  The chicken came out tender and flavorful. I served it over rice---a real stick-to-your-ribs meal!!

I thought this was a great recipe, I did add, one can of cream of mushroom soup, and other seasonings. I cooked on high heat in slow cooker for 3hrs, and on low for 1hr. The chicken fell apart, and was very moist.  My children loved it.

My family loved this recipe; and they all usually like different things.  The only thing I changed was I added some cornstarch to thicken it along with some salt and pepper.  This will be added to our rotation!!  Thanks! :)

Husband loved this.  Said it reminded him exactly of "Turkey in a Bowl." Something I guess that was really good from the high school cafeteria. ??!?!  It was easy and pretty good.  We served it over mashed potatos.

When I made this the other day, I doubled the recipe except for the chicken. Then I doubled the paprika, soy sauce, and used poultry seasoning for the herb seasoning blend (which I also doubled). I added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. minced garlic with the spices. I used 1-12 oz jar turkey gravy and 2-10.5 oz cans of turkey gravy. I added 32 oz baby carrots to the bottom of the slow cooker stirring after about 1 1/2 hours. With 1 1/2 hours to go, I added 8 ounces of frozen cauliflower and 2 large yellow squash, sliced; then I added the reserved jar of gravy. Cooked for about 4 hours on high. Unfortunately, the carrots weren't quite as done as I would prefer, but they were edible. Also cut up the semi-frozen chicken before putting in slow cooker, and didn't shred them after they were done cooking. Served with rice and Double Quick Dinner Rolls from this site. Everyone loved it and there was plenty of gravy/sauce for both the rice and the rolls. I made this b/c I just happened to have all the ingredients in the house, and so I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I might make this again, I'm not sure but it was delicious. Thanks for posting this simple and surprisingly good recipe.

This one's a "keeper" at our house! I made a few changes...I used Heinz Classic Chicken Gravy instead of turkey gravy and used 1 teaspoon of Mrs.Dash garlic/herb seasoning. Awsome served with mashed potato. My picky 11 year old said she would definitely eat this again sometime.  Thanks.

I'd actually give this recipe 3 1/2 stars, but because my family liked it so much I'll give it 4. I cut up partially frozen chicken tenders into bite sized pieces before adding to the crock pot. Adding a second jar of gravy is a must! My little family of two adults and 3 very small children barely had enough from 2 jars. I added a little cumin, poultry seasoning and garlic powder to make up for the lack of flavor that so many reviewers complained about. I served it over rice but next time I will do boiled and quartered red potatoes- goes much better. It was a good meal, nice and quick- nothing fancy. I will definitely make this again because of the ease and simplicity.

the hubby and kids loved it...i thought it was "missing" something.  I like the idea with potatos and carrots.  Will try that next time and see if I can give it a 4

This was so yummy!  I added 2 jars of gravy and doubled the spices.  Also added salt because it needed a little more flavor.  Husband and all 3 kids loved it and ate all that was on their plates!!! Will definitely add to our meal rotation.

there's so many possibilities with this recipe!  i followed the recipe, but warmed a bag of frozen veggies and added that at the end of the cook time.  i did find that the one jar of gravy was absorbed into the chicken and 2 jars would be better.  also, i added salt to my individual portion, but that's a per person preference.

SO great! I modified a bit. I used 6 thighs, 2 cans of 10oz gravy, and doubled the spices. It had a good strong kick to it... over potatoes... couldn't get closed to comfort food in my opinion!

EASY and delicious.  My husband and I loved this.  If you have leftover homemade gravy that makes it even better!

Mmmmm....I added a little white pepper and some Worchestershire sauce to crock pot when the rest of the spices were going in.  I also shredded the chicken over rice.  We loved this!  Thanks :0)

I made this for dinner recently and both my husband and I agree that it is not something we want for dinner again.  The dish had no flavour.  We both ended up adding various seasonings to our portions to make it taste like something.  My daughter seemed to think it was all right, but I doubt that she will ever miss the dish if it never gets prepared again.

This was so simple and delicious!  I have made it twice, once using turkey gravy and once using chicken gravy.  Both times it tasted great!

This is a very easy dish to make, and it tastes pretty good. My family loved it. Personally I thought there was just a touch of something missing... but still good.

I don't know what happened. I followed this recipe exactly and I thought it was nothing to write home about. Maybe I didn't use the right seasoning. I used Mrs. Dash original. Just thought this was "blah" tasting.
