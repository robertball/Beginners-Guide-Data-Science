cake looks really nice when finished.
I found the actual cake was WAY TOO dry.
I think next time i make this delicious looking valentine cake i will be using a different cake recipe.

I love this recipe. You and your honey can sit down to a great piece cake, a tall glass of milk, and a nice movie. Make you feel warm and comfy.
