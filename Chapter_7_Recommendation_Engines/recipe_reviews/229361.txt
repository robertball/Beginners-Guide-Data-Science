This recipe is perfect!!!I see other reviews say to cut out the nutmeg and cloves. Don't!!!!That's what makes it unique and good. Try it as is. Everyone I make it for, loves it. The only thing that I think may be a typo, is use 1/4 c. FRESH parsley, not dried. Also I cut this recipe in half and it's enough sauce for 1 package noodles.

I thought it was great!! I have tried a lot of stroganoff recipes and I think I like this one best. I did omit the nutmeg and clove only because I don't prefer those spices.  I did add some sliced mushrooms because I love mushrooms.  It turned out fantastic and the whole family loved it.  Next time I think I will use beef broth rather than water.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe :)

I loved this recipe, the flavor of the sauce was amazing, I used slice filet instead of ground beef and served it with a crusty garlic bread!

Too much of a very bland gooey sauce.  The flour/water AND the soup should have been a tip-off but I tried it anyways.  I'm sorry, this is cafeteria food of the 70's, not for a discriminating palate.

I didn't cook it exactly as written but the ingredients were exactly the same (I cooked the onions first, then added in the ground beef, then stirred in the flour, then the water, nutmeg, cloves.  Then I added the family size can of cream of mushroom and cooked for a while, then whisked in the sour cream, mustard salt and pepper).  Perfect dinner tonight and will follow this recipe again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I did have to alter slightly only out of necessity and use a can of cream of  mushroom instead of two golden mushroom acai only had one can....still great.  It almost reminds me of Swedish meatballs from the nutmeg and cloves.  I used the same quantity of black pepper and it gave it a nice little kick, not too much as my toddler still ate it with a mmmmmm.  Oh and I  added a little garlic powder when adding the salt and pepper only because I add garlic something to almost every dinner I make. Definitely try this if you like stroganoff and Swedish meatballs as its a nice blend of both.

This was an ok version of stroganoff.  I put in half of the cloves and nutmeg and I used regular instead of golden cream of mushroom and beef broth instead of water.  If I were to make this again I would leave out the nutmeg and cloves, use golden cream of mushroom soup (to see how much difference it makes) and maybe about 12 oz. of the sour cream.

Like others I made a few slight modifications. I omitted the nutmeg and cloves and added 1 tsp thyme with the onion. Instead of using flour I used cornstarch (mixed with water) and withheld it until it simmered for about 15 minutes (because I used some fresh mushrooms they needed to cook some). I added 1 tsp cooking sherry to the sour cream mixture.

Pretty good stuff, if I made it again I will probably use half as much dry mustard as I did use. It had an overwhelming flavor, which was good, but still not what I was after. Thanks for the recipe!

I was so excited to make this recipe it looked absolutely delicious but I think the nutmeg and cloves ruined the recipe and it tastes nothing like stroganoff :(

My family loves this!  Don’t skip the nutmeg and clove.  If you’re worried add half the amt listed and taste it.  So good.  I used cubed stew meat and slow cooked it in beef broth in a 325 oven until it was fork tender...  I didn’t have ground beef on hand and I prefer it this way anyway.  Other than that I followed the rest of this recipe.  Delish!

Followed the recipe with two exceptions: I used stew meat instead of ground beef and I cooked it all in a slow cooker for 7 1/2 hours on low and then another 1/2 hour after adding the sour cream mixture. It was outstanding! I increased the amounts to fill a large slow cooker and ended up serving 12 people with leftovers to spare. I got rave reviews from everyone.

My family loved this recipe. I had a craving for beef stroganoff and this hit the spot. I did make a few changes based on what I had available though. For example, my package of noodles was only 12 ounces and that worked perfectly. I had no dry mustard so used two tablespoons of Grey Poupon and I only had enough dried parsley for 1-1/2 tablespoons. I also used 8 ounces of sour cream as the beef was already looking soupy with the 2 cups of water and 2 cans of mushroom soup. I actually ended up draining a bit of the mixture before adding the sour cream and it came out perfectly. The clove and nutmeg added a sweet taste which wasn't overbearing at all. Definitely use less sour cream and perhaps 1-1/2 cans of mushroom soup or less water as the original recipe will leave with you beef stroganoff soup. I will absolutely be making this again.

I didn't put quite enough onion in and a bit too much nutmeg- be careful with the nutmeg! Don't cut it out but be cautious. Despite these shortcomings, which were more my problem than the recipe, it came out well! Fun and I'll probably do it again!

Warning! This should read salt and pepper to taste, not the prescribed amount. 1 and 1/4 tsp. for 5 servings was way too much.

We love this recipe, have made it many times.  I don't usually have seasoned salt in the house, so I omit that part and really don't notice it.  I have pulled back a little on the cloves and nutmeg- delish!

This was a wonderful dinner! We had ours with some brown rice and used stew meat, and the whole family loved it. My husband is NOT a strognaff fan at all and he even loved it said it was by far the best he has ever had! Thanks for sharing! I did add some garlic powder to mine I did not measure how much just threw some in!

I loved this recipe when I omitted the cloves and nutmeg.  Our family is not a big fan of cloves.  I also cut the sour cream down to 8 oz.  It didn't make a difference in my opinion and made the recipe slightly lower in calories.  I also cooked half a zucchini with the onion before adding the beef.  I like to hide vegetables in my food, so my little one gets a little more in his diet.

yummy!  i was pretty free-flowing with the spices.  Also, I added a handful of sliced mushrooms and added when I added the onions.

This was a great recipe, lots of flavor and the sauce was very good. My husband and kids all loved it. I had to skip the mushrooms in the recipe because of the kids, but next time I will try it with the mushrooms. This recipe is definitely going to be a regular use recipe for me.

I will give this dish a five star rating the next time when I leave out the cloves. Not the spice I would add to this dish.

I also thought this was great! I deleted the nutmeg and cloves. I used beef broth instead of water and used only one can of golden mushroom soup. I added another 1/2 lb. beef and 1 large can sliced mushrooms.

This recipe was very tasty! Next time I will cut out the Nugmeg and Clove-it gave an odd flavor to the sauce and was a bit overpowering. I also found the 2t of pepper to be way to much and it made the sauce unnecessarily spicy.
