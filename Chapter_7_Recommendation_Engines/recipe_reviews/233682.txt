Great, moist cake with delicate lemon flavor.  To please everyone I served this to I omitted the coconut.  Also, because sizes of lemons vary, I hope it's helpful to note I used  1-1/2 tablespoons each of lemon juice and zest and was quite happy with that. Oven temperatures and darkness/lightness of pans (which can affect baking time) vary too, so I'd recommend checking this at 50-55 minutes - mine was done in about 52 minutes!

OMG, this is so good! I made it exactly as written and wouldn’t make any adjustments.  The only downside of this delicious lemon coconut loaf is that it won’t last very long in this house, in fact it's almost gone and I just sliced into it.   Thanks for sharing Christina!

I used solid coconut oil instead of butter (just beat sugar with it as you do with butter.) The result was great, the coconut oil flavor wasn't strong so you won't really taste it, it was just as delicious and healthier too.

There were several good things about this recipe. The bread was very lemony (I used the zest of two lemons in the bread)and moist-but a bit too dense. I baked it in an 8" round pan because I knew I would love the glaze (which I made thicker and increased the quantity)and I wanted more surface room for it. In my opinion the glaze makes the bread. The coconut was barely discernible in flavor-some didn't realize it was there- but does change the texture. If anyone has an issue with this (or any other quick bread or cake) being DRY I suggest to check what kind of milk was used. Skim milk is much more likely to produce a dry, crumbly product. Milks with fat in them really improve the flavor and texture of baked goods. So little of the product is used that it doesn't make a huge difference in fat content. Also- as always...use fresh lemon juice because bottled lemon juice has mellowed way to much to have any great flavor. With all baking-the end results will only be as good as the ingredients used.

Very good! Changes I made based upon my pantry: 3 T bottled lemon juice to replace fresh lemon in the batter (measurements for drizzle were fine), and unsweetened fine macaroon coconut instead of flaked.

The result? A rich tasting, buttery pound cake. The balance of lemon, butter and coconut was wonderful. This was very easy to make and will be part of my 'go to' recipes for quick, tasty evening meal desserts whose leftovers pair well with morning coffee. Yum!

As soon as I read this recipe I knew I had to stop everything and go directly to my kitchen to bake it! Just finishing off my second delicious, scrumptious slice! I used quite a bit of the lemon zest to make it even more lemony! Quick and delicious! Good way to end a hot, Texas evening: ice tea and lemon cake!

GLUTEN FREE VERSION:  I made this GF.  I followed the ingredients substituting only GF all purpose flour (using white rice, potato starch and tapioca starch with 1/2 tsp xanthan gum).  I had to use almost three times the lemon juice for the glaze though.  I did change the directions to adapt to GF flours.  I allowed the flours and liquids to sit for 10 minutes (stirring occasionally) then added the baking powder, mixed well and then put it in the oven.  This soaking time helps the rice flours and starches to soften a bit to lend to a smoother texture.  In fact it wasn't grainy at all.  As you can see in the photo I made it in a 9" round cake pan so it baked for only 30 minutes.  I didn't have the right size loaf pan.  It worked wonderfully.  Great taste of the lemon with the coconut.  My daughter, who isn't gluten intolerant, loved it so much ate almost all of it asking me to make it again "exactly like this don't change a thing!".  There's a great rating for you!  Keep in the fridge for a longer lasting storage.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Lemon goodness!  My first time making lemon loaf...this was a great recipe.  Just a few suggestions:  Use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan to prevent the loaf from sticking (mine got stuck and the bottom didn't look so pretty when I got it out).  Microwave your lemons (about 30 seconds)...you'll get way more juice out of them!  Also I could do without the coconut.  Didn't really do much for the loaf.  Other than that...love this recipe!

Made this with 1:1 coconut oil instead of butter and it smelled so amazingly coconutty as it baked. This ended up being pretty easy and good. Next time, I might zest TWO lemons for the batter and use the juice of the 2nd lemon for the glaze and see if it's too lemony or not!

I've made this maybe 4 or 5 times so far and everyone loves it. Especially my mom. She loves to have something sweet in the mornings with her cup of coffee and every since I made this she is always asking me to make another one for her. I couldn't wait to see what the combination of lemon and coconut flavors would be like and I was not disappointed at all. Simple recipe and quick to make.I'll surprise her over the holidays and make a couple for her and my aunt to have in the early morning hours of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Also I followed the recipe as written.

Made as is and my family loved it!  I had baked these twice in a week.  One for us and the other were for my Aunts visiting from England.  I really liked the sweet and tart balance it brings.  The amount of coconut is perfect for the non-coconut lovers!

I made this twice today, once exactly as written by and again with some changes. As written I found it too sweet, and not enough to lemon and Coconut flavor (i used a large lemon). The second time i halved the sugar, and replaced ALL the butter with coconut Greek yogurt.. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract and 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract. I served it with a spread of cream cheese icing (iI ad left over) I enjoyed both ways, but really enjoyed the less sugar, and more pronounced flavors of my tweaks. Thanks for sharing..Will make again... Both ways. :)

The first time that I saw this recipe I just knew that I would love it and I wasn't wrong. I love lemon and coconut so the two together is a marriage made in heaven. It is so moist and flavourful!!! The directions are well written and easy to follow. I made this exactly as written, there are no changes needed because it's perfect. Thanks so much for the recipe Christina.

OMGoodness!  I need more stars!   The combination of lemon and coconut is so good!  Even Hubby, who is not a fan of lemon, really liked this.  The flavor was even better the next morning.  I loved the addition of the drizzle.  I'm e-mailing this to my friend as I know it will be a hit at her house too.  Thanks for sharing another winning recipe, Christina!

This was delishious! The only thing I did different was to add shredded coconut while the glaze was still soft. I will be making this again tomorrow because the one I made today is already gone!! Pure lemon heaven :)

I used muffin tins instead of bread tins.  The glaze is a must to drizzle on top before eating.  Everyone loved this recipe at my house!

I made this recipe exactly, only taking advice about measurement from a fellow reviewer about it being about 1.5 tbls equal parts lemon juice and lemon zest. 

It is amazingly moist and delicious! A good, strong lemon flavor just like I like, without anything artificial! 

I sent a picture of it to my husband at work and he can't wait to get home and try it. :)

I didn't make any changes and followed the instructions word by word and the loaf turned out to be very good. I didn't make the drizzle, the loaf itself was definitely sweet enoughI suggest tasting the loaf first before you make the drizzle.

Love this recipe. But I love lemon more. I added 1/2 cup of lemon juice and the zest from the lemons (3 small). Also doubled the coconut (sweetened) and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Nice loaf, not a cake.

This is a delicious loaf. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and the cake was soft and buttery. I did not make the lemon glaze, but made an icing of 1 1/4 c. icing sugar (confectioner's sugar), 1 tbsp melted butter, the juice of 1 lemon and about a tbsp of shredded coconut mixed with enough water to make a thick icing.

I did not add the coconut because of allergies, but it turned out great. I did make a lemon juice syrup that I added while the cake cooled, and it added an extra kick of lemon to the cake.

this is fantastic! made it with lemons first time   and next time made it with oranges! SUPER EASY TIP!!: forget zesting your fruit!!!!!! just pick out seeds, throw it all in a blender ( white pith, peel and all!!!) . after the initial pulverizing, I put buttermilk in the blender to really liquify it and get the last bits out!!!).   i didn't worry about exact measurements of the fruit swap_ i just figured one lemon or small orange per loaf and that turned out wonderfully  each time! Perhaps that is why i didn't find mine overwhelmingly sweet as some have complained? Also, mine turned out moist and delicious each time!  If you quadruple this recipe, it is enough to fit into a large 14x18" cake pan.  a double recipe is perfect for a 9x13" pan.  Also,   to combat the "lack of rise" that others complained of, I baked 20 minutes at 400 degrees ( like a muffin) and then 15 more minutes at 350. This was perfect for the huge cake pan!  I like to put  tiny chopped walnuts on top of batter before baking. Pecans would even be better, but walnuts are a bit cheaper where i live.  Also, for the orange version, I got 2 chocolate -orange flavored candy oranges ( you see them at christmas time in the stores) and smashed them in a ziplock bag with a hammer and made chips/chunks  of chocolate... right before baking i sprinkled the chocolate and the nuts all over the top, slightly pushing into the batter.  Beautiful presentation! The chocolate didn't melt much and get oozy, so really pretty  pre

Hi Christina, I made this very yummy lemon loaf and I must say it is delicious! I omitted the coconut, and added 1/2 cup sour cream, and a little less milk. The loaf came out light and fluffy. Thank you for this recipe.

I did not expect this bread to be so dense, and not very moist. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I was somewhat disappointed, although the flavor was good.  Probably will not make again.

Brought a loaf into work and was told by my some of my coworkers that it was as good as their mother used to make. That's a huge compliment. So easy to make!

This is so delicious! Made it without the glaze and tasted great. My teen-aged daughter said it tasted like lemon loaf cake from Starbucks and the coconut put it over the edge!

This is so good. My Mom who is not so easy to please when it comes to food said "This is the best cake I ever made" and I do bake quite a bit. Did not change a thing. From one Pennsylvania cook to another, thanks for the great recipe Christina.

I did 1/4 c applesauce, 1/4 c butter and added a little rum extract.  Other than that, I made as written.  Very good!

I tried this loaf recipe and it certainly is a YUMMY.  The only reason I gave this a 4 rating was because I was a bit disappointed that it didn't rise like the photos show.  Mine only rose to just over 2" and I did follow the directions using a 4x8 loaf pan.

I wonder if gluten-free all-purpose flour would work in this recipe.  I love anything that is lemon.  Recipe sounds great and I am rating it 5 even though I haven't tasted it.

I guess I’m in the minority, but I didn’t care for this at all. Even my son, who eats everything, wouldn’t finish his piece. It was heavy and dense like pound cake, and it wasn’t overly flavourful. The only modification I made was using almond milk instead of regular, but I always do this when baking and it’s never and issue, so I doubt that was the problem here.

SO GOOD! I made a few modifications: only cooked 52 minutes. Didn’t use any coconut. Also it is imperative that you line the bottom with parchment paper. My first tasted great but came out in chunks. I used the zest and juice from a whole lemon, so to avoid an overwhelming lemon flavor, I glazed with the following: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1tablespoon butter and enough 1/2 & 1/2 to equal 1/4 cup, and 1 tsp vanilla. Simmered on stove while stirring a few minutes, removed from heat and stirred while it cools. Poured over cooled cake and it hardened in about 15 minutes. Amazing.

This is a good flavored recipe, however my bread was not moist. 
I made this exactly to recipe for my children and a low carb for myself.  
The low carb version I substituted flour for almond flour, coconut oil for butter, erythritol for sugar, and 1 cup full fat sour cream for milk. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. It was perfect, not too sweet.

I don't understand the negative reviews because this bread is fantastic! It's flavorful and moist with a crispy crust. Moving forward, this will be my go-to for lemon bread!

I love lemon baked goods and have been in search of a good lemon quick bread recipe for a while. I found it!

I made this bread twice - one loaf as directed with 2 small changes: swapped regular milk for almond milk due to allergies and a bit more baking powder since some reviewers suggested it to help it rise more. The other loaf was GF following Buckwheat Queen's directions in their review, swapping out the milk again but no extra baking powder.

Verdict: we liked the GF one better than the regular one - quite a surprise from the folks in my house who aren't GF.

The GF loaf had a nice rise to it, great texture and flavor. I'd consider adding a little more lemon to the bread dough itself next time since a lot of the flavor is in the glaze.

Excellent recipe, whole family agrees it's a keeper!

One of my all-time favorite cakes to make! My family devour this cake every time I make it.:) The only change I made was to leave out the zest of the lemons. That was the only complaint my family had the first time I made it. Otherwise this recipe is an absolute winner in my household.

I didn't use sugar, instead I used organic maple syrup. For the frosting, I mixed some of the syrup with lemon juice and coconut and sprinkled on top. this recipe was delicious! I'm sure it would have tasted just as good of you use sugar. I'm just trying to go paleo.

This is a refreshing, lemony recipe that I would make again.  I cut the sugar in half by substituting NuNaturals MoreFiber Baking Blend (Stevia alternative to artificial sweeteners) for 1/2 cup of the sugar.  When blending the ingredients, I found the batter to be pretty sticky at times. The bread/cake has a good lemon flavor.  I did not add the glaze to reduce the sugar, but I'm sure it adds a nice, sweet punch.

Great recipe, but something is very wrong with the time. My accurate oven cooked it in 45 minutes.

I added juice from  1 1/2 lemons. Loaf was a little dry but the flavor was really very good.

Overall a good recipe...for glaze definately more then 2 teaspoons of lemon juice is needed - i did not even put as much sugar as showing in the recipe and used a juice of a half -medium sized lemon in order to be runny enough to glaze the cake . Will make it again ...the coconut is perfect balanced- just enough to taste the coconut and not overpowering the lemony taste :)

Not much lemon flavor to it so I added quite a bit more lemon juice, but that could just be me. Made these for my church and everyone loved them.

This was not as moist as I would've liked, it was just ok. I did omit the icing, was trying to be a bit healthier. I made as stated in recipe, no alters.

The flavour of this cake was lovely, but the amount of time it takes to bake in a loaf pan made it very dry. I "poked" it to try and moisten it up with the glaze but it did little to help. I would definitely recommend using a different type of pan to bake this cake to shorten the bake time and preserve the moisture.

I also made it with coconut oil n more lemon n zest n lemon extract.   I did not add the glaze as that just adds more sugar n we liked it the way it was.   Thanks so much for the recipe very refreshing on a warm day we had it with cool whip... oh yum : )  Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly!  It is soooo delicious!
I found that it didn't raise a whole lot, so next time I may try another 1/2 tsp of baking powder.
I will definitely be making this over and over.

Followed recipe as stated and came out dry. Not sure why as so many other reviewers rave of moistness. Very lemony flavor was great but not crazy about the texture with the coconut.

This was an ok recipe. Though I did find the coconut flavour to be overpowering so I'd suggest either less coconut or more lemon juice/zest. Also after a few pieces i felt a little sick. But this isn't a bad recipe, it's just not amazing either.

Loved the intense lemon flavour and moist texture. Coconut really a great complement to this simple, flavourful, easy to make loaf. Will definitely add this recipe to my recipe box.

Made this gluten free by replacing flour with 1 cup rice flour, 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. Start checking if baked by around 40minutes

Don't miss this recipe. If you enjoy the flavor of lemon and coconut, you will love this. I followed the recipe closely but used skim milk instead of whole milk. I usually do not buy whole milk anymore. The other thing I did was a bit of a mistake. I buttered my baking dish instead of using baking spray. The bottom of my loaf browned a little more than I would like. This is a wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe. Very moist and Just the right amount of tartness. I followed the recipe to a T.  However, I think next time I will substitute lime for the lemon.  Coconut &lime
 have an affinity for one another.

Judy I am also going to try it using gluten-free flour. Also rating it before I try it. Will let you know how I go.
