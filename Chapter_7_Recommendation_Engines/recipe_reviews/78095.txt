I really like this recipe. I use 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and at least 2 tablespoons of honey as well. Also, I've tried it with both Sprite and Dr. Pepper instead of beer and results are sooooo delicious!!! You should definitely try it with other carbonated drinks to see what you like best.

This recipe was easy to make. I increased the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon. I think if I made it again I would add more honey as well. 
I also decreased the butter to 1/8 cup. 
One thing I like about beer bread is that it is low fat! So I didn't want to ruin that with heaps of butter!

This was my first attempt at making beer bread without using a mix.  My daughter and I both liked it very much, would recommend it.  It did take longer to cook that the recipe said.

I have been making this recipe for a while now, and I just got around to writing a review.  It is a staple in our household, my husband eats a loaf in 1 day.  It is hearty and flavorful, great for people who really enjoy the taste of beer.  Thanks for the recipe!

This bread was easy to put together and looked beautiful.  Took about ten minutes longer to bake.  No one cared for it because of the strong bitter taste from the beer.(Used Sam Adams).

Like others have said, increase the brown sugar to at least 1 if not 2 tablespoons and the honey to 2 tablespoons as well... IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't use a "good" beer! Sam Adams was the worst bread I've ever had while Big Flats, Pabst, Bud Light etc were good. The nicer bottled beers (go for a CAN) actually don't taste as good, they overwhelm the bread. You really want just the carbonation and earthy beer flavor. Sounds counter intuitive but I've been making beer bread for a long time. Overall this is a great basic recipe for beer bread to play with.

I'm sorry. I'm always the one that feels bad for the bad ratings...also the one that ignores the lonely bad rating which mine likely will be, but this was AWFUL!  The beer made it very bitter (I used the Sam's Honey Porter that an earlier reviewer raved about).  Maybe a milder beer is in order.  Still I found it not sweet enough.  Beer breads I've tried in the past have had a more sweet "aftertaste".  I won't make this again.

YUM!  I followed the previous reviews and added a tablespoon of brown sugar instead of the tsp it called for - and I used quick oats because its what I had on hand.  It took quite a bit longer to cook than the recipe stated, but turned out great.

This bread is absolutly delicious.  It is not too sweet and not too bland.  The butter gives it a very rich taste.  I even used cheap beer and it turned out great.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!

VERY easy, and it turned out PERFECT.  With honey in it, I thought it would be a sweet bread, but it's not.  It was actually rather savory.  Next time I'll add more honey or make some honey butter to spread on the slices.

I ran my oats through the food processor before I used it for a finer consistancy. I used Pabst beer. I've learned that using a cheaper beer is really best for our family--we just like the flavor better. Besides, all I had was Pabst. Mine took fourty-five minutes to bake, I tented a piece of foil over the top so it wouldn't scorch on the top. This was good but mine turned out a little dry. I can't say that it was overbaking as I've made beer bread before. I think cutting back the flour or oats by a quarter cup or so and it would be just right. Everything else seemed spot on. GREAT with homemade chili.

Very moist & flavorful. But I'm giving it 4 stars because it fell apart while slicing!  The only change I made was to use 1 c. whole wheat flour & 1 c. unbleached bread flour, instead of 2 c. white flour. Will definitely bake this again.

This was pretty good, but it was missing something that I can't put my finger on.  It tasted good toasted with butter.  Maybe I'll add more sweetness next time. Thanks!

Fantastic. I've made lots of different beer breads but this is by far the best. FWIW I used a lite beer ("lite" = not worth drinking) and got a nice honey oat flavor in this one. Thanks!

My husband and I brew our own beer which I used instead of any store bought beer and it turned out great.  The beer I used had almost a new england brown taste and the nutty flavor really came through.  I might try a honey flavored beer or mead next time and cut the honey down or out completely. Definitely worth trying different beers with.

Meh...not great but not terrible. Not as good as other beer bread I've made. This had a funny aftertaste, and I don't think it was due to the beer b/c I've made other beer bread with the same type and no weird aftertaste. I think I'll just stick to the traditional beer bread.

This was easy and delicious, maybe too delicious  :)  I thought it was good as written, and I followed the directions as written.  I use a tea loaf pan, as that was what I had, and it took about 10 minutes longer to bake.  I would recommend letting the beer come to room temp before adding.  I see many comments about bitter taste, if you use a bitter beer-such as a porter, ale, IPA-you will get a bitter tasting bread.  Try using a larger, pilsener or fest-type beer.  I used schwarzbier (dark/black beer) by this would awesome with a Marzen or Octoberfest beer

Really wanted this to work but no such luck. Any beer other than a very light Budweiser or Coors (ugh) will give the bread a very strong bitter taste that no one liked. The butter melted on top strangely gave it a salty-tasting crust (what's up with that?)...we are finishing the loaf thanks to a LOT of honey, butter and jam to mask the bitterness. Deleting this on from the recipe box permanently. For those that do try it it takes 10 minutes longer than noted to cook.

This recipe turned out great! I used Pumpkinhead beer, so it had a very slightly sweet taste, and it seemed to compliment the sugar (which I added 3 Tbsp, and 2 Tbsp of honey, and 2 Tbsp of baking powder, because I like my bread puffy). The beer made the batter very light and fluffy, but the oats gave it a very nice texture. Great recipe.

I can't believe how much I liked this, especially considering how much I hate beer!  My only problem with it would have to be that it didn't slice very well.  Maybe I left it too long in the oven?

I thought this bread was great! Quick, easy and tasty. I followed the recipe as written and used a Smirnoff Ice "beer" (passion fruit flavor) that someone left at my house after a party. I think this added a nice flavor and a hint of sweetness.

I had never tried beer bread and I liked this at 1st. But after a few bites, the after taste caught up and I didn't care for it.  That's just me though.  It had great texture and went really well with creamed chicken and peas poured over top which I had a few days later.

Not bad, but a regular garden variety beer bread in my opinion.  The oats add a bit more substance than I'm used to, but I don't think there is anything unique to reccomend it.  I'd prefer some spices or maybe some more honey in this one.  Still, it's not bad with butter or honey.  Thanks for the recipe.

really easy to make, and I loved that I had all the ingredients! I also added more honey and sugar, but I'm not sure that made much of a difference. So I also served it with honey on top, which seems the best solution if you want something even remotely sweet. I've never made a beer bread, and I'm not even sure whether I've eaten one before, so I don't know what to compare it to. It had a great texture, with a soft inside and almost crispy crust. I also cooked it about 10 minutes longer.

I loved this recipe!  I did as others suggested: cooked about 10 minutes longer and used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  I used a light pilsner and think it would be better with a darker beer.  I also halved the butter on top to cut calories.  I still thought it came out moist and delicious!

I have had better beer breads before.  I was excited about the oats and the honey and brown sugar, thought it would be sweeter.  I see now that one should definitely add additional brown sugar and honey for more of a flavor.  And I used regular light beer, but still found it a little bitter.  Will use other beer bread recipies in the future.  Sorry!

Very good- I read some of the other reviews and increased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and replaced half of the AP flour with whole-wheat. I used Sam Adams Winter Ale and with the spices in the beer, it turned out great. Would be perfect with soup!

This bread is great.  I added a little extra brown sugar and honey, and used a sweet beer, and it is almost like cake!  I also baked it in a size smaller breadpan at 350 degrees for about  45 minutes, I think this makes a moister bread.

Giving this one three stars for now, am planning to try it again, because it's faster than most beer breads and I like the idea of adding honey and oat. My son (age 15) made this one tonight, and I was busy doing other things, so I PRESUME he followed the recipe correctly. We used Guinness (because I can't stand drinking the stuff) and the bread was very dense, and a bit dry. The kids thought it was just ok, but with butter and honey, it's pretty tasty. As I said, will try it again but with a lighter beer, one that I actually enjoy. Probably going to toast up the rest of this loaf to serve with soup or some kind of dip.

My children LOVE beer bread.  The advantage of this recipe over some other is that this has oatmeal in it...so its a little more healthier.  I have bought the packaged beer breads at various home parties before and they still are better than any of the non packaged recipes I have tried...but this is still good.

Very good. The oats give a very comforting taste, and the beer ads a warm flavor. I like that this contains ingredients I usually have on hand.

Nice quick bread, just have to be careful to use a maltier beer and stay away from the hoppier ones as they will make the bread bitter.

Will definitely make this again.  Used Bohemia beer from Dominican Republic cause that’s what’s available. Very generous with the honey and brown sugar (here it’s more like a molasses sugar). Put a pan of water in the oven with the bread while baking. Nice chewy texture with full-bodied taste to pair with our beef stew and broccoli salad. Easy recipe on a sailboat as no rising time required.

I love this recipe. Used boring bud for the beer and substituted molasses for the honey and brown sugar.  I also put a little of the melted butter right into the batter.  Definitely doesn't need a whole 1/4 cup melted butter on top.  Possibly a couple of tablespoons.  Great flavour!  Terrific with soup!

Too much butter over the top. . . had to bake another 10-15 mins to cook that down.  Had to scrape from baking pan.  I'll try one more time with adjustments before discarding.

Yummy!!  Used seltzer instead of beer.  Quick oats not rolled.  2 tbsp each of brown sugar and honey.  At 375 took about 40_45 minutes.  Great basic bread.   Will definitely make again.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a big hit. The only thing I alter is adding about 3 tbsp of brown sugar and 2+ tbsp of honey, I like the sweetness to be more distinct. The recipe works well with half wheat flour as well.

This is a really good bread.  I did up the brown sugar to 1T and doubled the honey, plus added some honey to the butter that goes on top.  Delish and great with chili.

I really like this recipe and so does my wife (who doesn't like beer).  It does take longer to cook that what it says.  I don't measure the honey but I'm sure I put more than the recipe calls for.  I put less butter with no real effect on flavor too otherwise I follow the recipe.  I have tried different beers, mild and strong flavored, and I have liked them all.

I have never made bread before because using yeast always seemed so difficult. This recipe is so quick and easy and delicious!  And it is great toasted!  I did increase the brown sugar and honey as other reviewers suggested.

I don't own a bread pan (I am not much of a baker) so I made muffins instead and they turned out great! I baked them for about 15 minutes at 375 and they were perfect. I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey, as others suggested. It was so incredibly easy and it only requires stuff that most non-bakers have on hand anyway, and it makes for a perfect base recipe that you can add onto. I will definitely be experimenting with this on a regular basis!

I love this recipe.  So fast and easy.  I've been using Guiness Extra Stout, gives it a nice rich flavour.  I also like to cook it a little longer than the recipe states to get a real crispy crust, but that could just be my oven.

I made this recipe tonight exactly as written with exception to my baking vessel.  I made muffins instead of a loaf.  I had to bake them for 45 minutes so I would imagine it would take at least that to fully cook a loaf as well.  Besides that, it was an excellent bread.  The taste was not too sweet, and not bitter at all.  My family all loved it and we have some picky eaters for sure.  I used a can of light beer from the grocery store and it was excellent.

I took into consideration the recommendations made by others for this recipe and it turned out great! I left it in for 10-15 minutes longer, and put in extra brown sugar. I also used Bud Light.

After 40 years of making beer bread I have found that the quality of the beer does make a difference. Using a beer like Budweiser or Bush is a better choice. Also don't use 'lite' beers. Using a strong full flavored beer will overpower the taste of the bread. I would increase the amount of brown sugar to 1 or 2 tablespoons

This came out very good, but I did cook it for an extra 10 minutes. I didn't add any extra brown sugar or honey because I didn't want sweet bread, but I think it could've used it. Next time I will add an extra tablespoon of both honey and brown sugar. Great right out of the oven!

Very good, except I would cook it longer. I used Sam Adams Summer Ale and it turned out very well. My parents who detest beer LOVED this bread! We ate it hot out of the oven with orange marmalade... I think I'll make a loaf tomorrow!!

I made this bread last night and I have to say this was very tasty.  I brought it to work today and it was gone very quickly.  We all just ate it plain, but I would like to try it with a slice of cheese melted on top.  Yummy!

Taste is good, but I agree with another reviewer - something was missing.  I served it with cabbage soup - good for sopping.
