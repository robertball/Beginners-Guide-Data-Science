Made as directed.  I am on Weight Watchers.  My family is not.  Took a 13 x 9 pan to a family gathering and this was the only casserole gone.  I would make this again but would cook the potatoes a little less (about 5 minutes instead of nine) and would season the potato layer before adding the frozen vegetables on top of them -- it seemed like the frozen veggies got all the flavor from the sauce and the potatoes were a little bland.  I would also add some additional spices to the sauce itself.  Maybe garlic powder?  Thanks for the recipe as it was good to find a casserole that didn't involve a heavy cheese or cream sauce.  Would make again!

My sister made this and it was WONDERFUL.  It tastes like it is full of cheese and ritz crackers and CALORIES, but it's not.  My whole family raved about it.

Quite delicious! A wonderful option to the usual dish of veggies. Will certainly make again.

This is a great dish!  My 4 children clamored for seconds. (How often does that happen with vegetables?)  My husband and I appreciate that it's pretty low in fat -- though you'd never guess it by the creamy richess of the sauce!  This is so easy and quick to throw together; I'm sure I'll make it often.

Our family enjoyed this.  I used a can of sliced potatoes rather than the red potatoes to save some time.  I also added a little mustard powder to the sauce.

My cupboards are always lacking and even skimping on the ingredients didn't make that much of a difference. Even my picky boyfriend loved it and asks for it all the time.

I added garlic powder for a little more flavor and boiled the potatos instead. Really good and works well on Weight Watchers!

This recipe was kind of bland, it would be better with some more flavor.

Good way to get everyone to eat veggies, but I had quite a bit leftover.  I was afraid it was going to be runny but it turned out about right.
