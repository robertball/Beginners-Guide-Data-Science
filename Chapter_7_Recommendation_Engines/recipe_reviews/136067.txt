Made these for a preschool class. Used strawberry jello & star cookie cutters. To dip the bottom of the 9x13 dish in warm water - I filled a shallow baking sheet (large enough to hold the 9x13) w/ water; then set the 9x13 dish in it. Came-out perfectly, a good ol' classic. :)

Great for snacking.  I didn't think I liked Jell-O, but I wanted to try this for a guilt-free snack.  I used sugar-free black cherry and peach.  I also poured it into candy molds.

So EASY!  I used fish shaped molds which I sprayed with non-stick cooking oil.  It only took an hour for them to set.  This makes for a great late-night snack.  They would really look cute sitting on top of a salad.  Thank you Jello for another great recipe!
