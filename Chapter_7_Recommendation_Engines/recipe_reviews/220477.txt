This soup is absolutely delicious!  You can use any vegetables you desire especially now (summer)with all of the fresh vegetables in season.

Great soup.  Substituted grean beans and peas for the okra and edamame just because that is what I had on hand.  I liked that this soup didn't have an overly acidic, tomato flavor. The corn gave it a nice sweetness.

I did make some substitutions.  It was delicious!  A nice way to use some veggies that I may not otherwise eat!

I had totally forgotten I had made this, much less reviewed it and made it again today for our New Year's lunch so I will update my review.  This time I used fresh celery, carrots, onions and a generous amount of garlic.  Mixed the tomato sauce with a quart of Aldi Vegetable Stock, then added frozen green beans, frozen corn, and frozen peas, followed by fresh russet potatoes and a can of Muir Glen diced fire-roasted tomatoes.   I meant to add kale but totally forgot.  Added some fresh ground pepper - no extra salt and no other spices, and it was totally scrumptious.  It was also beautiful.  My husband actually took pictures of it because it was so fresh and vibrant looking.  We both had big bowls with hot Peasant Bread from Whole Foods and had enough for at least 3 more meals.  Thanks for this fabulous recipe - a real keeper.

I did like it, but I added way more salt. As written I think it is pretty bland. I made it as written and after tasting added some dried oregano, fresh basil, and thyme, with extra extra black pepper. Like another reviewer, I liked the fact that is wasn't so tomatoey. I usually do not eat okra, but it was very enjoyable in this recipe. A good basic recipe waiting for added special touches.

I will use this recipe again. It's so easy to change (based on what you have on hand) and still make a tasty soup. You can use any combination of vegetables. I used carrots, celery, onions, potatoes, mushrooms, peppers and spinach. I added oregano, basil, rosemary, salt, white pepper and worcestershire sauce. Instead of tomato sauce, I used tomato paste and two cans of crushed tomatoes. Thanks for the inspiration.

I made this recipe but used green peas instead of okra and added crushed red pepper flakes, oregano, fresh rosemary, and a little basil in addition to the salt and pepper just because I had some spices on hand. It turned out great. I loved all the different colors, tastes, and textures from all the veggies. It is very healthy and filling!

Of course I made some edits...but the basic foundation of this was perfect! 

My husband couldn't find a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce so he grabbed a 20 ounce or something close to that...and actually, it was perfect...I think it made it a little thicker and richer.

I omitted the kale, okra and edamame- my hubs doesn't care for any of that but I am sure this would have worked great either way.

I also pan seared my potatoes for a few minutes in a teaspoon of oil, with some dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt & pepper...I feel like this locks in some more flavor.  I also threw in a bay leaf when the soup was cooking.

Lastly- I cooked this in my Instant Pot pressure cooker- for anyone else out there who has one, I just sauteed the onions, celery & garlic and seared the potatoes beforehand...then threw everything in the pot and used the manual button to set it for 15 minutes...then I allowed natural release for 6 minutes and released manually the rest.  It was absolutely perfect...the veggies were tender without being mushy and the soup tasted great!

My hubs doesn't like soup, let alone veggies and he LOVES this.

This soup is good!! I subsituted the carrots for pumpkin and used frozen mixed vegetables that included both the carrots and corn. Did not used the okra or edamame.

Love it!  I am on a very restricted diet, so couldn't use the corn and potato, but added zuccini, cabbage and baby spinach.  Also, used lots of herbs to spice it up.  It changes every time I make it, but it's always great!

This is a regular on my meal "schedule"... because it's clean and tastes great.  I substituted the baked potato for sweet potato, to make it a wee bit more nutritious. And the kale for spinach (just didn't have kale on hand). I love that it is sweet from the corn.  Yum-my.

I loved all the ingredients, but it was boring. I won't make it again. There are too many other easy basic soup recipes.

I have an MSG sensitivity so I can't eat the canned veggie soup and so I searched around and found this.  I use a broth that does not contain MSG.  I use Creole Seasoning to spice it up and keep the sodium content down.  It is fantastic!  In the winter I used a bag of frozen veggies and now I'll be using fresh vegetables from my garden.

I didn't have any edamame or kale so I just used green peas and spinach I had. This was quite flavorful and I think you could switch up other veg too.

I LOVED this soup! I am not really a "vegetarian" but used this recipe in my diet plan and loved it! The only difference was I used peas instead of okra and beef broth instead of vegetable broth. I found myself eating it about 3 times a week! YUM!

Much better than Campbell's  vegetarian vegetable. I got to control the amount of sodium in this one instead of ingesting 650mg, I added only 45mg and it was still tasty!

I have made this a bunch of times and it is a favorite now. So healthy and satisfying, and great to freeze and reheat. I add extra kale, skip the okra, and add cayenne to boost the flavor.

Our family loved this soup. My husband especially raved about it. Like most, I didn't have every ingredient but was able to substitute other ingredients easily. My only critical feedback would be that it took MUCH longer than ~15 minutes to cook the carrots & potatoes, but perhaps I used larger slices/chunks. We will make this recipe for many meals to come!

Followed the recipe and it was good but not super flavorful. I added some oregano and cumin to spice it up. Good starter recipe. Use any veggies that are on hand and it'll probably work! :)

This soup was excellent!! Because we love the flavor of onions, I used a whole onion and 3 large garlic bulbs instead of two. I did not have okra, kale or edamame, so I put frozen corn, peas and some left over green beans I had in the fridge along with the carrots that are used in the recipe. I used an 8 oz  can of tomato sauce and added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes as well. It was awesome and will definitely make it again!!!

BEST. VEGETABLE. SOUP. EVER!!!!! If I could give this 7 Stars, I would. The great thing about this soup is that it is a simple base just waiting for your creativity. It’s such a forgiving recipe. Literally throw any veggies you have in it. Add your favorite seasonings and spices, just watch the ones that contain salt. I add thyme, “cajun matriarch physical assault” seasoning and a Mexican saizon seasoning packet instead of salt. Frozen Italian blend veggies were created for this recipe. Trust me!

I thought it was better when a little bit of ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, white wine, cumin rosemary, thyme, and Ro-tel tomatoes was added.  After I added the additional ingredients it was great.

This recipe turned out great. My daughter-in-law is pescatarian so I used the vegetable broth suggested as a substitute for the chicken broth. I did have to substitute a can of chopped tomatoes & a small can of tomato paste for the tomato sauce because I was out of tomato sauce. The only thing I might do differently next time is increase my cooking times slightly. The carrots were slightly more crunchy than I like for soup, but it was still very good overall. I served with garlic bread.

Fantastic recipe! I substituted fresh green beans for the okra and added a couple dashes of red pepper flakes to give it a kick. Everyone loved it and I'll be making it again.

I made it for my church lenten Soup and... dinner.  This was a big hit.  I did make changes because I knew that some could not eat the Kale so I omitted it.  I'm going to use this soup every night of the series along with others from this site.

I really love this recipe, but I only rated it four because it needs a few things to give it some real flavor. I made this to feed eight people, so I added 2 extra cups of water plus another 4 cups of vegetable broth/stock to bring the total to 10 cups (I kept the same amount of tomato sauce).
I feel that even though this recipe says 10 servings, it would only feed about 4 people with one bowl each with 4 cups of broth. 
Also, I would recommend like other reviewers have said, some seasoning. I added a touch of crushed red pepper, white pepper, salt, oregano, rosemary, thyme, turmeric, and a couple bay leaves. This adds some really smooth flavor to the broth which would otherwise just be the flavor that comes out of the box with a little bit of salt to it. 
This recipe is great because you can easily double or triple it and add as many different kinds of vegetables as you want. It can easily feed a crowd or be a small, intimate meal. It's also incredibly easy to throw together, but definitely needs help on the seasoning side!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I did not like the vegetable combo at all. Also it's quite bland. I'll stick to my own vegetarian vegetable soup recipe. I tried this one because the okra, kale, and edamame seemed interesting but I didn't care for it once I tried it.

UPDATED REVIEW: Gave it another try and loved it. Don't know what I did wrong the first time but I've made it twice since and it tasted wonderful.

An excellent base recipe! I tweaked it quite a bit, but it definitely helped me get started. Delicious, and I wish I hadn't halved it! 
I sauteed in broth instead of oil.
Used what I had on hand (peas, green beans, mushrooms) instead of some of the items called for (edamame, kale, okra).
Added marjoram, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. The spices are key, if you find the base recipe bland, which I know I would have.

Really great base soup recipe. I changed loads so this 5 Star review is mainly for ease of adaptability. I used cabbage, fresh green beans, celery, carrots, potatoes, corn, & fresh spinach as the veg. I also used a can of peeled tomatoes (smashed up) with a 1/2 cup passata instead of tomato sauce & added a bit of Worcestershire sauce and a splash of red wine for richness. I was excited to eat this again and again. 10/10 would make this again! Very happy bellies!

GREAT basic veggie soup recipe.  Changed it just a bit for a little more flavour.  Used fire- roasted crushed tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce... added tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  Peas instead of Okra.  LOVe how many veggies are in here.

don't know how and why, but this soup ALWAYS turns out great and flavorful even without adding salt! I always use this recipe as a base, and just change ingredients up depending on whats in my fridge at the moment :) I do use a veggie cube  as well, added a half of coconut cream since i'm vegan, bunch of spices, nutritional yeast, bragg's aminos, cabbage, green beans, and freshly blended campari tomatoes instead of canned. At the end I added olives, lemon juice, paprika, cumin, chilli pepper, 2 tbs sugar, and a few squeezes of lemon. It turned out sooo good!

This is perfect vegetable soup.  What's great is many veggies can substituted if some aren't on hand.   I usually make as is, minus the okra, and sometimes I add pasta to make it minestrone!

Liked this recipe. I did change some of the veggies (took out okra, kale, edamame-added green beans, peas, and kidney beans). I also added more garlic and some paprika and ground celery seed.

This is a great base recipe for veggie soup. I didn't have all the suggested vegetables on hand, so I only used onion, carrot, potato, and celery (which was on the ingredient list, but not in the directions, so I just added with the carrot and potato). Probably due to the lack of veggies, it did seem to need more seasoning. Another reviewer mentioned she added smoked paprika, so I added a 1/4 teaspoon myself, and that seemed just right. I also added a can of kidney beans, which made it extra tasty and filling.

This soup is a monthly staple in our home!  The flavors are wonderful & blend so well together.  Sometimes I use whole okra, why not? :)  I add fresh tomatoes too, just to have some extra stuff in there.

This recipe is very bland, a teaspoon of black pepper is way too much. It was too hot to enjoy.  Okra was too slimy for me.  Just not a very tasty soup at all.

I love this soup!  I did make some changes; I added 6 cups of water (I like a thinner base), used kosher salt (which I believe is what the recipe intended), A LOT more fresh ground pepper, and used golden potatoes (skin on). NOTE: You should cook your carrots and potatoes prior to adding.  Great with  fresh baked bread =)

I made this soup this summer because I had an abundance of okra.  I was kinda sick of okra at that point so I froze all the soup.  I have finally gotten around to thawing it, and it is wonderful!  A burst of summer on a cold winter's day.  I followed the recipe as written, except substituted sweet potatoes for white potatoes for a little extra nutritional value.  I think you could play with the vegetables, using what's fresh/what you happen to have and you would still get a great result.

I throw in the edamame with the potatoes so it can soften a little more. This is a really good vegetable soup.

Used what I had on hand. Fresh celery, onions, garlic, carrots, a couple of tablespoons of commercial sofrito sauce, smoked paprika, bay, salt and pepper to taste. 2 cups vegetable stock and two cups water, 2 cups of tomato sauce,frozen okra, frozen kale, canned corn and a can of canellini beans (to replace the potatoes). It was hearty and filling and pretty tasty too.

This is a great soup.  I played with the vegetables and didn't use any potatoes.  I roasted two green peppers, which gave the soup a smoky flavor.  I also added fresh thyme and basil.  This is a very good soup.

This gets 5 stars for its health value and how quick and easy it is to make.  4 or 4.5 stars for taste - it's very yummy but not orgasmically delicious.  Still one of the best vegetables soups I've ever made.  I did what most of the other reviewers did - I improvised on ingredients to suit what I had on hand:
chick peas instead of edamame, 
mushrooms instead of okra, 
lots of kale (is the 2 leaves a misprint?), about 3 or 4 cups chopped,   copious amount of fresh herbs - basil, oregano, thyme and parsley, about a cup or more chopped and compressed, 
1 tsp of Aleppo pepper (Next time I'll heap it a bit), 
grated cheese (I used sharp cheddar) sprinkled in each bowl when served.

I read that herbs are full of phytonutrients that are particularly beneficial to us.  And it's a win-win - using large amounts of fresh herbs is delicious.  I also used purple potatoes for the same reason.  If you haven't tried Aleppo pepper yet I highly recommend you do. I use it in place of red pepper flakes in everything now.  It has a richer, sweeter, and milder taste. The soup was even better the next day.

this soup is low calorie and tasty.  It is bland so I added chopped fresh serano chili peppers when cooking the onions and it was super.

I love this soup.  I added sliced baby bell mushrooms, extra kale and also substituted the edamame and okra with peas and green beans.

Very tasty. You'd think there are spices in it, but there aren't. And so healthy.

This was excellent. The kale-okra-celery combination is what drew me to this recipe.  Don't substitute the okra if at all possible!

I made almost no changes -- I just added some baby lima beans (personal taste), and to give it an extra zing I threw in some Crystal hot sauce.

This is fantastic! I get a big thumbs up from my son as well. I didn't have edamame or kale but I added green beans. It's very easy to customize it to your preferences. I didn't have to add any salt at all.

Delicious! I used home canned tomatoes, broth made with water+McKay's chick seasoning, extra of all veggies, extra garlic, and Yukon gold potatoes. This is the best chili I have ever tasted. Thanks for the blessing of tasty, healthy food:-).
