I would NOT recommend this recipe!! I made sure to follow the directions exactly but it was a disaster. The "cake" was very thin and dry. The topping never set and it was a gooey, not very good tasting mess.

Cake was too dry and topping never firmed up even though I did put it in the fridge.

I thought this receipt was very good.  My filling wasn't setting either so I put the cake in the fridge for an hour and it set up beautiful.  I was then able to add the frosting with no gooey mess.

I added the egg PLUS 2 tsp of Coconut Oil as I made them for my 103yr old friend & her 83 yr old daughter.
