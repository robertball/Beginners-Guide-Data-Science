These were good however they tend to come undone when you cut them so I followed the instructions but before I cut them I wrapped each roll in plastic wrap and refrigerated for about 1/2 hour then cut into pieces and this seemed to work to keep them together

Delicious. Every time I prepare this one someone asks for the recipe. Its quick and easy and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand. I've used flavored cream cheese spread and this really adds flavor. If making for a potluck allow your pickles to drain on a paper towel for a few minutes before assembling. This keeps them from making your rolls soggy.

This is standard fare on Sunday afternoons when the Green Bay Packers are playing! We don't use tortillas...we just use the ham as the roll-up. My kids love these!

These are very tasty.  I dried the pickles off with a papertowel before rolling to get them to stick better.  I might try to sprinkle some ground red pepper on the cream cheese next time for some kick.

I make this also and have the same result when I bring it to get-togethers!  I make mine slightly differently.  I use Hormel dried beef (found near spam) instead of ham, jalapeno-flavored pickles instead of plain ones, and I mix in a can of drained chili's (found with taco kits) and shredded mild cheddar cheese in with the cream cheese before spreading it.

Since pickles are generally curved, I had a tough time getting everything to roll up OK and stay together (since the pickle is moist, it didn't want to stick to anything). Although I loved how they tasted, my guests didn't really go for them.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe the first time and they didn't all get eaten, so I 'upgraded' the next batch: I added Beau Monde spice, dried minced onion, and garlic salt to the cream cheese. I also used pastrami instead of ham. It helped to have a more pungent meat to complement the pickle. Be sure to blot pickles with paper towel beforehand, and when spreading cream cheese, extend all the way to the edges of the tortilla wrap so after slicing the roll will stay together.

4 stars for simplicity and popularity.  Although, we substituted salami for the ham for a little added flavor.  We also used reduced fat cream cheese.  The tortillas wrapped without tearing.  Ours were at room temperature which, i feel, helps to resist tearing when rolling.

I received a recipe similar to this from a friend.  We don't use the tortillas.  Also, I add a packet of dry ranch dressing to the cream cheese first.  We always dry off the pickles and ham with paper towels before using them.   This has been served at many bunco parties and showers!  Yum yum!!

Especially for those reducing their carb intake, but even if you're not, these are really tasty without the tortillas.  Great to pack in a zipper bag to take for a snack.  Without the tortilla and using the right sliced ham, these can be low fat and a great source of protein!

An old classic that I had forgotten about. Took to a party and they were all gone in no time. Made mine the night before so they would set up and stick together better but still had some that did not want to stick together, maybe I will use more creme cheese next time.

This was ok.  I made it as a cheaper version of a favorite that I normally make that is much better. I prefer taking a slice of honey ham, spreading cream cheese on it and then rolling it around a piece of pickled asparagus.  No need to slice just place on plate as it is sure to be finished.  :)

These were great! I have made lots of variations of the "tortilla roll up" and have done the pickle/cream cheese/beef rolls, so this was a nice blend, and easier to make. I did some with ham and some with turkey. I added a bit of ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese. Perfect!

I made these for Labor day. Everyone liked them. I used sliced dill pickles because that's what I had. I like the fact that it only uses four ingredients. I will make again.

Also make this without the tortillas.  I find they taste best with the Clauson pickles rather than the Vlasic.

These are so good...quick and easy to make...and everyone always asks for the recipe.  I always use smoked ham from the deli and good dill pickles.  The quality of ingredients really matter with these, so don't skimp.  *Update-  You can also use many other different types of "pickles" such as pickled asparagus, pickled peppers, etc.  Have fun and be creative.  You won't be disappointed.

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe many, many years ago.  I use the kosher dills which are sliced in quarters lengthwise. Even though the recipe photo shows they used this type, the recipe doesn't state it.  I always dry the pickles with a paper towel before using them, otherwise the moisture with the cream cheese gets messy.  (The recipe also neglects to state which flavor of pickle to use.)  Since the recipe doesn't specify which type of ham to use, I always use a good brand of sandwich ham because it is sliced thinly enough to make the rolling easy.

My Mother-in-Law introduced these to me. They are delicious. I love pickles. For a low-carb version leave out the tortilla and spread whipped cream cheese on a slice of (rectangular) ham, roll them up and pin with a toothpick.

Skip the carbs!!!  My family has been making these for decades and we NEVER use tortillas.  Simply spread your cream cheese on the ham and roll the pickle up in the middle.  No need to wash the poor pickle or dry it either. Also, cut each into several bite sized pieces and secure with toothpicks.. that also make them no mess to eat!

I have been making these for years, and they are always a hit! The only additions I make are I blend in 1 small drained jar of diced pimentos and 1 pkg ranch dip mix in with the cream cheese. The ranch really gives it a wow factor and the pimentos give it a beautiful color

This is an awesome twist to our 'frog eyes' that we make so very often! Never thought about wrapping them in tortillas, what a brilliant idea!!

I have never made these with the tortilla. I use either the ham or sometimes turkey to roll it up. They are a big hit. I plan to try them with the tortilla at our next gathering. I can't wait I know they will be delicious.

I decided to try this recipe because I don't usually use a tortilla with mine. It didn't really work; the tortilla (Mission brand flour tortilla, fresh, fajita size) cracked when I rolled it :( Maybe my rolls were too thick?

I've tried this recipe before at a potluck at work. They were a Hit with everyone. The only thing I did different was I didn't use tortillas, just the ham cream cheese and pickles. I would do this again soon, it was  budget friendly and easy to prepare.

We use the same recipe here too except instead of tortillas we use honey wheat bread. I'll have to try the tortillas myself. Thanks for the different option.

Don't be afraid to put a nice thick layer of cream cheese on the tortilla's.  I made them a bit skimpy and they didn't stick together as well.  Very easy to make and they disappeared quickly.

These are good, although I did make some changes.  Didn't have whole pickles or ham, so I used spears and turkey.  Very good.  I thought I put too much cream cheese on it, but bf liked them.  They were a bit hard to cut on the ends, but otherwise I didn't find them hard at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum.  My husband loved this.  It was a very unique lunch.  The only thing I changed was I used fat free sour cream and added a little bit of package ranch mix to punch up the flavor.  This will be a normal for lunch rotation!

I made these for a pig roast this summer and they got rave reviews once people were brave enough to try them. I now have to make them for tailgates and other get togethers with friends.  I also sometimes make them with out the ham and substituting Lebanon bologna for the tortilla.  They get great reviews as well.  I also have a friend that makes them with dried beef, cream cheese and pickles and she says they are always a hit.  I prefer the original recipe.  Definately a keeper!

It's really quite funny. Some of us are seasoned cooks (note: did not say chefs) and we spend a great deal of time perfecting recipes catered to our friends and/or family. Sometimes adding this, adding that, substituting one thing for another.etc...but then as complicated as things can become, every now and then we find a simple recipe w/ simple ingredients that makes us stop and think, "This is so simple and fantastic...why didn't I think of that?" This is that recipe.

These are good with oinion-instead of pickles too.  I roll and put tooth picks in and slice between tooth picks.  Have decorated tooth picks with things for the holiday ex. very small colored balls of red and green for Christmas

These are always a hit when I take them to a party, but instead of ham, I roll them up in thin sliced hard salami.  I also use Clausen pickles that I slice in spears otherwise they are too big.

Excellent- every age can eat them and enjoy! First appetizer that was gone.  Be sure to use regular cream cheese not soft whipped as they will not harden up enough for cutting.

We LOVE LOVE LOVE these and often use them as lunch option wraps instead of sandwiches!  We use garden vegetable cream cheese and Klaussen refrigerated garlic dill sandwich slices  in ours for easier rolling.  They stay in place without toothpicks or holders that way too.   And the flavor is INCREDIBLE.  Any ham (or probably any lunchmeat to your preference) will work.  SOOOO YUMMY!  I also always make these as appetizers for parties, and slice them into individual portions.  LOVE this recipe!  Thank you!

The tortillas I used cut badly, however, perhaps another brand might work better- I used Mission brand. I added to the cream cheese a half pack of ranch dressing mix, diced red pepper, shredded carrot and chopped green onion which was nice.  I found the pickle to be overwhelming and could not even taste the ham despite using 2 pieces on each tortilla.

We have been making these forever.. However we don't use the tortilla and we call them Meat Pickles.  I dry the ham on both sides, spread softened cream cheese, and then place a dried whole pickle in and roll it up then slice.  I have used big dills and pettie dills. When we do these we use up almost a whole gallon jar of pickles.  I have my kids make these up because they end up eating half of them before they get to a plate.  I have never taken any home from a gathering.

I skip the tortillas, use pickles with as much garlic as I can find, and toothpicks to hold them together and make them easier to grab.  The are almost everyone's favorite!

I make these all the time during the summer months - they are great snacks for out on the boat!  But as I try to do the "low carb" thing, I omit the tortillas completely.  Spread the cream cheese directly on the sliced ham, lay a quarter of a pickle on top, add a strip of cheese and even a slice of green, red or yellow pepper, and roll up.  The cream cheese acts as "glue" and they stick together pretty well ~ stack them in a zippered baggie and toss in the cooler!  (Be sure to remove the seed strip from the pickles and pat them completely dry, otherwise, you will end up with a bag full of goo at the bottom!!!!)

LOVE these. Can even make without the tortilla. Have made with ham, turkey or chicken and dill or sweet pickles. Can also add a lil something by using flavored cream cheese. SOOOO good!

Very awesome. Make sure you rinse and dry the pickles! I also used some extras to fill spaces where the round ends would make it looks funny. And then I just munched on all those pickle ends! Yum!

These were pretty good.  I used weat totillas rather than flour.  I thought it was a little difficult to spread cream cheese on the ham itself.  They did turn out good, but next time I will probably make them without the tortillas all together.

I loved these! Bought the ingredients planning to make these for a party, but when the party was canceled I made my self a couple and ate them as a sandwich instead of slicing them! I love this tortilla version better than the non tortilla versions. Used spreadable chive cream cheese and kosher dill spears. Can't think of anything to make them better. NUM. Must try salami next time.

Easy and good...used a paper towel to soak up some of the pickle juice before rolling it up in the tortilla, and used a little bit of ranch for dipping.  Thanks!

This had an interesting taste but didn't work out overall. First I tried making with whole pickles and there was too much "pickle" taste (overwhelming) and the tortilla didn't go around it enough to really stay rolled tight after I cut them up.  Then I tried to make with a pickle spear and the uneven shape made it impossible to cut into sections and stay together.  I wanted to make these for a potluck and ended up having to go buy cookies on my way there.  Disappointing to say the least.  For the people who are making these for their kids for lunch, I'm wondering if they aren't cutting them up into bite size pieces and that's why they are easy to make.  I could see how leaving them whole would be easy and tasty.  I followed the other’s suggestions of patting dry the ham and I still couldn’t get this to make attractive bit-size pieces.

I'm on a low-carb diet so instead of tortillas I use nori.  I soften the cream cheese and spread it on a layer of ham, place that carefully cream cheese-side-down onto one side of a sheet of nori.  It should cover all but maybe an inch or two of the sheet... then I spread cream cheese on the other side of the ham, and roll 2 pickles (one for each half) into it.  It is really a hit at parties, although with nori it can be difficult to get it to come out round unless you use one of those bamboo maki-rollers.

My three girls couldn't get enough of these! Easy to make and easy to pack for lunches or a snack on a long car ride.

So, this was what I planned on taking to a potluck at work and then at the last minute I discover that all the ham is gone.  So I cooked those really thin, thin packaged sandwich steaks and forged ahead with the rest of the recipe.

They were a hit!
