Excellent recipe!  My husband and I both LOVED it!  As usual, I did have to make a few changes.  Since I had no jarred applesauce,(I usually make my own), I quickly peeled, cored, and chunked 3 Granny Smiths and cooked them on low for l5 mins. with 3 Tab. white sugar & a dash of lemon juice (tender stage) and "smashed" them a little but did leave small chunks for extra flavor.  This made a perfect substitute!  My only canned peaches were sweetened with Splenda, and they worked fine.  I did cut each slice into 3rds(fits into the mouth better).  Could not locate 8 oz. can of pineapple chunks in my grocery store so used tidbits instead, and they worked fine.  I had a can of "lite" apple pie filling in my pantry (impulse buy) that needed to be used so I tossed that in.  The end result had a wonderful texture and taste!  Next time, I will probably add a can of pear halves, drained and chunked.    
This would make a beautiful presentation at a holiday meal because it is so colorful!  It does make a lot (almost filled up my 13x9 dish), but you can enjoy it in a variety of ways.  I warmed it and served it with teacakes as dessert, ate it as a side dish, and will serve it over pound cake slices with whipped topping for dessert tonight.  Also, it will be wonderful with vanilla ice cream.  A delicious and versatile dish!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent; however, my sister-in-law is a celiac and cannot have glutens which are found in the pie filling.  Simply use maraschino cherries.  Drain the cherries and add to the fruit, reserving the liquid.  Add 1 tablespoon corn starch to the drained liquid, mixing well and add to the fruit for thickening.

Yuck! This was like school cafeteria leftovers gone bad! The mix of canned fillings, applesauce, etc, then served warm just tasted terrible--like having warm jello or something. I cannot believe I tried this recipe. I served it to me, my hubby, and 2 not-so-picky nephews. Terrible. Sorry.

This is a GREAT potluck recipe to bring somewhere.  I took it to my Mom's Club (about 50 moms) and it was a big success.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I am not sure why anyone wouldn't like it.  It tastes exactly like a wonderful warm fruit pie without the crust.  It is also actually pretty healthy! (Well, there is some sugar due to the canned fruit). 

The only thing I added was canned pears because I thought it would make a nice addition the other fruits.

I really loved this recipe and would make again!  I think it would go great over pancakes!

If you are looking for a really unique recipe with great flavor try taking this to your next outing!

I tried this recipe for our church potluck and it was a hit!  I put it together at home and plugged in the crockpot and let it cook during the service...couldn't have been easier.  Next time I need to double the recipe so we don't run out.

This is a solid slowcooker recipe for potlucks or home that always tastes great. Easy, easy...just pour in whatever canned fruit you have on hand along with the applesauce and cherry filling and forget it!  Tastes like you slaved over it. (Just remember to drain the liquids or it will be a mess. I won't make THAT mistake again!)

Great Recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used fresh apples and cooked them until they were soft and I sprinkled the top of the crock pot with brown sugar and instant oatmeal, it made a nice topping. I brought this recipe to a pot luck and it was weird, I kept seeing people pointing at me.  Turns out they were trying to find out who brought the hot fruit salad because they wanted the recipe.

Wow, this is totally amazing and yet so simple. Never mind the first review! I made a few changes. I diced and boiled 2 lg. Granny Smith apples in 1-2 T fresh lemon juice and a tiny bit of water to keep from sticking instead of applesauce and I cut the sugar in about half. I mixed it all together the night b4 and put it in the fridge and then the next morning I heated it on the stove and simmered only 15 min. I served it for brunch w/ Cool Whip on top and my guests loved it!!! I will definately put this on my regular menu!!!!

I made this for a recipe exchange.  Everyone raved about it and took home leftovers.  I baked it instead of doing the crock pot. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a few pats of butter on the top like I do when I make a fruit pie.  Everyone sat around giving ideas of other ways to enjoy this wonderful recipe.  Some were: as a pie filling, with a cobbler crust, over ice cream, the list went on & on and the kitchen had a wonderful smell as it baked.  Oh I did not bake it 90 minutes only about 1 hr.

Delicious. Didn't follow the recipe to a tee. Used a can of apple pie filling in addition to the cherry filling, no other apple products, grapes, and pretty much any other canned fruit we had to use up. Also omitted the sugar because of all the pie filling. Everyone loved it!

I just love this recipe. It is by far one of our favorites. It is versatile on two fronts - how you serve it and what you put in it. It can be used as a topping for pancakes/waffles/french toast/oatmeal, as a side dish, or as a dessert served with ice cream. I like to slice pound cake, lightly butter both sides, cut into cubes and lightly toast in the oven. These can then be sprinkled like croutons on the warm fruit and ice cream. It's also versatile in what you include. I made it per the recipe the first time, adding pears as others suggest. Finding that mandarins aren't that flavorful, I subsequently used orange marmalade to impart a better orange flavor. I also cut back on the sugar when using the marmalade. I toss in additional frozen cherries when I have them. Whole berry cranberry sauce is a tasty addition as well. This is great anytime of the year, but seems extra yummy in the fall/winter. Thanks for an awesome (and easy) recipe!

This was a big hit at the baby shower I hosted yesterday.  Mama-to-be fell in love with it!  I cut the peach slices into smaller bite-size pieces, and it was perfect.  Many people asked for this recipe, and were so shocked to find out how easy it is to make!

I love this recipe! It is very "tweak-able". A little more of this, a little less of that.  It all works so beautifully! Depending on your favorite fruits!

Yummy. I thought it was a strange mixture of fruits, but had them all on hand, so decided to try it. I forgot the peaches and it was still delicious. Thank you for a great wintry day fruit recipe!

Even though, I'd call this hot fruit soup because it was so runny, (yes, I drained all the fruits) it was delicious and versatile. I served this as a side dish with Make Ahead Breakfast Casserole, also from this site. I'm sure it would be wonderful with a crisp topping or served over pound cake. Next time, I'll substitute fresh apple slices for the applesauce.

We thought that it was pretty good.  We left out the oranges just because of the thought of hot orange pieces was not very appetizing.  I also added a graham cracker & brown sugar crust on the bottom and crumbles on the top to give it more of a rounded texture and a little more of a cobbler flavor.  With the additions I will definetly make it again!
