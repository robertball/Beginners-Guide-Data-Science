I thought this was such an odd list of ingredients but YUM this sauce is so good.  I used 2 packages of Foster Farms party wings.  For the taco sauce I used La Victoria Red Taco Sauce and Kraft Catalina dressing instead of French Dressing because it was what I had on hand.  Since they are already fried in butter and oil I chose to only add 2 small pats of butter to the sauce instead of the large amount called for.  I think it would have been fine without any butter at all but thought I'd add a bit to add some richness.  I baked as directed and when I removed them from the oven I poured the remainder of the sauce over the wings instead of serving on the side.  They were gobbled up.

These wings are great especially if you want a tasty wing without a lot of spicy heat.

When reviewing this recipe my husband and I decided not to use as much butter as was stated for the sauce, and it was an very good decision. We used half of the recommended amount, about 1/4 cup. Other than that, this was a delicious recipe and we are adding it to our recipe box.

Wow! This recipe was so yummy. I loved them. If you are making more then a few wings, I would suggest double or triple this recipe, to make sure you have plenty of this yummy sauce!!

I doubled this recipe---it was very good.  Not just your average barbeque recipe.  The taco sauce and french dressing really spiced things up without making them "spicey."  My kids loved them but the flavor was complex enough that the adults loved them too.

I made these a few days ago and they were great!  I did as other reviewers suggested and cooked down the sauce a bit on the stovetop first.  Otherwise, a big hit, even with my 3-year-old.

I found this recipe last night and tried it a few hours later. They turned out AWSOME and they were very delicious. My Fiancee LOVED them and so did I. The sauce was an interesting combination of ingrediants but they work very well together. This is definately a recipe I will keep! Thanks!

I didn't have french salad dressing but I did have catalina dressing so I used that instead. I did not add the whole amount of salt, just a pinch. This turned out better than I thought it would. I had a large family-sized package of chicken drumsticks that I used instead of wings which meant I had to double the amount of sauce used as well as increase the baking time. All in all, we liked the flavor, my kids thought this was great. My husband and I thought it could use a little grill spice, maybe some Liquid Smoke or maybe make this a good grilling chicken recipe, so that the flavor from the barbeque would give the chicken what it needs instead of the liquid smoke.

The combination of these flavors complimented each other quite well. I only added dried basil..garlic.. and extra Texas Pete hot sauce. I also lightly dusted the wings in flour and deep fried them because we like them a little crunchy. The sauce clung to the wings very nicely like a sticky gaze. Would definitely make these again!

The sauce was really good on these, but the wings were too soggy for our taste. We like ours crispy, so we'll stick to the frying method.

This recipe was my first ever attempt at homemade wings. I basically doubled the sauce and used 2 family tray pack of wings. It seemed time consuming to cook them in oil and then in the oven but boy were they YUMMY! A family of 4, and there were no leftovers (much to everyone's dismay)

These are really great wings.  Did omit the hot pepper sauce and replaced the taco sauce with medium salsa.  They went over great at our Wednesday night church dinner!  Will definitely make
these again.

Awesome!  The kids loved these....even my 6 year old son who doesn't like anything spicy.  surprisingly I had all the ingredients, even the taco sauce, I even squeezed the last little bit of french dressing out of the bottle!  I used a lot of tabasco sauce, at least a tsp.  It still could have been hotter!  but I had to keep the 6 year old in mind.  I did make an additional batch of just barbequed wings to have with these hot wings, in case he didn't want the hot wings...(he enjoyed both)

I baked the wings in the oven first at 375 for 20 mins.  And only used about a tbsp. of margarine in the sauce,  it was still very tasty! 

This recipe is a keeper!  My oldest son, said it tasted like we had ordered it from a restaurant!   

I served it with rice and corn, yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

This sauce is great!  Since I did not want to stand at the stove and fry wings this is what I did. Covered a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and sprayed with cooking spray. I seasoned whole wings & then put them in the oven at at 375 for 45 min.  Brushed both sides of the wings heavily with the sauce and returned them to the oven for about 15 min. They were so good I made them  2 nights in a row.

Had to make a second sauce mixture. On the 2nd one, had to replace taco sauce with salsa because I was out of it. Served with cheese quesadillas and a simple taco salad. Like buffalo wings but sweeter with still some heat.

I really loved this sauce. I decided to try it on boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I poured all the sauce over the thighs and cooked them for 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes. I have to say, while the sauce was on the stove top I had doubts about the taste but it's delicious after baking. The only thing I thought I'd like to change was increasing the amount of hot sauce, but this depends solely on how spicy you like things.

These were allright. For all of the effort involved, they were average at best. Made 1.5 batch for a Super Bowl get-together my bf and I went to this past weekend. Everyone liked the wings, but they were expecting "hot" ones - lol!!! These were very sweet tasting, almost like BBQ wings. I didn't expect much spice given the list of ingredients, but I guess I wasn't expecting a BBQ flavor either.... I do not like that these were a HUGE mess to prepare - cutting the wings was tedious, there was grease EVERYWHERE (I suggest using a deep fat fryer if you have one). It took me FOREVER to clean the grease off my stove, wine glasses (my wine glass rack is near my stove), counter, etc. Being the neat freak that I am, I almost had a coronary!!!!! I followed Gloria's directions to a T except for forgetting to s&p before frying, so I sprinkled the wings after (before placing in the oven). Oh, and I used about 3/4 c. of sauce with the wings, but the rest was a waste. No one touched the additional sauce. I guess I should have made restaurant style chicken wings (also on this site). Sorry, this recipe won't be a repeat at my house.

These wings were absolutely restaurant quality.  I like my wings both hot and sweet so I added honey to this recipe.  Will be serving these during the playoffs and Super Bowl for sure.

Quick and easy to prepare plus uniquely delicious equals a real winner. I used less than half of the butter, turned out great.

This were wonderful fall off the bone good.  I did change the recipe by also adding 1/4 hot wing sauce, 2 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons hot mustard, 2 tablespoons of blackberry jam.  I also taco seasoning mix instead of taco sauce.  I baked on 350 for 30 minutes before turning over in the sauce and baking for an additional 30 minutes.  Best wings I've ever had.

I suspect I'll give these more stars when I try this again.  I was in a hurry and made a few mistakes.  The sauce had really good flavor.  They weren't spicy to us, but they probably would be to others, so just put the hot sauce bottle out with them so people can spice them up more if they want. Next time I will probably dredge them in flour along with the salt and pepper (I also used cayenne pepper along with black pepper).  I might even try to deep fry them and then just coat them in the sauce after.  I used honey french dressing (walmart brand), and Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce.  I will make more of the sauce next time as well and probably pour the extra over them after baking or all of the sauce after deep frying. This recipe is definitely worth trying!  Oh yea, I love butter, but I think you can decrease it, and it would be fine.

These ingredients don't seem like they would go together, but they do. We ate these up and no one in our house even likes French dressing but it tastes good in this sauce.  I don't like to make chicken wings so I just cut cup chicken breasts and made them the same way the instructions called for.  The only change I will make next time is maybe a tad less taco sauce, it is a bit overpowering and maybe add some garlic.  Other than that I will leave it as is; it's a good recipe.

These were only okay for us.  I used thawed frozen wings and they never seemed to get crispy.  The sauce didn't thrill me either - just tasted like BBQ sauce.  I'm going to try again with fresh chicken and less BBQ sauce and see how that turns out.  After that, I'll go with a different recipe.

These are awesome, I used less butter as well.  This recipe is very easily adjusted for taste!
