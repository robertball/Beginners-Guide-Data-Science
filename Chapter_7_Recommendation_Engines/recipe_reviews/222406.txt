Use this last night on ribs. It was good & SPICY! For me this recipe is for basting the ribs while they are on the grill not for putting on your plate and dunking ribs after they've been grilled...

The spiciness surprised me. Cooking it down thickened it up.  Very good!

Excellent super easy sauce. I used Sriracha for my hot sauce. My Missus thought it was extremely spicy and I thought it was just right. On its own without being on the ribs it was smokin' spicy.

Didn't have cider vinegar so used a mix of white balsamic and cooking wine. Still turned out delicious

I modified the recipe because I did not need two cups. I used one cup for everything and 1/4 cup for the molasses. I still modified further to get it to the taste I wanted. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken. Other than that it was an easy recipe and everyone liked the meatballs I put in the sauce. It was a great hit.
