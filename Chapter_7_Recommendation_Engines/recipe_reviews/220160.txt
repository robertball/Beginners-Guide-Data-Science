This was very good. It tasted almost like a beef stew but with only pork. Next time I think I am going to add some carrots and serve with a side of cottage cheese!

well, I made a bunch of substitutions since I didn't have everything - canned mushrooms instead of fresh, one can cream of chicken soup and one can of chicken gravy, and sweet potatoes instead of white, and it ended up absolutely delicious!

I changed this a bit as I only had cream of mushroom soup and no Worcestershire sauce or brown sugar.  I also used 2tbls Mrs Dash Onion and herb mix instead of the onion based on the other reviews of using onion soup mix and I wanted to make it low salt.  I also used the healthy request version of the soup.  Everyone loved it, even my little kids!

I thought this recipe sounded delicious but I was disappointed in the actual taste. I followed the directions exactly. My pork chops were tender but the sauce was not good to me.  I cannot pinpoint what it was that we did not like because normally we like all these things. I'm thinking it was the brown sugar but I'm not sure.

The most delicious pork chops I've ever had!  Super easy to make - everything goes into one pot - and tastes wonderful. Used two cans of canned mushrooms instead of fresh - makes it even easier!

My family loved this, I did tweak it a bit by using some additional spices and using chicken stock instead of water for the liquid base... the meat came out tender adn pretty much falling apart and great flavor!

this was delicious! I made it with a pork loin that was taking up valuable room in my freezer. next time I should carve off the extra fat before I put it in the crockpot cause it made the sauce a bit greasy.

Hi, made some changes, used lean pork loin, added hoi sin sauce and chinese 5 spice instead of onion, to give it an oriental flavour,a touch of crushed garlic and same with ginger, no brown sugar, a tad of beer,and water, but all other ingredients were the same. Was DELICIOUS!!

I followed this recipe except for omitting the second can of condensed golden mushroom soup.  I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup and added carrots.  I baked in a 350 degree oven for 3 hours.  It was fantastic, not too salty and the pork was pull apart tender.  I seasoned the pork chops with a hefty dose of pepper before adding the other ingredients, but didn't add any extra salt.
Thanks for a good basic recipe Carrie.

Pretty much made it as presented but did go the healthy choice route for the soups (mostly because the onion soup mix has so much sodium,MSG).  As to 6grandkids comment about 4 chops making 6 servings, the chops I buy are a minimum of 11/2 inches thick and if you follow the guidelines of how much meat protein you should have per serving (prox 3oz), 4 is very adaquit.  Those 8-12 oz steaks are a dietery overload!

I just finished making this recipe. It was very good. The only thing I'm gonna change is omit the packaged onion soup mix, and sugar. Very good basic recipe. I served this over noodles. I will use the leftovers over rice though, because of the consistency of the gravy. Yeah, I know 2 starches, but you gotta get up all the gravy. lol. Thumbs up and try it.

Rather than the onion soup mix, which is fine for me but not hubby, I used Mushroom soup with garlic and it was delicious.

Excellent! I made a few changes, though. Instead of water I used vegetable broth. Only used two thick pork chops but kept the other ingredients the same. Seasoned the chops with Mrs. Dash (original)) and browned them in a skillet. Then I deglazed the pan with some white wine and added it to the other ingredients. I didn't add potatoes, but  in the last hour I added some potato, spinach and cheese perogies. It was fantastic!

This dish was good and made a hearty stew like meal.  I added chopped garlic and black pepper for some extra seasoning and omitted the potatoes.  After it was cooked I served it over brown rice with vegetables on the side and it went over well.  A good change from a beef stew.

When done, mix 2-3 Tablespoons cornstarch into some of the liquid and pour into crock pot.  Let thicken and serve over cooked egg noodles.

This is quite tasty, but it will be very salty tasting if you don't make the effort to use low sodium ingredients. Look for soups (both the canned and packet type that is called for here) in low sodium options. Otherwise I'm sure will find it excessively salty.

I really like this recipe! SO easy & inexpensive. My 7 year old says he HATES mushrooms, but he gobbled this up! The only thing I changed was the amount of mushrooms-used 16oz instead of 12 (only because I was being lazy!).I served it w/a simple salad & some cottage cheese. A wonderful meal. Thank you for sharing!

Servings say it is for six but there are only four pork chops.
Very good.  I'll be serving this again but will add two more pork chops.

Will definitely make again! Husband and kiddos loved it and was quick and easy to make. I rubbed chops with olive oil (as recommended to eliminate dryness) and it paid off greatly. Super tender and tasty!

Fantastic.  I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, but used some twists from the other reviews.  I used 5 bone in chops, I added a can of cream of celery soup, as well as garlic and other spices. I also used chicken stock vs water as another reader suggested.  The chops were fork tender.  I would probably add some carrots next time as well.

Excellent and simple recipe. Easy to lower fat content by using pork tenderloin instead of chops. I also added pepper and mini carrots and I used a bag of pre-washed mini potatoes instead of regular potatoes. Everyone raved best stew ever!! so will definately make again.

We really liked it. I did add a few cloves of garlic. I did not have cream of golden mushroom and used french onion instead with a can of cream of mushroom . Like  pork stew and better the second day. I’ll use carrots next time.

I liked the ingredients this recipes listed because I had most everything in my pantry. I was running short on time and had company coming.  This crock pot recipe was perfect since I wanted to spend time visiting while they were at my house.  
I had to make a few changes to the soup varieties but it still tasted great.  The meat was tender and the gravy was flavorful. 
I would make it again.

This is going into my rotation!  I liked it a lot, but I had to make some changes (which I hate to do when I try a recipe for the 1st time.)  I didn't add the onion soup mix because it's too salty and I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce.  I also added some carrots, and I should have used less water because it came out a bit runny and I like thick gravy.  Next time I make it I will add more carrots, and another can of soup instead of the water, and black pepper.

Thank for sharing the recipe!

We need to be gluten-free and I have yet to find a GF Golden Mushroom condensed soup, so I used two GF regular condensed mushroom soups, replaced the water with red cooking wine and added a small can of tomato paste. I also added carrots. It came out really well. Suggest putting the pork chops on the bottom and "weigh them down" with the potatoes and carrots. Mix the other ingredients separately and pour on top. Helps to keep the chops in the sauce and not rise to the top and dry out.

Made this tonight and will not make again. I followed the recipe exact. The potatoes were hard and the pork chops were dry. Pretty bland taste as well. Don’t waste your time or money.

This was very tasty! I didn’t put the brown sugar in as I don’t want a sweet dinner. You could use this base for any kind of meat and it would be good.

I was looking for a simple recipe for the slow cooker that did not require a lot of effort.  This one sounded pretty good.  It is simple and quick to make, but we all thought that it was just okay as far as flavor goes.  I have fixed pork chops many other ways that I prefer and that do not require much more effort than this one.  Probably will not cook this one again.

This was delicious and sooo fast and easy to prepare !!!  The only thing I added was carrots, as per another reviewer, and I didn't use the golden mushroom soup (because I didn't have any) and instead I used two of the condensed mushroom soups-- but the rest is as the recipe calls for.  My whole family loved it !!!  Will most definitely be making it again!!! Thank you for sharing :-)

This recipe turned out great.  I followed the directions to a T.  The pork chops were very tender and the sauce was delicious.  The next time I will add carrots, serve with a side of applesauce and the meal will be complete!

I made it exactly as listed except I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of onion.  The dish did not need additional seasoning and was tender and delicious for sure.  If your chops were tough perhaps the wrong size crockpot used...

Four stars as is -- five with just a couple of tweaks.  I opted to brown my pork chops before adding them to the slow cooker.  At the very least, they looked more appealing when served.  I also seasoned them with a cajun spice mixture to give them a bit more kick. Otherwise, I proceeded as directed.  The results were excellent -- the chops were tender and moist and the gravy was delicious.  It received rave reviews from my family.

Made this with a few exceptions -no fresh mushrooms (husband hates them and I had none)1/2 the Worcestershire sauce and no golden mushroom soup (didn't have or have enough of). I used organic cream of mushroom and organic cream of chicken soup, and boneless, thin sliced organic pork chops. Also had some org new potatoes.  I cut those up into 4ths or halves depending on the size and threw them in there.  The husband loved it, and my 5 year old cleaned his plate after an initial "I dont like these pomatoes" because they looked different then what he usually sees.  I would definitely make this again, and perhaps throw in some baby carrots or green beans. First time using a slow cooker for this mama, so thank you for a very easy and good recipe!

My tastiest pork chops so far. The prep was easy and quick. I use Spenda Brown Sugar. I would also either cut my fresh mushrooms into smaller pieces or look for smaller ones in the first place. My wife and I both loved this meal and will do it again soon.

This was fantastic! I served over egg noodles to make sure to take advantage of all that great sauce! I did omit the brown sugar as I'm not a fan of "sweet" food. I also added one extra can of cream of mushroom & chopped carrots. This was a huge hit & my mom said it was the best meal I ever made... I used thin slices pork chops (no bone)...I think about 7 in total. Could have used a little more meat although it was enough but not any meat left over.

I only used 3 small pork chops so left out the cream of mushroom soup and added a little ranch dressing in its place.  Did not add the water or mushrooms for personal preference.  It was quite tasty.  I loved the potatoes and onions.

This didn't have a whole lot of flavor. The meat was a little dry. I didn't have any brown sugar so I omited that, maybe that is why the flavor was less ? I did add some spices and it made it a little better. I liked this recipe because the ingredients are usually what I have in my cabinet so this will be a good go-to one to keep. Will make again.

This is the kind of meal you have all the ingredients in your pantry. I had everything but forgot the worcheshire and brown sugar, but it was still pretty good. I will add green beans next time. I didn't need to add salt, and used 1 can of soup.

The flavor was great, pork tender, but was a little disappointed in the texture.  For some reason I expected the sauce to be thick like in scalloped potatoes.  It was more like soup.  It tasted delicious, but I am not sure I would make it again.

My family loved this recipe!  I forgot to put the mushrooms in, though.  However, to make up for the missing mushrooms, I added 3/4 lb. of swiss cheese just before it was done.  Oh my word, was that delicious sauce!  And the meat was super tender too.  Yum!

this recipe was good although it was better when I made it with cream of mushroom and cream of broccoli soup instead of the golden mushroom soup.  My family really liked it scooped on top of rice and smooshed together :)

I made this a couple of weeks ago and was not impressed.  The flavor was not that good and I won't be making this again.

Didn't use the crock pot. I just layered onions, potatoes, trimmed boneless chops and topped with gravy mixture in a 15 x13 pan. Covered with foil and baked for 4-5 hours at 225. So tender and delicious gravy! BTW, I used cream of chicken soup and omitted mushrooms.

Loved it!!  I added carrots to give it more color.  My husband does not like mushrooms so I used half the amount and it still turned out good.
Don't use boneless pork chops, the bone has extra flavor.  We use pork from free range pigs and notice a big taste difference!  The gravy tasted fantastic too without the work!

Couldn't find the golden mushroom soup so I substituted with Wild Mushroom soup instead.  It's definitely a keeper.

Followed exactly, great winter comfort meal, easy and taste great.  With that being said, its very unhealthy, will try it next time with low sodium soups and try different seasonings instead of onion soup mix.  Instead of potatoes, use carrots and broccoli, pork was so tender and love mushrooms.. great recipe

This is a delicious recipe! My husband raved about it. The only change I made was to add some big chunks of carrots. The sauce is creamy and has a nice little tangy taste from the Worcestershire sauce. It was great with thick boneless chops and I think it would fabulous with a pork loin as well.

This was good.  I skipped the potatoes because I usually do not like the consistency of potatoes in the crock pot.  I served over wide buttered noodles.  I didn't have the golden mushroom, so I used 2 cans of the regular cream of mushroom.  I found it easier to mix everything in a big bowl, then transfer into the crock.  The leftovers reheated well in the microwave.  Will make again.

Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar.  Pork chops very tender, loved all the mushroom.
