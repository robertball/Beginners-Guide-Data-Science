Tomato Spinach & Cheese Pasta Haiku: "Needed more flavor. But very easy to make. It just needs some 'oomph.'" Made this as directed using mild italian sausage instead of bulk pork (glad that I did b/c it added much-needed flavor as otherwise it would only come from the Italian diced tomatoes) and I put it all together in the morning topped w/ the mozzarella and parmesan and baked 350 deg. for 30-40 min. at dinnertime. My daughter loved it my husband doused his in hot sauce and I added salt and dreamed up what I would add to it next time I make it.

The recipe was very light on seasoning. I added some pepper and about 1 Tbsp of dried oregano and about 2 Tbsp of chopped fresh basil. I used fresh mozzarella. If i made it again I would use some salt and a lot more seasonings.

This is great for kids. My 3 year old nephew loved it! However for adults I would add cayenne pepper or red flakes to spice it up it adds more flavor.

I used mild Italian sausage and " Vegeta" Eastern European spice to add more taste to it.
