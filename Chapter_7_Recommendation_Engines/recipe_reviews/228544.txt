Delicious dish. However, the instructions are unnecessarily difficult. These are the changes in procedure that I made: Poked the spaghetti squash with a sharp knife a few time and microwaved on high for 12 minutes. Set aside to cool enough to handle while preparing remainder of dish. Used no oil to cook Italian sausage, and added the green pepper when I cooked the onion. I had no fresh tomato, but always keep diced tomatoes in stock. I drained a can and added to the cooked ingredients to heat through. Then when those were ready, I cut the spaghetti squash in half, shredded and continued with remainder of recipe.

This is a keeper and I will be making it again.

This was very good. My only change was using spicy chicken Italian sausage and probably more seasoning. I am a salt freak. :)  Oh yeah.. I also cooked the squash in the microwave because I did not want to heat up the kitchen on a very hot day

I was pleasantly surprised how good this was.  I have had spaghetti squash mixtures in the past and they were just so-so, this was good.  I did simplify the recipe by cooking the spaghetti squash in the microwave.  I think you can add any vegetables you want to this and it will just improve it.  I had mushrooms I needed to use up and I threw in a can of sliced olives to go with the mediterranean style even more.  I will be making this again!

Made this delicious recipe as written with the exceptions of cooking the spaghetti squash in the microwave for 12 minutes and I adding a few sliced green olives at the end when heating the entire dish. The results was a very yummy, healthy and filling dinner and we will definitely be making it again. Thank you Jenny for a great recipe.                CO Karen

I really liked this. I cooked my squash in the oven rather than the microwave as so many suggested. It came out perfect. I used Italian turkey sausage. I think next time I'll leave the meat out all together and add some fennel seed to boost the flavor. It was delicious as written however.

Everyone in the family loved it.  Even my 2 teenage sons that are no fans of squash.  Only thing I changed was to add black olives on top.  We will make again!

My wife loved this.  I used quartered grape tomatoes instead of slicing a regular tomato as I think they hold up a little better during cooking. I misjudged the squash and over cooked it so the texture was a little soft but the flavor was fine.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I tripled the recipe (most ingredients) as I was having a large group.  Everyone had seconds and more.  I'll keep this recipe.  Since the crew wasn't quite ready to eat when I was almost finished, I  put everything together and let it sit on a low setting, stirring frequently for about 30 minutes and I think it helped meld the flavors.

It was a very tasty dish. I did alter the amount of some of the ingredients (I have to tweak EVERYTHING) Oe thing that should be noted though. Feta cheese will not melt like other cheeses. Stays chunky which is okay by me. You won't get a smooth cheese sauce from it though

I will not make this again I followed the instructions exactly. This was a disappointment after reading all the rave reviews this got.I did not think it had much flavor. What I thought gave the recipe the most flavor was the Italian sausage.

Very flavorful, colorful and different!  I cooked my spaghetti squash in the slow cooker first.  I used turkey smoked sausage, but couldn't get the skin off, so I just sliced it very thin.  In addition to topping with the tomatoes, we added some sliced green onions, as well.  I found the oregano flavor of the Italian seasoning to be strong, so I would 1/2 that amount called for in the recipe and use dried basil for the remainder.

Yummy! I used crumbled Italian sausage, sprinkled some  packet Italian dressing seasoning along with some weber's garlic season on it while cooking. I also mixed in some Parmesan cheese and added shredded mozzarella on top. Hubby said it was a keeper!

I used Jennie O ground Italian turkey sausage. I did not have the red pepper or feta cheese on hand,  but the dish still came out to be delicious with grated mozarella on top. Also my boyfriend suggested some red pepper flakes on top for some zing! That really improved the flavor.

This is my go-to dinner for when I want something that tastes fresh, is easy to make, and will be just as good a day or so later. I use seasoned chicken/turkey sausage and an additional zucchini. Makes great leftovers, hot or cold!

Followed the recipe with the exception that I used chicken sausage and just sliced it. I used a little less feta too as I wasn't sure my kids would eat it, but they loved it!

The only change was to use the microwave as some others suggested. I had two medium and the 12 minutes was too long. The second time 8 minutes was sufficient.
We have made this several times and love it.

This was a pretty easy and fulfilling meal.  I did the squash in the oven as directed and it was perfectly done.  I used spicy Bob Evans sausage and I'm glad.  I even ended up putting more hot pepper flakes in, but we like spicy.   The recipe said to throw the tomatoes on before serving, but I added them to the cooked mixture along with the feta.  Topped it all with a little parmesan cheese.  The meal had great texture, just the right amount of crunch, and was filling.  Healthy too!

I cooked the spaghetti squash in a crock pot for 4 hours on high.
Poked a few holes in it and put in crock pot. Easy.

I loved this. I used Chorizo instead of Italian sausage.  Also topped it with Avocados.  The next time I make it I am sauteing  some Mushrooms  in it also.

No change needed. This is a delicious recipe  using spaghetti squash. It was easy and simple to put together. 
I do want to mention , being from the Louisiana, I KICKED it up a notch the second time making this recipe. 

Rub down the squash with virgin olive oil and sprinkle the squash with "Vegetable Magic" by Chef Paul Prudhomme before you bake the squash. 
When adding lemon pepper, use a pinch of cayenne pepper also to kick it up a notch. Enjoy!!!

My husband loved this recipe!  I put it in my keto collection because all of the ingredients seemed to work out for it.  I did it a little different also.  I followed the directions on the spaghetti squash that said to poke holes in it and microwave it and then I baked it.  I also just bought ground italian sausage instead of buying it in the casing.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes and I read the review that said she used canned tomatoes and I should have done that.  And I used fresh cilantro.  All in all it was great!

This was a huge hit in our house! I only did a few things differently: 1) cut the squash around the middle so the "spaghetti" strands are longer when you scrape it, 2) put about 1/2" of water in the baking dish to make the texture a bit more spaghetti-like, and 3) mixed in the tomato at the end of cooking rather than sprinkling over the finished product. There are browned bits from the sausage and veggies in the bottom of the pan after they're sauteed, and knowing that acid in the tomato would help pull them up made this tweak a no-brainer. Absolutely delicious dinner, and the leftovers reheat wonderfully. Thanks for sharing it!

We made it exactly as directed and it is already on our "to be repeated often" list!  Delicious and easy enough to be served as a side at a future dinner party.

I used plain pork mince / ground pork as I didn't have Italian sausages on hand. It still worked out great and I will certainly make this dish again. Even my 6 yr old gobbled it up.

If you like spaghetti squash this is a great recipe. Easy to make and could be changed up in so many ways with various veggies. I also cooked the squash in the microwave for 12 minutes. I didn’t cut it in half,  just stabbed it with a knife several times, put in a pie dish and cooked. Then I let it sit while I prepared everything else. I used uncooked (as opposed to pre cooked) hot turkey Italian sausage. I would actually say the recipe needs more of it. With the amount of everything, especially the squash, the amount in the recipe gets drowned out. I had a 6oz tub of feta cheese so I dumped the whole thing in there rather than save a measly 2 Oz for something else. Someone said feta doesn’t melt, but it melted enough for us! I also sautéed the bell pepper with the garlic and onion. I didn’t add the zucchini into the mix while cooking, though. I find it gets too soggy over time so I saved it and mixed with the tomatoes to be added when serving. It gives it a satisfying crunch. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe! I did add kalamata olives, capers and a whole sweet onion to the recipe which spiced up the flavor! My boyfriend LOVES pasta and we’re trying to cut down on carbs, so this was a healthy alternative. He was hesitant to try it (he had never seen spaghetti squash), but once he tasted it, he was all in!!!! I’ll be making this again often!

Excellent recipe. Easy to make and very healthy and tasty. WE made these for friends to come over and watch a game with us and have dinner and they LOVED it also. They asked for the recipe!  WE made a double batch and my husband hacked it by getting chicken sausages without the casing on from Trader Joes and this worked out really well.

We really enjoyed this recipe! Being a recently-changed-to-stay-at-home-dad, I wasn't sure how this one would go. The hardest part for the first try was getting the timing down on the vegetables. I let them get a bit too mushy in the skillet while doing the second half of the squash in the microwave. I think I would try using the oven next time for the squash. My squash was quite large, which may have been a cause for my timing issues. I will make sure to get that part completed before moving on to the next ingredients. 

The flavor, however was excellent and most of the kids enjoyed it, which is a plus. Like another reviewer said, any vegetable could be added to this and only make it better. I fully agree with that! This one will go on the regular menu rotation.

it was a different way to prepare spaghetti squash. I made it as specified other than using spinach chicken sausage (I had some I needed to use up) and I baked the squash a little longer to get softer strands. You could mix up the veggies or seasoning any way you like. It's a versatile recipe!

Delicious!  I made the spaghetti squash according to the directions - in the oven.  I didn't have feta cheese, so I mixed in some mozzarella cheese instead.  I mixed everything together,  put it into a 9x13 pan and baked it for about 20 minutes on 350.   This allowed the cheese to melt and meld the flavors a little more.

This was delicious! I made it  by doubling the recipe,  I used turkey sausage links (one hot and one hot)and removed the casings , browned the sausage like ground meat. I used the juice of one quarter of a lrg lemon instead of lemon pepper,  and used a salt substitute, which to me is very peppery. I squeezed the lemon over the vegetables, and mixed well before adding the ground meat. Will definitely make  again and again! Have already shared on FB  and with some friends. A MUST TRY??

Used black cast iron pan-really cooked nicely and I just put a trivet down and served it right from the pan. I kept the squash separate in a large pasta bowl so family would mix whatever they liked. Some added Parmesan, others just butter and salt.  Will be enjoying this again. Oh, I didn’t want to heat up oven so I opted to do squash in crockpot for between 3-3:5 hours on high...perfect amount of time.

I put olive oil on the squash before cooking it. Family LOVED it. Also used turkey Italian sausage.

I followed Brenda Piper's microwave method and found the downside of cooking it too long.  With only the vent holes to let moisture out, mine was nuked too long and was a soggy mess.  Combined with the feta cheese it was still a soggy mess that now looked very unappetizing.  It tasted great but the aesthetics were terrible.

Made it exactly like the recipe was given. Have never had spaghetti squash before so it was a trip cooking it. That being said We Loved it.  My brother said this was a keeper.. Just wish the nutritional info was available.

My husband loved this dish; my only complaint was I thought there was a little too much of the Italian seasoning blend, so I'll just use less next time.  Cooking the spaghetti squash in the microwave,as mentioned by other reviewers, was a big time-saver.

This was delicious!  I cooked my squash in the microwave to save time (halved, seeded, upside down for about 15 minutes).
