I LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies! The recipe I use is slightly different, however.  Much less noodles & marshmallows... It uses 6 oz. each chocolate & butterscotch chips, 1 c. peanut butter, 6 oz. chow mein or rice noodles and 2 cups marshmallows. Also easier to melt chips and peanut butter in microwave on medium high power.

These are so delicious and so easy to make! I make them every year. They are a must in my family. I have requests for them every Christmas! I have to double the recipe just to make them last.
One very helpful tip: I mix the marshmallows and chow mein noodles in a large bowl and set aside. After melting together the peanut butter and butterscotch morsels, remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool a few (3-5) minutes (otherwise the marshmallows will melt). After cooled for a few minutes, pour over marshmallow/noodle mixture and toss with a spatula until completely coated. Then quickly drop them by spoonfuls onto waxed paper to set.
So quick and easy to make. Delicious!

This recipe was a nightmare!!  Made it 2x, once in the microwave and once over a double boiler.  When you add the marshmallows the butterscotch and peanutbutter become way too thick and almost impossible to stir in the chow mein noodles.  I finally got a hold of my Grandma's recipe which does not have marshmallows, the sauce is much smoother and easier to work with.  Don't bother trying this one!!!!!!

I used semi sweet choc chips instead and this turned out tasting like Reese's PB cups. I thought maybe adding raisins too the next time would be great.

Yummy! The marshmallows are a nice touch and easier on the teeth than peanuts and chow mein noodles. A few tips on these: (1) Use a double broiler if available. It's must easier than the microwave because the butterscotch is a pain to melt. (2) Regardless of melting method, melt the butterscotch about halfway before adding the peanut butter. I never could get the butterscotch melted all the way when I melted them at the same time. (3) Don't try to reheat the butterscotch mixture! I didn't have all the ingredients my first run and tried this and mutilated it. Hope this is helpful! Nice little treat!

These have to be the BEST cookies ever! I replaced half of the butterscotch chips with chocolate chips and they were SOOO good! I doubles the recipe and made them for a party. The recipe makes alot to begin with, so about half of them were gone within 15 minutes of coming out! SOOOOO good! ps: for those who have complained about the "batter" being to thick, it really just takes time to mix but it really can be done! thank you for a great, easy, no-bake recipe!

Everyone loves this candy! Note: add marshmallows last or they will melt. I loosely spread mixture on greased waxed paper and leave out overnight.

These taste wonderful and are so simple to make!! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and using a double boiler..melted the butterscotch chips first then added the peanut butter. Let that cool for a few minutes then poured the mixture over the marshmallows and chow mein noodles. It couldn't have been easier!! Will definitely make again!!!!!!

Good flavor but didn't stay set up once out of the refrigerator. May need to cut back on the peanut butter.

I followed the recipe as directed and they came out perfect.  It can be hard to stir it all once all of the ingredients are in the bowl but I found that putting half the chow mein and marshmallows in the bowl first then pouring the butterscotch/peanut butter mixture on top helped it along.  Also, I noticed that these tasted WAY better on the third and fourth day after the sauce marinated into the chow mein.  Get a big glass of milk and enjoy!

I've made these many times.  They are very very good.  I don't use marshmallows, though.  I've always used salted peanuts.  I don't like butterscotch, but, in this recipe, it is excellent.  To upscale them a bit, I drizzle melted chocolate over the top after they've hardened in the refrigerator.  The only thing you can do wrong is not try them.

Adding  peanuts instead of marshmallows makes the cookies higher in protein.  Cranberries are also  a healthier option.

Leave out the marshmellows !!!  This recipe tasted better and mixed much better without those dratted marshmellows.  Also, better with the mini-pretzels.  Would have given it more stars if there hadn't been marshmellows.

Turned out well. Only took 1.5 minutes in the microwave on medium high until was melted, but not hot so that the marshmallows wouldn't melt. Instead of measuring the chinese noodles and marshmallows, I just added until I had the consistency that I liked.    A no-brain, easy, tasty recipe!

I really like this recipe. I would recommend that you let the butterscotch mixture cool a tiny bit before you stir in the marshmallows. All in all still a hit at my house!

Great recipe! I added the noodles first, then the marshmallows. Also, let the marshmallows melt a little bit before making your haystacks, much easier if they are a melted!

If I could give these ten stars I would. So very very yummy. The combination of the melt in your mouth pb and butterscotch with the crunchy chow mein noodles is amazing.

I TRULY LIKE THESE COOKIES. I DID HAVE A MINUITE THAT THE CONSISTENCY WAS OFF WITH THE BUTTERSCOTCH MORSELS. BUT AFTER I ADDED THE PEANUT-BUTTER, THE CONSISTENCY WAS FINE. SIMPLE, EASY TO MAKE AND EASY ON YOUR BUDGET.

Well I can't say they weren't delicious. I sure ate enough of them, and all of my husband's coworkers enjoyed them. But I think they might have been better without the marshmallows, or at least just less of them. I followed another reviewer's advice and let the pnut butter, butterscotch mixture cool a bit before mixing in with marshmallows, so they wouldn't melt.

A helpful hint- If you are using store brand peanut butter and/or butterscotch chips you may want to add a tsp of cooking oil if your mixture is too sticky.

I have made haystacks for several years and lost my original recipe. I could not even stir this once I had it all mixed together. I agree with the other reviewer that there was far too many marshmallows and noodles.

A great, quick recipe that makes plenty of treats for a crowd!  Heat the chips and peanut butter over extremely low heat, stirring--it takes longer, but the mixture wasn't much warmer than room temperature, even when melted, and so the marshmallows stirred in just fine and didn't melt.  As per the advice of other reviewers, I used fewer marshmallows, although 2 c. was not quite enough for my taste.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Would have been better with less noodles. The amount called for is way too much. I'd cut it in half next time. I also added some rice krispies in.

I tried this recipe tonight, I love it! Simple, fast, and ohh so good!
I added some shredded coconut to one batch and some walnuts to another, also didn't have any wax paper so just put them on a cookie sheet and as they hardened they came right off.
As a previous review said something about a nightmare, this is a dream recipe for me, put them together,  on pans, and in fridge in less than 30 minutes!

I usually use just butterscotch and then add in peanuts but this is good too. I have never put in marshmallows but I love it!I wonder what would happen with Marshmallow fluff instead of peanut butter...

These treats were O.K.  Nothing special though.  Don't make these unless you have a  VERY sweet tooth!  I have a sweet tooth, and even I found the sweetness a little overpowering.
I prefer semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  I found they tasted more like peanut butter balls than anything else.
I wouldn't make these again.

I've been making this with my mom every year. It's been a few years since I have been on my own, but decided to start the tradition again, with my own little family. They turned out great! Wish I could figure out how to not let the mallows melt, though.

Super easy, super good, and super cute as Halloween monsters!!  Just add some edible eyes.   I only used 1 cup marshmallows and a big handful of chow mein noodles since mine came in a bag, probably about 1 1/2 cups.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing.  Will upload my photos.

This is a great 'basic' Haystack recipe and it will not disappoint. However, this recipe was 'sticky' at room temperature so it has to stay cooled. I am not sure why.....but beyond that...these are yummy!

We have been making variations of haystacks in my family for decades and this one won!!! I brought them to Christmas and they were such a hit I made them for a New Years party. I have had more requests since then. The marshmallows add just the right texture! Will make time and time again.

My kids love these.  I have to make them every year for Christmas.  I end up making at least 2 batches.  I like them since I am not a big chocolate fan
