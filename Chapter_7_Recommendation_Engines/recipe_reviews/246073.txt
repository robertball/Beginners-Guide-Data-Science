I was constantly making a bread with flax and sunflower seeds until I made this one!It is chock full of great ingredients and the molasses gives it amazing color...it is my new"normal" bread..I do it all in my bread machine on the whole wheat setting.( I use millet instead of amaranth)

We love it! I substituted quinoa for the amaranth only because I did not have any amaranth on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written. It is dense but is delicious. And we are very pleased with the healthy ingredients. A great bread.
