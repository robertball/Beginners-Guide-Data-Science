Turned out amazing everyone loved it! I had to make a second batch of the sauce but it was super easy. Thank you! I also added pecans inside and on top. Yummy.

Family loves caramel so this was a big hit. Used a 8" pan since that's what I had and it came out fine. Added toasted pecans on top for some texture.
