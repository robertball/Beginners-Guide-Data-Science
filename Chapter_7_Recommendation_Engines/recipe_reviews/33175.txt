I used mini-donut pans and the recipe yielded almost 36 donuts. I had to bake them about 15 minutes.
The batter was thick and hard to spoon into the pans. Maybe next time I'll stir in some milk, but I don't want to affect the final texture, which was really light and fluffy!
The donuts taste great AND are a lot healthier than traditional fried donuts.

Perhaps it was me, but...this recipe just did not work for me. First, the recipe calls for 1 t. salt - divided. Divided? No where does the recipe state where or what amounts to divide it into, or mix it into. Second - In Mary's defense, she calls for 1/4 c. of powdered milk. All I could find was nonfat, so I used that. If there is indeed a powdered full-fat milk product, I'd be hard pressed to find it. A very "eggy", thin donut, almost like a thick pancake. I was looking for something more "cake-like". Even with 2 t. baking powder (it was fresh baking powder), there was still little to no rise. The one other review gave this four stars, so I figured I'd give it a shot (especially since I'm trying to find a decent recipe for my donut pans, and have yet to). I consider myself to be a decent baker. Yes, my oven temperature is on the money. I'm sure these are healthy, but they're very bland and with poor texture. I don't even think a glaze/frosting/10X sugar could save these babies. Sorry.

I was so hopeful--but they don't resemble anything close to doughnuts.  Perhaps they should be under a whole wheat muffin category?

I lived in NH for years and this is how to make the donuts. I haven't tried your recipe but the ingredients are right on. I remember my first time not really liking them but the grew on me. It may not be what people are thinking of when they think of traditional donut but for what your recipe says it is correct

These would be great as a muffin but I don't get how these are doughnuts.
