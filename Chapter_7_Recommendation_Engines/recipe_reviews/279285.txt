As with any zucchini chip recipe, you MUST get all of the moisture out if you expect crispiness. You also have to slice them paper thin if you want them crispy so yes they will be difficult to separate. It's the nature of zucchini. The point is the effort to reduce carbs. If you are not willing to put forth the effort to do that then buy potato chips.

My teenage daughter and I made this and did not turn out, we followed the instructions but the zucchini didn't get crispy at all. The flavor was good but texture was bad.

Mine did take a lot longer to cook. Probably 50 mins on the 1st side and 45 to 60 mins on the second side. It helped to put the tray on the bottom rack of the oven. Salted after they come out and remove from cookie sheet as there is still moisture under the chips and they shouldnâ€™t cool in that moisture. Also I just dusted with grated parmigiana cheese not the ranch mix.

This takes way to long and is to fiddly.  had two batches and one of them went into the oven.  It took about 2 hours to get somewhat crispy.  They shrunk so much there was hardly anything there to eat.  Some burnt some where still soft.  The second batch I actually ate raw.  And that was quite nice.  Like a zucchini salad.

The chips never really got crispy. But they did have a good flavor.

I wouldn't make these again! They are really difficult to get parted to add the salt I think due to the fact that they are so thin! Not worth the effort in my view.
