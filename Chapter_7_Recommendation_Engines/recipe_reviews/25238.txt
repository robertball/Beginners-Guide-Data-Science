The seasoning is amazing, but read a lot complaints about the batter coating. I work at a gas station and we make our own jo jos. One trick that we use is not to use any milk, or eggs or anything before putting it in the flour batter. Soak them in water for a while before you put them in the flour batter and coat them. Then make sure you let them sit in the flour batter for at least 15-20 mins and don't shake the flour off. Toss them into your deep fryer for about 11 mins depending on size. We have HUGE jo jos. They will turn out crunchy and amazing and no milk or eggs required!! :)

I guess my rating doesn't truly reflect this recipe as I tweaked it quite a bit...I didn't want to deep fry the potatoes so I substituted about 2 or 3 TBS Shake N Bake Southern Fried coating mix for the flour, and I used 1/4 tsp. pepper instead of 3/4 tsp. lemon pepper.  I microwaved the wedges for 1 minute, then added all the seasonings, and then baked them in the oven on 450 degrees for about 20 min. on a greased cookie sheet with melted butter drizzled on top.  They came out perfectly crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  After reading several reviews where people thought these were lacking in flavour due to the flour, I think the Shake N Bake was a good choice.

These turned out really good!  They were crunchy with an excellent texture.  I popped mine in the freezer for a few minutes before frying.  The only adjustment I would make would be to omit the lemon pepper and substitute some other kind of spice, but that's just personal preference.  They looked and tasted like restaurant quality.  I was impressed!

I get the idea of these but they didn't turn out exactly as I had envisioned. They WERE tasty BUT after doing the first "batch" - the flour mix became chunky - which in turn was chunky on the 2nd batch of wedges. Plus, they were a mess to make. The spice mix is VERY good (on the ones that turned out) but as the recipe is written, I'm not sure if they were worth the hassle. Perhaps trying to coat them by placing the spice mix/potatoes in a plastic baggie might work better and be less messy? I'll think about it...

Like past reviewer, DREGINEK; I had a problem with the flour/spice mix becoming chunky.  My first batch looked delicious and had some flavor but after that batch they went down hill.  I do agree with other past reviews that the seasoning mix should be doubled and the mixture wasn't enough for the 2 potatoes I used.  Overall, I get the taste these were supposed to achieve but there has to be another way of getting the batter to stick without chunky results?  I used the plastic bag method but seem to think it has more to do with the batter not the method of coating.  Maybe next time use milk instead of egg?  I may try that next time.  Thanks, Wendy.  I will be playing around with this recipe.

Very enjoyable.  If you like your J0-Jo's a little more spicy, add a some black or red pepper.  I made mine in a fry daddy for five minutes.  To make Jo-Jo's more "tender" bake at 350F for 10 to 15 minutes after frying.

These taste almost exactly like the jo jo potatoes that I used be able to get back home at convenience stores.  I've always loved those!  The mix was pretty gloppy, even on my first batch, so I will have to think of some other way to mix them together.  Otherwise, loved them.  I didn't use my fryer--just fried in a bit of oil in a wide frying pan.

These are great!  I will make these all the time.  They are sooo easy.  I fried them in my deep frier.  I always make more flour mixture than called for when frying things, I always seem to need more.  I tripled the flour and seasonings and added 1/2 tsp baking powder.  For the egg mixture I mixed 2 eggs and 1 cup heavy cream.  To cut down on the mess I put the potatoes in the egg mixture and then a couple at a time I would use a fork to transfer them to the flour mixture and then I would shake the bowl side to side until the wedges were coated.  Very little mess, easy and sooo good.

Made some changes, but other than that I really like this recipe. I omitted the lemon pepper and put regular black pepper.  I doubled the seasoning salt. I didn't put the egg either.  I took someone elses suggestion by soaking the potatoes in water and leaving them in the flour mixture for several minutes and it worked like a charm.  I have been searching EVERYWHERE for the JoJo's I remember getting at a convenience store when I was a child.  These are pretty much it.  I also made Uncle Dans Ranch Dressing to go with them.  VERY YUMMY!!!

They were yummy.  I used pepper in stead of lemon pepper and added some garlic salt and parsley.  I fried them in vegetable oil in a frying pan in stead of in the deep fryer, they turned out great.

These wee pretty good.  The only thing I did differently was that I used just a bit more flour and added the spices w/o measuring-just because I like intense flavor :-).  This recipe is definatley a keeper!  Thank you.

pretty good jo jo's. slightly different than the store bought ones, but they were tasty. Next time, however, I'll add a little more seasonings to the flour. But overall, good:-)

These taste just like the wedges we buy at our local grocery store's Prepared Foods counter, only fresher and crisper. Very good!

in testing, this would be better remove the shallow dish method and use a baggie, substitute papirika for the lemon pepper, add garlic and some dried chilis to enhance the flavour. serve with a cooling ranch sauce

My hubby loves these! I add more spices than the recipe calls for, but the flavor doesn't seem to come through after frying. We just add some seasoning salt right after they come out of the fryer and they are delicious! For the reviewers that said the dry mix becomes clumpy, I put all the dry ingredients into a large baggie, then after dipping the potatoes in the egg, I put all the potatoes into the baggie with the dry mix and shake it up until all pieces are coated.

I am rating this five stars for flavor. They are amazing! I followed one of the reviews and soaked the potatoes in water and then let them sit in the flour mixture for a while. No egg. I do keep the seasoning and all that the way it's listed in the recipe. Just no egg. So I think I can give this recipe five stars, since I didn't really alter it. Anyway, these are excellent and we all love them!

Very good recipe, will be doing again soon! The only thing I would do differently is add ALOT more of the spices. My first batch I did this way was the bland one, the second one I added probably double to triple the spice amounts and they turned out perfect. I also added a bit of ceyenne pepper for the subtle spice that most deli potatoes have.

Alot of work and mess for something that turned out tasteless and had an uneven texture. I make oven-fried fries using the microwave, oven and other ingredients that turns out much better. Thanks anyway.

Fantastic! We have a pizza restaurant that has JoJos similar to this. I always order these when we go. My husband is not much of a potato lover but he liked these better than the restaurant. He was very impressed. Thanks for a great recipe. It will save me money since I can stop paying the 5 bucks it costs me everytime I buy them at the restaurant.

These turned out great! I followed other suggestions and soaked the wedges in water for a half hour first and omitted the egg. I also needed to increase the yield so I used 2 cups flour, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp lemon pepper, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp celery salt, 2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp seasoning salt. They turned out great!

EXCELLENT RECIPE! The taste was very good but not overwhelming. 

For the people that said the flour got lumpy, that happens when you get too much egg in your flour. Keep one fork for tossing the potatoes in the egg,  (1 or 2 at a time) make sure you drip some egg off as you toss them into the flour.

These were pretty good. I made them when I had family over for dinner. I was skeptical at first because my first batch I cooked for about as long as the recipe says and they came out a bit undercooked in the middle. The breading reminded me of fried chicken batter, which I did not expect. They also lacked salt, so I added some to the mixture and it was much better.  The next batches I ended up cooking for probably about double the time and they came out much better.  They actually tasted better after they sat for a while, but everyone said they liked them in the end. They came out much like potato wedges you'd get at a deli or convenience store. Probably make them again if we get a craving.

A family pleaser.  Very good and tasty. I only cooked 3 baking potatoes and had to use two eggs and double the dry ingredients. It made a lot more than my family of 3 could eat at one meal.  I will suggest this recipe to others.

These are great!! I cut baking potatoes crosswise and added a tsp of "Ms.Dash" for a little more spice. Then fried in  the deep fryer. They came out crispy on the outside and soft and yummy on the inside. Excellent!! Great recipe..thanks!

Seemed a little too floury to me, but at the same time, this isn't quite what I expected.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe. I cooked them a little longer though. 12 mins seemed perfect.

Better than the ones you buy at the store. Exceeded my expectations and I think are as good if not better than the ones you buy at Walmart.

Cmon....admit it.....Walmart does have good fried foods.

Very good starting point.  Tried it as recipe states for spices during first use.  I left out the milk and egg and soaked the wedges in water and sugar mixture for 30 minutes prior to cooking.  I am making them again tonight after my wife only had one cause the kids ate them all.  SHE ASKED for more!

I can't give a 5 because after reading reviews I took the advice to skip the egg, soak in cold water for 20 mins . added extra spices and used a baggie to coat and let them set in the flour for 20 mins then deep fried ... I LOVED THEM... PS: made again and tried "baking" @400 and even though I sprayed 2 or 3 times with cooking spray oil the flour mixture stayed pretty floury.... not nearly as good as deep fried

made this like reviewer rihannon suggested with more seasoning. They turned out wonderful. Only gave four stars since I didn't follow the recipe as is.

We enjoyed these potatoes sprinkled with parmesan cheese. My son complained that they were bland, but the rest of us enjoyed them thoroughly.

These are great, just like what I used to get in the stores back west (out here on the east coast, no one seems to no what they are- but maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places). Took a bit more flour than the recipe states, but they were the perfect texture and tasted fabulous, especially dipped in ranch dressing. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!
