Yum! No changes needed on this one. Very easy and so good!  Brought these to a family gathering and they vanished in no time.  I was asked for the recipe by several people.  Like them better than some other peanut butter bars because these have oatmeal making them a little bit healthier.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very simple and yummy recipe! These are different and very tasty, we liked them.  They are very sweet and rich though, I just cut them into small squares and one is plenty for my sweet tooth!  Though it calls for a 15 inch pan which some dont have, a 9x13 is just fine.  They will be nice and thick, another reason to cut them small.  I was able to cut 40 pieces (5X8).  I didnt have any light corn syrup so I used half dark corn syrup and half honey.  The bottom tasted just fine.  I also only had semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand so I used all semi sweet chips, again the tase was good.  I would like to try different chips next time! A good tip is to NOT press the bottom crust too firmly, as this will make the bars difficult to come out and a bit tough in texture.  Just a firm press with a rubber spatula is fine.  I will be making these again.

Yum...and so easy to make healthier.  I downsized the butter to 1/2 cup, used the same amt of honey in place of corn syrup and switch the milk choco chips to semi-sweet.  Loved them, can't wait to make again.

We really like these.  They are super sweet, so cutting down on the sugar is a great option.

These were very good.  Similar in taste to Scotcharoos, but with oatmeal instead of rice krispies.

These are great - mix up very quickly with minimal ingredients.  I baked mine on a 15x9 Jelly roll pan with no problem.   I didn't have the topping ingredients so made due with unsweetened chocolate heated with butter and some peanut butter and then stirred in some confectioner's sugar.  Thanks for a great after-school snack for my teens!

I liked these a lot!  I made them the first time following the recipe and the secon dtime, I made them my way.  I added slivered almonds and coconut when I was adding in the oats.  I also cut way back on the sugar and only used 1/2 cup.  I also used 1/4 of honey instead of corn syrup.  Lastly, I only used one stick of butter and added a small amount of vegetable oil.  They still came out great.  This recipe is quick and easy and I only dirtied about four dishes total.

Loved them! The topping is fantastic! Keep on eye on them while they're baking though, mine were done after 9-10 minutes in the oven.
