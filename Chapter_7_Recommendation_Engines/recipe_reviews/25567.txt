This a delicious, MOIST date nut cake. I never thought I would find one! The only change I made was I substituted 1/2 C. of the water for 1/2 C. brandy. This made it awesome! Yummmmmmmy! 
Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Wow!  Soooo good!  Will now be a repeat treat for me.  I subbed 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour and cut out 1/4 cup of the sugar. I think this recipe is a bit mislabeled as a "cake" because it's the texture of a sweet bread.  Also, watch the bake time; mine was a bit dry and I only baked it for 40 minutes.

This is my first attempt at baking since I became disabled 6 years ago.  I was excited to see this recipe was simple, Oh, forgot, I had to use hazel nuts since that is all I had.  It turned out quite good in spite of me. :)  Thank you for giving me my confidence back when it comes to baking!  I even posted a pic!

I was cleaning out the freezer and found 1/2 a box of dates and 1/2 pkg. of pecans. Got on here and searched for a date nut loaf and this one was the recipe I decided on. I was going to take this to the school tomorrow and put it in the teacher's lounge but I just had to get into it. I was so suprised---it is amazing! I have eaten 1/2 the loaf already. I can't really taste the dates, its more of a nut loaf, but maybe that is because I subbed pecans for walnuts. But still---amazing! Very sweet and moist! Had with several afternoon cups of tea (: Thanks for the post!

Very good loaf. I cut sugar to 3/4 cup, exchange 1/4 cup water with Captain Morgan Spiced Rum which I marinated the dates in for a couple hours, used 2 tsp rum flavor instead of vanilla. Also cut back the butter a bit, maybe 2 tablespoons. Baked for 40 minutes. Turned out very moist & tasty. When cooking the dates, don't allow all the liquid to cook out. Bring them to boil, stir in sugar & butter, then remove from stove. Makes for moist loaf.

Delicious flavour...ate it straight out of the oven; crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, a bit crumbly but not complaining.  I didn't bother with the sauce, sounds delicious but don't need the extra calories!  Would make a lovely dessert with it tho. I used a bit less sugar, some whole wheat flour and added a few extra dates and nuts; also used a medium sized sauce pan and after mixing the date mixture, just added the flour etc to the saucepan...voila saved washing that extra bowl.  Thanks for the yummy recipe, will make many times I'm sure.

I've tried a couple of date and walnut cake recipes which have turned out less than perfect.  This one is a wonderful recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.  I didn't have any chopped walnuts - only shelled, so I broke these up a bit before adding them.  There were a few big pieces in the finished loaf, which I actually liked although I will make sure I have chopped walnuts in the house the next time I make this. I didn't use the extra bowl to mix the dry ingredients in, I just added everything to the pan, which definitely made the cleaning up easier.  I really can't fault this recipe.  It was easy to make and the finished loaf was very moist and delicious.

I made this although I already have a date nut loaf recipe. This recipe needs spicing up otherwise it's too bland. I added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp allspice which in my view improves it a lot.

This was surprisingly good.  My DH (who is English) was craving date and walnut loaf so I made this for him.  He loved it.  I didn't make the icing as he said it's to be eaten plain or with a little butter.  Someone else told me it could be eaten with cheese but it didn't sound appetizing to me.  A keeper recipe.

I'm trying to reduce the amount of sugar I eat so I completely omitted the white sugar from this recipe, I added 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips instead. Did not add the topping. The sweetness of the dates and chocolate chips was enough, and went well together, it was really good!  Will  make this bread again for sure!

This came out really good! I did not make the warm sauce but I don't think it needed it. I did cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup. I also added 1/4 cup of flax meal in place of part of the flour. This would make a great breakfast loaf. Also, I cooked it for 50 minutes, any longer and it would taste burnt.

This is seriously the best date nut cake/bread I have ever eaten (sorry Grandma). So moist and sweet. I've made it with and without the sauce, it's too good either way. Everybody goes crazy for it. It's excellent when made exactly to the recipe and it's still good when you sub whole wheat for half of the flour and use 1/4 cup less sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe Rae...cheers!

Yummy!  And a very easy recipe.  I used half brown sugar and half white and used pecans instead of walnuts since that's what I had.  I haven't tried the sauce and eat it as a quick bread instead of a cake.  I've made it twice so far and expect it will be a go to recipe for me.

This date nut loaf cake was excellent.  So easy & much like the date nut loaf I have purchased up in Amish country.  Also freezes well. so you can make ahead of time.  I made it exactly as described, but added more nuts & dates.  Will add even more next time.  Thank You for a long sought after recipe!

This recipe looks like it will be delicious as written, but I'm on a health kick and the dates are very sweet so I altered it a bit.  I used only 2/3 C white sugar.  For the 1-1/2 c flour, I substituted a combination of 3/4c white flour and 3/4c wheat flour with a few spoonfuls of ground flaxseed mixed in. It is delicious even with all the changes and without the yummy sounding sauce.  Thank you, Rae, for a great recipe...hope you don't mind the alterations.

This was excellent and very easy to put together.  I found it very moist.  I didn't make the sauce to serve on it.  I didn't think it needed it.  Goes great with afternoon tea!

Great recipe. However, I only baked it for about 40 minutes. I also didn't bother with the sauce and it was good plain. It was very moist, but I also found it to be a little too dense. Nonetheless everyone really enjoyed it with a cup of tea.

A very delicious loaf just like my mom used to make. I baked it in a loaf pan that is four small loaves. It worked out great. Cut the baking time to 30 mins.

Great recipe!  Reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup and used dark brown instead. Also reduced butter to 6 tablespoons and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. Didn't use sauce. They were moist and sweet and delicious. A great snack for the little ones. Will try replacing all of the butter with yogurt next time.

My husband doesn't care for dates, but I had to watch out that he didn't eat this whole loaf!  Most wonderful bread ever.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and it was just fine.  Now my mom wants the recipe.  Highly recommend!

Delicious moist and very flavorful.  I did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and did not add the glaze.  It didn't need it.  It cooked perfectly in 1 hour although I did cover it with foil the last 20 minutes to avoid over browning  the top.  Easy recipe I will make again.

It was OK good.  Made it exactly to the recipe.  As easy as it was, I don't think that I'd make it again.  Couldn't taste the dates.  Basically bland.  I'm surprised that there are so many 5 star reviews.

My family are not cake people but we loved this! Halved the amount of sugar as the dates were already really sweet. Loved that it was super dense (it didn't really rise, I seem to have bad luck with cakes doing that) and felt like a bread loaf thing. From a family who usually take a small bite of cake and leave the rest on the plate to an entire cake disappearing in a few hours was quite amazing!

I substituted 1/4 cup of the water with rum, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also used 2 eggs. It turned out wonderfully, but I might use even less sugar next time.

Made it just like the recipe said.  I used the black walnuts I cracked.  I used a 12 oz package of un pitted dates.  It made about 1 packed cup of chopped dates after removing pits.
Did try to topping.  Would like to try it by substituting 1/2 cup spiced rum or brandy for 1/2 cup water

At first, it tasted good, but nothing wow... Then after I had the second piece, and especially over the next few days, it started to taste sooooo delicious! I will definitely be making this recipe over and over and over! I didn't make the sauce, and the cake didn't need it either, but I might try it some day.... Also, i did the cake recipe without changing a thing... Thanks Rae for this wonderful and easy cake!

Very good bread and so easy to make.  As someone else suggested, I used 1/2c granulated sugar and 1/2 c dark brown sugar for a richer colour.  Didn't make the sauce though; just slathered on some butter.  Next time I'll try the suggestion about adding some brandy.  Yum!

This was so easy and the flavor was just right.  I didn't get to making the topping and it wasn't even missed (although I do want to try it).  Just a dusting of powdered sugar worked beautifully.  Thanks for a wonderful and quick dessert!

This came out fabulous.  The caramel sauce is wonderful, but if you aren’t into sweets like that, the bread definitely can stand on it’s own.  Very good recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I was a banana nut bread lover now It’s. Date nut bread.  Great recipe so much you can do with it . Unbelievably moist. I used dried dates and walnuts.  I’ll be making this on a regular basis.

I was looking for a recipe like my mom used to make as I didn't get her recipe. And this is very similar. I left out the nuts and added raisins. Boiled them up with the dates so they'd be nice and plump. I also added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I just serve it as is or with some butter smeared on the slice. Haven't ever tried it with a sauce.

I made this loaf for a writers' group. Everybody loved it and a couple of friends wanted the recipe. I doubled it and substituted apple sauce for half of the sugar.
The WarmSauce served on the Date Nut Loaf was delicious. It becomes a staple in my recipe book.

I added an extra egg and still found it to be a bit dry. Maybe the warm sauce is supposed to remedy this, but I didn't make it. Next time I would add 1/4 vegetable oil to the mixture before adding the flour. Or applesauce. Also would add 1/8 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon. I increased the nuts to 1.5 cups as we love the crunch. I baked in 10 mini-loaf pans and 30 minutes at 325 degrees was a good time for this size vessel.

This is a simple base recipe that you can customize. I omitted the nuts (on accident) and the sauce (on purpose), the product is delicious.

My husband has been requesting that I find a good date bread recipe. This one is excellent;  sweet, but not overly so, and very moist. 
I did add extra dates because I had them on hand. I'll definitely make this again.

I didn't have quite the amount of dates called for so I added about 1/2 c. of plumped raisins.  I like spices, so I also added a generous 1/2 t. of cinnamon.  This loaf was a big hit and I'll be making it again soon and will stick with the changes I made.

I HATE dates. But had them on hand because of a family request. Had extra and decided to find a recipe. Came across this one and thought why not. WOW was I surprised. LOVED IT! Made another batch and put them in mini cupcakes to serve to guest. It was a big hit...even with the grandkids! Try it you will love it!

Very, very good.  Made in a 9 inch square  dish, reduced cooking time by 10 minutes to accommodate. Added 1.5 cups toasted + chopped walnuts on top and a bag of heath bits into the batter.  Used the full amount of sugar specified, and it was definitely not too sweet.  Very moist and almost doughnut-like consistency.

Just made this exactly as the recipe stated except I used only 3/4 cup of sugar. Next time I might even try 1/2 cup because the dates have so much of their own natural sweetness and I have been kind of 'off' the taste of sugar lately. Honestly, I could have sat right down and eaten the batter as is like pudding. It was soooo yummy! Also I put the batter into 4 soup cans so I could have round loaves. We will see how that turns out when I get them out of the oven.

Used 1/4 cup pumpkin puree instead of egg.  Date lovers will enjoy this rich and moist flavour.

Wowwwww! Best Date Cake ever! I am serving in Peace Corps Thailand. I have a counter top convection oven. I had to adjust the time and temperature. 150C for 60 minutes. I cannot get walnuts but cashews worked well! Yummy and the flavor is amazing.

Easy, moist & tasty!
As recommended by others, I reduced the sugar by  1/4 to 1/3 cup, as my dates were freshly picked and very sweet to begin with.  I also subbed whole wheat flour instead of white flour and replaced 3T with milled flaxseed. 
For the nuts used what I had, a mix of walnut, hazelnut and pecan.
Last I added 1T cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and cloves. 
The bread was ready in 30 minutes and is so moist it doesn't need a topping.

Wonderful, simple recipe that we all enjoyed!  I replaced half of the butter with coconut oil, and used 3/4 cups of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar. I didn't make any icing, and it was great by itself or with a little whipped cream cheese. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great quick bread recipe. I didn't make the topping, and subbed pecans for the walnuts and I used half dark brown sugar and half white sugar as others suggested. Very, very moist and flavourful. Mine took exactly 50 minutes to bake. Thanks for sharing.

Used brown sugar instead of white. Only had slivered almonds on hand so used in place of walnuts. The brown sugar made it really sweet so no need for the topping. Superb!

I love this cake! The only thing I did differently (by accident the first time) is pouring half the sauce on the cake while it's still warm. This makes the cake super moist. Now I poke holes in the cake with a fork and pour most of the sauce and let it soak in before serving.

When I saw a 5 stars rating I figured it must be amazing... Well it was!!! So amazing a well deserved 5 stars.  The only thing I did different was I didn't put nuts (After I started the recipe I noticed I had none left!!)  I can only imagine it would be that much better! I will make this over and over and over again!

This recipe is great! I did it without the sauce and added some walnuts that I toasted....to say the least it was amazing. The loaf is moist and super yummy even without the nuts. I used the Madjool dates which don't need to be boiled with water so I just cut out that part. Very please!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made it last Sunday, while cleaning the house, cooking and doing some laundry. It's really that easy to make and it tastes very very nice. I liked it better when totally cooled, as it got more moist. The only changes I made was using brown sugar, 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract and I added 1 teaspoon of browning for a darker color. I baked it in a round 8 inch dark metal thin and it took exactly half an hour in my oven at 325 F. Perhaps next time I will check on it after 20 or 25 min for some extra moisture. I will definitely be trying it out with other combinations like prunes and bigareux.

FABULOUS. I REDUCED THE RECEIPT TO HALF, BECAUSE THEIR ARE ONLY THE TWO OF US, BUT I WISH I DIDN'T, BECAUSE WE JUST ATE THE WHOLE LOAF IN ONE DAY.  I DID NOT MAKE THE SAUCE, BUT DID ADD 1/4 CUP OF ORANGE JUICE TO WHOLES IN TOP OF CAKE WHILE STILL WARM. SINCERELY MARLENEV

This bread was fabulous!  Left out the nuts because no one in my family likes nuts, but still tasted great!  I made a cream cheese frosting to top it off.  I am planning on making again(2 nights in a row) because the first loaf is all gone & everyone wants more!
