I took the lazy way out and just combined the rinsed and drained beans with a can of undrained diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  I chopped a bunch of fresh basil and added that, too.  Voila - quick, cheap and easy lunch for this week.

I found the recipe rather tasteless and oily.  Even after marinating overnight the flavors did not intensify or really impart to the beans.

I love this simple white bean salad. I used just a bit more garlic and crazy-mixed up pepper instead of black pepper to give it a little more kick. It turned out wonderful and the family loves it. I would definitely bring it as a side dish to any party.

We have always like the white bean/tomato combination but I add some very thinly sliced white sweet or red onion. Also a few bacon bits-if I have. And if  have romaine or leafy green lettuce will cut some in FINELY sliced strands & add along with the olive oil a splash or two of balsamic. This makes an excellent side dish in the summer but we have it thru out the year.

this was great. I didn't have fresh basil so I used 1/4 tsp dried, it would be really good with fresh though. I used canned pre chopped tomatoes and their sauce. I thought I would have to add some lemon juice for tangyness but it did not meed it. I also added frozen chopped asparagus to the olive oil and garlic to sautee, it was a good addition. I also omitted the salt, it did need it at all. Next time I will make it with even more green veggies.
