I thought this was okay, but my husband didnt seem to care for it. Those that used applesauce seemed to have more sucess. The banana yields a slightly rubbery texture. So, I may try it again with thate other fruit. After I mixed it, it seemed like quite a bit of filling. I decided to bake it in ramekins. I sprayed 3 of them with Bakers Joy spray and filled them to the fill line on the inside of the cups. I microwaved them for 6 minutes, stopping to check them every 2 minutes. (My microwave is a little small and slow). I would do 2 minutes at a time and see where it is at that point. It will have a baked look on top when it is done. Whatever it is put in, it does rise above the container while cooking. So don't fill to the very top or it will leak down the mug. I let them cool a few minutes and turned them out of the ramekin. There was absolutely no sticking with the spray I used. I re-calculated the calories, for 3 cakes, and it came to 135 calories as made above.

This recipe was just ok for me. It had a strong banana taste and not overly sweet. My husband felt like it lacked the chocolate taste. It did overflow my large mug in the microwave and I had to add a minute to the cook time.

I was looking for a quick sweet treat to have tonight and saw a pic of this on the front page.  it's convenient and was enough to calm my chocolate urges. I used a large mug, so I didn't have any trouble with overflowing like others did.

I would strongly recommend that you pour this mixture into 2 mugs because my single regular-size mug overflowed big time.  Scooped and scraped it all up and put into a bowl, but it would make more sense just to make this 2 servings which also makes it "healthier."  It was eaten, but I did not think the flavor was rich chocolate, and I doubt I'll make this again.

So I decided to try my hand at the healthy chocolate mug cake. I bought some quinoa flour last month and decided to use it in this recipe. I also chose to use agave nectar in place of honey...and since the original recipe indicated you could use a fourth a cup of applesauce I did that instead of the banana...hmm interesting indeed! I can't detect the taste of the quinoa flour!!! Success!!

I subbed chocolate sugar free torani syrup for the honey. I had a large mug so I figured I'd try it all in one. I got two drips down the side so all went well. It did puff up quite a bit when cooking.  At first I wasn't thrilled with the texture, but I let it cook and stirred it u a bit with a few areas that didnt cook all the way... that tasted much better to me so I think when I make it again, I will slightly undercook this.. nice idea for the cake

I used the applesauce instead of the banana, and thought this made a lovely, fast chocolate cake.  Despite making this in two coffee cups, it still overflowed, but I kind of liked the look of it. We enjoyed it.

This cake was very quick to get together used ingredients I normally have in my pantry.  The cake did rise quite a bit, but, after I removed it from the microwave it sunk back into a dense cake.  I liked the texture better than most mug cakes I have tried.  It was moist and dense and not quite as spongy as some.   It did have a strong banana & dark chocolate flavor.  I liked the bitterness of the cocoa, but, for my personal taste it needed to be a little bit sweeter.  It was a little too bitter for me.  Next time I would add a little extra honey or opt to add some chocolate chips as the recipe submitter suggested.

A recipe for someone wanting chocolate in a hurry. This recipe reminds me of chocolate banana loaf. I added some strawberries, blueberries and whipped cream.  Less calories since the recipe does not use oil.

In the past I have tried several of the time saving recipes in a cup.  Unfortunately I did not care for this one at all.  The recipe is very easy to follow and the ingredients are what most people have laying around in their kitchen so it is an anyone can do it kind of recipe.  I mixed everything in a separate bowl and poured it into a mug.  Placed it in the microwave for 2 minutes and it was done.  As soon as I opened the microwave door the cake deflated to about half the size it was when it was in the microwave.  The taste is where I had the biggest problem.  Nobody in my house was fond of this recipe.

The texture was okay, slightly rubbery. I made this in a large single latte mug using the recipe as written. The cake cooks up quickly and the taste is good. We topped the warm cake with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and caramel sauce. My daughter was not fond of the cake, although it may be a personal preference.

I should have read all the reviews before making - I used an oversized mug, but it still erupted all over my microwave and wasn't cooked all the way through after 2 minutes. I like the idea and would try again, just not in 1 mug. I wasn't too thrilled with the texture either; a little "rubbery" to me...

No, I didn't change it.  I won't make it again, It took to long and burned even though the edges didn't cook, I'm sure it is delicious  Megan, I know you worked hard to make it but for me, It just didn't work.  I appreciate you making recipes for Allrecipes users like me... I wish I didn't have to give you this rating. but it is what it is, I'm sorry

I found it a bit dry and I used half a banana, because a whole banana is quite a lot. I would  suggest adding a bit extra honey and milk.

Excellent! I used applesauce instead of the banana. In fact it was a blueberry apple sauce.. And I loved how I could taste the berries. Mixed nicely with the chocolate. I love the bitterness of the cocoa and the sweetness was just right for me. I made in one ramekin, but shared and it was enough to hit the spot. If you are looking for a sweeter fix.. This isn't it as written. But you could add another tablespoon of honey or through in some chocolate chips to get pieces of them melted throughout. I will be making this again!.. This is the perfect cheat dessert.. And it's really not even cheating. :)

This recipe was quick and easy to make.   I wasn't a fan of the texture, but my kids thought it was pretty good.  I may try to make it again with applesauce instead of the banana to see if that improves the texture.

This seemed like a lot of liquid, not enough flour and too much baking soda when I was mixing it. I was right. It overflowed the mug and went all over the plate I put under it. It was too soft to eat as it did not cook. I've never had luck with this sort of recipe. I probably will not make this again.

This was quick & easy to make. I made it in a soup bowl because it looked like it would overflow in my mug. It would be good if you have to have cake NOW, but the recipe needs some work. It's bland & kind of eggy tasting. I would add a pinch of salt & some vanilla at least.

The texture was interesting, not bad but not ordinary. The flavor was quite dull, probably due to the lack of salt which I'd have added if I'd noticed in time. I appreciated how quickly it came together and, as I'dI baked all 3 mugs before dinner, was pleased they were still steamy after dinner on account of the coffee mugs. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Based on previous reviews, I split this between two mugs.  Wow!  Quick, easy and delicious, with no leftovers to tempt us.  :)

This is an amazing, healthy, fast alternative to a traditional cake! My husband was pleasantly surprised! If your craving chocolate and trying to behave this is a great alternative. I did the applesauce method as my bananas were not ripe enough to mash. Will be making these again and again!

It is a great recipe for satisfying your chocolate cravings. If you are following a diet and want a healthier option this is the recipe for you.
I didn't change any of the ingredients nor the quantities at all and added some pieces of chocolate which made this recipe tastier. I used a big mug to cook the cake but while in the microwave the mixture started erupting  like lava from a volcano.Probably I have to reduce the power from high to medium the next time.
