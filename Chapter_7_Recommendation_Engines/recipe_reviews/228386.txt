I made this yeaterday for a crowd, there was none left at the end!  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.  Sorry to say that I made a few minor  changes, they are as follows:
I did not use heavy cream, (coffee cream was all I had, and I didnt use quite as much as the recipe called for, maybe 2 cups?)
I did not put in the green onion as there was enough with the original chopped onions in base, and I added a little cumin with the curry. I also grated in about a 2 inch knob of ginger root, and only used about 4 cloves of garlic but probably could have been braver and tried using all 8!  I was a bit afraid of it being overwhelming.
It pureed beautifully, and was a warm and hearty soup!

Also, if you enjoy a garnish....we swirled some yogurt that had been mixed with a bit of curry on top.  It added a nice swirl of colour to the orange hue of the soup.  Culinary,  and visual art!
It was a great dish, and could be a hearty meal with some rustic bread or croutons.
I keep forgetting to use my pressure cooker, and this soup worked amazingly well in it.  Quick and easy.

This makes a ton of soup, and let me try out my pressure cooker!  I just got it for a present and was excited and a bit scared (that pressure thing kind of freaks me out, but anyway).  I was skeptical that carrots, which take FOREVER for me to cook, would cook in 7 minutes.  They so did!  Awesome!  As for the recipe itself, I added some more curry and salt and pepper at the end.  I did leave out green onions (didn't have) and subbed sweet potatoes (already cooked, courtesy of my mother) at the end instead of potatoes, which I don't have.  And as we are in the middle of a hurricane, I felt it was prudent not to go out in it for potatoes.  I also didn't have cream, so I just put in half the amount of milk.  Worked well--maybe not as thick as it would be with cream, but it was nice.  I served with Wheat and Barley bread I'd made for dinner, and it was a nice, warm dinner on a cold, windy and rainy evening.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  Absolutely loved this soup - just what I was looking for!  I didn't have green onions, so just chopped one large regular onion and used half-and-half (2 cups) at the end.  Mashed sweet potatoes were also on hand, so I added them once the carrots were done cooking - I was also surprised that the carrots were done in only 7 minutes.  I chopped about 7-8 large carrots, and did not need additional cooking time.  Because I like my soup a bit spicy, I added some cumin and cayenne at the end.  Very yummy - I will be making this often during the cold weather!  thank you!

Honestly, I did not like this soup at all.  I made it as written, minus the green onion (didn't have).  FYI: I made it in my 6-quart Instant Pot, and everything fit fine.  It was very bland; maybe my carrots were flavorless to start with, I don't know.  It just tasted so boring.  Roasting them first might have helped.  Anyways, I wasn't going to let that much soup go to waste, so I ended up adding some extra things to make the flavor brighter (doubled the curry, added at least 1 T. of dill, 1 tsp of ground ginger, and about 2 T. of white vinegar).  Even with my additions, I will not make again, but I at least thought it was all right.  I got the ideas for ginger and dill from the food network website.

I used a sweet potato (orange yam) and a chopped yellow onion instead of Yukon gold potato and green onion.  Turned out to be delicious!

My family loves this soup!  I've made it following the recipe and with some changes. Both ways are 5 stars.  

My changes are doubling the curry powder, skipping the potato, and using a can of coconut milk in place of the cream (I have an electric pressure cooker, so I always do a half recipe).  It's thicker with the potato, but I prefer the taste of the soup without it.  Substituting coconut milk does not make it taste like coconut, but it makes it healthier.
