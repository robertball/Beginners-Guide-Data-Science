I have cooked these for years!  I cook them at 400 for exactly 10 minutes and they come out perfectly every single time.  Can't imagine cooking them half an hour!  For a delicious savory biscuit, add garlic powder and some grated parmesan cheese as well as a dash or two of onion powder - just delicious!

Been making these for years; recipe given to me by my great aunt back in 1973. Her recipe says add a pinch of salt and bake at 350* for 10-12 minutes.

If you are out of self-rising flour add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.

Great recipe. Versatile base; delicious regardless.
(I vehemently  disagree with the use of muffin tins for biscuits. I understand it. But, as a southerner it seems like a heresy has been committed. Use any flat pan instead.)

Great little biscuit that's easy to throw together when you need something in a pinch! I've made them with milk and with low-fat buttermilk and the result is a light and fluffy biscuit. Don't be afaid of the mayo, you can't taste it! Ya gotta love when a few ingredients you have in the pantry come together to make something so good. And, they take virtually no time at all. I can't wait to experiment with them by adding some herbs and cheddar or parmesan cheese!

Easy-Fast-Yummy! Doubled recipe, used reduced fat Hellman's and added an  1/8 cup milk for smoothness. Thanks - Keeper!

Little crumbly, but I think that may be a result of overcooking.  Everybody's oven temp is a little different and mine runs a little hot, so next time, I will start checking the biscuits for doneness at about 20 minutes. I had some buttermilk in the fridge, so I used that, and we had sausage biscuits for breakfast today.  Don't be concerned about a mayonnaise flavor...there is NONE.  This is so easy to make and yields a pretty tender biscuit.  I will make this one again.

These biscuits were very tiny, like bite-size, but were absolutely delicious. The outsides are brown & crunchy, and the insides are very moist & tasty.

I baked these on a cookie sheet, I should have put a little less time on them but they were still delicious. They are similar to KFC biscuits!!

I baked mine at 400 for 10 minutes.  My kids liked them.  They are so easy!  They are moist, not crumbly at all.  This will become a family recipe.

Wonderful!  On the recommendation of another reviewer, I only cooked them 10 minutes.  I would at least check them often to make sure they do not overcook.  I will make these again and again.

Super easy recipe, I had never thought about using mayo as the shortening in biscuits. I don't keep self rising flour, so I used all purpose, with the addition of 1/2 tsp salt and 1.5 tsp baking powder. I made them in the muffin pan as directed, but next time I would like to try just making them as drop biscuits. I don't like cleaning muffin pans lol

I sort of found this recipe by accident but am so glad I did.  These were delicious biscuits to eat with our vegetable soup today.  I did make my own self-rising flour.  I baked these at 400 degrees for 15 minutes on parchment paper.  I will definitely make these again.  You are right, kitchen_angel, this recipe is amazing.  Thank you.

made just like the recipe, and they weren't all that.   Def no mayo taste,  but not much flavor either.   Needs butter, or like someone else said,  garlic and cheese.   They do taste very similar to Red Lobsters cheddar bay with no cheddar.    Just sort of bland.   And in the muffin cups,  def cook the 30 minutes,   even with that, mine were kind of gummy in the middle.

This is a great quick bread/biscuit recipe! I added a pinch of salt and baked for about 15 minutes. I like the recipe size as well since it is smaller. Thanks!

Simple and delicious! I only needed to bake them for 20 minutes until they were golden brown and slightly crispy. I used reduced fat mayonnaise and whole wheat flour to make these even healthier.

We wanted an old fashion bacon and egg Sunday morning breakfast, but we didn't have bread for toast, so we decided to make a quick biscuit and this was fantastic!! They came out soft and airy inside and a nice light flaky crust!!!

Definitely would make this again. Not too bad, only 3 ingredients, a little mixing then you're done! I added a pinch of salt, and took advice from others,  baking @ 400° F for (my oven) 15 minutes.

My first attempt at making these, they tasted great but were a bit stodgy in the middle, probably because I made two big ones as i don't have any muffin tins. I added half a teaspoon of bay seasoning to the mix and ate them hot with butter, delicious.

These are delicious biscuits. I can't believe how easy these are to make. I've never been good at making biscuits but I know I am now with this recipe. I did drop the dough on a parchment line sheet pan.  Simple clean up this way.  Thank you for sharing, kitchen angel.

Super easy and always....ALWAYS (!!) fluffy!  My son loves them and I can whip them up in no time at all.  Definitely in my weekly rotation.

I have been using this recipe for years thanks to my daughter. I bake them at 400 degrees for about 10-15 minutes they are perfect...you can also drop them if you like I had never tried them in the muffin pan until this time but I like the fullness of how they came out!!

This is a great recipe, moist and delicious. So fast and simple with only 3 ingredients. I followed the recipe as written and baked in muffin cups.  They were light and flaky.  My new quick biscuit recipe, thanks!

These turned out great and were perfect for adding jelly or honey before eating!  (didn't have self-rising flour, so I used the baking powder.) Also, think I'm going to try cooking them at 400 for 10 min. next time like another person suggested though.

Was looking for a different recipe than what I'd been using for years.  Made no changes at all and they were absolutely delish!  I can't wait to try adding some flavors like onion or garlic powder!  My new go-to recipe.  Who doesn't have the three ingredients on hand?

Quick, easy, and delicious biscuit - nice crunch on the outside, and soft as a cloud in the middle. Only thing I'd adjust is the baking time - 30 mins seems excessive. I took them out after 25 and they were done all the way through and quite brown around the bottom and sides.

Tabasco spicy mayonnaise was on the clearance rack for $1.00 and it works well with this recipe too.

I did not have self rising flour, so I used the tip below and added baking powder and salt. Thank goodness I did, it would've been bland without that added salt! This recipe could use a tiny bit more salt in the recipe. But otherwise the biscuits were really good!

This is a very easy recipe and I will be using it again for a repeat performance. The only tweak I did was to add1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to it. The next time I make these, I am not going to use the muffin tin. I will be rolling out the dough and using my biscuit cutter.

I made these to go with gravy for a biscuits and gravy breakfast and they are delicious and moist, however the tops of them looked odd. Dry and bulbous. I made them in a small muffin tin at 350 for 15 min, doubled the recipe and used all purpose flour, some salt and baking soda (using the appropriate amount to substitute for baking powder)  instead of baking powder because I had none. I was only able to make nine of these biscuits in the small muffin   pan. They were fluffy and wonderful. I will make these again.

This recipe is fast and easy, and delivers crispy, tender biscuits. I just dropped the mixture by spoonfuls onto a silicon mat covered cookie sheet, and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I will make again, especially when I want last minute biscuits.

Absolutely no changes to ingredients. First time using a muffin tin for biscuits (great idea!) I made a crumble with the mayo and flour first, then added the milk. It came out a bit soupy for me, but utilizing the miffin tin, that was ideal as it poured in like cake batter! 

Preheated my oven to 375°F, and greased my muffin tin, but only kept them in for 10 minutes. They fell right out of the tin with a soft, creamy-gold glow on the bottoms and a mashed potato look to the white tops. Sliced open well, and we enjoyed them with honey butter. 

Thumbs up! Will make again.

Absolutely delicious!!! I tried making them on a cookie sheet but they were too thin for that. They tasted great though. So the next time I used a muffin pan....wow, I was amazed! So easy and tasty. I wonder if you can put cheese in the center of the dough and make cheese biscuits?? Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy Mayonnaise Biscuit Haiku: "Thought this was a joke, but nope, this recipe ruled! Way too easy, good!" Needed a last minute "starch" to dip into a thick soup and this recipe fit the bill w/ having the few ingredients on hand. I just didn't think it was for real - I mean, 3 ingredients becoming biscuits?? But yep, even though mine didn't take nearly the full 30 min., when they popped out of the muffin tin looking all lumpy, crusty, brown and delicious, we were so happy at how good they tasted dragged thru soup. Now if I were to eat them solo, I think they'd need some of the suggested-from-another-review garlic powder, parmesan, or another seasoning of sorts. But YUM and a cinch!

Only try in a pinch. I felt like I was eating play dough . Very dense and zero flavor.
