This is pretty good sauce.  It was easy to make.  I didn't have the guajillo chile so I subbed a chipotle.  It gave it a nice smoky flavor.  I just read that you suggested an arbol chile for heat.  I have those.  I will have to make again to try with the arbols.  Interesting sauce.  Would like it a little thicker though.  Going to play with the recipe now that I've tried it the way you posted it.  Thanks for a nice hot sauce recipe.

Great hot sauce.  I didn't have quite enough cumin, so used only 3/4 tsp., but everything else was the same. I did add the optional lime. Great flavor.

I would suggest when heating chilis in the pan to try to do that outside.  We had too much chili in the air and were coughing like crazy, but we did use arbol chilis, which probably made fumes in the air

Great flavor! But no heat. Definitely needs to be thicker. Will try to adjust

I thought this was easy and tastey. I even left the skin on and used hatch peppers, if thats any different from New Mexico. Mine had the perfect amount of heat. I will make I

I was very disappointed in this sauce. It was very bitter and not at all like the sauce served at Mexican fast food places.
