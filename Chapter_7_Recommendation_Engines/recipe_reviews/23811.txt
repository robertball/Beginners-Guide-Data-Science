Yummm!! This was really good...I didn't have any brandy on hand, so I substituted with apple juice and it came out great! I served over egg noodles, will definitely be making this one again!! Thanks Joan!

This has become a fast favorite for my family.  I used whiskey instead of brandy and it turned out great.

I've made this recipe twice already. It's easy to make and a great crowd pleaser. The second time I was going to make it I just said "Hey guys I'm going to make the Chicken Diane Style again, what do you think?" It was a resounding yes. It's awesome. I don't like chicken that much but this was awesome.

This was very nice. I added some garlic and a splash of cream to the sauce. My husband wants me to make it again!

I liked this very much, although when I went to put the dijon mustard in I found I didn't have any, so i put in wholegrain mustard instead.  It worked very well, so tasty.

I was sooo looking forward to this and I dont know what happened - I was quite disappointed. I followed directions exactly.  Sauce was very bland. I sprinkled spices on top as directions say, but I think they perhaps should be stirred into sauce.  My husband said "put on the don't have to make again list".  My son said "it tastes like boiled chicken". Too many other good recipes here, most likely wont try again.

This was very good, and very easy to make. My family gobbles it up- and these are picky people who claim to not like onions or mushrooms!  I only did one thing differently, and that was substitute Balsamic vinegar for the Brandy; the flavor was still great.

My family rated this one--a 3.5.  (Three teen boys and one Asian husband).I'm not sure why...just not their favorite.  It was moist enough, tasty..just a 3.5. (For my taste, I'd use less pepper next time).

This recipe is AWESOME!  My hubby and I enjoyed this very much. I used a horseraddish mustard and it was just as good. I'd serve this to company.  I'll be making this dish again. :)

I made this last night for my family.  It was really good.  I didn't have any parsley so I used oregano and I didn't have any brandy so I used more chicken broth.  This dish has a really rich flavor like it's been cooking all day.

Edible? Yes. Delicious? No.  This recipe is pretty much tasteless. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I will not make this again. Don't waste your time with this one.

Eh - just ok.  Not bad.  Kind of boring.  I made it as written except left out the dried parsley as I didn't have any.   Husband said he would eat it again but I don't think I'll be making it any time soon.

This was SO good! I used apple juice in place of the brandy and green onions in place of the chives and it was excellent! I would say this was probably one of the best recipes that I have gotten off here! I will defintely be making again!

I thought this was an excellent recipe! I didn't have brandy so I substituted apple juice like one of the other reviews said. I also added minced garlic while I was sauteing the onions and mushrooms. I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijion because thats all I had but everything still came out very flavorful.

Really good.  The only thing I would suggest is not to be too steadfast with the salt measurement.  I would recommend to season lightly with it.  I would certainly make this dish again.

Very easy, very flavorful. I did add some corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce a bit.  Served with buckwheat instead of rice, which went really well - soaked up all the good sauce and added a hearty texture!

On flavor, I'd rate this a 5 easily. The tastes were great and I accidentally used 1/3 c Whiskey (whoops!). Don't think that made much of a difference as the end result was great. Other than the one accidental change, I followed the recipe as-is and served over Jasmine rice. I can't rate this 5 stars because quite frankly, there's no "good" way to plate this. The end result is kind of mushy and a collage of browns. I love mushrooms so I'm not saying it's gross, just not a pretty plated meal so maybe not for company. But for the hubby and I, this was fantastic and happy for the some leftovers for lunch! Will certainly make again as an easy, go-to recipe.

This was a big hit with everyone in my home, guests included!  I sautéed the onions and mushrooms in a little olive oil and about a Tbsp. of butter.  I also seasoned them with garlic salt.  I followed the rest of the directions pretty much to a T, except that I put the lid on when I simmered the chicken.  The sauce is absolutely wonderful!!! I served it with Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley which is a combination of brown rice, black barley and radish seeds.  Perfect!!!

This dish was fantastic!!  Husband LOVED it.  However, I did modify slightly as it did not seem that the spices/sauce would be enough.  So, I just doubled those items (salt through mustard).  The sauce was so very, very tasty.  I also covered the skillet while the chicken was simmering so it turned out very juicy.  Beautiful!

Excellent results!  We had it over rice with broccoli and everyone cleaned their plates and had seconds.  Very tasty and so simple it makes me want to cook more often.  I did substitute Disaronno for the brandy as it was what I had on hand, plus I didn't have chives, so I used 1 tsp of dried tarragon instead, because I really love the flavors of paprika and tarragon together.  I used about half the amount of chicken and mushrooms for just three of us, but kept the liquid and seasonings the same, and I think the kick up on flavor really made a difference, so when I do a full batch, I will be doubling those amounts.

Easy to prep, easy to cook, and tasted great. I think next time I will try a dry sherry in place of the brandy. I think that would give the sauce a slightly stronger presence.

This is defenitely one I'll make again.  I didn't add the parsley or the chives (I just didn't have any), but I think next time I will - it seemed to be missing something.  Otherwise really juicy and tasty.... and even more it was easy to prepare.

To speed up the process I diced the chicken plus my dude loves eating with chopsticks. I made it with extra broth so there'd be more gravy for rice. Dicing the chicken cuts the time down significantly. This recipe makes the rotation prolly monthly.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if it is a personal preference but my kids and I did  not enjoy this.  I did follow the directions exactly.  Smelled wonderful while it was cooking and presentation was very nice but I agree with another reviewer that it tasted like boiled chicken and had no flavor whatsoever.  Sorry but I would not make again.  In fairness, my husband said that it was okay.

Good recipe, I added carrots for additional color. The sauce seemed too thin, so I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken.

Delicious!!! Made this but I used 6 large chicken breasts...sliced! Came out sooooo yummy this will be on a regular rotation! Had no brandy, so I used white wine, 4 garlic cloves, and a splash of heavy cream. Very delicious. Served it over white rice..

This was a  great recipe.  I only used one regular onion and half the mushrooms.  I also butterflied the chicken breasts.  I let the sauce reduce for several minutes over medium heat.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was a hit for the dinner party we had.  I served it with sauted zucchini and yellow squash.  I will definitely make it again.

I still like steak Diane and my wife will to eat beef so this works out well as I can use the same sauce for both.  I use scallions other than that everything else is the same.

I found it very bland and underwhelming. It was also incredibly water.

I cook all my meals on one day, so I like to use the crock pot when ever I can.  Based on other reviewers comments, I tripled the seasoning and dredged the chicken in it, browned the chicken the put in the crock pot.  Sauteed the onions and mushrooms and added to the crock pot.  I deglazed the pan with the wine/broth mixture then poured over top.  Two days later (that's when I had it on the menu) I cooked it on low for 4 hours and served over egg noodles.

These pancakes are amazing!! Great, fluffy restaurant quality. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because mine 'deflated' and I'm not sure why. The boyfriend said they are 'ridiculous!' I also added in cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla because that is how we roll :) This is now our go-to recipe.

I sauteed my mushrooms in butter (that alone makes mushrooms mouth-watering imo) which I think was the best part of this recipe.  Definitely not the prettiest food but overall not bad. =)

Followed the recipe tasted it (which was good as is) then I added splash of evaperated milk and a couple of shakes of Wondra to thicken the sauce a bit. It's good recipe to make chix breast differently in the meal routine.

Pretty good, especially for a meal on the lighter side. and an excelent way to use up some brandy, which someone left at our house.
