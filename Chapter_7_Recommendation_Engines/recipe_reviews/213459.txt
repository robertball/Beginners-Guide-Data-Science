I've made rice krispie treats before and I was worried the shapes wouldn't work out because the treats are SO sticky. I was wrong, I let them cool for about 3 minutes and then began to cut them with a heart cookie cutter. It was so easy! I made 1 batch of pink hearts and a batch of purple. Instead of decorating them with icing, i dipped 1/2 of hear heart in chocolate. They look super cute!

I halved the recipe and made it with my three-year-old. Two things the recipe fails to mention: You need to add the cereal gradually and the mixture is so incredibly hard to manuver and hot that it should only be handled by an adult.

Super cute! Can't wait to try it with other colors & cookie cutters. I suggest using a bigger pan than 9x13 to get thinner treats that will cut more easily w/ a standard cookie cutter.

This was my first attempt ever at making these and I thought it went well with this recipe.  I let them cool about 10 minutes before cutting them into shapes.

They turned out a little too sticky to be cut into heart shapes.  I used red food coloring to make them pink and then just cut them into regular bars and used white frosting to draw a heart on each one.  They were good old fashioned rice crispy treats, but did turn out cute.

Very simple and fast treats to make. A little difficult to get them pretty, but that's just how Rice Krispies treats are!
