Like potato pancakes, these can be tricky to get perfect. I used my food processor and used a thin film of oil to fry them. They were good but needed more seasoning. I will use regular, sharper onions next time, maybe some garlic and more pepper. Cook the full 5 minutes on each side so they are becoming dry. I served with unsweetened applesauce instead of cheese or sour cream.
