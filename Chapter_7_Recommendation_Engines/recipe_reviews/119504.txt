Great side dish for grilled meats! I used light butter and low sodium soy sauce. I added a little bit of minced garlic, salt, and cracked black pepper.

Great blend of flavors and colors! I prepared this as written, only adding fresh minced garlic and pepper. Rather than wrapping this in a foil packet, I used an 8x8" disposable aluminum tin which hubs, the cook, appreciated for sturdiness and ease. Be careful on the cooking time as this is easily taken from "crisp/tender" to overcooked!

I wanted something very simple with zuchini and yellow squash and peppers, and this was it!  I put the veggies in a 8x12 pan, tossed with soy and a little garlic powder, and dotted w margerine.  I covered w foil and baked in the oven with the lamb roast.  The veggies werent quite done so I broiled them for a couple of minutes at the end.  All the veggie eaters in the house ate it with pleasure, despite it being very plain.  Somehow, it just worked.  (note, my daughter agreed it should be 3.5 because it was good but nothing specail, so i rounded up a little)

I used yellow squash bec/ I didn't have zucchini.  Grill the pepper quarters directly on grill first to get marks, before adding to foil packet.  Also sprinkled top of packet with feta cheese.  Delish!

Mad it tonight, with 2 red peppers, 1 summer squash and 1 zucchini.  Such a quick prep for the grill, and quite yummy!
