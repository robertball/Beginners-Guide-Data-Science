I've never had a custard pie before, so I didn't know what to expect, but it sounded easy, so I gave it a shot. Wow. Not only was the recipe as easy as it seemed, but it was absolutely delicious. I used a little less sugar because I don't like things super-sweet, but that's the only change I made. So yummy.

This was really yummy, and this coming from someone who doesn't usually like custard! Custard Pie is my husband's favorite pie for Thanksgiving and I wanted to find a light recipe the whole family could enjoy. I read some of the reviews first, and cut the nutmeg down to 1/8 tsp, instead of 1/2, because I don't like an after-taste, and I did add 1/8 tsp of cinnamon. It formed a nice light crusty top and was very thin, so next time I will try doubling the recipe to fill up the pastry. All-in-all, though, a very yummy tasting dessert for the whole family's taste buds!!

Had a nice taste, easy to make but it is the
"solid heavy type pie" not like the more "custard"
styles.  Less nutmeg if I try it again.

I made this recipe without the crust.  (I put them in individual custard dishes.)  Both my fiance and I really enjoyed this dessert.  There may be a bit too much nutmeg (could only tell because of the after taste) but still a really delicious recipe.

This is one of the best custard pie recipes I have made. I had a deep dish pie crust so I changed the serving size to 12. I used 4 eggs and a little less than a cup of sugar - next time I will use between 3/4 and a cup as it was still a little too sweet.  I used 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in the pie and then sprinkled some on top.  Very tasty pie!

I thought this pie was delicious!  If you are not a big fan of nutmeg, I would only use half.  I myself liked the flavor.  I used skim milk (since that is all we buy) and it was just fine.

Way too much nutmeg for my taste.  Not what I was expecting for egg custard pie. The pie butter sitting on top.  Strange.

My family and I enjoyed this pie.  I love the fact that it took minimal effort to make!  The thick consistency of the custard flavored with nutmeg was a big hit.  My children have already requested another!

I wanted to make a custard to put fruit on top of, and this recipe was perfect. I omitted the nutmeg completely and added some vanilla extract and yellow food coloring and it was beautiful and light and delicious. It wasn't too sweet at all. I just put some blueberries, strawberries, and mango on top and voila!  Quick warning: When mixing the flour with the other ingredients, don't just dump it in there. Mix all the other ingredients in first, and then slowly mix it or sift it in. I just threw them all in a bowl and ended up having to strain the mixture before I combined it with the eggs. Then I put the combined filling through a strainer again. It ensures a smoothly textured pie.

I thought this pie was too sweet and had too much nutmeg. Perhaps I shall adjust these to my taste and it should be ok.

This wasn't too bad.  I give it a 4 star because of potential.  I read some reviews and followed some suggestions, used only 3/4 cup sugar, and only 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I'm glad I cut the sugar down, it was the right amount.  I thnk that the 1/4 tsp nutmeg still was a bit much, the nutmeg stands out too much.  I will probably make this again, but either cut out the nutmeg, which I think would even be good..or just just barely a pinch so that it would be only a small hint of it.

I made this for my friend who is 65.  He said it was better than his Mama's!  High praise from a native Texan.  The only change I made was to use Tapioca flour (purchased from King Arthur) in place of the all-purpose flour.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I peeled and sliced a couple bartlett pears and laid the slices on the bottom of a deep dish pie crust then poured the custard over it.  The top cracked a bit (I used too many pears - would only recommend a thin layer on the bottom if a perfect looking pie is important) but the flavor combination was amazing.  My grandpa, a professional baker, used to pour this kind of custard over apple pie filling or mincemeat filling for a layered looking, creamier version of holiday pies and they were delicious.

This was my first attempt to make custard pie and I think it came out great. The filling was not enough to fill a deep dish which I prefer my custard pie to be thick. Next time I make it I will up it to 12 servings as suggested in another review. Thank you for posting this recipe.

My Great grandmother, Grandmother and Mother have all made this pie for holidays and it is still a family favorite.  My mom has to make one for each kid in our family so we can take the leftovers home.  This recipe is exactly how she makes it!!  It is and will probably be my ALL TIME FAVORITE!!!

I relucantly tried this recipe after another egg custard recipe from this site (which was highly rated) wasn't good. The other recipe was so horrible, I almost didn't try this one. NOW, I'm so glad I did b/c this is the absolute PERFECT RECIPE. My mom says it tastes just like the ones my grandmother made more than 30 years ago. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this recipe, it's definately on the "Keep list".

This was my first custard pie try. All the reviews scared me  to cut back the nutmeg. I did just a sprinkle. Maybe an 1/8 of a teaspoon. I think I should have used a little more. For the sugar I used a cup then scraped a little out. I didn’t think it was to sweet at all. Overall I thought this was a great recipe, had all the ingredients on hand and easy to follow. I did need to bake it an hour. But I checked my oven temp and it was only 305 when set to 325. So that could account for that. I will make this again. Thank for the recipe!

It was delicious and easy to make except for a few minor issues...  1.  TOO sweet.  Next time I would use just 2/3-1/2 cup of sugar instead of the full 1 cup.  2.  TOO LITTLE egg custard.  The pie turned out to be really thing.  Next time, I would double the recipe.

I had a lot of excess butter and I had to cook it much longer than recipe said to get it finished.  I did use a deep dish and made the serving 12.  It tastes good though so I will probably make again.

In my opinion this pie has too much butter. When I took it out of the oven, I blotted lots of excess butter off the top with paper towels. Otherwise the pie is fine. Next time I will use a custard recipe with no butter. There are many on this site.

My pie went over well with people who like dense, eggy custard.  Not so well with the people who like pudding-like custard.  For what it's worth, I didn't have any issues with the butter as other reviewers did.  It came out just fine.  I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon, since I'm not a big nutmeg fan, and I was worried there would be an aftertaste (also worked fine).  I used a frozen 9" "deep dish" pie crust, and the custard didn't quite fill it to the top.  This is a nice pie, but make sure you like eggs and  egg custard before making it (though I guess you shouldn't be looking at this recipe if you don't!). =)

OMG! This was better than I expected.  I read reviews and knew I had to change the serving size because I had a deep dish crust.  Made it 12 instead of 8.  I had no milk so I used half and half instead.  Also no nutmeg so I used cinnamon.  I cooked at 350 degrees for the same amount of time about 55 minutes.  It made such an unusual crust on the top. Fantastic!  Im making one today for Xmas but with coconut.  The half and half is what made it.

I just made this pie on a whim this evening along with the no roll pie crust 1 also found on this site. I love it! This is my first custard pie and it turned out great. I followed the directions exactly and love the flavor. I look forward to having a piece cold tomorrow morning for breakfast.  I will make this again.

When I made this I left out the nutmeg and it turned out perfect! I also cut down on the vanilla the second time around, because the first time I made it the liquid rose to the top as it was baking and it looked very greasy. Other than that, it was by far the best and easiest custard recipe I have tried.

I made this recipe and it was outrageous!!  Everyone loved it.  The texture was perfect.  That extra flour really works.  This will be a family favorite for a long time.

This turned out cake-like instead of a moist custard. Not sure what I did wrong - but I didn't serve it :(

This was the first time I've ever made any kind of custard & it was so good.  Very easy & tasty.  I doubled the filling, added some cinnamon, & keep the sugar at a cup.  I will be keeping this recipe handy!

This pie was really good.  I did not bake my crust before filling as called for in recipe but it turned out really good. The crust was very flaky.  My husband is very picky and he said it was good.  I will make this again.

My husband was constantly asking me to make him a custard pie and this recipe looked simple so I tried it and I'm glad I did. I used the full amount of spices since my family loves them but I did double the recipe because it was too thin for a deep dish pie. Other than that it was perfect.

Fantastic custard pie! I love custards and the nutmeg adds just the right flavor. I grate my nutmeg from a whole bean, and have made this many times and never ever noticed any aftertaste from the nutmeg. Wonderful taste with just the right amount of sweetness. If you blend the flour & butter well it will bake up perfectly in 45 minutes. The best part? If you use a frozen shell it will be the easiest pie you've ever made.

This pie was really easy to make. I used Soy milk instead of milk. My boyfriend is lactose. I was reading most of the reviews and  most people said that it had to much nutmeg. So I used 1/4tsp of nutmeg. It came out great! It taste better when it’s cold. You can taste all the flavors.

I just made this pie and I must say it was fabulous!  I was looking for something similar to my grandmother's Mississippi Egg Pie and this was pretty spot on to how I remember hers.  Only difference was I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon... strangely I agree that there was a bit munch nutmeg.  Maybe next time I'll keep the cinnamon the same and scale the nutmeg back some.  That's what I thought anyway.  My husband just devoured his piece and smiled.
*UPDATE*
I made this again after quite a long while.  I'd forgotten about the nutmeg and I didnt check the comments so I baked the recipe as posted ahead of time for Thanksgiving.  We served it straight from the fridge and this time I noticed no after taste, whereas last time we fell on it just as soon as it came out of the oven.

White the custard filling is OK, this recipe doesn't work for me.  I blended the ingedients very well, but the some of the butter was absorbed by the crust.  I prefer recipes that don't have butter in the custard.  I won't make it again.

What a hit! My family loved it.  I did dock the crust before baking it.  I just dusted the shell with nutmeg before filling with custard.  Careful though...........After pulling it out of the oven, I ran an errand and came home to half the pie gone. 
 This recipe will become a family keeper!

Made this pie tonight following the recipe even cut the nutmeg in half  of it being a strong spice. This was the worse pie I have ever eaten. Very eggy and had a scrambled egg kinda texture and the nutmeg was still way to strong.

Simple, tasty and one usually always has the ingredients on hand. I prepare my own crust as it is so much flakier than store bought types. I used a little less sugar in the custard and the flavor was very good. Husband liked it! So, this is a "keeper"
PS - For those who thought there was too much nutmeg, try using freshly grated nutmeg as it makes all the difference in the world.

Excellent custard pie!  At the suggestion of some of the other reviewers, I reduced the nutmeg to about 3/8 tsp and the pie was delicious.  I loved how the sugar/nutmeg formed a bit of crackle on the top.  Will definitely make again.

This pie tastes like eggnog - we liked it very much and it feels Christmas-y.  It won't replace fruit pies for me, but with plain whipped cream it is really, really good.

May I say that because you are 78, Pat, I gave this pie a try!  I felt you had to be a seasoned  chef(no pun intended!).  First,  my family said it was phenomenal.  Then I tried it on some guests, who all want the recipe!  I didn't change anything and send a bouquet of thanks.  I've been reluctant to make a custard pie and I'm 65.  I can't wait to make it a third time.  I may try a praline crust just to experiment. Hopie G.

First the color is wrong.  It's not the yellow shown in the photo.  Second, it doesn't taste like the kind of custard pie you get at a professional bakery.

I substituted the butter and milk for non-dairy versions for that would have impacted the result. But I am pleased to report that it worked just fine and tasted great too. This is a really handy recipe for making quick, last minute desserts.

I used this to make an apple-custard pie.  I made my regular apple pie recipe and poured the custard over the apples.  It turned out well (i used 2% milk and it was not quite set, i think it would have been ok with whole milk), but the custard is very sweet- that could be because of the sugar all over the apples).

Yummy! I changed the nutmeg to cinnamon coz I don't have any nutmeg, but I followed the rest of the recipe as is and it's so good! It is sweet, so if you're not into sweet dessert, maybe reduce the amount of sugar by 1/2 a cup.

This was a first for me.  I would never eat egg custard because I was assumed it had a LOT of eggs in it.  I made this recipe for a very dear friend who is 88 years old.  She said it was better than Piccadillys!!!  My 10 year old said it was her favorite pie now!  She is my picky eater.  And I loved it, especially warm.  Followed the recipe exactly.

This is a very good custard. It is too sweet so I will cut the sugar next time. The butter came to the top and puddled so I will not use it next time. I also will bake the crust for 10 minutes instead of 5 as it wasn't done enough. But I recommend this recipe as it is easy and very good.

Pat this was my first attempt at making an egg custard pie.  It was wonderful.  I used margarine instead of butter because we had the margarine and no butter.  It still was really good.  May try the butter next time to see the difference.  My mom said just before she tried it not to be suprised if the crust was soggy.  It wasen't.  She and several family members said it was really good.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. and put just a sprinkle of nutmeg, and added cinnamon.

I wish I had changed two things:
1. even less sugar (next time I'll try 1/2 c.), and 
2. when I pre-backed my crust at 400 Fahrenheit, I should have cooled the oven before baking the pie. I didn't  notice the temperature change and adjust the oven until just before I put the pie in, and I think the eggs came out less custardy and more scrambled-like due to the high residual temperature of the oven. 

I would bake this again with the adjustments above. Maybe even try a lemon or coconut variation.

Just made this last night, with modifications, when I was looking for a good basic baked custard. I made this for a friend, without the crust, who is doing chemo and has limited food tolerances ....I melted butter in a pie tin and added 2 grated apples with cinnamon instead of the crust. I added 3 Tbs of peanut butter (for a bit of protein)to the butter and melted them together in the microwave. Be sure the milk is warm when adding or the peanut butter seizes up and separates.  Very Tasty! The apples rise to the top and there’s a half inch layer of pb “crust’ on top of custard.  A bit sweet for my taste so I may cut back on the sugar next time and maybe swap some light cream for milk (I only had 2%), but the apple/pb combo was tasty

I made this pie exactly as the recipe stated and I was so disappointed. The texture came out super eggy, and the nutmeg on top burned. If I was to make it again I think I’d do one less egg and put the nutmeg on more toward the end.

I followed the directions precisely but the custard part was only 1/2 inch high. Then there was a thin layer of something between the custard and the crust. I will be looking for another recipe for custard pie!

Yum yum. Easy to make and very tasty. This was my granny's favorite pie and now it's one of mine. I only used 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet for me. I'll definitely make it again.

I’ve always been addicted to Custards since I was a little boy in the 1950’s. My mother and both grandmothers cooked this style custard for me as a little boy. Sometimes they added coconut to this recipe. The amount is not critical, it’s just how much you like coconut! The only change I made to this recipe is I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla (I’m addicted to vanilla too!

This tastes great! I do think that if baked in an 8 inch pan, it would result in a higher filling and better appearance. Classic taste and texture for those of us lucky enough to have experienced this pie growing up.

I  did like this but think there is too much sugar in it...it is very sweet.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar to 1/2 to 3/4 a cup  and also cut the flour to 1 Tblspn.  It is not like an eggy custard should be with so much flour.

I made this for my father for Christmas. It was much too sweet. The flour had a had time devolving into the egg mixture. I ended up using the Vita Mix to blend the flour into the egg mixture. It was awful.  There are better recipes out there.

I did not care for this pie. The texture was off, it was surprisingly too sweet for someone who loves sweet, and no one really liked it at our Thanksgiving dinner. The other pies I made were perfect. The butter and spices rose to the top and I just absorbed the liquid with a paper towel. I will keep looking for the recipe I made from this site years ago but failed to save; I liked it much more. This one is not a keeper for me. Sorry!

This was my first attempt at making a custard pie, after years of lamenting about how no one ever carried them in the stores anymore.  I finally decided to try my hand. This recipe was easy and I did it  as it is written.  I didn’t have any issue with the butter rising to the top, but my pie filling did seem awfully lumpy. It cooked out  okay, but still  a bit odd. I did add the full amount of nutmeg, not too much for me, but I did break it up. Some in the filling and some brushed over the crust before I pre-baked it. Overall, this was a nice easy recipe and I am excited to try it again.

My grandpa asked me to make a custard pie as he hasn't had one since my grandma's passing. I chose this one because it seemed the most like the one he described and he said it was perfect. It was very tasty, I added some cinnamon and allspice because that's what hers had but it would be just as good as the recipe has it. Very delicious!

I made this pie and used a nilla wafer crust. Then I added the juice and zest of lemon and it was amazing! The custard tempered the strong lemon just enough to make a perfect lemon custard pie! SinceI was adding more liquid I added a touch more flour to help thicken. My family loved it!!! Can’t wait to make a chocolate one!

I had fresh apricots that I cut in half and put on top with a tiny bit of caramel in the center of each one. I made the pie just as written and the apricot was a tiny bit tart, it was so good and my husband loved it. A very pretty pie. I did pre-cook my pie shell 5 minutes and cooked the pie about 10 minutes longer. Just till your toothpick comes out clean.

Custard pie was not like the traditional custard pies.  I thought it was too sweet.  Maybe the next time I make it,I will cut the sugar, vanilla and nutmeg in half.

This is definitely not a traditional custard pie. I made it twice and both cracked and had a hard crust on the top. I have never had a custard pie crack before. I just don't think flour should be put in a custard pie and I believe that is what the problem was.

This custard pie is a very easy recipe to follow, but the pie custard is too sweet and watery. Don't know if it is because I substituted the brown sugar to the white one. It tastes nothing like the one at the bakery store.

I made this for my father-n-law and he loved it. But for my taste it was a bit too much nutmeg, so next time I will cut back the nutmeg. It baked up beautifully and had the perfect texture. And it was so easy. I will use this recipe every time from now on. I also did one omitting the nutmeg and using cinnamon instead. It was very good also.

Delicious. Easy to make.  Followed instructions with one exception - we did not pre-bake the crust.  The pie took a lot longer to cook - maybe another 20 minutes or so. I ended up turning the temperature up a bit.  We used fresh grated nutmeg in the full amount called for and there was no bad after taste, no overwhelming nutmeg flavour.  The nutmeg and butter formed a lovely crunchy topping. We served the pie with a dollop of whipped cream.  It was very popular at the Seniors' lunch today.  I'd make this one again.

Such an easy recipe! Has a great flavor and I prefer the more "dense" consistency. I used half/half instead of milk for a richer flavor. I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, but next time will use 1/2 cup instead. Like other reviews that were left, I did cut the nutmeg in half. I will definitely make this again!

I really like this pie, I read some of the other comments before making it & didn't use all of the required nutmeg when i should have... Will i make this pie again? Yep! lol I brushed my pie edges & the bottom of my pie crust with egg white so it would't burn & my crust wouldn't be soggy at the bottom.

I used 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg instead of 1/2.  Also I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  It is important to whip eggs first then add them to the mixture of all of the other ingredients last.  If you don't the pie develops this liquidy middle section.  I did it right the second time I made it and it came out much better.  Tastes great!

Like the way it reliably bakes up nice and firm, uses only one temperature setting, and skips all that rubbish about scalded milk. I settled on 3/4 cup sugar and half the butter, but otherwise it's fine as is.

I had a craving for a childhood favorite from the restaurant Morrison's. The only adjustments I made was using 2 ½ tablespoons of vanilla. It was a light treat, not heavy at all.  Not too sweet.  I would cook it less than 45 min because crust was browner than I'd like. Other than that, it was delicious.

I made 2 of these, to one I added sliced strawberries and to the other I added 1 cup of raisins. Both were a HUGE hit and I would have eaten them both myself if I could! I liked the original recipe flavor and consistency, but adding the fruit was a nice change and I liked the texture they added.

This is basically the same recipe that's been passed down in my family for years.  It is great.  Instead of using a pie crust, we heavily grease and flour the baking dish and it will make it's own crust.  We also don't use nutmeg.  It doubles easily to a 9 x 13 pan.  After it's cooled some, place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pie and poke slits all over with a knife.  This will keep the butter from forming a crust on top if you are refrigerating it.

Best pie ever! I added 1 tsp almond extract & 1 tsp vanilla extract. Sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over top of pie.  Baked 45 minutes @ 350°.  To keep the top  from over browning,  I put a sheet of foil over top of pie. Definitely a Blue Ribbon Winner!!!

This was a very tasty pie.  I used a "standard" size pie pan, and followed the directions to a T. ( It doesn't fill up the entire pie crust using this size of pie pan)  It was very easy to make and I will definitely make it again!

It was okay. I was expecting it to be sweeter or creamier. Not bad just too bland for my family.

Don't change a thing!  Great pie!  My grandmother owned Brown's restaurant for over 40 years in Indiana and made a pie very similar to this. Although making 25 different pies each night, she always made extra Custard pie to satisfy customer demand. Thank you and our neighbor Ed thanks you too.  :-)

I am 72 and this was my husband's favorite pie of all time.  He would sneak pieces until it was gone and I would never get more than a taste. It didn't matter what time of year it was, he wanted this pie.

This turned out perfectly! I read the reviews and since I had a deep pie dish, I doubled the recipe and altered it a tad by using 4 eggs, 3/4c of sugar and only 1/4t of nutmeg instead. When I took it out of the oven I was a little nervous, because butter was sitting on the top. Once I refrigerated it, it looked and tasted perfect! Definitely will be making this again!!

I used soy milk for a dairy free version and only 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I'd never made a custard pie before, but it was my favorite before going dairy free. This came out great! The first time I made it I used coconut sugar and it was yummy warm out of the oven. However, the flavor of the coconut sugar overpowered the pie after it was chilled and I don't think I would make it again. The pie also had the color of butterscotch (to be expected) and would only be something I'd serve at home anyway. Using regular white sugar, this was superb!! I used the full cup of sugar and will probably experiment with 3/4 cup next time. It's a matter of taste and prefer mine to have more of an egg flavor. The sweetness of the pie becomes more pronounced as it chills, so gauge your sugar according to how you plan to serve it. Super quick and ridiculously easy to make! LOVE IT!!

YUMMY! So simple, and so delicious. Like some other reviewers, I used a bit less sugar (3/4 cup) and nutmeg (1/4 tsp. - fresh ground). I snuck a piece while it was still warm - heavenly! I'll be serving it cold with fresh strawberries. Can't wait!

Awesome.  Used half the amount of butter & it came together just fine - like to top with frozen sliced strawberries.

This tasted just like the Egg Pie my Mom used to make for us. I put it in the perfect cream cheese pie crust also from this site. My only complaint is that it is a little too thin, however that could very easily have been my fault. The only change I made was to omit the salt and nutmeg, only because we don't like it.  I will try it in a smaller pie pan next time, but there will definately be a next time!

Great Taste! My pie ended up like a couple other ratings here, too buttery a bit too sweet and a bit to much nutmeg. I had to bake it longer than was stated in the recipie. I think next time I will delete some  of the sugar, nutmeg and butter.

I tried this recipe because it appeared to close to the egg custard pies my family made. The taste is good but I did use evaporated milk and half and half. Added more Vanilla and lightly sprinkled nutmeg on top for color. This pie has a crust on top which I wasn't expecting on both pies.
