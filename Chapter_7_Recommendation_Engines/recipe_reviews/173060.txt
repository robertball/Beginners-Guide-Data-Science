This is a great base for pico de gallo, however I have to agree with the other reviewers in that I would never add the black pepper, white vinegar or veg. oil. It's just not necessary. I would also add the cilantro to taste along with a bit of cumin. This is supposed to be a very simple side dish.  I let it rest for a few hours to the flavors blend together.

This is almost identical to my husband's recipe! The only thing he does differently is to add a little cumin and use red wine vinegar. It's super fresh tasting, and a great addition to any Mexican foods. We've even topped baked tilapia with it.

This could be a 5 star if the amount of oil was decreased by about half, as it was way too greasy for my taste. I also followed the other reviewer's advice and added red wine vinegar, which was a good idea, thank you. Overall, it is a good recipe and I will try it again with less oil.

Oil?   Vinegar?  Black pepper?    Why would anyone put that in Pico de Gallo or any other salsa?  Otherwise fine.

Sorry Chef, but as I was in the midst of making this and gave it a taste I realized the lime juice provided enough acid and there was no way I could add either the vinegar or the oil. I also had to cut back on the cilantro and only salted to taste.  It was perfect.

Nice and fresh tasting... I used red wine vinegar instead of white, less oil and cilantro, and a touch of cumin.  Easy to play around with the amounts of ingredients to suit your taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was very good and tasted like the Pico de Gallo we had in Mexico.  I halved the recipe so I wouldn't have a "ton".  I used red wine vinegar as others had suggested.  My husband's only request is that next time I put in less cilantro (he is not a huge fan of cilantro).  Update.... I have made this many times now and it always gets great reviews!  I have given out the recipe a number of times.  I usually try and let it sit overnight and I drain out the extra liquid right before serving!  I love this recipe!!!

A few changes. I guess for personal taste. I like to use spanish white onion, jalapeno, and avocado in addition. Use fresh lime juice. And plenty of cilantro. Very yummy.

Real good! However, it makes a ton of it so be ready to use it within a week or two.

I liked the vinegar in this but I think there was too much oil. The recipe calls for a lot of cilantro which I like but the oil drowned it out and made it real soggy and not very pretty. I will make again but will leave the oil out entirely next time.

This recipe is great!  I get asked to make it for parties all the time.  I decreased the oil by half because I don't prefer a lot of oil.  It keeps for more than a week in the fridge, too.

So So good! i wasn't sure if I would like the vinegar and oil, but this was very good. I didn't have red onion so I used yellow. Still good though.

My husband just made this and we can't stop eating it... it's SO GOOD! It's not your typical Pico de Gallo with the vinegar and oil, but it adds a very nice touch. We did only use half the vinegar and oil though. Can't wait make this to wow company ;)

This was my first attempt at Pico de Gallo, as I was trying to find a way to use fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Yes... It is the end of January, and yes I live in Florida where our veggies are happiest in the winter as long as we don't get a freeze.    I think what caught my attention was the vinegar.  I read what others posted though and used wine vinegar instead.  I added some bell pepper and a different kind of hot pepper, as someone in our house has stomach issues with jalapeno.   Left out the black pepper.  Just gotta say that people were chomping down on this!  I'll be doing this one again, absolutely positively.

I used red wine vinegar and no oil.  Unfortunately, the first time I made it I used the amount of salt called for in the recipe and it was way too salty.  I evened it out with more lime juice and some brown sugar, and it was delicious!

We were excited to try this recipe, but it was a bit too oily for us. We will give it another go, but also seemed to lack "something".

Wonderful recipe that alters easily. I used white onion because that's what I had. I used red wine vinegar as others suggested and less oil. I halved the recipe oh and I added 1 tsp of cumin. This was just fantastic with the carnitas I made. I think though I will try it next time without any oil at all to see how it comes out. Great recipe though.

Awesome!  Fresh and tasty.  This blows the socks off anything I have tried in a can or even supposedly fresh pico at restaurants - and it is easy to make.   I do recommend using disposable gloves while chopping the jalapeno peppers.  The oil on these can sent you to the ER if you accidently rub you eye after chopping - even after you have washed your hands.

I'm a huge fan of pico de gallo versus just salsa. The only kind I've ever had came from a local mexican grociery store. This was my first attempt at making it and I took the advice of others to cut back on the oil & vinegar (cut both quantities in half) and thought it was great although I feel it needs to be kicked up a notch in the heat dept. so I'm going to add more jalapeno to mine. Will definitley be making this one again and maybe next time I'll try the red wine vinegar in place of the white.

This is a very good pico de gallo recipe.  I totally agree with 2 of the recommendations I read so far.  First off, definitely cut back on the cilantro.  I probably used about half of it.  Also, I dropped down to about 2 tablespoons of oil.  I thought everything else was fine.

Very excellent. This was so very good. I make this often and bring it to parties and it is always a hit. Thanks for sharing.

I played with all of the volumes on each ingredient.  I think this is a fantastic recipe, you just need to play with the ingredients to get the flavour you like best.  I did notice that its much better after resting for an hour in the fridge, but after 3 hours, it starts to get a little soggy.  Try putting in on the table 15 minutes before serving to let the tomatoes 'come back.'

Everybody's saying that they wouldn't use oil and vinegar. I do. But I have always just used a capful of each. Pepper is ok but with this recipe only 1/4 teaspoon is adequate. For cilantro this recipe calls for too much 1/2 cup chopped would be better. I use two limes. Instead of red onion I use chopped green onion.

This recipe is great. I changed a few things though. I added a few more tomatoes, four tomatillos and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My wife wasn't a big pico de gallo fan until she tried this recipe. Even my 12 year old loves it. After all the ingredients are mixed together, and they have set in the refrigerator, there is no one ingredient that really stands out. Instead, just like the description says, all the separate parts come together perfectly.

I love this pico!! I am a huge cilantro fan, so I use the full amount.  I usually make this the night before I will be using it, so that the flavors meld overnight.  I have served this to my Mexican food loving friends from California, and they said this is the best pico they have ever had!!

I would agree with several other reviews to cut the oil in half. I also used more cilantro.

Good recipe.  I would recommend cutting back the cilantro a bit though.

I too had to modify this recipe, however, I will say it's the closest I've gotten to figuring out my favorite Mexican restaurant's salsa. Their salsa rocks- it's authentic like my Nina used to make and this (with a few modifications) hit the nail right on the head. Thanks for a basis for figuring out this great salsa!

I just finished making this and haven't had a chance to chill it and let the flavors meld yet, but so far I'm not a huge fan. I did half the amount of salt and a little fresh ground pepper (no where near a tsp, let alone a TBSP!) and that was way too much on both of those! Also did half the amount of red wine vinegar and canola oil and found that plenty on both. I also LOVE cilantro and didn't quite do 2 c. and found that overpowering as well. I think next time I'll look for something else but I'm glad I tried this!

This is the best pico de gallo known to man!  It's not too oily but I DO use red wine vinegar.  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  It's good as soon as you make it and for several days afterwards.  I've been asked to make it 4 times now and it's fun and easy.

Great recipe. I made this and ate it for two weeks. Thanks everyone for the extra tips. I used almost all of them and they made this pico de gallo awesome
