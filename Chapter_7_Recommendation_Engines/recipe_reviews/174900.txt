Got such a beautiful cake out of this recipe.  It came out very moist, and the glaze, I believe, helps when spreading the frosting on the cake, making it less crumbly.  A nice change from basic chocolate cake.  I made the frosting as directed, using exactly 240 grams of confectioners' sugar, and the consistency was perfectly spreadable without being too soft.  I substituted the buttermilk for 1 tablespoon vinegar added to 1 cup milk.  It always works in cakes when I don't have any real buttermilk on hand.  Next time, I might try flavouring with Kahlua in the cake instead of coffee granules.

This cake was good, but not extremely moist. It recieved rave reviews at the party which I served it at, however I think it was mostly due to the frosting, which was delicious. In the furture I may use a boxed cake and follow the other instructions.

Absolutley delicious! The cake was moist and flavorful. I made half of the recipe and made cupcakes which made 18 cupcakes. I piped the frosting on top using a startip and topped it with a dark chocolate espresso bean. I will be making this again, next time I will add more coffee granules to the cake batter and frosting because I like a stronger coffee flavor.

I made this cake for my husband's graduation and it was a hit. There are several steps involved to infuse the cake with its mocha taste. It's worth the time!

So rich and delicious. I brought this cake to work, it was so moist and the buttercream frosting is to die for.  The frosting is velvetty, and melts in your mouth.  I will be making this cake for years to come.

This was delicious and a big hit for a birthday request.  Very moist and lots of coffee flavor!  I will use this again and recommend to anyone.  Very easy to make and everyone raved about it.

This was the first cake I have ever made from scratch, and I'm so happy to report that it turned out very nicely!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars was because the cake didn't rise very much so it was pretty dense and shallow in my 2  8" pans.  The glaze seemed to stay wet on the cake (I was expecting it to crust a bit), but it adds a great flavor.  I will definitely hang onto this recipe - very yummy, rich cake.

I just finished making this for my mother's 60th b-day and it is fabulous! (I'm eating the part I trimmed off the top with extra icing). It's a lot of work for a cake but for such a special occasion it was worth it.   I followed the recipe exactly and it worked perfectly (although the recipe does make a lot of icing). After I frosted the cake I put semi-sweet chocolate ships around the bottom edge and shaved some dark chocolate on top (like sprinkles) to jazz it up a little.

OMGosh!  Wow, whata cake.  Thought it'd be too sweet, too much chocolate, too much espresso flavor.  But it wasn't at all; it was absolutely perfect blend of flavors with nothing overtaking the other.  Made for our annual Daytona 500 get together and it got rave reviews.  If you love chocolate, coffee and like your sweets, this is the recipe for you.  Make it and you won't be disappointed.
