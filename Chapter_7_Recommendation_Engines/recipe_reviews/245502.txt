Loved this recipe! Substituted mango because it is what I had, and raw local honey instead of stevia. I also threw in a dash of nutmeg. Delicious.

Interesting. I left out the stevia and any sweetener. Definitely a kick start to your day. I can see where mango would be a nice addition to or sub for the banana. This is one of those recipes you just have to try yourself to understand how good it really is.

Perhaps it was a bad idea to omit the Stevia. I tried 1/2 cup of blueberries instead. I'm sure it's very good for me but it's not delicious.

I made changes that probably altered this smoothie significantly, but that's part of the beauty of smoothies!  I had powdered turmeric & didn't realize this recipe called for the root until I'd put everything else in.  So I put in a scoop of my powdered & added a roasted beet left over from last night's dinner.  I probably used a little less cayenne pepper & subbed honey for stevia, probably almost 1/2 tsp.  It's really an interesting flavor, I can definitely taste the beet, but I love the spice & it's surprisingly really great!  Next time I'll be sure to buy turmeric root so I can try it as its intended.

I used coconut milk and ground turmeric and ginger. I wanted to make this and didn't have fresh. Very good. Love the spice and kick of the pepper.
