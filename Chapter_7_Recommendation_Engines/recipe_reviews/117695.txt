For those saying the kind of steak is too tough, remember to marinate it as long as you can. The acid in the juice is what helps to tenderize it. Also, be sure to let the steak sit for 10 minutes or so after pulling it off the fire, and the biggest requirement of all is to slice it as thinly as humany possible across the grain. My kids love this, too. Every time I take it to a gathering or make it for others, I laugh as I hear the men tell their wives, "You've GOT to find out what she did to that! This is incredible." It's sooooo easy. I am tempted to do like the old Rice Krispy Treat commercial and throw flour in my face and wilt and pretend that it is the result of many hours of hard labor. :-P   I make up the marinade and then put in either flank steak or skirt steak (which is often cheaper) in freezer bags and freeze it in the marinade. Then, I just pull it out and it's all ready to go. The longer the marinating time, the better!

I've been looking for an alternative marinade for a while, and thought I'd try this one. I was a little scared trying one that hadn't been reviewed yet. But, boy am I glad I did!! I was NOT disappointed. I'd give this 5 stars except the cut of meat recommended was too tough for the marindate to tenderize. I will try with a better cut of meat next time! The flavor was terrific and I will use this recipe again and again! Works great on meat cooked under the broiler, too.

This is by far the best marinade I have ever found.  I made beef kabobs.  I do not like beef and I thought it was delicious.  My children and husband devoured the kabobs.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is by far the best marinate for most kinds of meat.  You don't have to use the orange juice.

I actually used this not on beef but on a ham.  it was really really good.  we baked the ham for a couple hours and then started basting this (didn't use it as a marinade) about every 10-15 min for the last hour, hour and 1/2.  it was mmmm good!!!

I couldn't make this recipe as is, I had to modify so I could use what I had on hand.  I had some oranges that were pretty ripe and didn't want 2 waste them and that is why I chose this.  The only thing I did different is I just squeeze the juice out of the oranges and used that, and I used vegetable oil instead.  I also added a smidge of worcheshire because I like how it tastes on beef =).  Awesome recipe, definitely keeping this one around

Has anyone tried using this as a basting sauce on spareribs?  Thinking of doing this this weekend.  Sounds wonderful to me.  Only giving this a four until I try it with the ribs.  Can't wait.

I love this simple marinade and have used it several times now.  Really great on chicken breasts.  I use honey instead of sugar.  I did try it on round steak, which I think is similar to flank and even marinating for a long time was still tough.  But loved the flavor.  Just read the review about adding port wine and will try that next time.

This is a wonderful marinade which I will definitely use again. I must agree with WICKSY as to the BEST STEAK MARINADE IN EXISTENCE, it is a true winner. Thank you Kookie for its submission. I, too, get tons of compliments when I use it.

I tryed this with beef sirloin. Wonderful flavour. I let it mairinate overnight, and I found the meat a little tough. I tryed it again but mariinated 3 hrs and was better. A little confused. I thought the longer marinating the more tender.

THANK YOU sue! So simple and So good! Been using this several months now. No matter what cut of beef it's always great! London broil has been my favorite. Most recently marinated beef (stew) cubes in a baggie ALL day in the cooler then bbqed kabobs at the swim club. Fellow swimmers were wondering what smelled so good...

Excellent!  Wonderful flavor!  I will use this again and again.  This first time, I did have to use orange-pineapple juice, as I didn't have orange juice on hand.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor, tender meat. Used this on beef but will be trying it on other meats as well. I broiled a couple different cuts of steak and they turned out great. The kids even loved it!

If you want this marinade to be an eye-popping experiencing, add 3 T. port wine.  OMG!!  It is that good!

This was very good, but not any better than plain old Italian dressing, which has always been my favorite steak marinade. I may try it on chicken or pork one of these days, but for beef I'll stick with my tried and true (and easier) Italian dressing.

easy and Delicious.  I did cut the brown sugar back by half however.  Not that crazy about overly sweet meat.  I marinated for one day in a zip-loc bag in fridge and made Shish Kabobs out of Flank Steak that my butcher had on sale.  Very good.  I would like to try this marinade with Pork Chops!  I think some fresh garlic would be a good addition mext time I try it.

This is my 1st time reviewing, so  u know I love it! I used thinly sliced sirloin tip. Let it marinate about 5 hours, my husband threw it on the grill. YUMMIES! Big hit with the family! We're already thinking of other things to use it with. I definitely will be cutting & pasting (the old fashioned way) this for my real life recipe box!

Made exactly as called for, excellent.  A hint of sweet, perfecto!  I used NY strip steak, but think flank would be great too.

Good flavor and easy to make!  My husband immediately told me the beef tasted good before I even asked his opinion :-)

I used this for chicken. We do not drink orange juice, but we drink pineapple, so that it what I used. Very yummy. Marinated it for about 9 hours.

I really was looking forward to this since there were so many great reviews. I did sirloin kebabs but all I tasted was orange. They browned really nicely on the grill, though.

I don't usually cook London Broil but I decided to try it with this marinade.  It was perfect!!  I put the marinade on top of the meat in a glass dish (covered) for 2 days.  Even my fussy adult son liked this.   We cooked it on the grill to a medium doneness.   It may have been even more tender had we eaten it rare but none of us wanted it that way.

Used this on london broil.  Only marinated 4 hours--next time will do more.  But thought was very good!  Will also try freezing along with meat in a ziplock as someone else suggested.

Have an electric outside grill that I'm still learning about. I cut my own pork chops from whole loins.Scaled this recipe down for 3 servings, the put the chops to soak in the marinade overnight in a zip bag. WOW...Unbelievably tasty and moist, with a really, REALLY great flavor. Nice job, Ms. Sauer!!!

This was a great marinade.  After grilling the flank steak, I used it on top of a caesar salad with cheese tortellini.  This was a great simple dish - everything on one plate!  Great summer dish!

I like this because of its ease and use on any number of meats. I tripled the recipe then added a teaspoon of ground ginger and a mix of  freshly ground black and white pepper to taste.  This made the flavor a bit more complex.  I am still debating, though, whether my changes made this better or not.
