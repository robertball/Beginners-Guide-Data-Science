Okay, I'm a born and raised NC girl.  I've been away for 4 years and crave BBQ daily.  I decided to make this to see what I got.  I used 4 pounds of pork shoulder, boneless, so I halved the recipe.  I did the rub exactly as is and marinated it overnight.  The next morning, I made up the sauce exactly as written, halved for the amount of pork.  After tasting it, I decided it needed more brown sugar so I added 2 more tablespoons.  I put half of the sauce and the pork in my slow cooker and cooked it for 8 hours.  I then took the pork out, let it cool and then shredded it.  (It was already falling apart.)  I used a large spoon to take all of the fatty oil off of the good bits in the bottom of the slow cooker, and then I added the rest of the sauce, in addition with about 1/4 cup more brown sugar.  I then put the pork back in.  That is EXACTLY what I grew up eating, and my husband, a NC boy, completely agrees!  I am so happy, I can't begin to tell you!!!  Thank you SO much for this recipe!

We love North Carolina barbeque and have been looking for a recipe for a long time.  This is a good one.  I did make some changes though, as I was cooking it in the oven.  Before I used the rub I stabbed the pork to make some slits in the meat.  Then I put a tablespoon of liquid smoke on top and bottom of the meat.  Then I used the rub.  I wrapped the pork in heavy foil and put it in the refrig all day.  Before I went to bed I preheated the oven to 350 degrees.  Then I put the foil-wrapped pork in a pan in the oven overnight.  By seven the next morning it was smelling wonderful and the meat was falling off the bone.  I let it sit for about an hour and then shredded the meat.  The fat just fell away leaving all that wonderful pork.  As for the sauce, I thought it had a very strong vinegar flavor, so I added more brown sugar (a 1/4 cup at a time) until it tasted as I thought it should.  Totally, I put in 1-1/4 cups of brown sugar.  I also heated the sauce on the stove top until the sugar disolved.  I also added 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke to the sauce.  Then I mixed the pork into the sauce and let the whole thing simmer for about a half hour.  Wonderful flavor.  Tasted just like what we remembered from Lexington.

This is the 3rd time I've made this and my family loves it.  I decided to cook the pork in a crockpot.  I added 2 T. of salt and 2 T. of Liquid Smoke and cooked it on High for 8 hours.  I then made the existing sauce recipe.  With a 5-1/2 lb. pork butt using a single recipe, the meat soaked up all the sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce.  I omitted the salt since I put it on the meat before cooking.  I also reduced the red pepper to 2 tsp.

I cooked this in the crockpot on low, overnight, with the addition of some liquid smoke.  It was so easy to make a just wonderful.  I'll never use another recipe.

PLEASE READ THIS AND CHECK OUT ADLEVINE's 2003 REVIEW...I've been making this for almost two years and thanks to ADLEVINE (a reviewer in 1/2003), it was a hit from the beginning!  I omit the liquid smoke, hot paprika and white pepper, and cook all day (6-7 hours)in the oven at 325 COVERED WITH TIN FOIL.  Simmer for about an hour in the sauce.  Also, I'm too lazy to "rub the butt" the night before, so I just do it right before I put it in the oven.  Believe me, even with these lazy changes, I can call my friends at work while the ham is in the oven (I'm a homemaker) and they'll come running to my house when they get out!  They even pick up the rolls themselves!  Reheats awesome; even brought a baggie full on a river trip and ate it cold - a great snack!

This recipe is identical to the one found in 'The Barbecue Bible' by Steven Raichlen (Workman Press).  I smoke a 5.5lb Boston butt in a offset horizontal smoker (Chargriller with side fire box) an hour per pound at 300 degrees with a mix of hickory and cherry chips until internal temp of 195.  Contrary to other comments it does NOT turn into jerky at this temp if done correctly using a smoker.  In an oven it may dry out at this temp.

Some tips- instead of 2 cups of vinegar, start with one and adjust to taste; also Raichlen includes a recipe for Carolina Cole Slaw to use as a side.  Finely shred a head of cabbage with a mandolin and coat with ~1 cup of vinegar sauce.  Mound the pork on a grilled hamburger bun, top with slaw, and enjoy.

Simply delicious- but no amount of liquid smoke will replicate the results of a bona fide charcoal smoker.

We lived in Suffolk, VA when my husband was in the Navy and pulled pork sandwiches with cole slaw were everywhere. Back here in Pa - they have no clue what BBQ pork is.  Found this recipie and made it for our VFW (using 4 six pound rump roasts) and everyone raved.  This is the only recipe you will ever need for pulled pork.  Don't forget to top your sandwich with good coleslaw - you'll never want it any other way. UPDATE: just finished making this again using leftover pork roast and the sauce is amazing! Upset that some reviewers cut vinegar/pepper flakes and others added bottled sauce. This is true Southern pulled pork and it is perfect.  If you want BBQ pork with a thick sauce (like BBQ ham sandwiches) like they serve up north this is not the recipe for you. Please don't rate it badly simply because you are not familiar with Southern pulled pork.

This was good.  I was really looking for an Eastern NC style barbeque and it is almost there.  I did as others suggested by decreasing the vinegar and adding more brown sugar, but I wish I had not.  I found the meat more sweet than what I wanted and without the zing of the vingear.I also added liquid smoke to the roast before cooking since I was not smoking it. I cooked mine for 8hrs on low in the crock pot with 1/2 the sauce +  and then pulled the meat out to cool. I drained the  sauce which has a good amount of oil from the fat.  After, shredding the meat- it most fell right off the bone, I put the meat back in the crock pot and  pour the remaining sauce over.  I will definitely make again, but will add more than 1 cup of vinegar as so many reviewers mentioned.  I think it really depends on how sweet you like barbeque.    I am giving the recipe 5 stars because I think if I had followed the recipe, it would have been closer to what I wanted :) Thanks!  It was so moist and flavorful!

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I made this and used the full 2 cups of vinegar, which pretty much ruined a good thing. I love vinegar, but this was way too much in my opinion. But the meat was very tender and very tasty right after it was done cooking in the spices. I will make this again, but will try cutting the vinegar in half (at least) and adding more ketchup and brown sugar.

This was great.  I used a 3 pound roast.  Cooked it in the oven covered on 290 for 6 hours.  It was very tender and juicy.  We didn't even make the sauce.  We just dipped our bread in the meat juice.

Second time making this. I too rubbed hickory smoke all over the roast, then put the rub on the roast (I added seasoning salt and some poultry seasoning to the other ingredients) and cooked it at 325 in my oven all day. Served it on big smooshy buns with sides of baked beans, cole slaw and corn, and it felt like a 4th of July picnic! PS As for the sauce you really do have to cut the vinegar down by half, and I added more brown sugar as well. I tossed the pork in this, and then served at the table Bulls Eye BBQ sauce that I doctored up with garlic, honey and mustard.

Okay all y'all who reviewed this recipe without using a smoker or grill:  
You are SERIOUSLY MISSING OUT.  
Your choice, but trust me when I say that your crock pot cannot in any way shape or form recreate the flavor of a big a$$ butt, rubbed with spices and smoked for 12 hours over slow heat for tenderness.   
Yes, use the rub, it ROCKS. 
But USE A SMOKER too.  
Once you do, you'll NEVER go back- this recipe will make you FAMOUS.  
If you don't think you have time to babysit a smoker on the day of your event, then smoke in advance, pull the pork and freeze it.  
You can reheat it in the crock pot on the day of your party.  
In fact, do what we did and smoke 4 butts at a time, pull and freeze so you have real mouth watering BBQ when you want it.
Another reviewer said if you don't like NC BBQ- vinegar style, then don't try this recipe.
I have a different opinion.
DO try the recipe- do everything it says except make the vinegar sauce.  
Instead use your own favorite sweet sauce.  
We are partial to NC brand "Bone Suckin' Sauce" or Honey Mustard BBQ sauce.  
That bein' said, There ain't no need fo' a ton of sauce to cover up the pure, incredible flavor of the pulled pork 'cause it shines on its own.  
We made 2 butts and 2 shoulder roasts for our son's graduation party and people just inhaled the stuff.   
Well worth the 12 hour smoke time...  
That's how we do it in Southern Virginia...  :)

I have made variations of this recipe many times and have found that the best way to obtain the real smoked/BBQ flavor using a Weber type grill is to BBQ indirectly as stated for about 2 hours, then cover with foil and transfer to a 300deg oven for 2 more hours or into the crockpot for 4-6 hours.  This way the meat retains all it's external smokey goodness,  doesn't dry out at the surface and still "falls off the bone" as advertized when you're ready to "pull".  As for the sauce, NC BBQ is famous for it's thin, vinegary sauce which absorbes directly and totally into the pulled meat, but adding more sugar or any other favorite ingredient is always up to the cook.

I am from North Carolina, and never have I tasted this sauce in north Carolina. It surely has nothing to do with the eastern half of the state. If you want search for something like "Eastern North Carolina Pulled Pork Barbecue" yes it is tangy.

This was absolutely great! My hubby and I both love pulled pork, but hate the kind drowning in thick, sugary sauce. I used a pork loin roast, used the rub and chilled it overnight. I also made the sauce a day ahead of time, and it was much better the next day. I cook the roast wrapped in foil in the crock pot for 6 hours on high, then shredded it and put it back in on warm. I stirred about a quarter of the sauce into the pork, then served the rest on the side. This sauce is GREAT: tart, tangy, spicy with a faint hint of sweetness. I wouldn't increase the sugar, but I guess that's my preference. This recipe is definitely a keeper, and probably the best pulled pork I've ever had (restaurants included). NOTE: wait until after you cook the pork to take off the fat. You have to let it cool for a bit before you, but the fat adds a lot of flavor and keeps the pork from drying out. Plus it's a lot easier to take it off after it's cooked.

Absolutely top shelf! I made some slight adjustments in the rub spices to suite our taste, added liquid smoke and reduced the vinegar as per suggestions below and cooked it in the oven. Served topped with creamy coleslaw on home-made potato rolls with a pickle spear on the side, I could have sworn we'd picked them up at a roadside barbecue place just outside of Salisbury, NC! Thanks so much, Doug!

This has to be some of the best pulled pork I have ever had!! The rub recipe is unique and adds lots of flavor. I made this recipe in a roaster on my gas grill. I used a smoker box with hickory chips inside as well. I cooked a 9.1 lbs shoulder roast @ 375 degrees and I hit my desired internal temp at 168 f. It only took me 4.5 Hours to cook. The only thing that I changed in this recipe was the sauce at the end. I used only half the vinegar which was still plenty, doubled the brown sugar and put in about a 1/4 cup of honey as well. LOVED IT!!!!! Great recipe

This was very easy....I had to make it in the crockpot. I also placed the meat with rub in the fridge overnight. Also cooked on top of two quartered onions. Huge party hit. Served with potato rolls and swiss cheese as suggested by another reviewer. We made the sauce that came with this recipe, plus offered Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy for options. We ALSO had some of my famous home-made cole slaw and mashed yukon garlic potatoes for those who weren't in the mood for a sandwich. Great meal!

I am from North Carolina. I love pulled pork and I grew up eating it.  When I saw this recipe I could not believe this is the same recipe that I grew up on. I did not cook mine on the grill. I do love the flavor of hickory wood in the pulled pork. I cooked half of pork loin in my crock pot using this sauce. I also added 2 tablespoons liquid smoke. I cut back on the salt (just a preference) and it turned out very good. Thank you Doug for sharing this recipe. Reminds me of home (my parents)

This recipe is fantastic.  I've made it on the grill, in the slow cooker, and in the oven.  Always great, although on the grill is definitely the best.  I have noticed many people have changed the recipe and that most negative reviews mention that they aren't fans of the strong vinegar flavor.  That's what North Carolina BBQ is!  If you don't like vinegar, don't try this recipe.

I made this the 1st time in July 2010...love, love, loved it! Just the NC style I was introduced to years ago and wanted to re-visit it. When I made it in July, I had to take some serious short-cuts, because I just stumbled upon this recipe, the same day I decided to prepare a 'que'. I only had the dry rub on for maybe a an hour or two, slow-cooked in oven (used liquid smoke), did the sauce and it was still amazing!  I'm now preparing it for the 2nd time...already knew what I wanted to do with pork butt shoulder when I saw it on sale! So this time, I've got the dry rub on it....the night before I'm going to make it, again in a 'slow oven' and can't wait for the results!  Btw, I use Bragg's raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar, it's the one with the "Mother" (it's cloudy) - makes a world of difference, and has great health benefits, as well. The taste isn't as stringent or as "vinegary" as regular cider vinegar. I love it in the sauce.

My husband and I have been making this recipe in a charcoal smoker for three years. We always get rave reviews. We cook it for about an hour per pound of meat or until the meat reaches 165 degrees.  I make the full amount of vinegar sauce but only add about half to the meat. Then put the extra on the table so company can add more if they like.

This really does make incredibly moist and flavorful pork - HOWEVER, the sauce is a Memphis-style sauce - sweet and ketchup-based.  As a native Carolinian,  I can say that true Carolina BBQ is dressed with a thin, vinegar-based chili sauce.  It's not for everyone, but it is a defining characteristic of Carolina Que.  Still a yummy recipe, though.

My family loved this. I cooked it in the slow cooker with liquid smoke as suggested by others. After 8 hours it was pull apart tender. I used less vinegar in the sauce and more tomato ketchup as my kids prefer food on the sweeter side.

This is the bomb!!!  Mine doesn't look as tomato-y as the picture, I used all the same ingredients except that I used liquid smoke 1-1.5 T since I don't have a smoker.   I trimmed the large parts of the fat before doing the rub. As recipe says, refrigerated overnight. I also mixed ingredients for sauce and refrigerated overnight. Roasted in oven to appropriate T. (Check meat T after 1 hr, so as not to overcook)  Allowed pork to cool before pulling the pork, yes tedious, but not as difficult as anticipated  (pulled easily using 2 forks).  Placed in large roasting pan, poured on the sauce.  Covered loosely with foil and placed on oven briefly at 400 to heat thoroughly before lowering heat to 300.   Slow cooked in oven for 2 hrs, stirring twice. Delicious, and easy. Living in Virginia Beach andChesapeake area (on the NC line)  this was easily found, even in our workplace cafeteria.  Moving back North, not at all, after almost 7 years, I think this is a definite keeper.

made this for the superbowl (go giants!) and it was perfect. cooked it in a slowcooker so we added the hickory liquid smoke. upped the brown sugar a little bit. used the full 2 cups of vinegar. if you're craving the Carolina experience of a vinegar sauce, use the full two cups!

Excellent recipe.  I used the dry rub and marinated the pork overnite.  Then next day I cooked it in a slow cooker all day with some chopped onions, bbq sauce and a bottle of honey beer.  This is definately a keeper!!  It's good served with swiss cheese on potato buns.

WOW, this is great.  I took the advice of others and only used 1 cup of vinegar and added more brown sugar.  The meat was so tender it fell apart.  My whole family loved it and it was even better the next day.  I will be making this again :-)

Awesome!  I cut the vinegar to 3/4 cup and increased brown sugar to 1/2 cup, as suggested.  I baked in the over all day and it smelled incredible (also baked a cake!).  Served on fresh rolls over deli cheddar cheese.  Yummy...the neighbors loved it as well.  Kids thought was a bit spicy (even though I halved the red pepper) but my kids are hard to please lately.

excellent. i followed the advice and added more sugar because i don't like things too vinegary. couldn't find hot paprika so left it out.
it was sooooo good the next day after sitting in the fridge. i cooked it in the oven for 6 hours at 325 since i don't have a smoker. very tender and wonderful flavor.

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party this weekend.  The pork chilled overnight with the rub, cooked it in my Nesco roaster for 24 hrs on low.  Simply delicious!  EVERYONE complemented me on the BBQ.  Minor changes I made:  cut back to 1 1/2 cup cider vinegar, bump up to 1/2 cup brown sugar, cut back to 2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, omitted the white pepper because I don't have it.  This delicious meal cost me way under $5.00 to make.

I made in the crock pot with some leftover pork flaps from ribs we had in the freezer. I really loved the sauce, so tangy. The hubs said he will try this on the smoker very soon...I can't wait.

This is FANTASTIC!!!I've spent years perfecting a sweet bbq sauce and grew up on vinegar based.I skoke my pork butts for 12-14 hrs at 230 degrees until internal temp. reaches 185 degrees.take pork off and let cool enough to pull.I boil sauce with only 2 teas. red pepper and add a 1 tbl butter and a squirt of lemon juice.,(I think it's too spicy for the kids otherwise and boiling really blends the flavors).After sauce boils and pork is pulled I coat the pork with the sauce.This is now a must have when we have a family get together.Thank You for the recipe.

I made this for Labor Day and what a hit! I used pork shoulder and, gathering bits and pieces from other reviewers, I put it in a roasting pan, rubbed the seasonings all over it and cooked it on 290 degrees overnight. The meat was falling off the bone by morning and the house smelled awesome! Wish I could try the smoking method but couldn't this year. I forgot to add the liquid smoke and didn't change the amounts on the liquid ingredients. My entire extended family loved it. We all agree that this is so much tastier than the sweet bbq pulled pork I usually make, in fact, that version seems sickly by comparison. I also made Mom's Coleslaw from this site and put it right on the pork sandwich as I read from other reviewers. AMAZING! If you haven't tried it like that, please do, it's beyond yummy! Thank you for this recipe, I will be a staple in my own collection now!

Wow this is the real stuff.  Lexington style BBQ.  My husbands grandparents live in Lexington, NC and we eat the BBQ quite often.  This is really close to the real stuff, only it is a bit too spicy for us, I think next time I will leave out some of the red pepper flakes.  And if you want the real NC style BBQ, use the full amount of vinegar, I did and it is great.  Made this with some of the BBQ "red" slaw and my husband loved it.  Also, I did mine in the slow cooker and added 1 and 1/2 Tbsp. of liquid smoke, turned out great.  Thanks for a great recipe, now we can enjoy real NC BBQ without the 2 hour drive!!!

This recipe was a hit with my family. It was my first time making pulled pork and I highly recommend this recipe. I made it in the crockpot. The rub gave the meat so much flavor. I cut down the vinegar for the sauce after reading the reviews and added more brown sugar and some molasses instead. It was really the best pulled pork I have had!

I'm from NC and this as close to Lexington BBQ as I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did trim some of the fat from the meat before cooking. Be careful on the salt though, it was a tad salty. Next time I think I will omit anything that has salt in it from the rub and just substitute celery seed and garlic powder. This was a huge hit with my guests and even more so with me!. Thought I was back in NC...if you like Lexington BBQ you will love this!

Holy smoke!!  This recipe was incredible!!!  Out of 7 lbs of pork, I had no leftovers, and people begging for more.  I actually purchased a side fired Chargriller to do this dish, as well as many dishes yet to come. While I had trouble getting the cooking chamber temp over 225 degrees using the side burner, it may have worked to my advantage.  The fire was hot at 6:30 am and the pork was pulled at 3:30 pm, about 2-3 hours longer than planned.  It took multiple reloads of coal and hickory to achieve this, but "WOW" was it worth the wait.  The pork was incredibly moist and simply falling apart, and once the sauce from the recipe was added, Mmmmm.  Note, I took advise from others and cut the cider vinegar to one cup, and scaled back the amount of red pepper flakes to 2 tsp.  Add the slaw from "IHallidays's" post, and you'll be in heaven. I can't wait untill I can one this one again!!

This is by far the best recipe for North Carolina pulled pork barbeque. Follow the recipe and you will be in for a real treat. The only thing you need is a recipe for hot cole slaw to top it off.

I lived in North Carolina for a few years and this is very similar to authentic Carolina barbeque. If your don't like the vinegary taste of Carolina barbeque only use half and substitue store bought barbeque sauce for the ketchup.

This is a wonderful recipe! We really enjoyed it, although we all felt there was too much of a vinegar taste. Next time I'll cut back on it, and there WILL be a next time!! We added plain BBQ sauce to the sandwiches just before we ate and it really let the flavor of the meat shine through. Incredibly tender, too. The smoking hickory chips really added a nice taste, not to mention the smell, which filled my whole block with an aroma that had my neighbors walking around sniffing at the air. Thanks for another "keeper"!!

Takes a while to prepare, butt(pardon the pun), when the labor of love is over this is to die for. There is a problem though, the recipe says to cook (a)pork butt, not enough this order needs to be doubled or tripled just to last to the next morning.

The pork was awesome! Loved it... glad we did since it took a lot of work! The sauce... could have ruined it. 
I was able to doctor it to our liking. WAY too much vinegar. Plus it was VERY thin. (Even after I doctored it) After my adjustments.. I'd give the pork itself a 5, the sauce a 4. Before my adjustment.. I would give the sauce a 1 or 2. Hence the 3 rating. 

We will use the smoked pork idea again though!

I made this when my mom was in the hospital and took it to my dad. He doesn't like pork, but enjoyed this so much that he called friends and invited them over to have some! Six months later he's still talking about it! Now, I did make some changes that others suggested, like cutting the vinegar down significantly, but didn't change much else.

The rub sounds good, however, the temperature you should reach is not nearly hot enough for the pork to have all the connective tissues broken down. I've removed a shoulder from the grill @ this temp and it tasted good, but was not "ready." 190 is pretty much the minimum temp to reach internally. This could take upwards of 12 hours. I've smoked several shoulders recently, on a Weber 22.5" Kettle, indirect heat. Took 13 hours. The result was pork that didn't need a fork to pull it, the pressure of my hands caused it to simply flatten.
Soaking chips and putting on your coals, you risk putting out the coals. Better to use some fist size chunks of wood (4-5) and call it good. Once the meat reaches 140F internal, it will not take any additional smoke flavor. From that point on, you just need to keep cooking. I do my brisket in the same manor. Once you reach 190F, pull it from the grill, double wrap in heavy duty foil, put into an empty cooler, and let it rest for 2-4 hours. It will continue to cook and tenderize. The results are nothing less than awesome! On the cider vinegar, if you want real zing, make sure you use an unfiltered cider vinegar. I couldn't believe the difference in taste.

Oh. my. gosh.  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for!  So great and so easy!
I only had a 1 1/2 lb roast but I just halved the sauce ingredients because we like a lot of sauce.  I only used 3/4 cup of the vinegar (not 1 cup) because of previous reviewers.  Added a little more brown sugar, a good glug of Liquid Smoke  and subbed some chili powder for the red pepper flakes.  All I did was mix up the sauce ingredients (with my changes) and poured it over the defrosted roast in the slow cooker.  Cooked on low for about 8 hours.  Vinegar-y, sweet, with just the right amount of heat for us.  Served on potato rolls - DELISH!  Thank you!

Thank you, Thank you....I have been trying various recipes for 6 years to try and get this taste down.  You have made it possible for me to finally get it right.  I tweaked a bit, not quite so hot and a little more sugar a wee bit less ketchup, but, stiring and tasting, I finally got it perfect with your recipe.  Tons of thanks to you.  My husband who does not like BBQ, loved this.  The rub is perfect too.  Hugs from an old lady to you Doug.

160 degrees is way too low for pork shoulder, as is the 6 hour cooking time.  The meat is barely in the plateau at 160, and it needs to remain there for at least 2 to 4 hours to break down the connective tissues in this cut of meat.   I cook my shoulders at about 225 degrees on my wood smoker and it always takes about 20 hours or so to get to 195 degrees internal, which is the temp the meat should reach before you pull it.  Even if you want sliced shoulder (KC style), it needs to get to at least 175 to 180 before pulling it from your cooker.

This is by far the best pulled pork that we have ever tried.  I cooked mine in the crock pot on low for 6 hours (didn't have any charcoal).  Then shredded the meat and put back in the pot on low for a couple hours with the sauce.  I would like to try it on the grill next time.  Very moist and delicious.  Wonderful flavor.

***** (5 extra stars!) This was the best pork BBQ I've had!! I tried it out on an experienced group of food testers (my family!) and they ALL agreed that this was wonderful!  (ok, my 11 yr old son said it was "THE BOMB!!!").  I used a 4-5 lb. boneless pork roast (it was on sale!) and marinated it in the rub (I also added liquid smoke) for about a day and a half.  I then put it in the crockpot with about 1/2 cup of water & let it cook for 10 hrs. It just fell apart and was so delicious!  For the sauce--I also cut down on the vinegar to 1 cup and used the watery drippings in the bottom of the crock pot for the water that is required.  I also added a few squirts of liquid smoke.  I will be stocking up on pork roasts to make this more often!!!!!  GREAT RECIPE-Thanks!

This recipe was ok. Fall apart tender, which is why I gave it five stars. The sauce was a little too vinegary for our taste though. I made mine in a slow cooker like another reviewer suggested and poured some of the sauce in while the roast cooked. Maybe that was the problem. It turned out really tender, but next time I'll try a different recipe for the sauce. Guess were just used to midwestern style BBQ sauces.

This recipe is great!  I was not able to smoke the meat on the grill so I made it in the crock pot.  I added all the ingredients and cook it on low for 8-9 hours.  It turned out moist, tender, and juicy!  Oh and I used a pork butt.  I made it twice already!  Great recipe!

Excellent! I did the rub, scoring the meat a bit to really get the seasoning in, then let it set. I wanted to have this done when we got home and since I didn't want to leave the grill unattended I made some adjustments. I grilled it for an hour, searing the meat and putting a nice char on it, then I put it in my crockpot. It was perfectly done when I wanted it and had that wonderful smoky flavor- the natural way! I adjusted the sauce to my taste, using less vinegar, salt and peppers adding some cajun seasoning and molasses. The whole result was INCREDIBLE!

I put the dry rub on & left it overnight in fridge....this am  cooked it for 1 hr at 350deg in an open roasting pan then transfered it to a covered pot & cooked it for 3 hrs at 270 deg  in that juice. Really really good! thanks!

The meat itself was excellent. I cooked it on my BBQ with wood chips for a little over three hours to reach 165 degrees. I was afraid it would be tough because it cooked rather quickly, but it wasn't at all. As for the sauce - that's a different story. I cut the vinegar to just over 3/4 cup and I still thought it was pure stank. If you like pouring gasoline over good meat, go for it, but I would definitely recommend using a different sauce. I'd stick with a Memphis style sauce.

The "vinegar hot sauce" was too spicy for my guests, even though they enjoy spicy foods - and I even used less red pepper than the recipe called for.

I read a lot of reviews saying the meat was dry. Here is my suggestion: Follow the directions of the recipe but cook the meat in a roasting pan, covered, with a little liquid at the bottom at 300 degrees for 5-6 hours, basting with pan juices every hour or so. I guarantee the meat will be falling apart. After the meat is cooked, pull apart and pour bbq sauce over it, don't bother simmering, it is already tender enough. Hope this helps!

Awesome! Just served this for a Carolina Panthers party and it was a HUGE hit!  Thank You Doug!  A few comments/suggestions for others: (1) increase the salt to 2 tsp (2) after the meat has cooked, place it in a closed paper bag for 1 hr to further tenderize the meat (3) an 8 lb roast yielded about 15 sandwiches.  thanks again!!!

this is a fantastic recipe. The vinegar sauce is not what I expected but it was phenomenal. I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes. I actually just picked up a 20lb pork loin and will be using that to make this recipe this weekend for a party.

This is our go-to pulled pork recipe! We use it just as directed and we love the results. There are times when we are unable to smoke it but have found it is still wonderful if I put it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours then shread it into a skillet and add the sauce. We also sometimes double the sauce and use on other meats. Have some sauce in the fridge now! Works great!!!

Among the top 5 meals I've ever made.  I'm also a barbecue hound, & this tasted better than anything I've ever had in NC.  I went to college in NC, & we ate all kinds of Q, including smoking whole pigs ourselves (I wasn't the cook!).  

Marinated overnight as directed.  I used a Smokey Joe Weber charcoal grill, and two kinds of Kingsford charcoal.  Kingsford sells hickory charcoal that gets added to normal coals.  I custom-made a charcoal box using a toaster oven pan, and drilling holes in the bottom for airflow.  This allowed for the proper indirect heating set up.  I placed a smoker box next to the charcoal box, so the two were touching, and filled it with hickory chips.  Chunks are better but I couldn't find any.  I did not soak them because that makes steam, not smoke.

Once it was hot, meat on.  I flipped and rotated the two 5 pound pork shoulders every hour, and stoked the fire three times with more charcoal (hickory charcoal each time).  I also added a few hickory chips directly into the hot coals.  Every thirty minutes, I blew on the coals to keep them going and kept the vents open most of the time.  I monitored the temp using an iGrill.  After 5 hours the internal temp had stopped at 158.  Ideal Q temp is 195-203.  Yes 203.  I moved the meat directly over the coals for the last 90 minutes.

The meat was unbelievably tender and shredded easily.  I used half the vinegar but all of everything else in the sauce.  Perfect.  14 adults finished all of it and raved.

So good!  Cooked it in my pressure cooker for about an hour and a half with the sauce.  Turned out way better than expected.  I didn't have onion power or celery seeds, so I just finely minced an onion and a stick of celery and threw it in the pot with the meat.  When the meat was done, I took it out, strained the sauce, shredded the meat, and put it back in the pot with the strained sauce.  Wow!  Even my kids loved it!!

We moved to TX from NC and have been craving NC pulled pork.  I cooked my boneless whole pork loin in the crock pot all day, skimmed the fat and shredded it and poured this sauce on and it hit the spot.  Almost as good as being back in NC!

This was awesome! Kids loved it. Everyone did. Even better as leftovers the next day. I used half the recipe with a 4 lb roast. I did as others suggested and used liquid smoke in the sauce and all over the roast before I rubbed it down. I cooked it in the oven in a cast iron dutch oven with lid for 3 hours at 300-325. It was moist and juicy. Since I made half the size roast I made half the sauce, but it does soak it up so, if you want more sauce, make the whole recipe or double according to size roast. I made it a little too spicy this time, will use less heat next time. Didn't have spicy paprika so I used a little cayenne pepper. I found a vinegary coleslaw recipe to top the sandwiches with, and it was perfect. Very authentic. This will be a regular in our home

After reading so many negative reviews of the vinegar sauce, the first time I tried this recipe, I followed the rub part exactly and then just added 1/2 cup cider vinegar and some Sweet Baby Ray's. The Baby Ray's killed all that great, spicy flavor.  I ended up having to go back and add more vinegar, flakes, pepper, basically, I should have just gone with the original recipe!

The second time, I went with the original recipe (using only 1 cup of vinegar) and it was excellent, just not quite saucy enough.  I added half a bottle of BBQ sauce (Diana's Southern Smokehouse BBQ) and it was delicious.

I'm doing this pulled pork again (already rubbed and waiting in the fridge for tomorrow.)  The rub is perfect!  I put liquid smoke all over the pork and  double the amount of rub because I really like to get it into every nook and cranny.  I make it in a crock pot and it takes about 7 hours on low setting.  Maybe 2 cups of vinegar is a little much, but try 1 cup, it does not disappoint and blends seamlessly with the rub!  I also do about 2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes but I have kids who wouldn't tolerate the maximum spice.  

Excellent, excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing, Doug!

Simply delicious.  This is my go-to recipe for larger group parties during the summer months.  I followed some previous recommendations for making it in the slow cooker and adding liquid smoke.  Comes out perfect every time.

Now this is some good pulled pork... I made it in the crockpot and was not disappointed.  My husband claimed it was a little hot, but he can be a wimp... haha.  I thought it was great.  Thanks!

Delicious!  We have an electric smoker and smoked a 9 lb picnic pork shoulder at 225 degrees for 6 hours (until internal temp reached 160 degrees).  After 5 hours of smoking, we took it out, put it in foil and put it back in the smoker for an hour. Don't forget to take off the fatty skin before putting the rub on!

I made this using exact ingredients only I didn't have hot paprika so I just added some cayenne pepper, not much though to cut down on the spice. I doubled the sauce portion, as I know that NC style is more dry. It turned out to be the perfect amount, and it still wasn't as saucy as the picture. I didn't smoke it, cooked it stove top in a dutch oven covered, simmering about 4 hours. The first hour in water, saved some water for the sauce and sliced the meat. Then simmered the remaining time in the sauce until easily shredded with a fork, very good!

This is a really delicious recipe.  I am from the North, so I'm used to BBQ sauce in my BBQ.  When i first moved to NC I totally didn't expect the vinegar based BBQ that I was served.  It really grew on me though.  Now that I am pregnant I have been craving it and decided to give it a shot using this recipe.  I did cook in my slow cooker, but other than that i followed the ingredient list.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 2 hours and then reduced it to low for another 6 hours.  The result was delicious and I have never used another recipe for home made pulled pork since.

Spice was good, but cooking/smoking a butt to 160 is ridiculous.  Yes, that is what you need to cook pork to for it to be done, but to fully tenderize and dissolve all the tendons and tissues, your looking at closer to 210-220 dgrees.

I am reviewing this as of now for the sauce only.    It's delicious!  I used a little less vinegar (b/c I ran out) and less red pepper for the kids.  All in all very good and next time, I will try prepping the pork with all the seasonings (although I will still cook it in the slow cooker).  Edited: Did the spice rub on the pork and let sit overnight...made sauce as written and it's really spicy!  Next time will cut the crushed red pepper in half at least and maybe use just a touch less vinegar, 1 and 3/4 cup perhaps. Edited again: Will use about 1/2 the white pepper next time too.

We smoke massive amounts of pork and then freeze it in portioned bags. I made just the sauce last night. It was great. Cut the serving size to 6 but it did need a little more sugar. My honey loved it. He thinks we should add some chopped jalapeno next time. I followed some suggestions and made a coleslaw with some of the sauce. Perfect together. So much better than sweet sticky stuff. Thanks for the great suggestions. ( I agree you can't make bbq without a smoker. )

I put my 8 lbs. of pork butt into the oven the night before, temp. at 300 degrees and in the early morning found it to be cooked through and pull apart tender.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used only 1 cup of vinegar, and I'm really glad, another cup would have been way too much vinegar for us. After pouring on the sauce, it seemed too dry so I made another full batch of the sauce and that was just enough liquid for an 8 pound pork butt.  Also, for a double batch of sauce, I did not double the amount of pepper flakes, I kept it at 4 teaspoons and I'm glad because otherwise it would have way too spicey for us.  Thanks for a great recipe, we just loved it.

This is fantastic!  I baked it in the oven, wrapped in foil and resting on a small rack in a covered roasting pan.  I poured off all of the fat before pulling the pork and returning to the pan.  For the sauce I included 2 tsp. of liquid smoke, reduced the red pepper flakes by half, doubled the brown sugar and including the amount of vinegar called by the recipe.  I heated the sauce in a saucepan before adding to the pork.  We noticed that the red pepper and vinegar flavors were more subtle after cooking through the meat than when tasted from the saucepan.  This is going to be one of our favorites for a long time.

Taste great , and you can adjust the salt intake by changing "celery salt" to "celery seed" and "garlic salt" to "garlic powder". It does not change the taste.

This was fabulous.  One thing I did do based on other suggestions was cut the vinegar to one cup and use 1/2 cup brown sugar in the sauce.  I also added regular barbeque sauce to the sauce.  Probable about 1/4 to 1/2 cup.  Once it was completed I added more salt, cayenne pepper and more hot pepper flakes to the pan as I was cooking it with the sauce.  I think this works better because you can control the taste you want instead of putting more in the vinegar sauce and trying to make it right.  Let it sit over night for the flavors to mingle and you will have a hit.  Mine was scored 9 out of 10.  I think that is pretty good.

I took the advice of those before me and decreased the vinegar and red pepper, increased the water and brown sugar, and added liquid smoke to the marinade and the simmering sauce. I also cooked it in the oven overnight on 225 and the bone fell right out of the meat! Next time I will replace even more vinegar with water and up the brown sugar again as well. If you like tangy, sweet, and hot this recipe is for you!! PS Make it along with Restaurant Cole Slaw (from this site) the two harmonize beautifully!!

This is wonderful!  After reading the reviews I only used 1 cup of vinegar and thought it was enough.  I also added 1 teaspoon of Cavender's Greek Seasoning to the rub.  We ate it as a 'meat and potato' dinner the first night then made sandwiches the next night, only three of us.

I'm Canadian (Vancouver, B.C. area) and we don't have pulled pork but read the recipe and thought it sounded interesting.  I did as another wrote and cooked my pork overnight in a slow oven wrapped in foil.  By morning the pork was incredibly tender.  The only down fall of this method - cooking at night - is you wake up smelling it and get hungry!  Made this as a "trial" recipe at my husband's 35 birthday party - we had 15 for dinner and it was a huge success. Will definitely make it again!  Thanks!

We cooked a very large pork butt overnight for our Father’s Day pulled pork and served along-side pulled chicken, corn on the cob, coleslaw, baked beans and some fruit side dishes. We put very little of the red cayenne and red pepper flakes in,  but added a tablespoon of liquid smoke. Nearly all of the pulled pork was gone with lots of the chicken remaining. It was a hit with young and old!

Made this today as a test for a big family get together in Aug. so I made by the recipe to see if it needs adjustments. I think it is to hot for a large group that includes some young ones. I'll probably make it with just 2 tsp of red pepper. I like it the way it turned out.

Everyone loves this when I make it. I will say though, I believe that your smoking time is off a bit. I would strongly suggest using a meat thermometer so you dont serve undercooked  pork.

Awesome recipe.  I put the rub on the roast (7.5 lb pork butt) and refrigerated it over night.  I followed the rub recipe but added some dill weed (one of my favorite spices), cut down on the salt, and used dark brown sugar since I didn't have any light brown.  Don't have a smoker so I used some oak bisquettes on my gas grill and grilled it for 2 hours on medium / medium-low heat which got the outside looking really nice (used a drip pan).

For the sauce I used the amount of cider vinegar the recipe called for, chicken broth instead of water (I hate using water), ran out of ketchup (of all things) so I added some chili sauce, used a whole cup of brown sugar (per other reviews), cut down on the salt, a little liquid smoke, and threw in some pickle juice (bread & butter chip kind) for the hell of it (used all other ingredients listed as well).  I also chopped up a whole onion.  Threw everything in a slow cooker for about 6 hours on low heat, turned the roast a couple times during, and it turned out awesome.  Definitely a keeper.

The rub was adequate but I used smoked paprika instead of hot paprika and added tbs cayenne pepper for heat. Next time I will use more salt as well. Left butt in refrigerator overnight then put in oven at 350 for 6 1/2 hours. I read other comments and agree with many regarding the cider vinegar.I increased the brown sugar (dark) to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup molasses as well as a good splash of hickory smoke flavor not as good as smoked but I had a Grandsons birthday to attend. After removing the pork butt from the Dutch oven I poured off most of fat and made sauce as pork rested. Heated sauce in the Dutch oven making sure to get the fondant. After shredding the pork mixed into the sauce and ate on buns toasted with butter. EXCELLENT is the only word and the flavor improved as the sauce sat.

Made this on Sunday for the first time-My boyfriend said it tasted EXACTLY like our fave pulled pork at a great BBQ restaurant!  I used the 2 cups of vinegar and thought it was great- but we also LOVE vinegar.  Cooked the pork for 7-8 hours in the crockpot and added 1 T of cinnamon to the mix.  Served on toasted potato buns with baked beans and mac n cheese.  Amazing bbq dinner- this will now be one of my go to meals!!!

Great recipe.  Exactly the same as the one from the Barbecue Bilbe by Steve Raichlen, except for the water.

I've made this recipe several times and think it's the best barbeque recipe ever. I've made it in the crock pot and on our Big Green Egg. It's amazing either way. I didn't change a thing. The whole family loved it!

After all the work of cook'n and watch'n fireworks, finally home for the pork! Bummed,the sauce -WAAAYYY-to much vinegar...I added almost cup of Karo let it sit overnight and choked it down with bun,melted cheese and coleslaw to get kids to eat, hubby refused. Tasted great before the sauce though. Signed by the Northwest folk....

Great recipe!!  However, I use Apple wood plus 1 small piece of Hickory for smoking.  It makes a milder taste of smoke but great flavor.  I use the same rub recipe for Baby Back ribs.

My guests loved this different take (in this area, at least) on pulled pork!  I cooked it in the crockpot like other reviewers and then added the sauce when it was almost totally shreddable and cooked it in the oven in a broiling pan for the last hour.  Fabulous.  I used smoked paprika and liquid smoke while it was cooking.  I couldn't find hot or mild paprika (just plain old paprika).  Anyway, it was amazing!!!

I halved this recipe, and smoked the pork for 2 hours without heat.  I cooked it at about 300 degrees, covered, in the oven for about 4-1/2 hours with a little water and vinegar.  The meat practically fell apart on its own, and the wonderful scent of the meat tortured my husband all day, who couldn't wait for dinner!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was sooooo good.  My extra-picky room-mate actually asked me to make it again about two weeks after the first time.  Second time around, I got lazy and used bottled barbecue sauce.  I'm NEVER going to do that again, as it doesn't come close to the awesomeness of the sauce in this recipe.

To be fair, I cooked my pork shoulder the night before to make burritos, but I used the sauce, and it was fantastic.  I threw the rest of the shredded pork shoulder into a skillet with the sauce and let everything simmer for a while.  Delicious on a bun with coleslaw.  Reminded me of my childhood.  I highly recommend the sauce, but I will admit that I didn't try the rest of the recipe.  The sauce is so flavorful that it will probably overwhelm anything you do to the meat before you add it to the sauce.  This sauce is pretty vinegar-y, so beware if your idea of pulled pork involves anything approaching BBQ sauce.  This is definitely NC-style and goes best with a healthy heap of coleslaw on the sandwich. Delicious!

This recipe is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  Since it's the middle of winter, I made it in the crockpot instead of the grill... so I added a little liquid smoke.  I also used some extra brown sugar, but I think it would have been fine with the original recipe amount.  This is an awesome recipe if you like NC-style pulled pork... we served it with cole slaw on potato rolls, and made total pigs of ourselves two days in a row  =)  It's just like the BBQ we love on the Outer Banks!

This is worth the planning it takes.  I've made it for 70 and I've made it for 20, and everyone raves about it.  Take the suggestion others made and serve it with creamy coleslaw (At the party for 70 we put out a little sign suggesting to put the slaw on their sandwich- we don't live in North Carolina!).

This was just okay. I did follow the suggestions of others by using 1c. of Cider Vinegar and 1c of B. sugar but it still was a bit spicy/vinegary. I will stick to my normal recipe which involves slow cooking it in rootbeer, draining and then adding good ol' bbq sauce. That's our family's fave.

For the original recipe I give it only one star.  Reading the reviews most ppl are making huge changes to this.  I like to try the original first if it is rated so high.  I wonder if the recipe is correct.

I thought this recipe was awesome. I cheated alot and it still came out tender and favorful. In the interest of time, I used a smaller boneless pork roast (2.5 lbs), I didn't let the rub sit, and I slow cooked it in the oven. Since my roast was small, I only cooked it three hours. As suggested in other reviews, I cut back on the vinegar. I was a little nervous that my husband wouldn't like it because he's not normally into "barbecue", but he ate several helping and then requested it in sandwiches the next day. I've had pulled pork from North Carolina on our travels and I thought this was better.

I grilled/smoked my roast which was slightly under 8lbs for 5 hours until it reached 195 degrees...after resting it just fell apart, tender, juicy with amazing hickory smoke flavor. We didn't like the sauce, next time we'll eat just plain or with some Famous Daves. Our first time with this cut of meat and the smoking/indirect technique. I'm passing this recipe around the office for sure.

Really good.  I only used half of the crushed red pepper.  Remember that you will lose about 1/3 to 1/2 of your pork butt after smoking.

I followed this recipe pretty closely and thought it turned out great but it serves way more than 10 people. We had about 20 people over and made a recipe and a half and had more than half leftover, even after a lot of people had seconds! Also, I made this in the crock pot and after about 9 hours on low it was perfect. I waited a few more hours to serve it and just left it on low and it turned out fine. I made the sauce and added it after 9 hours and let soak in for the last 2 hours and it turned out great.

oh my heavens. we made this for Super Bowl sunday and it was an incredible hit. I cooked it for 12 hours, then put it in the freezer and pulled it out for the party letting it cook in the slow cooker again for the entire day. Always on low. I will Reduce hot pepper by half, it is spicy and I will double the brown sugar next time. It was amazing with the coleslaw suggested by another reviewer. Oh I also used a pork loin and it worked great!

I thought this was very good.  The rub was great.  The sauce was good.  I don't have a smoker so I made mine in the slow cooker.  I meant to add some liquid smoke but forgot to.  I will be making this again.  In the future I may even buy a smoker.  We had this on Ciabatta bread.

This is a winner.  I followed some of the previous reviewer's suggestions and wrapped my roast tightly in foil and baked overnight.  Served on soft onion rolls with cole-slaw for the perfect tailgate fare.  No leftovers, here!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This was the best pulled pork I have ever tasted. I did not have the means to cook it properly so I used a slow cooker and Big Al's BBQ sauce. Earth became heaven the moment I bit into my sandwhich. Make this for your family and they will be calling you god!

doug, used this 3 times already.  excellent!  here in so. ohio, bbq has to be red and sloppy.  after a couple of charlotte trips i new that a better pulled pork was out there and you have it!  although i can never do the same thing twice (chef's secret weapon) my folks love it.  my friend makes his own (red) sauce (very good) and was puzzled when 90% of my guests didn't use his sauce to top this pale pork!!  i haven't converted him yet but he's out to top me with something else.  thanks again.

I really liked this recipe.  To be honest, I only used the barbecue part since I had leftover pork that my husband smoked last weekend.  I scaled down the barbecue, going a little easier on the vinegar.  I put it into a crock pot and let it cook on low for a few hours, and the pork was soft, the barbecue tasty.  I liked it more than my husband because I am a huge fan of Carolina barbecue.  I served it on whole wheat rolls with peppers, onions, and mustard.  A great meal for a cool Sunday afternoon.

When I first read this recipe, I almost decided not to make it and then I read the comments.  I'm not a big vinegar fan and neither is my husband (anything with vinegar in it makes him sweat!!)  But i decided what the heck and broke down and made it this weekend (there's only two of us - should have invited all the kids over as it made a BUNCH!)  I did cut down on the vinegar as other viewers noted and also on the red pepper flakes.  It is a very good recipe and my husband will have stuff made for his lunch all week (which he said he would be glad to take)  I was looking for something differenct to fix and this fit the bill.  One word of caution - I cooked it in my oven at 250 for 6 hours and it could have used about 2  more hours of cooking time to make it fall off the bone as other reviewers noted.

Absolutely wonderful! This recipe is now a favorite all over town because I've served it at several parties and shared the recipe. It freezes beautifully.  It's extremely hot with red pepper, so if you don't want that, cut the pepper in half or even less. You might also want to cut the black and white pepper iin half.
Following some of the other reviews, I cut the vinegar to 1 1/3 cups and increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.

i went looking for a pulled pork recipe when my fav pork joint's pulled pork disappointed me one evening and i decided to make my own.  This was good, still not the pulled pork i've been craving (and i like a vinegar based sauce).  my Boyfriend thought the same thing i did, good but not great.  And my meat didn't fall off the bone like i hoped but when simmered w/ the sauce was very tender.  May play around w/ this recipe and try variations on it.  Overall i enjoyed it...but will continue my search!

Excellent recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this one.  I too took the advice of another reviewer and cut back on the vinegar and red pepper flakes and it came out great.  Also would like to note that cooking it in the oven overnight works very well... the meat just fell away from the fat and bone!

Excellent, especially considering my meat wasn't smoked.  Very close to Lexington barbecue.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked my 5 lb roast overnight at 250, wrapped tightly in foil.  The meat and fat separated perfectly. As to the complaint of some reviewers that NC Barbecue doesn't have any red - that depends on whether you're eating in the eastern (no red) or western part of the state.  I love it both ways though!

It was very good, but be careful with the red pepper flakes.  It turned out much too hot.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested cuting the amount of red pepper flakes in half.

We served this at a World Series Party here in Arizona where everyone likes their food a bit spicy.
All the adults raved about the pulled pork.  For smaller children we served the pork with either a Sweet Barbeque Sauce or plain.
This was great for a big crowd and can be done a little ahead of time leaving plenty of time for the host to relax.
This is a winner in our book as well as our neighbors!!.

I never really had good NC pulled pork, so I can't say how it compares to what locals may call authentic.  What I can say is that this recipe is tremendously good!!!  I  smoked a 9 lb pork butt using the rub listed in the instructions.  The rub was good but I felt there wasn't enough of it, at least for the size of butt I was using.  I smoked it at about 230 degrees for about 10 hrs the day prior to when I wanted to serve it.  When I took it out of the smoker I shredded it and placed the meat in a crock pot.  I then added the sauce and let it marinate overnight in the fridge.  The next day, I started heating it on low in the crock pot about 4 hrs before my guests arrived, stirring occasionally.   Couple notes about the sauce...  I mixed it up initially with only 1 cup of vinegar then added additional vinegar until I got the taste I wanted.  It ended up being only a bit more than 1 cup.  For my taste, I think 2 cups would have been a little much.  I also reduced the amount of pepper a bit since some of my guests were sensitive to spicy foods.  Served it on a semi hard roll piled high with some vinegar based coleslaw.  It was amazing!!!  This goes close to the top of my list for smoked foods I make.  It will definitely go into my regular rotation.

I found this to vinegary,  so I added 1/2 Cup extra Brown Sugar and 2 more ounces of Ketchup.  I will make it again, but I will only use 1 to 1 Cup of Cider Vinegar to start!

best  recipe yet for Carolina style BBQ.... I made it in a crock pot.  Used smokey Paprika (hickory flavor) instead of the mild Paprika.  Didn't change anything else.  Loved it.  If you use a crock pot, place a cereal bowl (safe for heat) upside down in the crock pot.  I added a 1/4 cup of water.  Don't be surprised when you take the bowl out of the crock pot and suddenly have a abundance of liquid in the pot.  (this works great for ribs too.  Keeps them dry and comes out super tender.

I used the main recipe for ingredients but I smoked on grill for 1 hour to sear the meat then put the meat and all ingredients into my Instapot for 45 minutes with 5 minutes natural pressure release and then quick release. Took the meat out and shredded and put back in the sauce. Turned out to be a family favorite

Love this recipe. I used half the meat but kept the amount of spice the same. Instead of adding water when done I just keep the juices from cooking (put in freezer to quickly skim fat off). Amount of vinegar it calls for adds a nice bite. Cooked in crockpot on low for 8 hours and it came out amazing, didn't bother searing beforehand.

Perfect, but I also took the short cut and used the slow cooker and liquid smoke.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I initially thought there was too much liquid but after shredding the pork and warming for an hour or so it was the perfect amount.  Thank you for sharing this!  I haven't had any this good since I was in NC!

I've made this for a few years now - with just a few twists
( using a 12 pound pork shoulder ) :

Make extra rub - make sure you reserve about 1/3 cup rub 

On the grill , load up hickory chips until you have so much smoke coming off it the neighbors start knocking on the door and call the fire dept.   Smoke all the meat for 1.5 hours.

Bring it all in, throw it in a crockpot for 12-16 hours with a 1/2 recipe of the sauce ( omit the water ) & two tablespoons of rub.

After it's done pour off the rendered fat & separate it - then use the collagen in place of the water in a second batch of sauce with the remaining rub.   Shred the meat and toss in
the sauce.

worried about the negative reviews, i decided to cut this recipe down to 2 servings (my math) and just make the sauce.. i'm not a huge fan of sweet and i'm beyond in love with vinegar so i figured i'd like the sauce.. boy was i wrong.. even after adding more brown sugar it still wasn't anything good.. i ended up adding bottled bbq sauce, some worcestershire, and mustard to bring it back to something that resembles bbq sauce

This was so excellent!  I made it in the slow cooker-made the rub and then just used the other ingredients as a sauce for the meat to simmer in. I reduced the vinegar to 1/2 a cup, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. We loved it, thanks for sharing.

Very good, too spicy for us though. Next time less red-pepper!  I slow cooked a 2 lb pork roast in the slow cooker with salt, pepper, garlic, and some gourmet burger spice and then used root beer to cover it with. Slow cooked for 6 hours, then followed the last step, except put it with the marinade in the oven for another hour. Came out great! We added some coleslaw to it to calm the spicy taste down a bit.

made the vinegar sauce for some left over chicken drumsticks I'd bbq'd. Simply shredded the meat and placed in the sauce and it was delicious. I didn't have cider vinegar so used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 balsamic vinegar. It worked fine.

the sauce was way too vinegary. i even cut the vinegar in half after reading other reviews, but it was still way too overpowering! i ended up draining most of the sauce off and pouring bottled barbecue sauce over the meat to hide the strong vinegar flavor.

I used a 9lb pork shoulder roast. I didn't marinate overnight, instead I used the exact ingredients and rubbed the pork just before cooking. I cooked on grill with hickory wood chips for smoke flavor. I placed on upper level and cooked for 1 1\2 hrs with low fire. Then I wrapped in foil (double layers) tightly. I placed on upper level of grill again and cooked for 6 hrs on low. It came out wonderful and the whole neighborhood smelled wonderful. My disappointment was with the sauce. I did as other reviewers have stated and cut vinegar in half, using 1 cup. Still it had a very strong vinegar flavor. I have 5 people in family. Three liked it, two did not. That is why the 3 stars. I will use recipe again for the rub mixture, but will try different recipe for sauce.

After living in NC for years, it occurred to me that my family had never made home made Carolina pork BBQ.  I rubbed our pork roast in normal yellow mustard and then added the rub and let it do its thing in the crock pot for several hours. I made this for a family dinner and it was an incredible success.  Everyone loved it so much that they made claims to who got to take the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Fantastic recipe. I did alter it (cutting the vingar in half, adding more brown sugar) but not enough to change the flavor. This is sinfully easy to make. I used a very cheap roast, and you'd never know. I've eaten it for two meals a day for the last two days; it's that good.

Ok, my Momma is from No. Carolina and I lived there for awhile and this is the BEST carolina cue I've tasted.  Made it as stated and the sauce was just sweet, hot, and vinegary enough.  You gotta love this style cue or just make the pork shoulder with the rub and use the sauce of your choice. SLAMMIN' GOOD!  Thank you for the recipe. Oh, I eat it with slaw on a potato roll.

My husband cooked the pork as directed but cooked it on a Big Green Egg.  It tasted SO good. Perfect!! THEN he made the sauce and all we could taste was the vinegar.  The tasty pork was no longer even detected, it was just vinegar.  Loved the Pork rub and recipe, for our tastes, we just need a sauce that doesn't over power the taste of the pork.

I liked the rub but I didn't really enjoy the BBQ sauce, too much vinegar and very watery. I ended up adding more sugar and more tomato product to sweeten and thicken it up. Thanks for the recipe though. It's a good starter.

My husband is from east carolina.  This is close. Save yourself the trouble and order wells barbeque sauce off their web site hog heaven if you are particular on authentic sauce.  That is the true sauce.  Nice rub recommendation and it worked well.  Thanks for teaching a Floridian how to make ECU hubby happy :-)

My neighbor found this recipe and now there are 5 families using it. FABULOUS! We cook it in the slow cooker, so double the liquid and add in 2 Tbsp. liquid smoke. My hubby is a lightweight, so we use only 1 tsp red pepper flakes. TDF!!

I don't think we are true NC barbeque fans because as written, we could never have eaten this recipe. I cut the vinegar down to 1 cup and it was still WAY too overpowering for us. I added probably a 1/2 cup more of brown sugar and a few more healthy shakes of red and white pepper and let it simmer for about 2 hours. At this point we ate it on homemade hamburger buns and it was very good. After letting the roast sit for 24 hours in the fridge with the run on, I also did mine in a slow cooker. I put it in with a few tablespoons of liquid smoke and a cup or so of beef broth. Cooked it on high for 5 hours, low for 2. At that point I shredded it, added the sauce, and cooked it on low for another 2 hours. Very good with all the sugar I had to put in, but I don't think NC barbeque is for us. :)

This was very good.  So good it didn't make it to the bbq part. Once the meat was sampled after it came out of the oven, they wanted to eat it just the way it was. Hopefully next time I will able to make it all the way. The only thing I did different was cook it in the oven just as someone else mentioned. Came out juicy.

The cooking method was right on however I don't think the spice rub made any difference because the outside was charred and that was discarded.  that would be better in the oven.  The sauce, although was tasty on its own, we ended up using regular bbq sauce.

This is a great recipe! Ever since the first time I made I have had my friends asking me when I was going to make it again.

I thought this cooked up well and made plenty of sandwiches.  After having this I think I will stick to the "Memphis Style" barbeque, but all my guests seemed to like this.

Having lived in NC for a few years, I felt like a native once I had tasted this recipe!!!  Many thanks to Doug for our Superbowl fare recipe! I used the suggestions of liquid smoke (as I had to roast mine also), increased the brown sugar (but not by much! ) and kept the red pepper the same as Doug had.  A little kick, but almost as good as Lancaster's BBQ - the standard in my area of NC.  Loved it!

Great recipe. I made this recipe a super bowl party. I was hoping this would bring a win for the Panthers, but there is always next year.
I cut back to 11/2 cups of vinegar and to 2 teaspoons of the red pepper flakes. This did tone the sauce down a bit. Great recipe Doug. Thanks from all the Panther fans in Northern Virginia(Redskin territory).
