I liked this... I used  peppered turkey bacon and a reduced fat cheese. The bacon and the sweetness of dressing was a nice combo and the creaminess of the cheese was delicious

I made this. It was delicious, however I tweaked it a little. Instead of French Dressing, I seasoned it and marinated it in Olive Oil and brown sugar. I also used Maple flavored bacon. Came out super moist and was so good. Will be making this again!

This was good, although I made some changes just based on what I had on hand.   I used fresh banana peppers, after slicing small and nuking them for 3 minutes first.   And I only used 8 oz shredded cheese, which was plenty.  Chicken was very moist.
