This recipe was just ok for my husband and me. I think it needed more ham and maybe even onions. There seemed to be a lot of filling (sauce, creamy stuff) but not enough IN the filling. Broccoli or spinach might be a nice addition.

I used Pillsbury pie crust and whole milk. I also added some green onions and 1 cup of mixed frozen carrots and peas. The sauce set up great. Hubby loved this dish.
