This would get an 8 starts if I could but I had lemon vodka on hand and that's what went in. I am Astonished this has  been both review less & faceless! I have had this in my RB since Sept. 2010. People, ya gotta try this!! I found a passion lemonade juice in one frozen can that I am really Enjoying on this HOT summer afternoon!! Very refreshing! I made this in the blender and added a cup or so of ice and made it slushy. YUMMY and a bit tropical- wishing I had a little cute umbrella to pretty it up. Oh well with this drink, who needs an umbrella???  Thanks so much Mrdag:):) Cheers for a Fab drink!
