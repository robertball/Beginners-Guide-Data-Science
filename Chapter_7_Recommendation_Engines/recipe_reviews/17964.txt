Excellent!  I made this for a Polish dinner festival and it everyone loved it...had many requests for the recipe.  I added some rum-soaked raisins, and used diced candied cherries as I couldn't get maraschino cherries when I needed them. I also couldn't find the flavoring, so I used a mix of vanilla, almond and a bit of maple flavoring. Wonderful blend if you have the same problem. My family is Polish and we will definitely be adding this to the dessert list...awsome!

I started checking the cake after 1 1/2 hours.  It was done in about 1 hour 50 minutes, not 2 1/2 hours!  I did get rave reviews from my family.  I would make it again.

This is a spectacular and great tasting cake - needs no frosting as outside forms a slightly crunchy sweet layer! Would be a colorful, great holiday cake!

This cake is fabulous.  Dense and moist.  Baked at 300 in my oven it was done in 1 1/2 hours.  The only issue I had with this cake was getting it out of the bundt pan.  Make sure to grease & flour this REALLY  GOOD!  Definitely a "keeper" recipe.  Highly recommend!  YUM!

I loved this recipe.  I substituted buttermilk for the condensed milk and used pecans instead of walnuts.  It was delicious.  I frosted with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.

I have never gotten so many great comments on a cake in my life.  I have made it several times for all different groups and it pleases everyone.  I dust mine with powdered sugar.

Excellent cake.  I gotta say that I usually burn everything I try to bake .. but not this cake ! Maybe it was the low temperature -- I don't know.  I did only cook mine for about 2 hours.   Also added an amaretto glaze after it had cooled.  (Just mixed powdered sugar and amaretto until the right consistency).

I have to make this every year for my Polish boyfriend for Christmas and this year I made one for myself too. This is a great cake. A couple of suggestions: drain cherries and cut them in half, BREAK walnuts, don't chop them, you want them kind of big. Before adding the cherries, mix them around in some flour before adding them to the batter. And no icing is needed. 
There was a bakery in my neighborhood when I was growing up that made this as a HUGE pound cake with a little white sugar icing, and sold slices (slabs, really.) Brings back a lot of memories. Also, if you can find it, I HIGHLY recommend Superior Brand imitation vanilla, butter and nut flavoring. For a holiday cake, add some green colored cherries, if you can find them.

I have made this cake probably 5 times.  Every cake has come out well.  Everyone who has tasted the cakes give a grade of  5.0.

Absolutely wonderful pound cake!  We don't like maraschino cherries so I used 1 c. dried cranberries.  I should've tossed them in the flour with the nuts so they would be distrubted more thoroughly throughout.  I went with 2 hrs. baking time. The toothpick came out clean.  Nothing worse than a dry cake so I went with that.  Had a little bit of trouble getting it out of a well-greased/floured pan but that might be because the cranberries mostly fell to the bottom (top) without being tossed with the nuts in flour.  Great raves and requests for this recipe at a potluck last night!

The cake is sweet with a moist dense texture.  No icing is needed but beware...let the bake the entire 2 1/2 hours.  I was nervous from reading other reviews and took it out 20 minutes early and the bottom of the cake wasn't completely finished baking.

Made for Thanksgiving dessert along with the pumpkin pie and brownies.  Very nice presentation.  Yummy too.  Why is it Polish?

This is a really good cake. I zig zagged the top with melted semi sweet chocolate with a bit of corn syrup added. Not sure why the strange oven temperature or putting in the cake before oven is heated up. I baked mine at 350 degrees, testing until done.

This pound cake has very good taste and texture. The cherries added not only good flavor but makes it look great too. I've already gotten requests to make this again. I sure will!

I was sceptical of this recipe because of the amount of sugar and the absence of baking powder or soda... But I followed the instructions exactly, and it's turned out perfect! Mine needed only one hour baking time, maybe because it's a small oven.

Simple recipe but keep in mind it bakes for two and a half hours. Substituted Bob's Red Mill GF Baking Flour for the all-purpose flour with excellent results. The cake was a hit.

I'm rating this low due to the butter and shortening, plus the 5 eggs. It really is good, though, and if you don't have a health problem it's also lovely to look at. My husband really does like it, so it rates a 5 star in looks & taste.
