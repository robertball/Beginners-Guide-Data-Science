Copiously unique! I'm the only reviewer of this recipe so far and I was excited to take my first bite. The combination of flavors were unbelieveably harmonious, especially if you like exotic flavors of the East and the Tropics. You will be delightfully surprised by this cupcake! Definitely NOT for the faint of palette! I used Duncan Heinz butter recipe yellow cake mix.  For the frosting: 1 Tbsp of mild curry, 1 tsp of coconut extract and 4 cups of powder sugar in total and it was plenty. Next time, I will dice the flaked coconuts to reduce the stringy texture. Used only 1 stem of the basil and it perfumed the frosting perfectly. It is a process, but I believe it will be a recipe you'll want to use when you want something that can only be experienced!

Each individual part of these cupcakes is very good: the coconut cupcakes, the curry lemon curd and the basil cream.  Together though, the taste was a little bizarre.  I enjoyed eating it, though I didn't want to have another one.  I guess I don't like my desserts to taste like dinner.  However, the coconut cupcakes are the best I've ever had.  I made them again and made a frosting of 1 part cream to 2 parts powdered sugar- whip until desired consistency and add orange blossom water or jasmine flavoring to taste.  They were to die for this way and I served them at a party...people were begging me for the recipe!

I also  made these for an Indian-themed dinner, and they were quite a hit.  I must admit that I toned down some of the more intense tastes...only 1 T curry powder, and just a few basil leaves in the whipping cream.  The cupcakes looked beautiful - I scooped out a plug from the top of each cupcake and filled with lemon curd, then topped with the slice of cupcake that I removed.  Then I spread some more lemon curd over the top, with the whipped cream over that, but not quite covering it all of the way.  Over that, I sprinkled toasted coconut, and topped with a sprig of very small basil leaves.  Great presentation, unique flavor.

Well, I really appreciate the creative combination of flavors.  2 tablespoons of mild curry, however, was waaaay too much.  Next time I'll try 1 teaspoon max.  The curd did not set much.  Next time I'll heat it on the stove top where it's far easier to watch it thicken.   The basil cream topping I made was lovely and subtle.  But I only used 2  leafy 'stems' of basil- about 20 total basil leaves.  I suspect a full bunch would be far too overpowering.  I'll try it again

I liked the curry curd and thought it went very well with the basil cream.  However, as good as the basil cream was, the frosting was too sweet.  I would cut the sugar back by at least 1 cup.  I also had a ton of the frosting leftover.  I beat my egg whites and folded them into the cake batter.  The cakes were lighter but they still have the distinct taste of a mix.  Overall a good cupcake to serve to friends with a more adventuresome palate.  Thank you for sharing mkecupcakequeen.

These are so exotic and excellent. My mom came by as I was preparing the basil cream topping and she tasted a bit. She was horrified that I was making such a thing, but I told her to be patient and wait for the final result. You need to experience all the flavors at once, not individually. Well, once she tasted the finished cupcake she was sold. These will surely impress friends. I would say that the amount of basil called for might be too much...I used one bunch and it is VERY strongly flavored. I would say just one or two leaf/stems would work just fine. You want the flavors to subtly mingle and the basil is a tad overpowering at this point. For the Lemon curd I used only half a teaspoon of curry and it is PERFECT. Very delicious and fun to make.

The best cupcakes I have ever had.   Takes time but well worth the time.   Do the lemon curd and basil cream the day before.

These cupcakes are amazing!  Used the Duncan Hines butter yellow cake mix, Meyer lemons off our tree, and reduced the curry to 1 tsp.  When I tasted the lemon curd I thought it was still too much curry but when you have all the flavors together they are delicious!  We had an Indian-themed birthday lunch at work and everyone raved about dessert! I took everyone's advice and made 1/2 the recipe of curd and frosting and it was plenty for the dozen and a half it made. Thanks for expanding our palate's.

This recipe is amazing - I've made it for friends, relatives, and coworkers and have yet to meet someone who doesn't like them. I followed everyone else's recommendations and only used 1 Tbsp of curry and it turned out great. You will have a ton of curd left over, but the good news is that it freezes beautifully and makes future batches a cinch. However, do NOT listen to other reviewers' suggestions to cut down on the powdered sugar - it changes the consistency of the frosting and makes it really runny. I cut the frosting recipe in half and still had some left over. These cupcakes also do well as a mini-cupcake version.

DID NOT LIKE AT ALL. was making these for Indian lunch day at work and I didn't even take them in. Basil cream was ineatable and the lemon curd had way to much curry. The cupcake might have been ok but with different icing. Would not reccommend

These were delish!!  I made them for an indian themed dinner club and they were the hit of the party.  All the flavors (coconut, lemon, curry, and basil) meld together wonderfully to create a "party in my mouth" as a guest said.

I tried making these for a gathering the other night.  When I told people what I brought at first they were shocked, but everyone was won over when they tried them!  Thank you for posting such a delicious and creative recipe.

i was very hesitant to try these but am i glad i did!  These cupcakes are so unique (in a good way). I made these for a summer party and I also made regular coconut cupcakes with a custard and frosting.  After and hour these were gone and I had to take leftovers of the others home!  I did modify the recipe for my own tastes and per other suggestions though.  First of all I made a coconut cake from scratch (i never use box mix).  Second, for the lemon curd I used regular curry and only put in about 1 teaspoon.  That was more than enough for my taste.  I would recommend starting with less and adding as you cook it if you so desire.  Third, for the frosting i used a bit more cream cheese and way less sugar.  I always add sugar as i go to any frosting and stop when it is sweet enough.  Everyone agreed the basil frosting was the best part! I strongly recommend everyone try these, if you're scared just make a smaller batch (and then wish you'd made more)

We brought these to an Indian-themed gourmet club and they were loved by kids and grownups. I did omit the curry because of the kids, though.

These cupcakes are delicious and do have the distinct Indian flavor.  I used 1/2 of the Sweet Curry Lemon Curd and 1/2 of the prepared Sweet Basil Cream frosting.

sooo delicious!  My friends and I did a weekly dinner where we picked a country and each made food from that country.  I chose this as the dessert for  our India night and had different people from the group each make a different part.  Then end result was beautiful and delectable.   Everyone went gaga over these!

We went to a theme party which food from India was served. I had to make dessert. Found this recipe and gave it a try. We got rave reviews. One friend said it was the best cupcake she ever had. The presentation is beautiful. The
Lemon curd made it very special and extra yummy. The only thing I would do is to half the recipe for the basil cream.
It made way to much. Had to throw half away or else I would eat it! We served it with the rose ice cream to make the
Dessert complete! Thank you! Donna from Bronx,N.Y.

The combination of flavors was wonderful.  I was hesitant about the basil cream but it went beautifully with everything else.  I will say I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 tablespoon of curry,  cut back on the sugar in the icing and garnished with toasted coconut.  Also I had too much icing for the 24 cupcakes.  When I make these again, and I definitely will, I will make half recipe of icing.  Great cupcake!

Loved this exotic recipe! I made mini cupcakes with a few minor changes. First, I made my own curry powder using 1 tsp turmeric, 2 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp chili powder, a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of cardamom. I am not a big fan of cream cheese frosting so I completely omitted the frosting, instead just using the basil infused whipped topping which was delicious! Next time I think I will pipe the sweet curry lemon cream into the cupcake! Highly recommended!!

My daughter made these before I did.  Interestingly, we both had the same issues.  The lemon curd slid off the cupcakes and the frosting curdled and would not hold it's shape.  There is far too much lemon curd and frosting left over so I would suggest making half that amount.  I would also decrease the amount the basil so there is a very mild basil flavor.  I had very mixed reviews when I took them to work.  Some couldn't eat them once they took a bite and some loved them and ate several.  I love each part individually and the combination.

I'm an Indian woman who was assigned the task of bringing dessert to a party with a Thai-Indian fusion theme. All the partygoers were Indian so I was nervous about how these cupcakes would be received in a roomful of very seasoned palates. However, I got rave reviews from everyone who tried them! I reduced the curry powder, but given the crowd, I could have stuck with the full amount. It did not overpower the other flavors. The basil cream was wonderfully aromatic but reducing the sugar to 4 cups total made it a bit runnier than ideal. Next time, I'll reduce the whipping cream to 6-8 ounces for a thicker topping since there was a lot of leftover topping. Overall a hit with the crowd!!

Everyone at work looooved this.  As a precautionary measure for less adventurous palates, I took most reviewers' advice and used 1 tablespoon of curry powder.  Everything else was as per recipe.

Needed to tone down the curry flavor, so used a little over 1 tsp.  Same with the basil in the cream.  An entire bunch would have been far too strong, so used about 3-4 stems.
