This turned out to be one of the best meals I ever made.  Here are my adjustments: 1 lb ground turkey browned with a clove of garlic, 1 cup chopped turkey pepperoni, 1 jar Ragu Italian Sausage flavored sauce, 1 can Italian Style stewed tomatoes (I blend smooth), 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 tsp Ital seasoning.  I cooked 2 pkgs of the frozen cheese tortellini then put into 13x9 pan.  I just didn't have time for the crockpot this particular day. Added some cheese, then poured over the sauce and mixed through and topped with more cheese.  Bake till cheese melts, which is only 5-10 min.  Fantastic! Better than any other Italian dish I have ever made.  And easy, too.

I made this last night for my husbnad's italian family, everyone really enjoyed it.  I did however change the recipe up like I do w/ all new recipes.  First anytime I make a pasta recipe I always add onion and green pepper to the meat as I am browning it. I am not one whom like sausage so I used extra ground beef, I also added a fair amount of pepperoni not too much to give it a little spicy kick.  Instead of using original totellini I used garlic and herb, chich I believe gave it a great taste.  Also with any pasta recipe I added a little more italian spices, gralic spice and some brown sugar.  I don't add too much brown sugar, it does give a smoother taste, but the main reason for adding this to any pasta recipe it is counters the red sauce and keep the heartburn down, this is always worked for me and my family since we do get heartburn easy, so it's not as much for the taste.  Overall I found that everyone enjoyed this recipe w/ all the changes.  I served it was salad and bread.

I was very impressed with this dish and it exceeded the expectations I originally had of this recipe! I did add some onions and green bell peppers when sauting the lb of italian sausage (I didn't use any hamburger), added some extra italian seasonings, and (thanks to "Ravenmelle's" advice) added just a little brown sugar - which I can see why it would reduce heartburn!!! I didn't see the point in slow cooking this so I mixed all in a 9x13 dish, covered with foil and baked for about 1.5hrs at 325 degrees. I then removed the foil, added the cheese(s) and baked for another 15 minutes (uncovered).  Sprinkled a little parmesan over each serving...Viola! Great recipe Tracy! My family gives you a standing ovation!

The only changes made were to add some italian seasoning, a teaspoon of brown sugar, and a small can of sliced olives.  I was not impressed with this recipe and probably will not make it again.  It seemed too greasy even though I used extra lean ground beef.

All you need is 1 pan plus your slow cooker! Don't drain the mushrooms and use shredded parmesan instead of cheddar.Also, try it with roasted garlic & cheese tortellini!I refusd\ed to serve jarred sauce before making this recipe!

I made this recipe and it was DELICIOUS!! I used 1lb. Italian Sausage (mild) and mozzerella and parmesan (no cheddar). I made the sauce in the crock pot then added fresh 3-cheese tortellini, then poured it in a casserole and topped with the parm & mozzerella, covered with foil and baked at 350 for 40 min covered and 10 min uncovered. It was a big hit with my crowd and I will definately make this one again!! Thank you Tracey for posting this one.

Excellent and perfect for a "fix-it and forget it" recipe!  I added a little minced garlic and chopped onion while browning the ground beef and opted for sweet Italian sausage.  For the marinara sauce I used "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site that I had frozen as it's one of my favorites and is perfect for just this type of recipe.  I didn't use cheddar cheese as I really didn't think it paired well so instead I used shredded Parmesan.  Wonderful served with a fresh garden salad and warm bread!

Wonderful dinner and my in-laws even loved it!! I changed it a little as well. I used all sausage and added onion and green pepper as well. I also added some garlic and brown sugar and just cooked it all in a casserole dish for 40 min. on 350 and then added the cheese until melted...so yummy..and I did not add mushrooms!

I find this to be an "average recipe" I don't see the need to leave it in a crockpot all day. It doesn't make a difference in the taste.

This sauce was hearty, meaty, and flavorful...mixed with the tortellini, it made a satisfying meal that I will make again very soon!  It was really easy, too.  There's a bunch of allrecipeeps out there giving this recipe high marks, but they've changed it all up! I made it AS IS (minus the mushrooms) and thought it was a keeper.   Also, even though it doesn't HAVE to be done in a crockpot, I found that it created waaayy less dirty dishes this way AND I could come home to a ready-made-meal (plus, it makes your house smell like a authentic Italian kitchen!) If you don't have a lot of time, it definately doesn't have to cook so long, but the point is that it CAN cook all day if you have the time :)   Lastly, for those of you looking to skip the jarred sauce...you can replace it with a little can of tomato paste and 16 oz of crushed tomatoes, add your own seasoning (plus the other ingredients) and voila! Of course, this way you must cook the full 7 or 8 hours to get the sauce done right.

I made this recipe twice...following the directions, I found it to be an "Average" recipe.  The sauce definitely did not need to be cooked for 7 hours.  The second time I made it, I substituted pepperoni for the sausage, and cooked the sauce for about an hour, and it tasted just the same, but better to us, because my family prefers pepperoni to sausage.

Wonderful quick and delicious meal!  I followed the recipe without making changes and found it to be very tasty.  Family really enjoyed and said it's a "keeper."   I always cook these recipes the first time as they are written so I can review them.  If I want to customize the recipe, I do that next time I make it.

I made this for a family  holiday get together.  Everyone enjoyed it.  There was so much flavor.  I used baby bella mushrooms and cut them into halves so we had nice chunks.  I also used turkey burger instead of the other meats only because some family members are on restricted diets.  I flavored the turkey burger with Italian seasoning while it cooked and people didn't even notice.  I will be making this one again.

My three year old loved this! I didn't cook it in the slow cooker, instead I browned my sausage, mushrooms, and an onion, drained the grease and added the sauce and tomatoes to a dutch oven. I didn't add the extra cheese either. We'll have this again.

My eight year old said that I cook better tortellini than Chef Boyardi does.  I guess that means that this is a good recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly as stated.  It was very easy.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is a quick family meal.  I didn't have time to cook in the slow cooker so I prepared it in one pot.  It was good and a great dish to whip up quickly.  I served it with Sister Shuberts Parker rolls and added a garlic butter to the rolls.  The rolls were a bigger hit.  I got this recipe off this site also.  Overall it is repeatable but not deserving of 5 stars.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME I ONLY COOKED FOR 7 HOURS AND DID NOT ALLOW MY SAUCE TO REMAIN IN THE SLOW COOKER (ON THE WARM SETTING) PAST THAT. I ALSO USED 1/2 BEEF, 1/2 (MILD / SWEET) ITALIAN SAUSAGE AND ADDED ~ 1/2 C. CHOPPED PEPPERONI. I KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME AS LAST TIME. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE SAUCE WAS A TAD BIT WATERY, SOMETHING I DID NOT EXPERIENCE LAST TIME. THAT ASIDE, MY HUBS AND I REALLY ENJOYED THIS WITH MY CHANGES. NEXT TIME I'LL BE SURE TO PARTIALLY DRAIN MY TOMATOES AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. THANKS TRACY! :) While "OK," neither my hubs or I were all that impressed with this (sorry!). My sauce "sat" in the slow cooker for several hours (after it had cooked) and I think that is what caused it to have an odd texture. Many reviewers skipped the slow cooking step altogether, but it's that VERY thing that drew me to this recipe in the first place. Having said that, I'm sure this would have been MUCH better if baked in an oven. :( Because I thought Tracy's recipe could use a little tweaking, I made several (albeit minor) changes. For starters, I used all (hot) Italian sausage, subbed Italian-blend cheese for the mozzarella / cheddar called for (just seemed more appropriate), added a T of Italian seasoning and omitted the mushrooms alltogether (we HATE mushrooms!).  I'm still a sucker for LUVINMYHUBBY's beefy baked ravioli. I like it better and it's just as simple to whip together, IMHO. Thanks anyways, Tracy. :-)

We're vegetarians and I made it with veggie ground round and mini raviolis, it was delicious!  Next time I'm going to double or even triple the amount of raviolis, there was so much sauce you could definitely add more pasta.

This was so easy to make and tasted GREAT.  The only change I made was to add oregano, garlic, and onion to the meat when I browned it.

Delicious and SO easy! I used a full lb. of sausage instead of 1/2 lb. and about 3/4 lb. hamburger instead of 1/2 lb.  (We like a lot of meat! : ))

Made this for dinner with friends. Everyone loved it! I also did not use the slow cooker. I mixed it all in a dish and baked it 1.5 hours before adding the cheese and baking it 15 more minutes. Served with beer and homemade Parmesan breadsticks. So good.

I made this for 10 people but altered the recipe for 12 servings. I used two bags of tortellini and had a TON left over. Probably close to a whole bag. However, the meal was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it. It was a great family meal, easy to prepare and easy clean-up. It was a little on the cheesy side so I might use a little less cheese next time but overall, something I would definitely make again!

This was a very simple recipe. I used ground turkey instead of beef and used a pound did not have any sausage. I also used cheese ravoli instead of tortellini did not have any on had. I seasoned everything with italian seasons, minced garlic, lemon pepper, fresh onions and accent. That's my typical seasoning and it came out great. I cooked the sauce for 6 hours on low, added the frozen ravoli, put the cheese on top and cooked it for an additional hour. I will try to use tortellini next time.

I wanted to make this as quickly as possible, so I didn't use the slow cooker.  Instead, I diced a small onion and cooked with 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 lb. of ground beef.  Then, I added a jar a "Newmans Own" Mushroom Marinara, the can of diced tomatoes, 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of oregano.  While the mix was simmering I cooked the pasta.  I mixed the drained pasta with the sauce, poured in a 9X13 pan and cooked at 350 covered for 30 min.  Last, I sprinkled the cheese on top (just mozzarella..didn't have any cheddar), and cooked uncovered for 10 more min.  YUM!  Thank you for the delicious idea!

I loved this recipe! I'm always looking for different ways to prepare tortellini and this was extremely easy and very flavorful. Cooking the meat sauce in the slow cooker gave it a very rich, full flavor. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and all ground beef and loved the results. I think it would be just as good with sausage and other vegetables. I also used frozen tortellini which is cheaper than fresh and only had to cook it an extra 15 mins. I have made it more than once and the results were just as good the second time. I don't understand the critical reviews of this recipe, it really is delicious and easy. Try it tonight!

Just got done eating this dish and it was wonderful!  My boys all loved it.  After being at baseball games all evening it was great to come home to a nice warm meal.  I used turkey italian sausage but everything else exactly the same.  Wouldn't change anything!

Love it!  Instead of 1/2 lb of beef and 1/2 sausage, I used 1 lb of hot italian sausage and it definitely kicked it up a notch.  I also used a 24 ounce jar of sauce and am very thankful I did b/c it was still really thick.  Also I had a bag of four cheese Italian style instead and loved it.  

Next time I'll add another can of tomatoes too, maybe some sauteed onions and green peppers if they're around.

This recipe was excellent!  It was very flavorful and did not seem dry like a lot of slow cooker recipes do.  I don't eat beef or pork so I used ground turkey and italian chicken sausage and it came out great.  Made a very large amount and will provide lunch and dinner for at least tomorrow.  Very good, filling, flavorful and easy meal!

This was a HUGE hit with my husband. He said it was the best sauce he's ever had EVER. lol I did make a couple of minor changes based on some of the other reviews. I didnt add the diced tomatoes mostly because I'm not a fan of huge tomato chunks. I sauted 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and threw that in and I added maybe 2 tbsp of brown sugar. Other then that everything remained the same and it was delicious. This will definatly become a staple in our home.

this was fabulous! don't quite understand why it needed 7 to 8 hours to cook when the only thing that needed to be cooked was the meat and you do that beforehand, so maybe to combine all of the flavors? what ever the reasoning, this is delicious!

This was delicious but I did make a couple of changes.  I added 4 cloves of garlic, green pepper and onion while browning meat.  I also used Jeannie-o turkey Hot Itialian sausage and ground turkey.  Family did not notice!  Very tasty!

I love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was I omitted the Italian sausage because we just don't really like it.  It seems to have plenty of meat in the sauce with just the 1/2 pound of ground beef.   Very easy and SO delicious!

If you're going to cook a sauce in a crockpot for 7 hours, you may as well save some money and use canned tomatoes instead of prepared pasta sauce and make a sauce to your liking.  Also, cheddar is so not Italian. However, cooking the fresh tortellini in the crockpot is a great idea; makes a great tasting tortellini.

I made this for the superbowl and followed the recipe to the 't'.  That night, I would have given it 3 stars.  I stored the leftovers and ate it for lunch the next day.  It was much better!  This is a recipe, like lasagna, that benefits from sitting and allowing the flavors to marry.  I will make this again.  As a personal choice in the future, I will use sausage with casings as I did not appreciate the bulk sausage.  I will also cut back on the cheddar/mozz, as I thought the cheese was a little overwhelming and distracting.  Footnote, I also used 20 oz. tortellini, as a previous poster suggested.  I agreed with that poster that 9 oz was not enough.

This is very easy to make and everyone loves it. I make a couple of modifications: First, I use only Italian sausage and no ground beef, which imparts much more flavor. Secondly, I reduce the amount of shredded cheese I add. With the cheese in the tortellini I found that the dish just became too cheesy for us, though your tastes may vary. Finally, and most importantly, use a lot more tortellini than the recipe calls for. I always use at least a 16oz package, and even then there is still more than enough sauce.

This is such an easy recipe, for those nights you didnt plan anything for dinner. Really depends on the kind of tortellini you get.

This was excellent. I think this was true restaurant quality. I did add extra garlic, onions and mushrooms, and i used ground turkey-the sauce was wonderful cooked on low for about 7 hrs. I would have given it 5 stars if I could have only dirtied one pan.

We were all surprised at how good this is since we are not huge slow cooker fans. I used all ground beef and 1.5 jars spaghetti sauce. I did not have Italian tomatoes, so used petite diced and added a good bit of Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I used a 19 oz. bag of frozen tortellini and added fresh basil before serving.  Super easy and super good!

Even better the next day.  Used super cheap canned sauce, and it still tasted great! Added onion, garlic and italian seasoning to the browning meats.  The house smelled sooo good while it was cooking!  Will be making this again and again.

Thisw was great, I used Paul Neuman's sauces (I love his line).  *It was easy, hubby loved it.  I've also made this with beef Raviolli, some seemed to like this better to make it a meaty dish.

Even though I didn't have all the ingredients, it still turned out terrific!  The whole family loved it and I added it to our "Family Favorites" file!  
Note:  I didn't use mushrooms or the tomatoes because I didn't have those on hand, so I'm sure it would taste even better with them.  
Also, I used two cups of an italian cheese blend in place of the cheddar and mozarella.

This was so delicious!! I added a little bit of jalepeno for a kick, and it was fantastic.  This is definitely my new favorite spaghetti sauce.

Made this for a potluck at work.  Everyone loved it.  A few things I did differently though.  I used all spicy italian sausage, made the sauce the night before the potluck, and included 4 Bay leaves.  The morning of the potluck I put the sauce in a crock pot - cooked it on high for an hour to get it hot and then put it on low for 3 hours.  I added frozen tortellini during the last 90 minutes of cooking and put mozzarella cheese on top during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  If you like your italian food very cheesy, stir about a cup of shredded mozarella into the tortellini/sauce mix before topping it with the cheese listed in the original recipe. Enjoy :-)

I made these changes with much success:
Browned 1lb ground beef and added to crockpot along with 2 jars spaghetti sauce, 1 pkg frozen onions, 1 pkg frozen green peppers, 1 tsp Italian seasonings, .5 tsp garlic salt, 2 Tbs brown sugar and 1 pkg diced pepperoni. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Served with noodles.

This was a great easy recipe!  Nice change for the slow cooker too!  I spiced up my sauce some just because store bought usually is a little flat for me.  Also added a little spinach.  Thanks!

6 year old LOVED, husband and I thought OK.  I used 20 oz package of tortellini, as there's no way 9 oz would have made 6 servings, but perhaps it was a bit too much for the amount of sauce.  will figure out a better amount next time

This is good and tasty.  I used frozen tortellini and it was about twice as much as called for.  Added a bit of hot water to the sauce to compensate.  That worked just fine.  No need for all that cheese.  I topped it with a bit of parm when served.  That saved a lot of fat, I think.

I substituted the kielbasa for sausage and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  It still came out pretty good and it was a way to use up some leftover meat.

I really like this recipe as is because it is super easy and tastes great.  I've made it about 5 times and have even made it without the cheese just to be a little healthier and it is always really good.  I agree, it doesn't really need to cook 7-8 hours, but it is just nice to know you can let in sit in the slow cooker however long you need to and just add the tortellini whenever you are ready to eat.

I've made this a few times tweaking it...but got too far away from the original receipe to count it. I've even made this on the stove and the taste was the same. Unless you're making your own sauce, this doesn't need to cook all day.

This is so good and so easy.  I love how I can start it in the morning, and it only takes a few minutes of work at the end.  I doubled the recipe, and changed it a little by adding a sauteed onion, a few cloves of garlic, about a teaspoon of brown sugar, and two small drained cans of sliced black olives.  Then at the end, before I added the cheese, on top I added a pound of frozen chopped spinach.  I used one cup each of cheddar, monterey jack, and mozzerella cheese on top of that.  I will definitely be making this again.

Hate this new format. The first 3 reviews that appear are from 2007, 2003 and 2004... Ancient history! And all 3 made modifications to the recipe. Grrrr! You're supposed to make it as presented, not alter it and then review it!

Turned out great. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and fresh sliced white mushrooms. I also added chopped Italian parsley, ground fennel seed, black pepper, garlic powder, and chopped garlic.

This came out very good. I was tempted to add garlic and onion but didn't. The only change I made was to use Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar as suggested by several reviewers. After tasting I think I will use a extra sharp cheddar the next time I make this.

Excellent!  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 lb. of spicy italian sausage, all mozzarella cheese (the cheddar just seemed out of place to me), and whole wheat tortellini.  Also, I threw in about 1 1/2 c. frozen spinach at the end, which gave the dish a nice color and upped the nutritional value.  This was a great dish for a hot day when I didn't feel like heating up the kitchen.  I will be making this again.

I used one pound turkey sausage which was very good. I think next time I may use a larger package of tortellini.  It needed more.. Nice recipe..easy..will make again.

A slow cooker delight, and EASY as pie!  Hard to imagine store bought spaghetti sauce can stew in a slow cooker all day and taste like THIS!  I sprinkled seasonings on such as oregano and basil, and I'd probably use all mozzerella cheese next time (just looks better to me with red sauce/italian dishes).  I happened to use ground turkey because it's what I had in the freezer-just fine.  This is a great Sunday fix-pop the stuff in the crock ever so simply in the morning and serve with a salad in the evening-a KEEPER!

I was disappointed. Usually something with so many good reviews comes out good. The sauce was good, but the tortellini mushy/pasty. I may make the sauce in the future, but not add any pasta to it, and cook the pasta separate.

This recipe was wonderful.  I took the time to make the marinara sauce using the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe on this site.  Cutting the serving size on the marinara recipe in half created the perfect amount needed for this recipe.  I used Johnsonville Italian Sausages with Sweet Basil (it takes 2 to equal 1/2 lb).  I wasn't sure how I like this recipe after mixing everything up in the morning, but it turned out delicious.  I don't like mushrooms but I ate them without noticing.  My husband and 1 1/2 yr old daughter give it two thumbs up.

I found this recipe to be very 'tomatoey'.  It was not what I was expecting.  I think a lot of the flavour is expected to come out of the Italian-style diced tomatoes, and it really isn't strong enough to give it enough flavour.  The addition of the sausage was sort of awkward to us, although I'm sure it is supposed to add to the flavour as well.  It was nice for something different, but I did not keep this one in my recipe book.

This recipe has earned 5 stars from my extremely picky 7 year old son who never seems to like anything beyond cereal. I started this in the crock pot before leaving for work. I used a full pound of italian sausage in place of the sausage/beef split. Since it was the morning and I didn't have time to make the meat in a pan, I popped the Italian sausage in a microwave safe dish and cooked on high for 6 minutes, broke it up in small pieces and put it in for another minute and a half. I didn't have mushrooms so I didn't add them. I also followed other suggestions and substituted parmesan cheese in place of cheddar. My day was longer than expected, so this was in my crock pot for 9 hours on low - it was still fabulous. My son even asked if I could use the crock pot to cook all of our meals. If you have a picky eater, this is a recipe to try to win him or her over.  Thanks for sharing and for all of the helpful tips from other reviewers.

This was pretty good, but not outta this world. I love slow cooker meals and this was really easy to throw together. The sauce was good, but not amazing. I think since it cooks all day it would be great with a cup or so of good red wine to really add a delicious depth of flavor. But overall this was a yummy family pleasing meal.

Great meal to just throw together in the morning and forget about until 20 minutes before you are ready to eat.  I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes also along with the fresh mushrooms I needed to use or lose.

WOW!  This was yummy!  I did make a few changes though.  I didn't use ground beef (don't eat red meat) and I couldn't find any sausage that we like so I used Italian seasoned ground turkey.  Worked perfectly!  Also for some reason our store didn't have any white mushrooms, so I used presliced baby portabellas.  I also made my own sauce. And I had to use ravilois instead of tortellini because again our store didn't have any.  It was rich and warm and just yummy.  Perfect for the cold weather we've been having.  The leftovers were great too!

This was so easy and so delicous! I amde the following the night before. I added some garlic to the pan browned the meat together, dumped in a 32 oz jar of spag sauce, one can of italian seasoned tomatoes and some herbs. Cooked it on low all day in the cooker.  I used 3 cheese tortellini about 20 minutes before.  Turned it up on high sprinkled with mozzerella cheese....it was a hugre hit with my family! This will be in the regular rotation!  Thanks for the quick, easy and delicous recipe!

This a very good and very easy to make!  I loved being able to come home from work and having it almost done.  I only chnaged a few things.  I added some spaghetti sauce and I changed the cheddar cheese to mozzarella.  My husband said it was one of the best meals we have had in a long time.  I will make this again!

This recipe will definitely be a keeper in our house! I, like many other reviewers, made some modifications...I used all Italian sausage, added garlic and onions, and used 20 ounces of tortellini. But it was delicious and I suspect it will be even better as leftovers after it has had to time to sit and marry all the flavors.

Short on time, I followed other reviewers' advice and prepared our meal on the cooktop. Worked fabulously. Another reviewer suggested using only sausage rather than the blend of meats, so I tried HOT ground Italian sausage only, and I used The "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site as suggested, as well. Amaaaaazing. Can't imagine how fabulous it'd have been had I not forgotten the mushrooms, or had thought ahead enough to cook it in the crockpot.

You are right: this one is a keeper and will be on our regular rotation!

This recipe is fabulous. Thank you, Tracy!

Very good! I used fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach, cheddar cheese did not seem like it would work but I like to stay as close to the original recipe as possible, so in it went and glad I used it. This is a keeper, thanks Tracy.

This is a solid 4 star recipe and really should be a 5 based on the simplicity in making it.  No...it doesn't have to cook all day but isn't that what makes this so great that you can prepare it, be gone all day and only have 15 to 20 minutes dinner prep time when you come home?  I love that about this recipe.  It isn't the "best" italian dish I ever made but then I didn't spend hours making it and it is still seconds worthy.  I used an entire pound of ground beef (with 1/2 pound of sausage) because that is how I package portion my meat and my family are meat lovers.  I sautéed the meat with onions and garlic and about 2 tablespoons of italian spaghetti seasoning I bought by mistake one day.  I used the whole 24 ounce jar of Prego I bought to compensate for the extra meat and about 15 ounces of refrigerated tortellini...next time I will use 18 ounces.  I used parmesan in place of the cheddar.  It was very good...thank you for the recipe.

This was really good!  I will make this again for sure.  The only thing I will do differently is add more sauce.  I doubled the recipe so the tort seemed to soak up all the sauce or something.  Was even better left over!

This recipe was very easy and went very well. The modifications that I made was that I accidentally added about double the amount of tortellini. To help balance it out I added in more marinara (that's what I had at the moment, this was right before serving). I did not add any cheddar and about half of the mozzarella at the end. The next time that I make this dish I will put the meat, mushrooms, and tomatoes in more equal proportions to the tortellini and marinara. I will also add much less shredded cheese at the end. With the amount I used it was surprisingly too cheesy. Each bite came with a string of cheese attached that got very messy. 
I also don't feel the need to make this dish in a crock pot, I wasn't able to see the positive results of letting it cook all day. I could be wrong but I feel like it will be just as good when I make it all at once on the stove one evening. What I did like about this recipe that I will take away with me is combining the ground beef and the Italian sausage, it added a great flavor!

Best tortellini ever!! I made no changes to the recipe but used a 16-oz bag of frozen tortellini and plain diced tomatoes. Cooked it entirely in my deep nonstick skillet instead of the crock pot. Just delicious.

This was an average recipe. I made it because I just happened to have all of the ingredients handy. I was out of marinara sauce and had to use a jar of pizza sauce. I would make again if I had all the ingredients handy.

This has become a dinner staple for take-alongs and for my family.  It is easy to make in two 8x8 pans.  Enough for my family and one to take to a friend.  I used 1 lb of pork sausage, cooked the sausage, added the mushrooms and sauce, then mixed with cooked tortellini and into the pan covered with cheese.  I LOVE this dish!  Even though I haven't slow cooked it, this is a FAST weekday meal that everyone I have fed with it loves.

This dish gets 5 stars for easy preparation, but 4 stars for taste.  My husband and I thought it was good, and my 13 year old son loved it.  Very very easy to prepare.  Add a salad and bread and you're set to go.  I really don't think this needs to cook anywhere close to 7 hours though.

4-stars BUT I will definitely make this again.  It is easy and very tasty and uses just a few ingredients that I always have on hand.  What's not to like?! I definitely recommend trying this one.

I made this dish tonight for dinner and served it with a garden salad.  I used all ground beef but will try the next time with the sausage.  I added green peppers as well.  Absolutely delicious and will be made again and again.  No more need to go out for good italian food when it can be made like this recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My family really liked this tortellini.  I did make a few changes; I used 1 lb. of turkey Italian sausage sauteed with 1/2 of a yellow onion and 1/2 of a green pepper, homemade marinara sauce, left out the mushrooms, and subbed parmigiano-reggiano cheese for the cheddar.  I used all of the homemade marinara sauce so I had enough sauce to increase the tortellini to a larger pkg. (1 lb. 9 oz. I believe).  I served it with Caesar salad and homemade garlic bread.  The sauce is extremely salty, not sure why.  Next time I will use low-sodium tomatoes and maybe decrease the amount of sausage.

Made this once without the mushrooms or tomatoes, but added green pepper. It's good, but doesn't need to spend all day in the slow-cooker. Probably will make again.

This turned out very tasty. Great sauce. I didn't use any hamburger in mine, just the pork; and my tomatoes had basil and oregano in them. Also used up my fresh mushrooms instead of opening a can. Didn't cook for the full 8 hours, but everything in it is cooked--just the longer it's in the pot, the better! I will be making this one again.

I have made this recipe several times and it has been a hit. It is so easy and delicious I make it at least once a week. The only thing I change is I add 1/4 cup of red wine and I don't add the cheddar cheese plus my family doesn't like tortellini so I substitute it wish ravioli and add a box of chopped spinach.It is a great crock pot meal!

This was a great recipe!  I didn't have a slow cooker so I just cooked it on the stove low all day while I was at work (and had my boyfriend keep an eye on it).  Also, I was in a hurry that morning to throw it together before work, and I didn't read the directions carefully and I thought it said to add the tortellini in the beginning...not at the end, with the mozz and cheddar.  I decided to leave it and see what happens; I had cooked tortellini before in pasta sauce instead of boiling water so I figured it would be okay.  It was!  Everything still turned out perfectly, even with my faux pas and lack of a slow cooker.  Thank you!  (I added a little Italian seasoning too.)

This recipe was wonderful!  The sauce has an excellent flavor and melds beautifully with the tortelini.  Served it with Garlic Cheese Toast and it was a wonderful meal.  I know this will be showing up on our table often.

This recipe is fantastic!  The only changes I made were that I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I also added fresh garlic and green peppers.  I will definately make this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We added a few things like onion and bell pepper, but other than that, we followed the recipe.

We loved this yummy recipe! I made the following changes to suit our taste: used 1 1b. mild italian sausange (omitted ground beef), use 1 28 oz. jar spaghetti sauce (instead of marinara sauce), used sliced black olives instead of mushrooms, added 1/4 c. chopped green pepper, 1/2 c. chopped onion and 2 t. minced garlic. Also, I only cooked it for 3-4 hours on low. I may add more tortellini next time. It was a lot of sauce and meat. I served with garlic bread and caesar salad.

Excellent concept, but it's all about the sauce!  I used a larger jar of marinara (wish I had homemade on hand) and added fresh garlic, Italian spices, and a little red wine to suit my taste.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 4 hours.  Then I added fresh three-cheese tortellini and let it cook another 1/2 hour.  I then did as Reviewer MMaples suggested and put it in a casserole dish, topped it with shredded 6-cheese Italian from Sargento, covered with foil, and put in the fridge.  I made this on a Saturday, and on Monday evening, I popped it into a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes with foil on, and then another 10 minutes with foil off.  It was very good, and the tortellini just melted in your mouth.  Thanks!

We loved this recipe, My husband said "great", my 7 yr. old son said" better than star wars". I thought it was great. I didn't put italian sausage in it because we don't like it or mushrooms, but was great as that, I added a little more cheese but no chedder in it.

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I added minced garlic, green onions, and bell peppers to the meat when I browned it (I used 1 lb ground beef because I didn't have any Italian sausage on hand.)  I used spaghetti sauce and cooked this in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  I then added the tortellini (already cooked) and cheese.  15 minutes later (at 350) it was great.  It made lots of leftovers (which are great for taking to work for lunch.)  Thanks so much!  This will be a regular weekly dish for our family.

Very good!  I used almost double the Italian sausage, no beef, no mushrooms (picky boyfriend), added green peppers and onion, and twice as much tortellini (love leftovers for lunch!).  Had to add more water when I threw the pasta in, but it still ended up nice and thick.  Didn't add the extra cheese at the end as we thought the tortellini was cheesy enough.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was great! My boyfriend loved it, however it was very time consuming - not a weekeday dinner at all since you have to cook the meat first before you add it to the crockpot. Also - make sure if you buy packaged pasta you cook it first! yes, i just added my pasta out of the box - what a mess, lol. goes to show you an easy recipe can be messed up if you are tired.

This was okay but not my favourite. I agree that the time spent in the slow cooker is not necessary. The overall taste was good but nothing spectacular.

It turned out very good. Surprisingly, I didn't really taste the sausage at all, so next time I might add more. It seemed like it would be a little bland, so I did use Prego sauce instead of marinara sauce, and I also added some spices to it. Also, I used fresh parmesan cheese instead of Cheddar. Very good base recipe that you can tweak to fit your own personal preferences.

I was disappointed with this. It did smell absolutely wonderful though. This would just have been as easy throwing in the oven as others did. The jarred sauce does nothing for it. I did find the pasta cooked perfectly in the amount of time called for. I would try this next time with my own sauce made from scratch so the slow cooker would enhance the flavors simmering all day.

My daughter loved it! After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I browned ground turkey and turkey Italian sausage with onion and minced garlic. I also used fresh mushrooms and fresh basil, dried Italian seasoning and brown sugar. I really liked using the slow cooker for this recipe. The sauce cooked while I was at work and it was very simple to add the tortellini and cheese when I got home from work. A definite do again!

I loved doing it in the crockpot - the less I have to do at 5pm, the better!  I baked it a little longer to try and get it a little crunchy around the edges.  Also DELICIOUS reheated out of freezer!!

From the picture this was not something I was looking forward to trying, but my husband insisted we do.  I made a few tweaks along the way.. I used 1lb spicy sausage, just cut it in chucks instead of going thru the trouble of take it out of its casing, I used petite diced tomatoes, meat flavored spaghetti sauce, and 1lb ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Instead of cooking the 20oz tortellini in the crock pot, i cooked it separately in boiling water for about 5 minutes, and then added a cup of mozzarella cheese, and a half cup cheddar cheese. lots more flavor, and loved it!!  i don't like eating crock pot meals, but we've officially added this to our monthly menu!

My husband loved this. I only substituted ground turkey for the ground beef.  Also just added the whole pkg. 19 oz. tortellini, whole pkg. 19 oz ground turkey, 1 hot & 1 sweet Italian sausage (that's what I had)
Used the whole jar of marinara sauce which was 25 oz.   sprinkled with red pepper flakes while cooking.  That made it even better!

This was a great recipe but nothing special.  It tasted just like normal spaghetti sauce with tortellinis.  Served with garlic bread.

This was just OK in my opinion.  But it could be the tortellini that I used.  I don't think I'll be making again.

My hubby and I thought this was great. I didn't read the recipe a head of time so I didn't realize that I needed to slow cook it until about an hour before dinner. Instead, I let it simmer in a pot for an hour and it still turned our really good. I added onion to the recipe. I also didn't have any italian style tomatoes so I used regular and added some italian seasonings to it. I look forward to trying it again in the slow cooker.

Rave reviews from family of picky eaters.  Like another reviewer suggested, I substituted pepperoni for the sausage and cooked this on the stove instead of the slow cooker.  It was very tasty and EASY to make.

Great, easy meal when you don't feel like putting a lot of effort into dinner. I used a pound of ground sausage and left out the ground beef. I made this on the stovetop and left the sauce simmer for an hour. Turned out great.

This was a wonderful recipe that my entire family enjoyed! After reading the other reviews I added a few items to the original recipe: 1/2 c. merlot, 1 T. brown sugar, 1 T. Italian seasoning, 1 T. dried minced onion, and 1/2 c. beef broth (rinsed the jar of sauce with this and dumped it into the crockpot). I also substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, but kept the spicy sausage and added 1 tsp. crushed red paper for additional pop. We'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe (made for a large goup) and omitted the cheddar cheese and everyone ate it up. No leftovers! Also, I didn't cook it as long as stated. Will make again.

This was really good and very simple. I did make a few changes.. I dont like italian sausage so I used 1 pound of ground beef and seasoned it with fresh rosemary and thyme. Then saute'ed it with onions garlic and dry red wine. I put it all in the slow cooker and tossed in about 15 leaves of basil(chopped). I only used mozzarella cheese.nIt turned out very well I must say!

Delicious. The spice of the italian sausage gives it something extra then just using all hamburger meat. Easy to make and well worth it.

Our family really likes this recipe, or at least our variation of the recipe. Instead of marinara, I put a 14oz can of diced tomatoes (with garlic and onion, and not drained), half a small can of tomato paste, 3-4 TBSP shredded parmesan cheese, 1 TSP basil, 1/2 TSP thyme, and 1/2 TSP oregano in my food processor. After blending and pureeing the ingredients they are ready to be added to the crock pot. Instead of all the mozzarella, I use 3/4c mozzarella and 3/4c colby-jack cheese. Additionally, we do not eat pork, so I use a full pound of ground buffalo. It is AWESOME!

I found this recipe when looking for something to do with my extra/unused shredded mozzerella and chedder cheeses.   It turned out to be a total HIT with my meat-loving husband and a great time-saving meal for me. I browned / seasoned the beef the night before and just turned the slow cooker on in the morning when I left for work. It smelled fantastic when I got home!  While I agree that it's not "gourmet" or "real Italian" pasta, it very nicely satisfied our hunger on a weeknight and felt like a good, homecooked meal that didn't require a ton of work! I also agree that the tortellini are a bit "wasted" on such a thick/heavy sauce, but I wasn't going for anything fancy. Just wanted to use up the cheese!The real testimonial is that I've already made it twice and plan to make it again.  I added 1 tsp brown sugar, per the other reviews, and only used italian sausage (did not have ground beef), but otherwise followed the recipe.

Very good slow cooker recipe.  You always can add a little basil and maybe some grated parmessan to it when it is ready.

This is a great family dish. I did use the crock pot because I had a busy day of errands.  The only substitutions I made since I didn't have sausage or hamburger meat, I used meatballs from Costco.  I also added a can of tomato paste and left out the mushrooms. (Preference only) My family loved it!

I wasn't impressed by this recipe.  It was good - but not great.  The diced tomatoes watered down the sauce too much for me and didn't cling to the pasta like we prefer.  I will probably make again - but leave out the tomatoes and just use some extra marinara.  I will also just bake it in the oven next time.

This was great!  My whole family liked it.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and  I ended up just doing it in a Dutch oven on the stove top instead of the crockpot.  I let the sauce simmer about 5 hours and then added in the tortellini.  I just gave a sprinkling of cheese on the top at the very end so it wasn't too cheesy.  Yum!

Doubled this and made it for a large group.  Huge hit!  I used spicy italian sausage which lent just enough spice to this wonderfully flavored dish.  The slowcooker is definitely the way to go for this recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe and give it a 5 star rating. The rest of my family wasn't as impressed. My complaint is  it's too salty. Which is to be expected since the ingredients come out of cans. So, I think you could cut back the sodium by draining the tomatoes and then add 3 Tbsp to 1/4 cup. of water And use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Or use fresh mushrooms and add 1-2 Tbsp. sugar.

Very very good with a few alterations:
Used 1 lb italian sausage + 1/2 lb hamburger, both browned with onion and 3 cloves fresh minced garlic. Added to the sauce were red pepper flakes, basil, a small amount of brown sugar, and italian seasoning. My hubby did not LOVE this but he does not love italian in general. My picky 2 year old ate this for leftovers twice so I will definately make again

This recipe was good, not great. I didn't slow cook it, so maybe that was the problem. I didn't use the sausage either, just beef. It seemed to be missing something. It was good, but nothing fabulous.

Fantastic, comfort food at its best!  This is by far one of hubby's favourite type of meals.  Unfortunately, I didn't plan my time properly to do this in the crockpot, but nonetheless, it turned out great!  I used lean ground turkey (don't use ground beef that often) and seasoned with fresh garlic and the onions and added fresh mushrooms (canned...ugh!) towards the end of cooking the turkey.  Then I mixed all with sauce and can of diced tomatoes /herbs and the cheese/spinach tortellini.  Baked at 350 covered for about 45mins and then added some grated mozz and uncovered for about 15 more minutes.  YUM-O!

My family and I really liked this--I added some dried basil and some crushed red pepper and a little Parmesan to the sauce, noodle mixture and it was yummy!  Also, I did not add the noodles to the crock pot because I wanted to take  this to a friend for supper, so after the sauce cooked in the crock pot all day I stirred it with frozen tortellini and about 1/4 c. grated Parmesan in a greased 9x13 dish then covered it with foil and baked it at 325 for about an hour and 15 minutes, then added the remaining cheese on top for about 10 more minutes!  So easy and so yum!  I will definitely make again as Stated. (I used Ragu Robusto Garlic and Onion Spaghetti sauce, btw for the 2 c. of spaghetti sauce called for.)

I made this for my daughters since I'm a vegetarian, but it's so good that I keep picking  out tortellinis and mushrooms to eat myself. This almost makes me want to go back to eating meat! Just from the flavor that's soaked into the pasta, I can tell that the meat sauce is rich and delicioius.  It was also very easy to make.  The only work involved was browning the meat and opening a few cans.  My daughters gave this 5 stars and so do I.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. The only thing I changed-due to availability-were the tortellini. I use cheese and spinach stuffed ravioli. Heat up some garlic bread and toss a ceasar salad. Definately a keeper and so nice to come home after a day at work!

I don't make pasta often, but my husband doesn't care for lasagna, and I don't care to eat spaghetti everytime, so this was a really good change!  Used spaghetti sauce, doctored up with the usual Italian spices.  I have a hard time finding bulk Italian sausage at my stores, so I bought Johnsonville Italian sausages and pushed out of the casings.

This was good except it was very salty, not sure why.  I did not use Italian sausage, all ground beef.  Otherwise, had a very good flavor and very convenient - which is always great!

I made some major changes to this recipe, because of our families tastes.  I didn't use mushrooms, and left out the chunkier tomatoes.  I used all sausage instead of half sausage/half beef.  This was really quick and easy, an excellent meal to make on a weeknight when time is tight.  It was a different twist to regular spaghetti and had pretty good flavor.

My husband and I liked this recipe, though I think I'll try something else the next time I make tortellini.  I added garlic and onions to the meat and substituted 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms (sauted with meat when the meat was nearly done) for the canned mushrooms.  I used a whole can of roasted garlic pasta sauce (24 oz.) instead of the marinara sauce.  Overall, it was very easy to put together and tasted pretty good.

I made this for a board meeting that I was attending and everyone wanted the recipe.  The tortellini came out just perfect and instead of jar sauce I used some that I had made previously and frozen. I added uncooked sausage links at directly into the sauce and before I added the pasta I broke the sausage up.

This recipe was delicious.

My family loves meat so I added about 3lbs of hamburger, used the cheap can of Hunts Traditional Spaghetti Sauce, some dice garlic, and a 1/2 bag of onions, red and green peppers.  I used 20 ozs of tortellini.  I served it with Garlic Bread and a Salad (at least we had one healthy thing).  Boy was this good.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  We have pasta once a week and this was a quick way to use tortellini! To make this dish quicker, I substituted ground sage sausage.  To cut back on calories, I served the two cheeses in additional dishes for everyone to top with the kind they liked.

I used Trader Joes simple italian tomato sauce starter and then added one can of italian style diced tomatoes and one can of regular diced tomatoes.  I also used browned and drained italian turkey sausage.  I substituted whole wheat spaghetti for the tortellini and put roasted red peppers in at the end with the spaghetti.  This is the only way I will eat spaghetti from now on - the kids and hubby loved it too.

This was great!  I made a couple of modifications based on other reviewer:  added one finely diced onion, extra can of mushrooms, added a generous amount of garlic, oregano and dried Italian seasoning.  Also, instead of adding the cheese to the slow cooker, I just put the sauce/tortellini in a glass baking dish and browned the cheese on top in the oven.  I doubled this recipe and saved the extra sauce in the freezer.  This will become a regular recipe for us - it was easy and delicious!  Thanks for sending it in!

This was okay, nothing wonderful.  I browned the meat and mixed everthing together and placed in a 9 x 13 inch baking dish and baked at 325 for 20 min.  Maybe my mistake was not using the slow cooker, I don't know. It was a fast meal.

This was the first reciepe my family DID NOT like. The only one who "sort of" liked it was my husband, and he'll eat anything! I think it was the canned tomatoes and the sausage that gave it the hard-to-eat flavor.

This is a very easy and delicious meal. The parmesean cheese in place of the cheddar was a great suggestion. Be sure to cook this on the lowest setting. I made the mistake of cooking it a little too high and most of it stuck to the pot!

At first I thought it was stupid to make something in the slow cooker that you can make quickly on the stove, but was I wrong.  Like all good sauces, this cooks all day.  It doesn't taste like it comes from jars/cans.  I use a combination of mozzarella and parmesean instead of mozzarella and cheddar.  Try using the refrigerated cheese and garlic tortellini.  One of my favorites.

I have made this several times at the request of my kids.  The whole family really loves it.  I have made it on the stovetop when crunched for time, and it still came out good.  Thanks!

This wasn't very good. I went by the recipe to the T. The only thing that was good was the mushrooms and cheese. LOL Me and my husband wasn't impressed at all. Some people might like this but we didn't. Sorry.. =-(

This is a great recipe that I have made several times! The only thing that I have changed is that instead of Italian style diced tomatoes, I used a garlic, green chilies style diced tomatoes. It added some extra taste to the recipe! A definate must for your monthly planning!

Awesome recipe! I have prepared this many times for small family meals, large family meals, and retirement parties for up to 50 people (in large roasting . Everyone raves about this meal and asks for the recipe. The only substitution I make is Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage in place of the Italian Sausage.

This was pretty good! I will make it again because it was not only good, but EASY & CONVENIENT! However, I will add some herbs and spices the next time to bump it up a notch.

This recipe is delicious. The only complaint I have is that 9oz of this pasta does not feed 6 people. Even the package says it’s about 2 1/2 servings.

I used more marinara so it would be soupier.  I also added some Italian seasoning to the crock pot.  And I added some minced garlic while browning the meat.  I used 96/4 lean ground beef.  Did not add the cheese to crock pot.  We just sprinkled some Mozz and Parmesan  on top after we scooped it in our bowls.  My hubby loved this recipe, thank you very much for it!!

This was delicious. I've made some tweaks to it. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey. I've swapped plain Italian sausage with Italian turkey sausage. Since I didn't have any cheddar cheese with me, I've grated a block of white cheddar cheese.  I've used store-brought frozen tortellini and it came out so good.  I would make this again.

So easy and absolutely delicious. I did make one change. Instead of canned mushrooms I used 1 cup of fresh sliced Portobello's. I love the earthy Taste of fresh mushrooms. Tonight I am going to use ravioli instead of tortellini at my son's request. I'm sure it will be scrumptious!

It tastes very good. We are having it with mixed vegetables for our lunches this week. All I added was some extra  Italian Seasoning to add some extra flavor.

Thank you for this and other recipes.

This was very good!! I skipped the mushrooms and didn't include the cheddar cheese. There were suggestions to add a bell pepper and onions, which I may do next time (I can see how it would make an equally good dish just by changing the flavor profile), but I really didn't feel it needed anything extra. I doubled the recipe for our family of 4 and we had just enough. Quick and easy.

Second time: Used the mushrooms and cheddar cheese. No significant difference, so use per preference. I thought about the bell peppers and realized it would deter my children. So I stuck with the entire recipe the second time. Overall, still very very delicious!

Amazing dish! My husband loved it. I made two changes though. For the cheese I used parmesan and romano. I did not measure how much I just used my best judgement.  Secondly I did not make it in the crockpot because I made this dish in under an hour. Turned out delicious. Will definitely make again.

It wasn't bad, but I'm going to try this one more time. Next time I'm going to do all Italian sausage with no hamburger meat and I'm going to add a can of cream of mushroom soup and see if that doesn't help the flavor a little bit.

Good!! I cut out the sausage and just used very lean ground beef. I also didn't use my crockpot but made the sauce on the stove and added the torts. Yummy! Oh! And my picky 2 yr old even ate them!

This turned out so good the first time I made it. I have been making this for some time now. A all time favorite in my house, my children love it.  The only thing i may do a little different is maybe not add all of the cheese the recipe calls for.

This is a staple in our house thanks to this recipe! I double the tortellini (one of the family size packages) to have the right sauce ratio, and I don't use any cheddar (given it isn't really an Italian flavor). Awesome weeknight meal!

I really like it prepared as is,but I did follow the suggestion of adding a bit of garlic. Next time, I think I will add freshly cracked pepper and a bit more sauce as I noticed I had to add a bit of water to thin it a bit. I did not have the time to cook it in the slow cooker so cooked the sauce for about 45 minutes at a low temperature. YUM!

This turned out so watery, I switched the tortellini to gnocchi and made soup out of it. Delicious but not quite what I was expecting or hoping for.

Great recipe starter. I never use canned mushrooms like I never use canned tomato sauce so I used fresh sliced cremini, peppers, onions and garlic to flavor. I also skipped the cheddar and added parmesan and it was delicious.

Nothing special about this at all. Not bad, just nothing I need a recipe for. I make tortellini all the time and if you're just going to add some meat to a jar of sauce, you can't expect anything outstanding.

We make this recipe exactly as written and it has gone into rotation at our house. I've made it for others, leaving out the mushrooms for them and everyone has really enjoyed it. We use Newman's Own Marinara sauce with this recipe and it has a great cooked-for-hours tomato flavor. Easy, filling, and tasty.

It needed some "doctoring" in my opinion, not a bad recipe over all - just not as flavorful as I would have liked. Lots of tomato sauce and not much else.

This is one of my "go to" recipes.  It is the most requested recipe for my supper club.  Super easy.  I make it exactly like the recipe, but sometimes add more tortellini.  I have used a different marinara sauce every time - still great.

I absolutely love it!  I've served it for guests at my home and at Church.  The only change I make is substituting the cheddar for mozzarella cheese and serving it with shredded parmesan cheese on the side.

My family likes tortellini but we did not like this recipe. There were leftovers so I added 'regular' pasta and extra sauce to it and everyone said it was much, much better that way. I won't make this again.

This dish was very good. Next time I will try with fresh mushrooms instead of canned. And though it was good the first night I made it, it was even better as leftovers later in the week. I will definitely make this dish again. Easy Easy Easy and tasty!

I left out the mushrooms, and added a chopped onion when browning the meat. Everybody loved it. If you brown about 4 times the meat you need, you can freeze itthe extra in appropriate portions and then throw it in the crockpot and make it even easier the next few times. :)

I accidentally left off the mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, but it tasted just fine without it. I did sprinkle a little grated parmesan (sp) cheese over the top after I dished it into a bowl. It was still very delicious. My roommate and I both get ill if we eat a lot of cheese, so it was a win-win. We will try it regular way next time, but will probably continue to make it this way.

This was fantastic and so easy for a weeknight meal. We used 1# ground turkey because we accidentally pulled it out instead of beef...just added some fennel and additional italian seasoning to the meat along with chopped onion as we browned it. Next time we'll add less cheese, but very tasty.

I've been making this recipe for years. I made it last night and used storebought cheese ravioli instead of tortellini. Tasted great! Wonderful recipe that adds a personal touch to the meat sauce instead of just using a jar of sauce alone. Thanks for the recipe!

I added one onion and 1/2 a green pepper to the ground beef mixture, used 20 ounces of tortellini, a teaspoon of brown sugar, and an entire 26 ounce jar of marinara sauce.  Delicious!

This was a huge hit, I used my own meat sauce(in place of the jar sauce and meats),fresh mushrooms, but other then that no other changes.

very tasty meal and easy to put together.  I confess that due to lack of time, I did it on the stove top but since then have used the crockpot.  Solid weeknight meal.  Thanks

This a delicious meal that is easy to prepare. Since I don't like mushrooms, I added whole cloves of garlic instead. (1 head of garlic) I served this dish to a few of my friends who loved it. I definitely plan on making this again in the future.

This was absolutely fantastic! I would recommend doubling the amount of tortellini that is called for. We had a lot of left over sauce. I will definitely be making this again!

If I could give this more stars I certainly would.  I don't usually add the hamburger, just go with the sausage.  I don't know why this combination is so good...it just is!!

A great start for sure! I had to tweak the recipe to account for our personal preferences--I skipped the ground sausage and opted to place a package of whole, hot Italian sausages into the sauce. I also added seasonings including Italian seasoning, ground black pepper and onion/garlic powders. I chopped a couple of cloves of garlic and a small onion and added them to the 1/2lb of lean ground beef while browning. I ended up missing dinner that night, so my husband just dug into the sauce and made his own side of pasta; I didn't have a chance to add the tortellini or cheese to the crock pot. The next day, for leftovers, I boiled the tortellini (spinach/cheese variety) as directed and placed it, along with the leftover sauce and sausage, into a baking dish. I covered the top liberally with shredded mozzerella and grated parmesan cheeses and baked it at 400 degrees for around 15-20 minutes, until golden brown and bubbly. Wow, it was out of this world! I think from now on, I will make this in the crockpot without the tortellini and just have a good sauce with pasta the first night and then transform the leftovers into a quick, delicious baked treat. Although I traveled far from the original recipe as written, I thank the poster for a wonderful base recipe!

I'm a beginner at cooking new dishes and I don't have an opinion on sausage yet so I did the meat as directed. I did bake as other reviewers recommended because I didnt have time for slow cooking. I omitted the mushrooms and tomatoes and addeded 6 more ounces of Marinara sause (only because we don't like chunks of tomatoes and we are not fans of mushrooms throughout a dish). I didn't use the cheddar just because I didn't have any. This dish turned out delicious. A little dryer than its supposed to be but the tortellini was tender, and the flavor of the dish was great! Next time I will probably add more sauce.

This was good and very easy to make. I gave 3 stars because the sauce almost burned. I left it overnight in the slow cooker, 7hrs on low, and it was dry and starting to burn on the sides. I was able to save it thought.  I also decided to add garlic and italian seasonings to meat because it was coming out on the bland side.    Other than that, it was good. I will make this again with a few adjustments.

This gets 3 stars because the kids liked it, even if the adult reaction would have made it a 1 or 2 star.  The first time I tried this I made my own marinara sauce and used fresh mushrooms, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  The result was disappointing.  The second time I followed the recipe to the letter and felt like I was eating sloppy-joe-coated tortellini.  This is a thumbs down for me, though I'm sure is great for people with different taste.

a little salty, but delicious. i'm guessing saltiness is dependant on the type of italian sausage used.

This is phenomenal! I made this with what I had at home, so I used all ground beef with no sausage.  And we used 1lb. 90z. of cheese ravioli.  It was so GREAT, my husband and two boys just could not get enough of it.  And one of the easiest things I've ever made!  So delicious - THANK YOU! :)

I followed the recipe as closely as I could due to time and what foodstuffs I had on hand. I didn't use a slow cooker, just a skillet. I used all hamburger and added italian seasoning, fresh garlic and basil, didn't have sausage. I used fresh mushrooms and onions instead of canned mushrooms. It turned out really good! It was a bit greasy but I think it would have been worse if I'd used sausage, too. We had it with italian bread and butter. And, as usual with italian food, the leftovers the next day were even better than the night before! Good stuff, will make again!

4.5 stars. I made this on top of the stove b/c of time. I did however tweak it with some additional italian seasoning, garlic powder, and sauteed onions and peppers. I also used turkey italian sausage. This was so yummy. A must have again.

Absolutely delicous, with a few small changes that I took from previous reviews.  I minced a clove of garlic and sauted it in a bit of olive oil, then added ground turkey.  As the turkey browned, I added some italian seasonings.  Everything else was done according to the recipe.  My family loved this and I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was delicious!  I did however make a few modifications based upon what I had in my fridge/cupboard.  I used 1 lb. lean ground turkery and 1/2 lb. sweet Italian turkey sausage.  I browned the meat with 1/2 of a finly chopped onion, 1 garlic clove minced, 1/2 of a red pepper and italian seasonings.  Once the meat was cooked, I added a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasoning (I pureed it), and a jar of spaghetti sauce.  Once it simmered a while, I covered the bottom of a casserole dish with the sauce, added 18 oz. of tortellini (a cheese blend and a chicken/ham blend this seemed like the right amount for the sauce being prepared but makes 2 meals worth), a can diced olives and covered with the remaining sauce.  I then topped it off with mozzerella cheese.  I put it in a 375 oven for 30 min. and it was delicious!!!  This would also be fantastic in a crocpot as suggested however I was short on time and the bubbly browned mozz. cheese on top was yummy!  My husband and two young boys loved it, we will certainly be making this again!

So Yummy!!!  I also used the green pepper and onion when I fried up my meats.  The green pepper adds a bit of color too to the dish.  For the meats I used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 of the Jimmy Deans Hot Sausage.  This gave it spectacular flavor!  For my seasonings I used garlic pepper and that was it.  My boy who is normally a picky eater had three helping so this recipe is a keeper!!!  Thanks!!!!!!!!

This was great for a quick meal.  I used speghetti sauce that I had on hand.  I then prepared the meat sauce and froze it for use later.  It came out really good.  I used more tortellini than the recipe called for, and it was still terrific.

This tastes delicious, but cooking it for 7-8 hours in the slow cooker is way too long. My sauce starting burning around the edges, and the sauce seemed overcooked. Next time I make this recipe, I will only cook it for 3 hours on LOW in my slow cooker.

I've made this twice this week and it's great. My wife loves it too. I only used ground pork and cheddar cheese (didn't have the others on hand). Also, I added an onion to the slow cooker and various Italian spices. I also used a different kind of pasta since I can't afford Tortellini. With all of the changes it was very simple but very good!

I rated this a 5 with changes.  I am allergic to beef and pork =( I used chicken cooked in italian seasoning.  Tomato sause plan kind and diced tomatos.  Add the usual oregano, pinch of rosmary, minced garlic bay leaf touch of sugar.  I don't measure seasoning but that is close.  Did not have time to slow cook so I boiled the tortelli and precooked sause.  Then added doubled blend of cheese half in and half on top and put it in the oven on 350 for 20-30 depending on cheese type.  I guess this is no longer the recipe I started with but it used most of my leftovers.

So delicious, yet so easy!  I can't think of any recipe that I have made that is so easy yet so delicious.  I love to make this   for potlucks and other events.  I always get compliments.  I usually tell people how to make it because it's one of the few recipes I know by heart!

I decided to cut some corners on this recipe and use the leftover spaghetti sauce I made in my slow cooker a few weeks earlier. Both my fiance and I really enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again.

I changed a lot about this recipe (according to my family's tastes and what ingredients I had).  I used 1 pound of ground beef (we don't care for sausage), regular pasta sauce, an 8 oz container of fresh mushrooms, which were sauteed with the beef, ravioli (my store did not have plain cheese tortellini, so I substituted cheese ravioli), and I added some zucchini as well.  I read other reviews and used 2 packages of the ravioli.  Overall, my family really enjoyed this.  I agree some others that the slow cooker is probably unnecessary, but one real positive about this recipe is that there are not many dishes left to do!  The sauce cooks all day in the crockpot and once you throw the pasta into the sauce, that's it, instead of a separate pan for boiling the pasta and a colander for draining.  It tasted good and I will use the recipe again.  Thanks!

Yummy but instead of doing this in the slow cooker, I just baked. It was simple to prepare and plan on trying other varieties of tortellini with different sauces.

Not bad - I stirred in the tortellinis too late (time constraints due to work) and they didn't get soft enough.  I might make it again, but not for a while.

I was not very impressed with this recipe.  I had to add more and more sauce while this was cooking because it was getting dry.  When done it was sort of bland and nothing really special.  Maybe I was expecting too much and am being too harsh on this one, but I probably won't make again.

This recipe is awesome. I was so surprised that I finally made an italian dish that actually tastes as good as a similar entree' at an Italian Restaurant.

I did leave out the mushrooms.

Great slow cooker recipe.  Have made this three times already and it's a hit every time.  I omit the cheddar cheese and instead of using mozzarella I used a sun-dried tomato and basil mozzarella cheese.  The recipe also doubles easy.

This is so easy and REALLY REALLY good.  I used 1 lb turkey Italian sausage and omitted the ground beef because I forgot to buy it.  I am sure it makes it even better.  Just delicious, was beautiful, thank you whoever invented this recipe!

I personally did not like this all that much. I thought it was rather bland. I am a cajun cooking, grilled bbq, smoke pit kind of guy. When I do Italian i prefer white sauces. That being said I tried this one anyway. My wife is a fan of italian so I try and cook it often. The wife and 2 kids both thought this was great. They gave it a 4.5. I would have said 3 but..........they want this dish often. Great thing is we can have THIS one night (I can eat it), and the next night.......etouffee! :)  (Side note. I liked this a whole lot more as a leftover the next day. Tasted better after sitting).

Good, but I like pasta and cheese more than my spouse.  Would be great when grandkids come to visit!

I loved how easy and delicious this recipe is.  I put it in the crock pot when I left for work and came home and had to do little to get supper on the table.  My boys loved it so much my husband said he couldn't stop thinking about coming home to eat the leftovers the next day while he was at work.

This was OK, just tasted like canned sauce to me, I think the sauce needs to be jazzed up a bit. I don't think I'll make this again.

I was not impressed with this.  It tasted like run-of-the-mill spaghetti sauce with meat.  Very ho-hum, in my opinion.  If I want to make this again, I'll just add a jar of store-bought sauce to a pan of browned italian sausage and top off with some cheese.  At least I'll dirty less dishes that way. It might be better with a homemade sauce than the jar of marinara.  I will not be making this again.

The sauce was really good, but I can't say that I cared for the tortellini.  I won't make this again.

I thought this was a pretty easy and tasty recipe since I used some homemade sauce that I had made and already had in the freezer. The refrigerated past only added to the simplicity.

This was really good!  Didn't use the sausage and doubled the beef, but I think it would've been better with less beef.  Otherwise it was great and was a hit with the whole family!

Not what I expected, no need for the slow cooker. I cooked it in the slow cooker as stated and it was actually to long and it ended up tasting too over cooked. It had a good taste but I think I will try it again but not in the slow cooker...

My family loved it!! I did change the recipe a little bit using Italian spaghetti sauce and Italian rotel which added more flavoring. I only had 3 hours to cook it and it turned out just fine. Made great left overs!

My family, including my two picky sons, love this meal.  We serve it alot when we have company.  I do agree with the others when they say it doesn't need to be in the crockpot all day.  I make it so much I sometimes only put it in the crockpot for a few hours, and it still tastes awesome.  It has never been greasy.

This was very good. I used all hot italian sausage and no ground beef.  I didn't have any marinara sauce so I used a can of spaghetti sauce and I used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, also I used all cheddar cheese as I had no mozzerella.  This turned out very good and will definitly make this again.

It was good, but slow cooking not necessary.
