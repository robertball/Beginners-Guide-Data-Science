Yum!  This would be an excellent Fall side and may even make an appearance at Thanksgiving this year!  The flavors work so well together, and you have to like goat cheese to enjoy this pasta.  Ditalini pasta is a fun shape and really holds the sauce.  Another great one, Chef John, thanks!!

This was tasty, and I'll definitely make it again.  I increased the goat cheese a little and added some red bell pepper and onion with the apples, just because I needed to use them up.  I also added a little crumbled bacon, which I keep in the freezer for all such purposes.  I'm sure it would be fine without those additions, but with stuff on hand that seemed to fit, why not?  Thanks, Chef John, for a great inspiration.

This was extremely tasty, I think 2 apples would do wonders though.

First:  I made this with the ingredients I had on hand (feta instead of goat cheese and almonds instead of walnuts) so I'm sure that affected the outcome.  The way I made it was suprisingly good.  (I wasn't sure I'd like the apple.)  Next time I'll have to plan better and actually shop for the right ingredients.  Thanks!

AMAZING!  This is such a unique and unexpected dish - we just loved it!  I made it exactly as written except I omitted the cayenne pepper because I'm not a fan of spice, and I added an extra apple because of other reviewers.  I think that made it even better.  We didn't find this too bland or anything - although we are big fans of goat cheese!  This is not too difficult to make and turns out really well.  I would definitely recommend it.

We made this tonight for dinner and we really liked it! We used a granny smith apple and subbed vegetable broth--YUMMY. Next time I think I will use more goat cheese to make it even creamier:) Thanks for sharing  !

My daughter is new to goat cheese so she didn't like it. My husband and I thought it was great. I left out the walnuts and doubled the apples. I didn't want to take the time to chop the apples so I cut them in fairly thin slices but I should have cut them in half after that. They were a little bit too big. Definitely need 2 apples and I even cut the pasta in half. I think it would have been dry if I had done 2 cups of pasta.

I made exactly per the recipe, with the exception of herbed goat cheese since that was in the fridge. I used one green apple since I didn't want it to be overly sweet, but it could've used 2 as I was digging to find pieces of apple in the final product. Took away one star because once it cools off (and it cools off quickly) the goat cheese sauce ends up kind of a grainy texture that is not too appetizing; however, the taste was excellent on this dish. I had leftovers the next day with leftover Italian sausage and it was delicious. I will make this again, plus 1 apple.

So simple!  A little to my  surprise it was enjoyed by everyone in the family.  I noticed many reviews said they'd add more apple.  I think I would have like this without any apple, although it was good as made, too.  My daughter said she'd like more apple. I  think I preferred the savory part of it more.  I could see making this with some type of meat; perhaps apple chicken sausage would be tasty.  
Goat cheese has been a surprise hit in our house even with the kids.  Using it like this was new for me, but wow, loved it.  Will be making this again!

I was looking for a different recipe for goat cheese.  This was easy and tasty.  We had it as a main dish.  I will try it next with pork roast and add another apple.  I did use garlic and herb flavored goat cheese. I might try a different flavor next time.

I used 2 cups of milk instead of 3 and it turned out pretty perfect.  I need to make it again because I only had a few bites before my family devoured it.  It was a hit and perfect for a busy Christmas week dinner.

Although this was tasty it was too much fuss and had uncommon ingredients as a side dish for me.    I just happened to have some goat cheese.   I fixed recipe as written except had only pecans to toast which evens adds extra taste.  I prefer to make a simple fettucini alfredo and leave apples to a salad or dessert.  I probably won't make again.

This was quite good.  Served as a main dish and followed recipe exactly.  I agree with the other reviewers that another apple would do well in this dish.

I reduced the pasta to 1 cup.  I used almonds instead of walnuts and 1 c water and 2 chicken bouillon instead of broth.  I also used 8 wedges of laughing cow blue cheese instead of 4 oz goat cheese.  I did not saute the apple first, I just boiled it in the water and through the butter in afterwards.  I have to agree with the other reviewers, it needs another apple.  I think if I had left it with 2 c pasta and only 4 oz cheese it would have been dry and bland.

Pretty good. A little on the bland side, so I added extra cayenne powder, italian seasoning, onions, red pepper, and a pinch of garlic powder. I also substituted the pasta with whole wheat for health reasons. Otherwise, the goat cheese pasta fills you up real quick, super creamy and delicious!

We made this last night and did like it, but when i make it again i will change a couple things.  I would use a goat cheese with herbs or something on the outside to give the pasta a little more flavor, ands also more than 4oz.  Also i think i cooked my apples a couple minutes too long because i couldnt really taste them or know that they were there, even though i used an extra apple. Also more thyme then was called for. Still very yummy though!
