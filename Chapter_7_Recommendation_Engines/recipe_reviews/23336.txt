This was delicious and EASY.  I used 1.3 lbs of ground turkey.  I, too, increased the crushed tomatoes to 28 oz., added 1/2 T. cumin and some jalepeno and chipotle peppers.  I cooked the onion, garlic and turkey in a saute pan, then transferred the mixture to a crockpot (so I didn't have to tend to it) and added the other ingredients.  It cooked on high for an hour and a half and was ready to eat.

This recipe is a definte 5 stars!! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used a 28 ounce can of tomatos,1.5 lbs of turkey and 1/2 a teaspoon of cumin.  It was excellent but not spicy enough for my liking, so I added another 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and a tablespoon of crused red pepper.  It was perfect!!!  This is something I will make again and again!!

This was the best new recipe I have tried in a long time.  If you own a can opener you can make this dish.  I read the other reviews and took what sounded good from those.  I used 28 oz of tomatoes, 2 cans black beans, 1 can pinto beans with jalapenos, and 1 can of corn.  I also added 1 tbl cumin and 1 tsp red pepper flakes.  This mixture and amount of spice was perfect for us.  My husband and I both LOVED this dish.  He ranted for days about how good it was.  I served it with sweet cornbread, and topped it with a little shredded cheese and sour cream .... YUMMMO!!

This is a great base recipe for our taste. As any good cook knows, you take a basic recipe and adapt it to the seasonings you like or love. Ground turkey is bland so I also added the cumin--about 2 tablespoons as we LOVE the flavor, and used ground oregano--about 2 teaspoons to a pound of raw turkey. If you use ground turkey breast it may be necessary to add 1-2 T. oil to brown it if to dry.  I love to simmer meat and seasonings in a bit of fatless chicken broth until tender then add the rest and simmer for 10+ minutes.  Enjoy!

Following other the reviewers' suggestion, I used almost an entire 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (not 14 oz) and it worked great! I also added a can of corn and garnished the finished product with grated cheddar cheese. Also, I used 1.5 lbs. ground turkey and found that this was the exact right amount of meat. This chili was a big hit at my last dinner party!

This is a nice change from regular chili.  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes along with a  can of diced tomatoes with green chilis to add a little kick.  It seemed to take care of the problem of the recipe not having enough spices (that others have complained about).  I also added cumin because I love it and I used ground beef only because that's what I had.  I also used balsamic vinegar in place of the wine because that's also what I had.  All in all, I loved it and so did my family.  Give it a try:)

Very good!  Even better if you simmer the chili for over an hour.  I used a bit of olive oil when cooking the onions and garlic.

This was very good chili. Only made minor changes... omitted onion, doubled tomatoes, added a can each of green chilis and whole kernel corn, and added a bit of cumin to the meat when it was browning. I added extra chili powder, a few shakes of crushed red pepper, and a healthy dose of black pepper because the oregano seemed a bit overwhelming. Very good, thank you!

I have made this chili about 6 or 7 times and I think I have perfected it.. it gets rave reviews.  My additions are to add 2 tbsp. cumin in the saute with the onions and garlic and another 2 tbsp. cumin in the mixture.. the more the better in my opinion.  Like previous reviewers, I also use double the crushed tomatoes and a can of corn (drained) as well.  I prefer a little more meat to give it some thickness.. about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 pounds.  Now the key to me.. I add a healthy dose of Tabasco Chipotle Pepper sauce to the mixture... trust me trust me.. it combines with the cumin and gives the chili an amazing smoky character. It is not a hot sauce.. more of a smoky sauce.   Last night, I combined it with some customized Jiffy cornbread with a can of corn, a little honey and some minced rosemary.  It was awesome....

Simple & Easy & Yummy! This makes a lot more then 6 servings. I did take others suggestions: added a can of corn (drained), added 1 tbsp of cumin, and put it all in a crockpot for 3-4 hours.  I also drained the cooked turkey before adding it to the crockpot.  We ate it wrapped up in flour tortillas with cheddar cheese and sour cream.  **Update** I made this a second time and it was just as yummy but I accidentally put 2 Tbsp of Cumin in....OOPS!!  Panicking, I Googled my way to a solution....Nutmeg.  I added about 1/2 tsp. and let it keep on cooking. (You could add more if you wanted the cumin flavor tuned down further).  This time, I froze the chili in 1/2C portions because that makes 1 burrito and a little on the side for dipping chips into.

Decent chili.  Not the best I've had, but I was able to use ingrediants I had on hand.  I used twice the tomatoes and only 2 cans of black beans.  I also spiced up the turkey with a teaspoon of Cumin.  I agree that it could have used more seasoning.  Using a dollop of light sour cream and light cheddar cheese tops the dish off well.

This recipe is GREAT and a real hit with our family. One change I made was to use balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.  The balsamic vinegar gives it a real earthy flavor.  Thanks for the good recipe!

I tried this today and made a couple of adjustments.  I purchased a packaged of Walmart's MILD chili seasoning packet, added 28oz can can crushed tomatoes with basil, 1 med can tomatoe sauce and used 2 large VIDALLIA onions.  Did not use the red wine vinegar, chili powder oregano or basil leaves, since the seasons were in the packet.  I used a 20oz package of ground turkey.  My Mom loved it.  Mades a lot of chili!!.  She took some home, and we gave some to a lady who is unemployed and still have enough for me!! OH!!  I cooked it in my crock pot (6 QT) on low for 4 hours.

I've never been a fan of turkey chili because they all seemed to too polite. This recipe changed that. In my version, I added 1/2 T. more chili powder, about 1/2 T. gd. cumin, and, for some smoky kick, 1 1/2 T. chopped chipotle in adobo. Next time, I will add the beans later because after simmering 60+ minutes, canned beans start to turn to mush. Like most chili recipes, this one can be customized to suit differing tastes.

This recipe was super easy. I did, however, take some suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the amount of crushed tomatoes (2 cans of 14.5 oz), used only 2 cans of black beans, and used 1 1/2 pounds of ground white turkey. I left out the basil leaves since I did not have any on hand, but it tasted great. We topped it with cheese and sour cream and, unfortunately, ate it while we watched the Bears lose to the Packers! : )

This was a quick and easy chili to make. I did add some things to strengthen the flavor a bit. I added 1 tablespoon of cumin, half a can of green chilies, 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, half of a yellow bell pepper, topped it with cheese and I did not put the vinegar in it. I also cooked it in the Crock Pot for four hours as suggested by some of the other reviews. It turned out wonderful. This would be great for the winter time since the chilies make it a little spicy. Thanks for the recipe!

With a few changes this could be 5 stars.  Changes: 2 cans black beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes and added cumin because you just need cumin in chili.  Great, healthy chili option. Really enjoyed!!  Also sauteed onion and garlic then added turkey with cumin to cook and then put everything in the crock pot to cook all day.

This is a great recipe.  I added more vinegar, twice the tomatoes, 2 cans of corn, cumin, and a bottle of Major Peter's salsa style bloody mary mix.  Just brown the burger, throw everything in the crock pot and VIOLA!  Some of the best chili you will ever eat.  Don't forget the sour cream, cheese, and corn bread!

My 10yr old son said it's better than fantastic!  Super easy to make and oh so yummy!  I used 1.5 pounds ground turkey and added 1T cumin while browning it.  I also took the suggestion to use a 28oz can of tomatoes. I've made this twice and it is healthy and fabulous with crusty bread. Leftovers are great, too!

I have to say that this is something I will always make a day ahead.  While I was cooking it I wasn't impressed, actually I was dissappointed!  I figured that we were going to toss the leftovers after we ate it the next night.  Well I was wrong!  The flavors melded together very nicely and we all loved it!  I doubled the recipe, but I did not double the beans.  6 cans for 2 pounds of meat seemed too excessive. I could have added one more can, but was glad that I didn't increase it to 6.  This way flavor of the turkey was not overpowered by the beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time that I've ever cooked a chili with ground turkey.  Per other reviewers' comments, I seasoned the turkey with Montreal Steak seasoning, Worchestshire sauce, and cajun seasoning to give it lots of flavor.  I sauteed Vidalia onion, red pepper, and chopped garlic to add to the mixture.  I used 2 cans of black beans, 2 cans of seasoned tomatoes, and a can of corn.  I added an additional TBS of ground cumin and a TBS of ground coriander.  Cooked in the crock pot and added shakes of hot sauce, more Worchestshire, and red wine.  Very tasty!!  Thanks for the recipe Rebecca!

We eat a lot of chili and I really like this recipe. I make a few changes to suit our tastes:  I double the meat and blend the can of tomatoes because we don't like chunky tomatoes in our chili.  I add 1 1/2 tsp of Chipotle Chili powder (in addition to regular Chili Powder) plus 1 or 2 finely diced fresh jalapenos. The Chipotle powder gives it a richer, smokier taste. I usually add a chopped red or orange sweet pepper. The secret to this (for me) is simmering it for a long time so the flavors meld. This is a super simple recipe that people love. Thanks Rebecca!

Tried this recipe because I had lots of black beans and needed a recipe to use them up. Didn't really think this recipe could be as good as all the reviews said, but I was wrong. Amazing! Even my kids loved it. The only thing I added extra was a can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic (only because I like extra tomatoes) and used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar. It's a keeper for us. Thanks Rebecca!

great!  added 1/2 teas cumin - additional 1/2 teas. chilli powder - pepper flakes - and instead of 3 cans of black beans I did one can black beans, one can pinto beans and one can corn.  use 20 oz. turkey and 28 oz. crushed tomatoes.  everything else the same.

So yummy!  Didn't really change anything other than I did add an extra can of black beans.  With the 1 pound of meat it just seemed overly meaty...the extra can of beans made it more balances.  We put this in the slow cooker for the day.  It was even better the next day!  I think this would be really good with shredded chicken breast as well.

Delicious and so simple to make.  The only things that I did differently were that I added about a tbsp. of olive oil to saute the onion, and I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 2 cans of black beans instead of 3 cans.  I topped the chili w/shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, and some hot sauce.  Definitely worth trying.

This was very good, but I read other reviews and changed things a bit. I can't imagine only using one can of tomatoes - it would be very thick! I used 3 cans of tomatoes and it was perfect. I also only used 2 cans of black beans and I added extra chili powder, pepper, and garlic. I sauteed the garlic and onions in 1 tbsp of olive oil for extra flavor. Overall it was very good, but read other reviews before making it!

This recipe was excellent.  I added a can of tomato soup and taco seasoning.  I also drained the beans. Overall, very delicious and using the ground turkey makes it a lot leaner.

This recipe IS indeed fantastic but I found some small additions to make it even better.  Use 28 oz. crushed tomatoes and also add 1 tsp cumin + sprinkle of cayenne pepper when cooking the onions, garlic, and turkey together.  This was a hit at a Superbowl party!

pretty tasty! I put the browned meat and onions into the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients and let it cook on high for 2 hours. Served over the Sweet Cornbread recipe on this site. 

Just wished for some more spice to it. Next time I'll add more spice.

Delicious!  First time making black bean chili.  I did tweak it though.  I used Rotel tomatoes and apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  I topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream.

This recipe was a hit.  I changed very little.  I also used Rotel tomatoes instead of crushed.  It added a little heat which we liked.  To make it fabulous, after I cook the turkey and heat all the other ingredients through, I put it in the crock pot for a few hours.  It really blends all the flavors well.  My husband asks for this all the time.  Plus it's not that bad for us. Thanks Rebecca!

The best black bean chili ever!! I used grass fed ground beef in place of the turkey and a dash of cumin. The wine vinegar is the secret I think as it enhances all the flavors! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

Yummy...this is not only a very filling meal but also a healthy one! I followed the recipe exactly except I used cooking spray instead of vegetable oil and doubled the crushed tomatoes. I made sure to use LEAN ground turkey because it's much lower in fat and calories than regular. It tastes even better as leftovers. It got a bit thick in the fridge, so I added a little water before reheating the next day. I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this for a Halloween party and called it "Bettle Stew."  To enjoy this, you obviously need to like the taste of black beans.  My husband thought this was good but others preferred the taste of regular kidney beans.  I added 1 tbs cumin and 14 oz chicken broth as indicated by other reviewers.  Good flavor overall; it's just not for me.

Great recipe!  My review will sound redundant, but here I go:  2-14oz cans of crushed tomato (there is NO way you can do this recipe with 1 can!), 1lb ground turkey, no fresh onion/garlic so I used onion/garlic powder,  only had 2 cans blk beans so I used 1 can kidney beans ILO of the 3rd can, used balsamic vinegar b/c I didn't have red wine vinegar, used 1 can corn.  I added Montreal seasoning/onion and garlic powders, few dashes of cumin and chili pwd to meat mixture.  Added to a large pot and dumped all the cans in.  Added the seasoning (easy on the chili pwd b/c of my 3-yr old, easy on the oregano b/c I think it is a potent spice).  Simmered for about 40 minutes.  Still needed some umph, so added more salt, fresh ground blk pepper, and 3 dashes of ground red pepper.  Simmered a little longer and then let set for 20 minutes.  My daughter and husband devoured it!  Served with Jiffy mix cornbread with 1/2 can creamed corn, 1 tsp of baking powder, and honey squeezed on top.  Will definitely move this into my winter dinner rotation!

Most excellent and easy!  Used seasoned ground turkey (Jennie-O, 1.25 lbs) and 2 cans black beans, 1 can kidney beans and 1 can garbanzo beans (drained).  Used two cans stewed tomatoes (Italian style).

Cooked a few strips of bacon in a pan and then browned the onions, garlic and turkey in the pan and crumbled the bacon with it.  Mixed it with everything else in the recipe in the crockpot, cooked on high for a few hours and it was ready.  Later I turned it to low and it just kept tasting better and better.

Next time I may chop up some carrots and celery as I like lots of vegetables.  But as is, it's very easy and delicious!  A friend came over and tasted it for lunch and said she was inspired to make chili for her family tonight.

Update: Sept 2006. Still fantastic recipe.  I used one can corn, one can black beans and one can pinto beans and two cans stewed tomatoes and even my 20 month old loved it.  He esp. loved the pinto beans and the soup.  Next time I may cut back or skip the vinegar and just add a teeny bit of red wine.  The citric acid in the stewed tomatoes is plenty.

this was DELICIOUS!! i added some cumin and used more meat (1.3 lb)...also used 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans (instead of 3 cans black beans) since that is all i had. came out great anyway, since i like chili that is more meaty. :) anyway, with sour cream, this chili is *irresistible!* i ate 1 1/2 bowls, and my boyfriend ate three (and he doesn't even like chili or beans in general!!)

I have made a lot of chilli and this recipe may be the best one yet.  Quick and delicious,great for a weeknight.  I doubled the quantity of crushed tomatoes to make more broth.  Also added a dash of chipotle pepper seasoning to add a smokey pepper flavor which added some more intensity to the overall taste.

Very good and healthy chili recipe.  I did drain the turkey before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also added the extra tomatoes and spices that others mentioned.  Definitely need to spice it up to taste.

This is a great chile.  It tastes like meat because of the black beans.  I usually add extra chile.  I always substitute tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes since I make it in a slow cooker.  I also add cayenne pepper to taste.  I have now made this over 10 times.  Substituting ground veal was delicious.

Wow, this was great.  My husband loves black beans and now I have a new recipe.  I used regular ground meat and increased it to 1 1/2 lbs.  I also took the suggestions from the other reviews and increased the crushed tomato's.  This is a keeper.  :)

This was simple and delicious. I love the consistency. I actually used the 28oz.size of crushed tomatoes. And I added a LOT more spices, including cumin. And I added about a half cup of hot peppers. Yum!

The pros for this recipe are it is super easy to make with few ingredients and is low calorie, high protein, high fiber. The only draw-back is it is a little overkill with the black beans. It may just be a personal preference but I think this recipe could be improved by substituting one can of black beans with another kind of beans. I will try with garbanzo beans next time.

This recipe made a pretty good chili.  I substituted turkey for diced tri-tip (about 2/3 lb), and used 1 can of black, and 1 can of pinto beans.  All other quantities remained as stated in the recipe.

I like this recipe because it excludes cumin - a favorite of mine, but not shared universally at our house.  While I generally prefer a heavier chili (with cumin), this recipe still brings a distinctively chili flavor and is very satisfying.

I love chili and I love Black Beans ... turkey, onions and garlic too.  This dish was a grand thud ... no kick, no dicernible flavor other than black bean.  I added crushed re: pepper flakes to salvage it ... it added bite but it was an after affect kick.  Afterwards I laughed at how so tasteless a chili could have me perspire (after adding the pepper) so much.

It was good however I added some green peppers and chili peppers to the mix.  This added a bit more fire to the pot. Leftovers where great or cook it a day ahead and let it everything mingle.

Very nice! This was a pleasant change to the usual ground beef chili. Like other reviewers, I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Because I didn't have basil or oregano at the time, I had to use Italian seasonings (which had a lot of marjoram in it). It still came out delicious.

Excellent recipe!  I cook this at least once a month. I tweak it a little bit with adding one more can of tomatoes,  crushed red pepper and a teaspoon of cayenne and cumin.  My husband and I absolutely love it.

Excellent!  I followed all the ingredients to the letter but simplified the prep.  I sauteed the onion, garlic, turkey then threw everything in the slow cooker.  I let it simmer all day when I was at work (11+ hours - tricky to find recipes that can cook for that long without drying) and it was fabulous!

I only used half the ground meat (and I used beef because that's what I had on hand).  It was GREAT.  I have made this twice, once where I added green and red peppers and some corn, and once where I didn't.  I actually preferred this unaltered.  YUM.  GREAT flavor.

Thsi was pretty good. I followed reviewers advice and made these small changes, omitted oil,doubled tomatoes, added 1tsp red pepper flakes,and added 1 1/2 cups frozen corn (and by personal preference cut the ground turkey amount in half). Placed in crockpot four hours on high. Yummy.

Fantastic Black Bean Chili is a great name for this because it is FANTASTIC.  I changed it a bit only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. 
I used ground beef instead of the turkey.  I also didn't have any beans except a can of black bean soup and I added green pepper too.  It will sure be a staple at our house.

This recipe is wonderful!  We have it at least once a week in the cold weather season. I add a TBS of cummin and a Tbs of corriander for a little "extra something".  I also put it all in the slow cooker and let it cook all day for an extra easy dish.

This is simple and tasty.  Like the other reviews--you have to spice it up.  Next time I'll use less oregeno and more cumin.  Definately taste better the next day.  I'll be making this again.

My husband liked this recipe even better than our "standard" chili.  I usually don't care much for chili, but I liked the idea of the black beans and it was delicious!  I added a little bit of olive oil to the onions and garlic and added about a tablespoon of cumin.  Everything is better with cumin :).  I used lean ground beef instead of turkey, but I doubt that changed the flavor much.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

This recipe is the closest to my Skillet Chili recipe I've seen. Here's how mine is different:
Sautéed onion in Barefoot Cab (in lieu of red wine vinegar) with S&P.
Added 2 T. garlic and 2.3 lbs. turkey and 2 t. Vegetable Better than Bouillon.
When turkey was browned, I added 1 can fire-roasted tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste, 1.75 cans black beans, 2/3 can Ro-Tel. In addition to listed spices, I added cayenne to taste. Really tasty! Worth saving and repeating!

I LOVE this recipe. Have made it several times.  Try not to be too heavy on the Red Wine Vinegar though, it is powerful!  I also use less turkey than called for (about half).  You can even cut it in smaller portions when preparing and it simmers and tastes just the same. :)

Today was clean out the refrigerator day, so of course I had to completely change and use up what I had on hand, but the credit for the inspiration goes all to you.  How wonderful!  I scaled recipe way down to 2 (would really serve 4) and used 2oz diced chicken breast, leftover black beans, diced tomatoes, and olive oil instead of vegetable.  I love love love the addition of red wine vinegar!  Your spice mixture was dead on.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I cooked the dish and had it for dinner as soon as it cooked for the 1 hour 30 minutes, I thought the red wine vinager was too overpowering then. I warmed it up the next day for lunch and it was wonderful! I think it must be one of those soups that are better to cook them and wait to they are cooled down then put them in the refridgerator all night and they are much better the next day. Will be making this recioe again.

For whatever reason - the abundance of black beans, the healthiness of ground turkey, the ease of this recipe - I LOVE it!  It has become one of my mainstays.  The only thing I have added is 1 T of salt.

This is an amazing Chili. My family absolutely adores this one. I pulled back on the oregano some because it was too strong.  I am thrilled with the demand that is now there for me to make this Chili. Thank you so much!

Easy, hearty dinner! I made it last night and it was a hit. I added a lot of extra chili powder because it was a little bland at first and used the 1.3 lbs of turkey. Served with french bread and it was perfect. I'll definitely make it again.

This Chili was excellent!!! I'm one of those people that don't like when others change a recipe, but... I had to have some corn, so I added corn and sliced jalapeno peppers. But that was it! I can't wait to make it again. My family thought this would also be good in a tortilla with rice. Yum :-)

We loved this recipe!  I made a few simple adjustments (many based on other reviewers).  I only added two cans of beans and drained one of them.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used 2 cans of diced.  I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce and about 2-3tbsp of tomato paste.  Also added cumin and ground red pepper.  SO good and so easy.  This one is a keeper!!

I've never tried another recipe for chili other than my own, but my family loved this one.  I did make some adjustments to the seasoning due to personal taste and we served it over rice.  This is my new to-go-to recipe.

I was expecting something really outstanding after reading several of the reviews. It was a good chili, not what I could call fantastic.  I added 1 T cumin and some red pepper flakes as someone else suggested.  It helped, but still not anything in the category of outstanding.

This chili was wonderful!  Since I don't eat meat, I substituted baby bellas for the turkey.  The mushrooms added a meaty texture which worked well with the beans.  Comfort food indeed!  I'll be making this the next time I get snowed in so I can enjoy it with an old movie.

OMG...the chili was the bomb!  My husband, brother-in-law, son and daugthter all LOVED the chili.  Of course, my husband doesn't like ground turkey so I waited until he was on his second bowl before I told him it was chili and of course he said he knew something tasted funny!  LOL!  That's funny because it took him two bowls and my confession to figure it out!  LOL!  I used someone's suggestion to eat it w/multi-grain tortillas.  This is definitely a keeper!  I am so impressed with this recipe.  Oh yea, I left out one important part of the story, I hate ground turkey and took a chance when I made this and I'm now in love with it.  This dish was not bland at all and was very tasty.  If you take others suggestions and use the cummin you will not be disappointed.  I give this recipe 2 thumbs up!  Enjoy...I know my entire family did.  BTW, my husband asked me to pack him some for lunch tomorrow, this came from a man that hates ground turkey!

Excellent Recipe, my family loves it!  I always make a double batch so we have leftovers for the week. Being in TX, to make it a bit more Southwest or TexMex I use fire roasted tomatoes, and replace 1 tbsp of chili powder with 1 tbsp of ground cumin seed + 1Tbsp Lawry's Season Salt.  Very easy to modify this recipe to personal taste, thank you for sharing!

Very good. I only changed a couple of things. I browned the turkey with 1 Tbsp. cumin & 1 Tbsp. onion powder. I also added 2 cans black beans and 1 can pinto beans. My son doesn't really like onions or crushed tomatoes, so I added onion powder and tomato sauce instead. Threw it all in the slow cooker and let it cook for 2 hours on high.

This really is FANTASTIC Black Bean Chili!  And it was such a hit with my family!!  The only thing I tweaked was I added was about 1 tablespoon of cumin because in my opinion, chili just isn't chili without that smoky, cumin flavor.  Oh yeah, I put in about 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes too.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly and it was delish!!  Such a nice change from your run of the mill chili with kidney beans.  I served this with corn bread, cheese and sour cream.  Awesome!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a really good recipe, although I had to add more seasoning to enhance the flavor.  It got better with every day it sat in the refrigerator.  It froze very well too.  I'll make again, and just know that I have to add more seasoning.

to be honest i was wondering how such simple ingredients could create a dish that got such wonderful raves.   i could not find fresh chili's so used a small can of.  i also thought that was way too many beans initially but it turned out to be just right.  would consider using some white beans for variety in the color.  i used a 20 oz of chopped tomatoes and lots of fresh garlic.  recipe seems to be capable of handling any blend of spices. i combined the ingredients the night before and then put into the crock pot in the am for lunch.  YUM   topped with sharp shredded cheddar and sour cream and sprinkled with chopped cilantro.  hubby said it was a KEEPER!

This was good but definitely different due to the red wine vinegar, oregano, and basil. Still, it was easy to make and tasty with shredded colby jack cheese on top.

I'm not sure what the red wine vinegar is for. I added it, and all it seemed to contribute was a strange aftertaste. Definitely need to use more tomatoes and cut down on the number of beans - or at least mix up varieties. I added lentils and some chicken broth to make it soupier.

This chili is amazing. It is the best chili I have ever had. I tried this recipe several months ago and since have made it about once a week. I no longer use my typical kidney bean/beef chili recipe. This has more flavor than any other chili I have ever had.

wonderful, quick and delish paired with sweet cornbread from this site. this is an easy meal, as i usually have all the ingredients at home and just need to buy the turkey. i make this often. i use one 28 oz can of tomatoes and 2 cans of beans, otherwise follow it to a T. this past time i used muir glen organic fire roasted crushed and it was yummy.

Wonderful! Just a few changes: I sauteed red and green pepper, onion and garlic with the ground turkey and added a bit of cumin with the other seasonings. Also, Instead of the black beans, I used white (northern) beans.

Great base, but needs more.  I added: ground cumin (a must in all chilis), salt & pepper (of course!), jalapeno and poblano peppers, paprika, red pepper flakes to taste, and lime juice rather than vinegar.  I also subbed cilantro for basil.

GREAT CHILI!  (Now, I've never heard of making chili without a jalapeno or two and a bottle of beer- so I made those adjustments to my pot and left out the vinegar.  WONDERFUL!)  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  It is not spicy enough for my tastes, but with the addition of a few extra peppers, etc. it will definitely be a keeper! I substituted one can of corn for one of the cans of black beans, and sprinkled with cheese!

This is an amazing turkey chili recipe. Like everyone here, I have added some things to make it my own. I add two 15oz cans of chicken stock to make it as much of a soup as a chili.  I also have a tendency to like it a little spicy and end up adding powered chilpoltle pepper.  I then add some bay leaves and let it stew for a while with the cover on.  Add your own taste!  This is a great recipe.

This chili turned out to be quite tasty -- eventually.  However, it seems this chili actually requires an afternoon or a night of cooking to be tasty.  I found it to be VERY bland without some of the additions recommended by other reviewers.  Working with what I had on hand, I more than doubled the chili powder, added about half of a seeded and chopped jalapeño pepper, increased the vinegar, added a bit of cumin, crushed red pepper.  I agree with another reviewer that the taste of oregano is a bit strong in the final product.  Pretty yum the next day, but it wasn't worth delaying dinner until midnight for!  I'd make this again, but I'm left still searching for the perfect chili recipe.

I've found my new "Favorite Chili" recipe!  I made a DOUBLE recipe for 16 and I modified it slightly, 747captain style.  I used 3 cans of black beans, 2 cans of kidney beans, and 1 can of pinto beans.  I also added 1 packet of HAIN taco seasoning and a dollop of Mick's jalapeno garlic jelly from Pike Place Market in Seattle.   Great chili for the winter!

Wow, I was surprised that I didn't like this with all of the great reviews! In my opinion it was very bland tasting. I must just be in the minority here.

I liked this recipie the first time I made it, but I've made a few changes since and now I LOVE it!  I use TWO (instead of one) cans of DICED tomatos and add 1 small can of tomato sauce.  YUM!  Gives it a fuller flavor!

This chili fits it's name.  If you don't feel like slaving over the stove and want a quick and easy chili, this is the one.  I did have to add some water (next time I may try that can of beer)and doubled the tomatoes.  My daughter says that the addition of shredded cheese, lots and lots of cheese, makes this worth more than 5 stars.  That is high praise from a very harsh food critic.

This was OK.  I drained and rinsed the black beans and used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of a 14.5 oz. can.  I still needed to add water (about 2 cups) as the consistency was so thick.  You can adjust the seasoning as needed.  I reduced the amount of oregano & basil and added a little cayenne or you could add cumin.  I served it with shredded cheddar on top (or you could use jack cheese).

This recipe made as-is is pretty good.  Now, I added a can of Diced Tomatoes, a 4 oz can of green chiles, a tsp of cumin and some undetermined amount of chili powder.  I served it with Cornbread muffins & topped chili with cheddar cheese & a bit of sour cream.  YUM!  Mom, Dad & 3 yr old loved it.  I got a "your the bestest cooker in the world"from my son...the best compliment!

This tasted great!  I turned up the heat a bit, adding a can of dices chiles and also mixed in a can of red chili beans.  Ultimately, it didn't seem like you could go wrong with spicing up the basic recipie provided.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe was so good, but I had to make a few adjustments since I didn't have everything on hand. I used half a red onion, 1 can black beans, 1 can kidney beans, and 1 can white beans. I also used 2 (14.5 oz) cans petite diced tomatoes and 1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce with garlic instead of the crushed tomatoes. I added a 1/2 T cumin, an extra 1/2 T chili powder, the previously suggested crushed red pepper, and about 1/2 to 1 cup water. Simmered in the crock pot for just over two hours. So good!

This chili won me first place at a Super Bowl chili cook-off this weekend!! I'm not the hugest chili fan, personally-- but this is a really tasty dish. The only change I made to the recipe was adding 1 tsp. red pepper flakes. I will definitely make this again (and everyone at the Super Bowl party demanded the recipe after they tasted it). Enjoy!

This is a good chili recipe. I spiced it up by adding a little cyenne pepper and cumin. I have also made this where I use a variety of beans.  I always get great comments on it.

Ok, so I did this recipe the hard way by using dried black beans and it turned out really well.  Because we're watching our sodium intake that was the best route for us along with using "no salt added" diced tomatoes. A great warm meal after playing outside in the cold.  Our daughter said she never liked chili before now and that was all the praise I needed. Thanks for the submission.

Yum!  I used one can of black beans with jalepenos (and two cans regular black beans) and used tomatoes and green chiles for the crushed tomatoes.  Also used a total of 2 T chili powder and 2 t cumin and a couple of dashes of hot sauce (Blair's Death Sauce).  Then we were worried it might be too spicy for the party we were bringing it too, so we threw in a little can of corn to cut it a little.  Sooo good-- great taste, great texture.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was good!  I doubled it and noticed it was a bit thick and not too much liquid but after re-reading the recipe, I realized that I drained and rinsed the black beans instead of adding them undrained.  DUH!!  So the recipe would have been even better if I'd followed directions!  HE HE!

16 guys went up to Wisconsin for our anual broomball outing.  We made enough for 30 servings the night before, and ate the entire 5 gallons of chili the next day.

We have been eating a different recipe every year.  However, next year we will repeat this one because it was so well received.

Excellent blend of spices with both the chili and herb flavors. One thing to keep in mind is not all chili powder is the same blend of spices. Mine had oregano in addition to the added oregano.  I grow fresh basil and oregano. My dinner came out slightly strong on the oregano, but was still very good.
We enjoy green chilies, so I added that as well. Next time I will put the ingredients in a crock pot on low to simmer.

Have you ever noticed how so many reviews start with:  "I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT..." ??   

Well...I followed this recipe exactly, PERIOD.  EXACTLY.  And it was fabulous!  I actually started to add salt, but then thought, "No, I will wait and taste it at the end and see what I think then."  And after tasting it, I decided I really didn't miss the salt at all.  I think the sodium from the canned beans and tomatoes probably gives it enough as is, and the other spices provide a really terrific blend of earthy and rich flavors.  

This was something new and different, and not just the same old chili.  I will definitely make this one again and again!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Very good.  Put the 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes and also added a 10 oz can of ro-tel.  Great with Mont.Jack cheese, sour cream, and some jalapenos.

Perfect for a cold winter day like today in Michigan. I used two can black beans and one pinto (cuz I didn't have three black bean) and was perfect. Also added can of corn. Will make this again for sure!

This chili was ridiculously delicious. It was quick, easy and healthy. It made my dinner! I added a little cumin and smoked chipotle pepper and a lot of garlic and it was just superb! It inspired a whole post on my blog.

Good base recipe. I added corn, 1 tsp of cayenne pepper. Serve with sour cream, cheese, and lime wedges. Tortilla chip strips would be good, too.

Delicious! I changed a few things up: left out the turkey to make it vegetarian, used chili beans for half the beans and actual red wine instead of red wine vinegar and added some diced red bell pepper. I sauteed the onions, pepper and garlic in a separate pan then put everything together in a stock pot to simmer. I didn't really measure anything so I probably used more spices than called for and topped it off with some shredded cheese and a little sour cream. This was definitely one of the better vegetarian chili recipes I've made!

I was looking for a chili recipe to use up leftover turkey I had.  I had cooked a turkey breast the night before and had plenty of leftovers, so I shredded it and used it in place of the ground turkey.  I tried it as is, and in the end, after taste testing it first, decided to add a can of diced tomatoes (and I had used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes because that was what I had on hand), which helped thicken it up. 
 
Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy although I like my chili more spicey so I added more chili powder along with cumin and about 5 times the amount of garlic. I think I'll try to add some anahiem peppers or some roasted chili of some kind next time. I used fire roasted canned tomatoes (Muir Glen) for an additional roasted tasted. A made a big batch for a party we had and my neighbors loved it. I served it with the Vegan Agave Corn Muffins. Huge hit!

I used this recipe, but didnt use canned black beans.  I cooked some myself.

I modified the recipe with these changes:

1. Doubled chili powder to 3 tbsp, and added 1/4 tbsp hot chili powder.
2. Used ground chicken instead of turkey
3. Added 1/2 tbsp cumin
4. Added 1/4 tbsp paprika
5. Since I used my own beans, I added 1/2 cup of tomato sauce
6. For crushed tomatoes, used 2 10 oz cans of Ro-Tel tomatoes.  Use hot or mild for your taste.
7. Used EVOO instead of veggie oil.

This makes a nice spicy chili, as well as the extra chili powder cuts the tart taste of the tomato sauce and the vinegar.

Enjoy!

This is an awesome chilli - my guys didn't even notice the difference between a regular beef chilli and the turkey! I added a can of tomato sauce and doubled the tomatoes.  Also, I used one can of black beans and added white kidney beans and some chopped red peppers.  Next time I will add a bit of spice via red pepper flakes or jalapeno peppers for a bit of a kick!

This chili recipe was pretty good. I doubled the recipe and made a few changes. I added one can of Del Monte Diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles and only used 2 cans of black beans and two cans of kidney beans in chili sauce. Otherwise I kept everything the same. I'll be freezing most of it and hopefully it taste just as good when I use it again.

I loved it so much that I made it twice. I added a small can of tomato paste, 1 tbsp cumin, 3tbsps instead of 1 of the red wine vinegar, and finely minced 2 chipotle peppers in adobo. Sooooo easy, and really good.

Following others' suggestions, I added another can of tomatoes, and used 1 can of hot chili beans and 2 cans of black beans because that was what I had on hand. After tasting the chili, I added more chili powder, some cumin, red pepper flakes, and a splash more vinegar. Overall, this is a very good recipe that I will certainly make again. Thanks!

A decent chili, but very bland. I doubled the garlic and all spices, and it still needed added black pepper and pepper sauce.

Amazing! I usually do not like black beans, but decided to give this a try.  I have been converted! I'll be using black beans instead of kidney beans from now on.  The depth of flavor is amazing.  I browned the meat, onions, and garlic on the stovetop and then finished it in the crockpot.  I had leftovers for lunch today and it is even better! Thanks for an awesome, AWESOME recipe!

This recipe is almost perfect in flavor as a basic chili.  I only added extra crushed tomatoes and some chicken broth just to give it more liquid.  Oh, I also added more cumin for more flavor.  I suggest you start with this and then add your spice that you prefer.  I have young children so this was perfect for them without the spice.

This really is fantastic!  I was on a cleanse and trying to make sure I was getting enough fiber and protein in my day without a lot of processed ingredients.  This recipe definitely did the trick.  The cleanse is long over, but this recipe is a staple in my house now.  Thanks for a great, simple, healthy and comforting meal!

Sorry, but I thought this recipe was rather tasteless.  I added cumin and red pepper, which made it better, but it's not a keeper for us.

Very tasty,and easy to make. I added more chili powder ( I put in 2 1/2 tbs ) and it was still on the mild side. I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes. Making it 29 ounces all together. This definitely tastes better the next day, so if you're making it for a get together make it the day before.

great basic recipe. used 1 can black beans, 1 can of red beans. I add red and green peppers. I add a big can of crushed tomatoes and if i add another can of beans some small cans of tomato sauce. I add crushed red pepper flakes into the oil to make it spicier and i also add jalepenos. I like adding worstershire (sp?) sauce to my ground turkey for some flavor.

This is SO good.  We've made it several times.  We usually add a tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and it ends up being the perfect spiciness for us.

Very good.  I made just a few minor changes: ground chicken instead of turkey and added a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 1 T. cumin.  I browned the ground chicken with the onions and garlic then just threw everything into the crockpot on low for about 4 hours to let the flavors meld.  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this and it was very, very bland. Even my 8-year old thought it had no flavor.  After it had simmered and I tasted it, I added a whole lot more of all the spices, plus cumin. I also think it could use a little more tomato. With the changes I made I'd give it 4 stars, but as-is, it's very blah.  2 stars for taste. 3 stars for ease of recipe.

I made this for hubby and I a few weeks ago and LOVED IT!  He normally likes alot of meat in his chili, but he really enjoyed this recipe.  I dont think he even knew that there was only 1 lb of meat in it.  The taste was amazing!  Instead of crushed tomatoes, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with hot peppers in it from Aldi's.  YUM!  No other modifications were needed.  It's a keeper!

Like others, I browned the turkey and onions on the stove, then transferred everything to a slow cooker and let it cook on low for as long as I could stand it. I added 1/2 T cumin and about 2 T of chipotle chiles blended in adobo sauce for an extra kick and some smokey flavor. Served with chile and cheddar corn bread. Yum!

Yum! This was very good. I used a quart of home canned tomatoes in place of the 14.5 oz. crushed because that is what I had on hand. I also added a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce because my tomatoes seemed a bit watery. Added 1/2 tsp. of cumin to give it a little more spice. I only had about 1 cup of black beans I had cooked the day before and put that with an additional can and my turkey was in a 1.25 lb. package so I used it all. Threw in a stalk of celery cut up also. Very good and seasoned just the way we like it. I didn't think the changes I made altered the original recipe too much. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is so good! I followed the recipe almost exactly except using dry beans that had soaked overnight.  I also added some chicken broth to get the desired thickness.  I served with sour cream and chedder cheese as well as corn bread.  This is a keeper.  My children ages 4 and 5 ask for this.  I am making it again tonight and my babes are excited! Thanks for such a wholesome recipe!

By itself the recipe is a little bland. I followed the suggestion of others and added cumin and salt. It was good, still a little bland. Next time I'll add some green chile like suggested. Good place to start though!

I love this chili! I too used 1.3 lbs of turkey and 28 oz of tomatoes. I also added some cumin, cocoa powder, cinnamon and beer. I simmered it for about 2-2 1/2 hours. I served it with some whole wheat bread sticks. Delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

Not good at all. It needs more veggies.  I thought it was wierd to add canned beans UNDRAINED, but I did it.  I makes the chili slimey. I thought it also needed more canned tomato, maybe diced tomatoe instead of crushed. The turkey was good. Ill definitly use ground turkey next time I make chili. But I wont be makin this again. My suggestion, drain beans and add an extra can of diced tomatoes to make up for the liquid.

It was good but not anything special. I Although I replaced the ground turkey with beef. Maybe that was why. I wanted to do the turkey but nobody in our house likes the smell (or taste) of ground turkey. Oh well, I'd try it if I were you though with the turkey. If you want beef instead, go with another recipe probably.

As a person who cooks chili at least twice per month, every month :) I can say this recipe is really decent! My husband is on a diet so I wanted to give turkey chili another shot--- and we're both glad I did!  I too used 28 ounces crushed tomatoes, added a 4 oz can of diced jalepenos, about 1/2 cup chicken broth, California style garlic salt, fresh ground black pepper, and a small onion (added late to preserve crunchiness). This recipe tastes like something we've had at On The Border restaurant.  Definitely good and a great, healthier alternative to traditional chili. Even without my additions-- I think it'd be really good; with my additions it's noticeably  spicy...yum!

Everyone liked it, even the kids.  I used the larger can of crushed tomatoes and only 2 cans of beans, plus ground beef instead of turkey.  We may make it the next time our vegan brother and sister-in-law come over (w/o the meat).  I think my husband would have liked with a little spice, but my 5 year old like it as it was.

This recipes was AMAZING!  I did NOT follow it to a T though, only deviating to increase the amount of chili powder to give it more of an "umphf."  I also used 3 kinds of fresh peppers, (red, green, and jalepeno), fresh tomatoes, fresh onion and celery, tomato paste, a cup of salsa, a can of undrained corn, black pepper, extra garlic, onion powder, basil, and oregano.  I also used 1.3lbs of ground turkey as that is the only way I can buy it at my local grocery.  This is an extremly nutritious recipe, it made enough for us to eat for a week, and my husband and I LOVED it!  (Sorry not trying to be rude with the modifications--I just tend to "play" whenever I am in the kitchen)  This was bang up!  A MUST TRY!

I love this chili. It tastes best when you make it the night before or early in the day and reheat for dinner. I use the tomatoes with chilis for extra flavor. The first time I didn't and it needed something. I also add diced red pepper.

If you love black bean soup this is the chili for you!  I slow cooked it in a crockpot for about 6 hours.  It was so good- I plan to make it again and again.

This was great!!  I doubled everything (so that I could freeze some for later) follow other reviews and added cumin, extra garlic, extra canned tomatoes, about 8-10 oz. tomato sauce and then at the very end decided to add an additional couple splashes of red wine vinegar.  Very easy recipe, easy to customize to your family's liking.  Will make again!!

This is the first time I have ever rated a recipe!  My husband and I loved this!  I used lean ground beef because that's what I had.  I'm originally from Texas and we have to have cumin in our chili!  I added about a tablespoon of cumin.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Yummy!!!

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe and made a few changes. I used 3 cans of black beans, 1 can of pinto beans, and 1 can of corn. Everyone loved it! I serve it with cornbread and it's always a hit!

My teenagers request this recipe before their friday night football games and invite all thier friends.  I use italian seasoning instead of basil and oregano, add cumin, pepper and a little salt.  Top with grated cheddar,a dollup of sour cream and serve with tortilla chips and/or mini corn muffins.

This is really yummy!  My husband loves it.  I use two cans of Rotel tomatoes and add a little salsa, too.  I also add a little brown sugar so it's not so "acidy" and adding a can of corn is really good, too.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was good chili - very hearty but not the best I have had.  It could have used more spice.  I gave it an extra star, though, because it is so easy to make and seems like it would be versatile.

This is a staple for me.  I love this chili.  I saute the onions in about 1/2 to 1 tsp. of olive oil.  Generally, I just add garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I freeze in small containers and make corn bread to have with it.  VERY good!

This is a fantastic recipe, especially when cooked in a slowcooker. I followed exactly, except I had no turkey, but I did have left over meatloaf, which had green bell peppers, onions, and the regular ingredients. It tasted like "WOW". I didn't add any salt, nor hot pepper ingredients, and served it with cornbread. It is delicious and a good way to use the black beans. Oh, I substituted 1 can of red kidney beans for one of the cans of black beans. I will use this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  This is a keeper!  I followed the recipe but also used more crushed tomatoes, 1 tsp. cumin, more turkey and some red pepper.  Soooo good!

I made this recipe with dried black beans (bulk beans are more economical for a student), added some water to rehydrate the beans, threw some frozen corn in for good measure, browed the turkey and drained the fat, and put it all in the slowcooker overnight.  It came out hearty, low fat, and not too spicy.  Great for a cold rainy day like today.

This chili was awesome!!  It reminded me of Wendy's chili, where it's not like a mush but more of a soup.  I did make some adjustments to make it that way.  I only added 2 cans of black bleans and I added 2 cans of tomatoes.  I didn't think one can had enough liquid.  But other than that, everything was kept the same.  It is a little salty for me, but I think I'll pair it with rice next time.  Mm, this was the perfect accompaniment to a cold night!

This chili was good, not great or special in any way.  I laughed when I read that you're supposed to "brown" the turkey.  Ground turkey, in my experience, doesn't brown and it didn't in this recipe either.  I liked the black beans insted of kidney beans and the spices were good but could have been a lot spicier.  I added an entire 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes because 14.5 oz wasn't nearly enough.  A good beginner chile recipe!

Very good. I used diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil, so I cut down on the basil and oregano. I used 2 TBL chili powder, 1 tsp cumin. Added red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and a pinch of sugar. Lastly used a can of mexican corn inplace of one of the cans of beans since dh doesn't care for beans much. The consistency was perfect not to thick not to runny. DH loved it also. Served with cornbread and topped with cheese and sour cream. Yummy!

This was a good chili recipe. I really liked the black beans! I did add one small can of corn and extra chili pwoder. I also had to add plain old salt and pepper after I had served it up. Next time I will add the salt and pepper while cooking it.

Love it! I used lots of extra spices - chili powder, cumin, garlic salt. Also followed others' advice and decreased black beans to two cans and added a can of corn and some diced green chiles. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is good, it lacks enough items.   I increased the tomatoes, and decreased a can of black beans and added a can of corn.     I also think adding 1/2 cup of barley would be good.

This chili is fantastic!  I increased the garlic cloves to 4 & the crushed tomatoes to 16 oz.  The chili had a rich hearty taste without being overpowering -  perfect for those who can't tolerate super spicy foods.    We had warm flour tortillas with humus on the side.  It was a filling meal, great for cold winter days.

This recipe was exceptionally tasty.  I added carrots, celery, and bell pepper... and it turned out wonderful.  Also, I only used two cans of black beans(that's all I had on hand)... and it was still great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was a bit skeptical of putting 3 cans of black beans in, sounded like a lot -- but it wasn't.  All I can say is OH-MY-GOSH... This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!!  I added a TBSP of RedHot for some kick, and the whole 28oz can of crushed tomatoes.  The best Chili I've ever had!!

This was really good. I only had 1 can of black beans on hand so I used that and a can of pinto beans as well. I also added some chicken broth to thin it out a little. After I browned the turkey I put everything in the crockpot on low and we enjoyed it that night. Thanks for a good recipe!

This is a great base, but a little bland as written. We added another tablespoon of chili power, apx a tsp of salt and maybe a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (plus I doubled the amount of fresh garlic in the beginning). I only had two cans of beans but otherwise made the recipe as written. It has a great texture and is much healthier than my usual burger/pork recipe. We'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

This chili was ok. Not my favorite recipe. I added 1 cup of chicken broth because otherwise it would have been way too thick. I also added 1 bay leaf, 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin powder, and one dried red chili to add more flavor.

This has been a family favorite since day one.  I kick up the heat a bit with 2 1/2 tbp chili powder, and a couple of dashes of hot red pepper sauce. I also add some coca powder (1tbs to keep it simple)for some balance and richness.  Great recipe and really healthly.

Wonderful chili! The red wine vinegar gives it a nice twist. My changes: only 1 can of black beans, 2 15.5-oz cans tomatoes, 1 14.5-oz can stewed tomatoes & some diced celery. Perfect.

I've made this several times and it's really good.  For those of you who don't care for ground turkey try adding the spices to the raw meat first and brown all together. It gives the meat a lot of flavor.

The turkey and black beans were definately a good base, however the spice mixture was bland and the recipe lacked sufficient liquid. I took the advice of several reviewers, adding tomato sauce, chicken broth, cumin, cayene pepper, and SALT. Thank you for the helpful suggestions.

I added, as did others, a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and a little cumin, and .... WOW! Great with shredded cheese on top and corn muffins along side.  Everyone in the family enjoyed, and my 10-year-old had it twice in one day!  Thanks for the "keeper"!

This will permanently replace my old kidney bean version with the packaged seasonings....it's far better. I served it with corn bread and a peach crisp for dessert and no one is complaining. I followed the recipe exactly except added 1 cup of chicken broth as it didn't seem like it would have enough liquid to simmer for 90 minutes on it's own. The seasonings were perfect for us with little kids and it was great with shredded cheddar on top!

I love this!! I have made it at least 3 times since I found this recipe. Even my husband, who is not a fan of ground turkey, likes it. The only thing I add to it is when I serve up a big bowl-ful I put a sprinkling of grated cheddar cheese on top ~ very yummy!

I found this recipe to be very bland. Guess I should have added some salsa.

I used the ground turkey with only 1% fat and it came out pretty good.  Definitely better the next day.  I added a few cloves of minced garlic and a dash of cumin.  Next time, I might switch up the beans.

I didn't feel this had enough beans in, so I added an extra can. Also added 1 extra can of tomatoes, 1 small can of chopped green chiles, 1 tsp cumin, and a generous sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Left out the vinegar. Served with cornbread and shredded cheese. This is a fabulous, fast, and easy meal. Froze half of it to use later.

My family absolutely loved this chili! I did not have any black beans on hand so I fixed a box of black beans and rice and added it to the rest of the ingredients. I prepared everything before I went to church and put it in my large crockpot. It was so nice to come home and smell the wonderful aroma! Thanks.

Yummy and easy, just the way I like it.  I made a few changes, I used a 28 oz can of diced tomato, a mix of white, pink, & black beans, I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp crushed red pepper, 2 chipotle peppers (seeded), and about 6-8 oz of beer.  The smoky chipotles & the beer really gave it a great flavor.  Plus it was a great way to use up some things that were sitting in my pantry.  This is a keeper!!

I used ground chicken and it went very well with the black beans.  I doubled up on the spices which was necessary.  Turkey and chicken are typically very bland without extra spices.

This is a hearty, flavorful chili! I'm not a fan of kidney beans, or greasy chili, so this is a perfect recipe. I like a little more burn, so I added more chili powder, but that was the only tinkering I did. It's quick and easy to put together, and goes great over rice topped with a sprinkle of cheese.

I found this recipe to be as fantastic as the name.  It is quick, easy, filling without stuffing and real comfort food for a cold day.   As other reviewers have stated the options for this recipe are endless.  I, also, served it with a honey cornbread that I made quickly and easily from a box mix.  This will be a regular and one that I send to friends.    Thank you for this recipe.  And many others I still have to try.   Karen

Really great! Big fan of black beans and always looking for new recipes.  We used cubed left-over turkey from Holiday dinner instead ogf the ground type. Tasted great and had more texture.  We used homemade tomatoe puree/juice to make more liquid. Also added more chili powder, brown rice and frozen corn to make it go farther. Served with cornbread and hot sauce. Excellent!

Loved this chili! So easy! I followed other recommendations and swapped one of the black beans for pinto beans and used a 28 ounce can of tomatoes. 

Turned out delicious!

This recipe turned out really well for us, I made a small variation from everyone else but ultimately used the other reviews to "doctor" up my dish! I didn't have any ground turkey on hand so in place I used 1 lb ground bison. Instead of red wine vinegar, I used 1/2 Tbls apple cider vinegar. Then from other recommendations: 10 oz can rotel tomatoes with green peppers, 14.5 oz can chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp cumin, 1 onion diced, 1 very large garlic clove, 1 1/2 Tbls oregano, 1 Tbls basil. I had made black beans on the stove the previous day so I used 1 3/4 cups from that in place of the canned beans. I did have to add 1 tsp of salt i'm not sure if this was because of the bison or what but it made it taste much better. I really wanted to add the corn but didn't have any on hand, I literally just used what was in the kitchen since we are on a tight budget and with that being said, this was a delicious "I have no idea what to make and we're broke" type of dinner. We topped it off with cheese, crackers/corn bread. Not to mention, healthy!

This was marvelous!  I instead made it a three bean chili with black, kidney and red beans. I had some breakfast sausage and added it to the pot too.  My whole family loves this topped with shredded colby jack cheese over brown rice.

I have made this recipe a few different times. It is a good basic recipe. My family prefers meat over beans (and I like beef over turkey), so I used 2lbs ground beef and only 1 can of black beans. I also used 28oz of crushed tomatoes as other reviewers have mentioned. I didn't add cumin because I didn't have it, although I believe it would be a good addition. I did add a few pinches of sea salt as it tastes a bit bland if you don't in my opinion. It has a good taste but is definitely not hot which is ok with me because the kids will eat it. My husband adds tobacco to his to add heat. I have made this when I was in a hurry and it is good but it definitely tastes better the longer you let it simmer. :) I would recommend giving it a try!

We really enjoyed this in my house. The crushed tomatoes made for a great flavor and consistency - previously I used diced varieties. I added peppers for a bit more spice.

What great recipe,I love that is fast and easy to make.I have little ones so a I used a packet of mild chili seasoning,I just added sriracha hot chili sauce to my servings lol.I also added red and green bell peppers,more garlic,cumin, a little sugar,and the vinegar is a must,it brings out the flavor in the beans which I only used 2 cans.I use vinegar whenever I make  black beans! I didn't have cornbread so I used Pillsbury Butter Flake Crescent Rolls,and omg was it delish..I'm happy I didn't have cornbread..please try them with the chili..it's delish!!!!Btw Yes YOU WILL NEED A 28OZ can of tomatoes!!!

Fantastic Black Bean Chili Haiku: "Shoulda read reviews, and added more tomatoes. Needed cumin too." I really, really try my best to stay faithful to a recipe as written, and the only thing I had to drop was one can of beans from this, but gosh, if I'd only read the seemingly-consistent call in reviews for more tomatoes or cumin, maybe we would've enjoyed this more. As it was, we needed quite a bit of cheese, hot sauce, and Fritos to get thru eating this at dinner, and the leftovers were sadly tossed.

My husband does not like chili. However, he ate two bowls and was asking if there was more. Also my daughter whom is so picky that about all she will eat is pizza and fried chicken. Loved this chili. It is definitely five star chili. This recipe is now the only one I will use. Thank you

This is a great recipe, my family loved it.  I used venison instead of turkey because I have way too much in my freezer.  It worked just fine.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe. Have been searching for weeks. Per the reviews, I used what I had and added rotel tomatoes and corn; used ground beef; cumin, crushed red pepper, 2,cans pinto and 1 can pink beans; white wine since I had no RWV.  I think it's a fabulous base recipe. Thank you for making my first chili experience a very tasty one! My 4 kids, husband, bad my very picky older sister had seconds and thirds. It sat overnight in fridge to infuse all flavors. Sieved with Fritos and cheese.

This is currently in my crockpot.  I did use ground chicken because I picked it up by mistake instead of turkey.  I browned it with the onion and garlic and then added everything to the crockpot.  Others suggested adding cumin and I like cumin so  that went in.  Set it on low and simmered for 3 hours.  Since the meat was cooked when it went in, I tasted it.  It needed a little doctoring for my taste.  A small can of tomato paste and a teaspoon of garlic salt took care of it.  (I used low sodium beans so it needed some salt.  Needed a little more garlic for me also.  That took care of it!)  That and a loaf of home made bread...dinner tonight!

Love this recipe! I am not a big bean fan, however I do like black beans. My husband loves this recipe too....we use ground goat meat. It's wonderful. Corn bread on the side and a little cheese on top. Great comfort food for this rainy wet weather we are having here on the east coast.

This is my new favorite black bean chili recipe. Everyone loved it and said that it was the best yet.  Also, it's really simple to make and requires very few basic ingredients.

I made two tweaks though; 1) I added 1 tsp of ground cumin. 2) I used dried beans instead of canned. I soaked them overnight and cooked them alone for  60 minutes.  I then drained them and continued with the original recipe.

First time making chili.  And this wasn't that bad - actually good. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would.

First, I didn't follow the recipe to the letter.  I added an extra 14.5 oz can of tomatoes (total 28 oz), I added a TBSP of Cumin, I added a BUNCH more chili pepper till I found the heat to a level I liked.  I think probably 2 TBSP of chili pepper.  Way to go here is cayenne pepper though.  Chili pepper doesn't have enough heat for me.  

I also minced up fresh garlic and sauteed that with the onion.  Then I added beef instead of turkey.  Finally, I added 2 packets of Goya Sazon seasoning.  

I like my chili a little more "brown" and meaty.  Not red and tangy.  This is plenty spicy and the tomatos are definitely in there but I think the meat and beans should be the stars with tomatoes a close 3rd.  

Lastly, I cooked this in a crock pot for about 6 hours.  And it was pretty good in my book.  Also - it tastes MUCH better the next day.  Pretty simple chili to cook in a crock pot.  Cut up some onion and garlic, brown that up with some meat, open a few cans, and let it cook in the crock pot while you are at work and you have a pretty good chili when you get home.

Mmmmm! This is a rich, flavorful, and hearty chili. I really liked the spices- I added a little cumin to the meat as some others suggested and it was just great. I used only two cans of beans and added some stewed tomatoes, which I would definitely recommend. Topped with sour cream and shredded cheese- thanks for the delicious, healthy dish that everyone loves!

I didn't have red wine vinegar, I used balsamic instead, also added cumin and coriander. The balsamic vinegar gave it a hearty smoky flavor!

Really liked this.  Way too much liquid though so next time I'll probably drain at least 1 can of the beans.  I also used Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of plain crushed tomatoes as that was what I had at the time.

Super easy and tastes great.  I did add cumin and extra shakes of the dried seasonings.  I also only used 2 cans of black beans and for us that was more than enough.  Will definitely make again!

I was looking for a quick and vegetarian lunch today, so I left out the turkey. I only had 2 cans of beans, and for the spices I just did 1/2 leveled tsp. of each and a few splashes of the red wine vinegar. Interesting combination and I enjoyed it. TY

This was a huge hit with the family. I used 3 cans of black beans and 2 cans of tomatoes to make it stretch a bit farther. Other than that followed exactly. It is definitely a new winter staple at our house.

I followed the recipe exactly. Not a repeat for me. All the tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic, and red wine vinegar made the taste too ...  sharp/bitter. After I added A LOT of cheese, I was able to salvage the dish and not toss it out, but I didn't enjoy it.  Definitely will not make again.

Great recipe.  I give it 4 stars because I made minor tweaks based on other suggestions by other reviewers and based on what I had (example: I used cider vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar).   One kid who doesn't like chili really enjoyed this chili and ate up all her chili and even had seconds.

This chili is excellent. I was asked to bring some kind of black bean dish as part of a Superbowl Sunday nacho bar. Everyone loved it. Since people were already bringing chicken and beef to the party, I substituted 1/2 pound of center cut bacon instead of the ground turkey. I bet it would be great with ground pork. Wonderful!

My new favorite chili recipe. I like spice so I doubled all the spices and added a few of my own, but very, very good chili.  Even better the next day. And dont forget to allow the whole time for simmering.

Great recipe! I also followed the above reviews and added a larger can of tomatoes. A really great base to create any sort of chili you would like. Will be making this one again for sure! Also very healthy with all those beans!! Thanks. :)

Very good chili recipe and a nice way to switch it up. If you cook as the recipe suggests then it will be VERY beany, if you add more crushed tomato then it will lessen the bean taste.

I added in cumin and cinnamon. I also cooked 2 lbs of turkey.... LOVED it! Great and easy recipe.

I won my work chili cookoff with this recipe. I use Rotel, mild, unless you like it unbearable, use all Hot. I also increased the tomatoes, 4 total cans of Rotel, 3 mild, 1 hot. I cook in a slow cooker on high for 3-4 hours.

I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe as written as I didn't have some of the ingredients. I sauted onions and garlic and then added 2 cans of black beans (I thought 3 would be too much), I then added about 1 1/2 cups of homeade pasta sauce and leftover ground beef from the night before along w/ basil,oregano,chili powder and salt. It was very yummy, my picky 4yo said it was the best chili she has ever had!

Aha! When I was making this I thought it needed more tomatoes so I added a second can. Then I read the reviews and it seems that others felt the same way. Instead of simmering it on the stove I put this in the crock pot for a few hours. Awesome!

This is a savory & delicious chili (not spicy).  I've been making this for years and it's always a hit.  I use only 2 cans of black beans and double the amount of crushed tomatoes to 28 oz.

Very good.  I used ground beef instead of ground turkey and added can of green chili peppers.  That gave it a little heat.

I made this chili because I had all the ingredients I needed to make this & we had a HUGE snow storm & I felt like some nice warm chili would hit the spot!! I sauteed extra garlic in with the onions & added 2 cans of tomatoes, as well as only 2 cans of black beans cause that was all I had. I added red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, salt & pepper as well. Because others mentioned it didn't have much of a spicy kick to it. Then I threw it all in the crock pot on low for 4 hours. It was good & had lots of flavor, but I think I prefer my usual chili recipe. I like more of a thick tomato based chili with the tomato sauce, tomato paste & tomato puree. Still was a nice change though & it was good! I just prefer a thicker more tomatoey chili.

This was one of the best chili recipes we've had yet, and I've been through many!  I used lean ground beef instead of turkey, and it still came out delicious.  Thank you!

Great filling, hearty, healthy and simple recipe. I didn't have turkey on hand so I used ground beef which worked great. I think I am going to try this next time with tofu.

Delicious, easy chili recipe. Turkey burger isn't quite the same as beef, but with a little more seasoning, I was happy to eat on the healthier side. I added cheese and a couple of jalapenos to my bowl to make it more zesty (I love spicy food). I will definitely make this again soon. :)

The best turkey chili by far that I have ever made at the firehouse. The crew loved it and it was so easy to make. I usually do not change ingredients on any recipe, but with this one I did double the tomatoes and added 1tsp. of Cumin. I made these changes after reading several other reviews.

Loved this one too! I did use a lb. of extra lean ground chicken since thats what I had on hand. Reduced to 2 cans of black beans drained and rinsed. Also added a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a 14 oz. can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. Also added some cumin and more chili powder. Very good and tasty. Served with multi-grain tortilla chips for scooping. Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and used half turkey and half italian sausage (mild or hot).  I also like a slightly sweet chili, so I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  Great base chili recipe!

Was pretty good starting point for a black bean chili. It was bland for us the way it is written but as others suggested I added more spice to our preference. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!!  I made a few changes, based on what I had in the fridge and cupboards.  I added 2 stalks of diced celery, rotel tomatoes, and 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce.  I did this because instead of using 3 cans of beans with the liquid, I used 4 cups of cooked dried beans and I didn't reserve any liquid.  I also added a can of corn (drained), 2 tbs cumin, and some red pepper for heat.  Fantasic recipe that is easy and fun to play with!!  Thanks!!

I was missing some ingredients, so instead of three cans of black beans, I added one can of black beans and two cans of chili beans.  I also did not have ground turkey, so I used ground elk.  My husband and two people working at our home loved the chili and asked for seconds.

This was fantastic, as stated!  I cut back on the chili powder b/c my kids can't tolerate the spice and I used 1 less can of black beans and a larger can of crushed tomatoes...added a pinch of cumin as suggested by others and it was so good!!!

I love this chili recipe; it has become one of my favorites.  My only modification is use 2 cans of black beans, instead of 3.  Otherwise, it's perfect.  It's really great with avocado slices and a little sour cream.  A really healthy recipe!  Thank you Rebecca.

I thought it had a good flavor. I used a large can of crushed tomatoes, only had 1 can of black beans, added kidney beans, corn, can of green chilis, 1tsp cumin, red pepper flakes and served over brown rice.  I added a little tobasco to my bowl as well as chedder cheese.

Initially I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  Then after cooking  and tasting I went back and read some of the reviews, adding cumin and Tabasco Chipotle sauce as others have recommended.  Next time I'll also double the crushed tomatoes.

I thank previous reviewers for the tip about the tomatoes. I used a large can. Other than that I made the recipe as listed. Served over brown rice and topped with sour cream and cheese....it was delicious!

This is a great chili recipe! I followed the suggestions of other users as well (28 oun. crushed tomatoes and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin). I also added a can of rotel. It needed a little salt in my opinion, so I threw in about 1 teaspoon. We loved it!

Four stars because as written, it would be pretty good.  As others have mentioned, this needs some extra spices to be delicious.    I doubled the recipe and added a jalepeno.  Instead of using all black beans, I used two cans of black beans, two cans of kidney beans (this is chili, after all), and two cans of pinto beans.  I used two of the giant (28 oz?) cans of crushed tomatoes.  I then added more vinegar, cayenne (2 tbsp), cumin (1 tbsp), and crushed red pepper (~1 tbsp).  Other people have said that they used 1.5 lbs of turkey for the original recipe, which would have been too much for me.  2 lbs for a double recipe was perfect.

First of all, i always make my chili with ground turkey so when i saw this recipe i knew i had to try it. It is a great recipe and can easily be modified to suit one's taste. i omitted the red wine vinegar and basil. i added worchestershire  sauce, a little tabasco, cumin and used a can of dieced tomatoes with chilies. i cooked my turkey in about a 1/2c of chicken broth. i also added corn. we garnished our chili with colby/jack cheese, avocado slices and a dollop of sour cream. next time i think topping with a little fresh cilantro would be good too. thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

I followed the recipe exactly.. it was obviously very easy to make...the results were tasty but definitely not delicious. The level of spice was pretty good but probably not enough for people who really like heat. Overall, it lacked the "god that hits the spot" or "wow" factor.. and my family and I usually love all forms of chili so this was a bit of a disappointment.

I've used this recipe twice as a base for my homemade chili, and my chili came out beautifully both times. I love how easy this recipe is to adapt to what I have on hand and/or to the tastes of those I am cooking it for.   I do everything the same, except I usually don't have turkey or ground beef on hand, so I've had to omit the ground turkey. I'm sure it would have been all the better if I was able to add this.  I add about 1/2 tablespoon of cumin just because it doesn't seem like chili unless there's a hint of cumin in it. I also add about 1/2 tablespoon of Cayenne Pepper to give it that spicy kick.   For those who like a little bit of extra tomato flavor, go with what has been suggested by others and add another can of tomatoes or you can also try a half cup of regular salsa.  ...and this chili tastes even better on the second day! I will definitely be using this recipe as a base for my chili from now on. Thank you for this great recipe! :)

We love this recipe more than the Boilermaker chili recipe that's so famous on this site!  This one is much simpler, which I love.  I added a can of corn and I used stewed tomatoes, sliced, as that was what I had on hand.  I added more tomato and cumin, thanks to other reviewers.  Topped off with some sourcream, shredded mexican cheese and crackers on the side.  Great!

Standing Ovation!  When you are tired of being too healthy, I use 50% each of beef and pork cubes.  I also use Italian flavored tomatoes, cumin, and an extra 1/2 to 1 T of chili powder.  I cut back on the oregano since it is in the tomatoes.  I simmer in an open pan to reduce to liquid, and let it sit for an additional hour before serving.  YUM!

Great, easy chili. I use ground beef, one can diced/peeled tomatoes, and also add a second can of diced/peeled tomatoes with green chiles. To make it thicker, I smash up the beans in one of the cans of black beans before adding it to the pot. I skip the vinegar, too.

Very tasty!  Used only 2 cans of beans and it was still a lot of food.  Added 1 oz. of shredded low fat cheddar and 2TBSP of non-fat sourcream to each serving - delicious!

This was good! It definately needed the can of corn (which I added) for color, I had a can of tomato paste so I added that in too. I also put in a tablespoon of red pepper flakes. That was a bit much, I'll try a teaspoon next time.

Everyone enjoyed this meal.  I will make it again.  I gave it a 4 because I made several changes to it.  The changes were as follows: (1) used chicken breast instead of turkey or beef; (2) added cumin, chicken broth, can of diced tomatoes and green chilies; and (3) omitted vinegar.  Served it with cornbread and topped it with cheese and sour cream.

This recipe was a bit bland, like the other reviews it needed a bit of something. I added salt, cumin and some salsa I had in the frig. After that I thought it was pretty darn good. I use turkey in my chili anyways so that was no biggie, I also dont cook too spicey because I have 4 kids. So this was a really workable recipe for my house. Love it!

This was REALLY bland. I assumed by the other reviews that it would need some work, but by the time it was all said and done, I worked it into an entirely new recipe! I did like the black beans and the use of turkey instead of beef, but I won't be using this recipe again.

I thought it was just like the name, fantastic!  One could also make it more spicy if you wanted, but it was really good as is.  I did add more of the crushed tomatoes, since all I had was a 28 oz. can and knew I wouldn't use it with anything else.  I also added some cumin, like others...I just can't have chili without cumin.  We served it with tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream. Yum!

I thought it needed some salt; so I added a bit when the meat was browning and a little when I added the other spices.  

It was a great chili recipe.  Loved it!!

I love this recipe.  I used the cheapest ingredients, the whole pot cost me about $5 to make(not counting the spices and vinegar which I had on hand) and it tasted delicious.  Low cost, low fat, high protein and delicious.  Can't beat that.

I love this chili! I don't like kidney beans at all, so black beans are a welcome change. It's also lighter made with turkey. I find this recipe to be incredibly easy to make, high in protein and lower in fat for when we are watching what we eat, and a good choice when I have no idea what to make for dinner. Serve it up with some sour cream and cheddar! Excellent!

I have made this (along with several variations) dozens of times, and it has always been a success. I also like to add extra types of beans,and sometimes more heat, but the vinegar is the key to this recipe. Thanks!

This recipe improves mightily with additions. On it's own, I found it was too sweet, too much oregano and too much tomato taste. It was bland and very disappointing, given it's reviews.

Reviewers, please rate the recipe as written. Reviewing your own mods confuses the heck out of it.

My (vegetarian) mods:
+ 1 tbsp cumin
  1 tsp salt
  1 pinch chili flakes
sub veggie crumbles for ground turkey

loved it. changes: i used 28 oz. of crushed tomatoes, a small can of sweet corn, a shake or two of cumin, and doubled the chili powder. i subbed kidney beans for one of the cans of black beans (just for variety). this made probably 7 or 8 large servings.

I made this strictly for my boyfriend because I am not a chili eater, or at least, I wasn't until I tried this.  I hate the way black beans look, so I only used 1 can and 2 cans red beans.  I went with the other reviews and used 28 oz. of the crushed tomatoes and added a little extra garlic and some red pepper flakes.  It was amazing!  My boyfriend loved it and he knows his chili!  I was even tempted to try it and to my surprise, it was quite good with some saltines mixed in.  Not too spicy, but had just enough kick.  I found the flavors mixed well together after cooking for 4-5 hours.  Very good recipe that I'll use again!

This was terrific, I followed it for the most part but this is how I made it my own.  I took it to a chili luncheon at work and it went over better than ever.

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 pound ground turkey
3 (15 ounce) cans black beans, undrained
2 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 can of Rotel
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano
1 1/2 tablespoon dried basil leaves
1 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
Red Pepper flakes to taste
Cayenne Pepper to taste
Salt and Pepper to Taste
3/4 large can of tomato juice
Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat; cook onion and garlic until onions are translucent. Add turkey and cook, stirring, until meat is brown. 
In a crockpot, pour in turkey, onion, and garlic, and stir in the remaining ingredients cook on high about 1 1/2 hours.

i wanted this to be good so bad, and thought it would as per all the reviews. but as soon as i started making it, the mounts of oregano AND basil concerned me. But i figured, everyone else liked it so stay true to the recipe. Mistake. Instead of a southwest-esque flavor, it tasted like italian food. Those two spices combined with the tomatoes made it taste like something italian. it was so weird b/c it looked like black bean chili but tasted like marina sauce! I definitely recommend cutting down those two spices!

My husband raved about this chili.  I took the advice of others (something I love about this site) and doubled the amount of tomatoes in the recipe and added about 2 tsp. of beautiful cumin.  We like everything really spicy, so one can of tomatoes that I used had green chilies in it.  I also doubled the garlic and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  This recipe is a keeper and is so easy to spice up or down.  Wonderful, thank you.

This is a recipe doesn't compromise taste for health concerns, which makes it a true 5 star in my book.  I had bought a package of 99% fat free ground turkey, which my BF just absolutely loathes.  He thinks the 1% fat stuff tastes like cardboard, so I decided to make this chili to disguise the dryness of the turkey.  To add a little fat, I added a few strips cooked diced bacon and I sauteed the onion in 1 T of the drippings.  I added a can of jalapenos, some tomato paste, worcestershire sauce 1 T cumin, paprika, cayenne and 2 bay leaves.  I increased the chili powder to 2T, oregano to 2 T, basil to 2 T, garlic to 4 cloves,and vinegar to 2 T.

This is the first recipe that I have not liked at all from this site.  I took others advise and doubled tomatoes, added cumin, extra garlic, salt, and pepper.  Still turned out way too bland.  I was actually surprised at how little flavor this had.

I really liked this, as many said much better the next day.  Freezes well.  I froze several 1 cup containers for lunches to wrap in a tortilla or added rice...very good.  *Update*  Made it again, this time added 1 extra can of tomatoes, some cumin & a small can of diced jalapeno's.

I would give this 5 stars because it was so easy and good and nutritious- but I have to take a star away for the gas factor! OMG!! You better eat this when you won't be having company or don't have to go to work the next day. But really, it was very good. :-)

Fantastic! Like other reviewers had suggested, I added a 28oz can of tomatoes, cumin, and a small can of green chilis.  I also cut back on the oregano a bit and added a chipotle pepper with adobo sauce, an extra can of diced tomatoes, extra garlic and I used red onion and olive oil instead of veg oil.  I forgot to add the vinegar.  My husband and I both loved it and had it again for lunch today.  Will make this again and again.  I served it with sour cream, shredded cheese and crackers. YUM!

This was good.  I used ground turkey meat.  I sauteed the garlic in some olive oil then added the turkey meat.  I left out the onions as I can't eat them and we never miss them.  Used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce since i didn't have the large crushed tomato can.  Put everything into a crock pot on low for 4.5 hours and it was great.  Next time I might try adding a few more beans, maybe a drained can of white beans and a drained can of corn (drained because there was plenty of liquid already).  I think the corn would add to it.  Served with a sweet corn cake, tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and soup crackers.  I'll do this again and get more creative!

Mmmmmm! I love chili and this one is so simple and easy.  I just diced in some bell pepper to the onions/garlic and added a tiny drop of liquid smoke and a droplet of worestershire sauce. Perfect.

This was a nice basic recipe.  It was too meaty for me though.  I started off following the recipe exactly but ended up changing some things while it was simmering.  I added an extra can of kidney beans, corn, red chili flakes, diced jalapenos, and twice the amount of chili powder.  Next time I'll just cut the meat in half and add extra black beans.

This was OK.  I'm not sure why it didn't turn out as good as all the other reviews said it was.  It just tasted like black beans.  If I try this again, I would probably only add 1 or 2 cans of black beans and try a little different seasonings.

Great(and easy) recipe! I used ground beef because we didin't have turkey and browned it in a skillet with the onions. Poured everything into the crockpot mixed and let cook on low for about 4 hours. YUMMY!! My family couldn't get enough. I will definately be making this one again, thanks!

We thought this was pretty good but lacked spiciness.  I would add more chile powder and some cayenne pepper if I made this again.  I really liked the black beans in it, though.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce to this because it seemed pretty thick.

If this had been named "Black Bean Turkey Soup" I may have liked it more.  It was very bland and didn't taste like chili to us at all!  Not an awful recipe, and certainly healthy, but I'm not sure it's a keeper.

Outstanding!!  This is so easy to make, and so tasty it's hard to believe that it's diet-friendly.  I was skeptical about adding the vinegar at first, but it really makes all the difference.  I actually used balsamic because that's what I had available and it worked out great.  This has become such a staple at our house that I automatically double the recipe.

This was very good and had great flavor.  I did have to add about 1/4 cup water and a 6 oz. can of no-salt tomato paste to get it to a chili-like consistency.  It was perfect after that.  I browned the turkey with onions and garlic and added everything to the crockpot and let it cook all day.  Served with sour cream and tortilla chips, and a green salad.

This was so good! I used Morningstar Farms Griller's Crumbles instead of the ground turkey. This was wonderful with a big, thick piece of cornbread!

Wow!  This was excellent and easy. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party and added two chipotle peppers. It gave it a wonderful smoky flavor with some extra heat. Sour cream is great on the top. Served it with baked potatoes and salad. Yummy.

This recipe really is fantastic. I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I also put one extra can of tomatoes just because I like allot of tomatoes. I sauteed the onions and garlic, then the turkey and added everything to the crock pot. I cooked it on low about 5 hours. Before serving I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and also a dollop of sour cream.

This was the first chili I ever made and it was fantastic! I added three diced jalepeno peppers and since I was low on chili powder I added a few tablespoons of Tabasco Sauce. It was a good level of spiciness. I plan on making it again very soon!

This was great!  Super easy and I won 1st place in my work chili contest!  I did what most other reviewers did which was substitute olive oil for vegetable, one whole can of tomatoes and one less of beans.  I also added corn and cumin which weren't in the recipe.  I made mine the night before and let it simmer in the crock pot all night.  The kids liked it, the husband and friends liked it and like I said, I won 1st place at work.  Most people commented that it was very mild so if you like spice I would add a jalapeno or two.

I took MSDORKY's advice and cooked this in a crock pot (after sauteing garlic and onions and browning the beef in a skillet) on low for 4 hours.  I got a lot of compliments on it.  I ended up changing the ratios a bit once I realized it wouldn't all fit in my 4 Qt. crock pot!  Also, I forgot to add the chili powder, and it was just fine.  I like more heat in my chili, but for a party this was just right.  Guests could spice it up if they wanted.

Not everybody has the same taste buds, so  I had to mess around with the seasoning...I also added twice as many tomatoes. But it seems that no matter what I add or don't add...this recipe comes out yummy! And it's some of the fastest chili to make. Just love it with Jiffy Corn Muffins and cheddar cheese.

It was yummy but I only gave 4 stars because I had to doctor it up a lot to get a good flavor. I ended up adding more canned tomatoes and tomato sauce and lots more spice/seasoning.  (I have also made it and added tomato paste.) I like to add a touch of honey too- to balance it out.  I felt like it was just a pot of beans and things, whereas my husband and I think of a chili as being thicker.  After some doctoring, this was good and I liked the idea of adding black beans to my chili.  I think I'll use the idea again. We served it over elbow macaroni pasta.

when i started to make this recipe just as it says, there was not enough to feed a family of four or even three. and it was way to thick. i added 1 regular can of hunts tomato sauce and 1 can of chicken broth to thin it out. added a little more of the seasonings and some salt. it turned out very good.

We really liked this one.  It simmered for about an hour and thickened up nicely.  Per other reviewers I added more spices: cumin, red pepper flakes, 2 chopped chipotle peppers in adobo; used a large can of tomatoes; meant to use 2 cans of black beans, but only had 1 (it was fine); added a cup of frozen corn at the end.

Excellent!  I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand so I sort of cleaned out my cupboard and used one can each of northern, black & kindey beans.  Also added green chilis and used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and it was still very thick.  Also I added a can of corn!  Thanks for sharing!!

I added pinto beans and made a small portion without turkey for my mother who is a vegetarian.  I cooked it in a crock-pot for 4 hours and it was perfect.  My dad didn't even add any spices, he always adds salt and pepper to everything, but the seasoning was perfect!  I will be making this dinner often :-)

This was great!  I left out the onion and i added a 1/2 cup or so of lentils.  Also used beef instead of turkey since that was all i had.  I sprinkled the bowls with some cheese before serving.  Will definitely be making this again!

Very good quick recipe but lacks the rich flavour of beef chili. 
I removed the turkey meat and added:
1 tablespoon of Smoked Paprika
1 teaspoon cumin
2 cans tomato
4 tablespoon tomato paste
lots of olive oil
blend before serving so that 1/3 of beans remain.
Serve on rice drissled with yoghurt.
Be amazed when people can't beleive it doesn't contain meat.

This was ok, but it needed more flavor. To give ground turkey flavor, you have to really overspice it. Maybe if you double the spices with the turkey or use ground beef. I put a dollop of sour cream in my bowl, which gave it a nice unique flavor.

I made this recipe as written the first time and it was good, but not spicy enough. The next time I made it I more than doubled the garlic, added a can of Rotel, 1/2 of a jalepeno chile, 1/4t cayenne pepper, 1/2 Tablespoon cumin, and followed other reviewers' suggestion of the 28oz can of crushed tomato (I've also substituted 3  8oz tomato sauce cans when that's all I had on hand, and the results were still really good). Sometimes I also use 1 can red kidney beans and 2 cans of black beans to make it more colorful. I've made the recipe a few times on the stovetop and a few times in the crockpot. I like it made in the crockpot better because the flavors meld more and I don't have to be in the kitchen. I highly recommend this recipe.

I love black beans and turkey and love experimenting with new chili recipes, b but I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. It was okay, but a little bland.

This was fabulous!  I don't like the beans in regular chili.  Both my husband and I loved this!  I used extra tomatoes (1 can diced and 1 can italian seasoned stewed tomatoes, cut up), reduced to 2 cans black beans, added one can corn, reduced basil and oregano to 1 tsp each, omitted the vinegar, added extra chili seasoning and salt and pepper.  Will make again and again!

I made this recipe using a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes and two 19 ounce cans of black beans. Ten minutes before it was done cooking, I add a thawed box of spinach(did not squeeze it) and a package of Old El Paso chili mix. Great!

Excellent recipe!  I was looking around for a black bean soup recipe to make with a bag of black beans I found in the pantry.  I found this recipe and had everything on hand except the ground turkey, for which I substituted ground beef.  We are big chili fans, but there is something very special about this recipe.  It has a very rich flavor and is extremely filling.  It was excellent on the first day and even more awesome as leftover. I just finished the last of it for lunch.  We will definetely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My husband raved about this and he LOVES black beans.  I liked it, but didn't go back for seconds.  I made it more for him though and he loved it.  I give it a 4 only because I have to go on my tastes.

Yummy...everyone I make this for always asks for the recipe. I use two cans of tomatoes that are spiced with basil and oregano. It also is great to serve with sour cream and cheese.

This one is really good if you are doing the low fat diet thing, as you can use the extra lean ground turkey breast.  I find I have to pretty much double the amount of chili power though.  A bit of cayenne pepper does not hurt things either if you like things with some heat.

This was okay.  I was expecting something more considering the reviews.  It basically tastes like chili but without that hearty beef taste (which I happen to like - I usually even add beef bouillon to my chili).  Worth a try, especially if you want something lower in fat and calories than traditional chili.  Also, it needs a bit of heat!  The new Chipotle Tabasco worked wonders.

Great healthy chili recipe!  I thought it could have used a bit more kick (maybe a jalapeno or some more chili powder) but husband said it was the best chili he's ever had, so 5 stars :)  I used 2 cans black beans and one can kidney beans, and used diced instead of crushed tomatoes (what I had on hand).  Turned out great, and makes a ton!

This recipe is really fantastic. I used ground chicken because it is moister than ground turkey. I added diced jalepenos for a little more heat- and i threw in some corn for color. My husband absolutely loved this. We both don't like regular chili very much (I don't like kidney beans, he doesn't like beef)- but we both decided this would be a regular item in our household. It is healthy and delicious!

This was EASY and AWESOME!  I ended up using 3 14oz cans of diced tomatoes, 2 tsp of cumin, chopped up pickled japapeno (even dumped some of the vinegar in) and used lean ground beef (it's what I had on hand).  Don't think I'll ever go back to "regular" beans.  It's black beans from now on!

For some reason, chilis made with ground turkey don't satisfy my taste as well as those made with ground beef.  I used olive oil to brown the onions and garlic.  I added a generous sprinkle of crushed red pepper and 1 Tbsp of cumin.  I changed the black bean quantity to 1 28-oz can and the crushed tomato quantity to 1 28-oz. can.  I even added an 11-oz can of corn (drained).  My family liked this chili, but it isn't something that I'd go out of my way to make again.  I served it on hot rice as I do with all my chili recipes.  It is an easy recipe to make, so it'd be good in a pinch.  The ingredients are those that I usually have on hand.

This turned out great!  The only change I made was that I used a can of Rotel (with diced chiles) in place of the crushed tomatoes.  Next time I will follow other reviewers advice and put some different beans in too.

This is a most delicious & easy recipe, and to tailor it to the tastes of my husband and myself, I added several cloves of garlic & a can of diced tomatoes with green chili.  I have made it in a large pan & I have made a very large batch, simmering it in a roasting oven.  Thank you..this is great!

This is very good. I added 2 teaspoons cumin and used chopped tomatoes with green jalapeno chilies. I cooked it for 4 hours in the crockpot. I already had a favorite chili recipe, but this is different enough that I will make it, also.

Really excellent chili.  I didn't change much.  I used tomatoes with jalapenos, but other than that, I stuck pretty much to the recipe. My husband appreciated that it wasn't too spicy and I just spiced my own up with hot pepper sauce and salsa.  I served it along with the Excellent and Healthy Cornbread recipe from this site.  A really great low fat and low calorie dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent. I was tentative about ground turkey in chili, but it was sooo good! I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I added some ground black pepper and used spicy chili powder to give it a little more zing. Served it over rice and my husband ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The whole batch was gone in less than 24 hours!

Delicious and super easy to make! My husband, friends, and even my 10-year old niece loved it! I used a chili seasoning packet instead of the other seasonings and it still turned out great. The red-wine vinegar gives it a nice flavor. I will definitely use this recipe to replace my old chili recipe!

This was good but unfortunately I had to leave out the ground turkey.  I didn't realize it had gone bad and had to throw it out at the last minute...so I made a vegetarian version, which was tasty.  To make up for the missing turkey, I added a can of drained corn and a can of chopped green chilies.  I topped it with shredded pepper jack cheese and sliced banana peppers.  Yum and Thanks.

I first adjusted recipe to 9 servings (for Superbowl party tomorrow), and modified recipe as follows:  2 large onions, 5 cloves garlic, 1.25 lb gr. turkey, 1.45 lb gr. beef, 2 cans black beans, 1 can dark & 1 can light kidney beans, all undrained, two 28oz cans tomatoes (torn into chunks), 2 green & 2 red bell peppers, 3.5 Tb chili powder, 3 tsp cumin, 1 Tb oregano, 1.5 Tb basil, 1 tsp cayenne, 4 Tb red wine vinegar; simmered covered about 45 min, then uncovered to reduce liquid another 45 min. Make awesome chili and so easy too!!

OK - I didn't follow the instructions perfectly so this may not be fair.  I used soaked black beans rather than canned and there wasn't enough liquid so it burned.  Turkey doesn't have fat to prevent sticking and I am not used to that.  Nice flavour though.

I was not  crazy about this recipe.  It just seemed like just too much black beans and turkey.  I guess I like more "stuff" in my chili.

My husband gave this recipe an A+.  It was great to find a chili recipe made with ground turkey.  As someone who does not like very spicy foods it is a great alternative from traditional chili.  We will be enjoying this recipe a lot this winter!  I would definitely make it for company too.

"fantastic" is right! several people asked for the recipe. I made this and a traditional chili and this was gone first. Its a very unusual chili in that it has the black beans, making it very unique. Yum!

Delicious and SO easy!  Subbed a can of kidney beans for 1 can of balck beans as only had 2 cans black beans on hand; also replaced red wine vinegar with red wine as (again) that's what was on hand.  Pretty sure would adapt well to slow cooker as with most chili recipes.  Thanks Rebecca!

This was pretty bland and I had to add a lot of spices to it. I think that the texture of the black beans is what my family really didn't like about this recipe. Sorry, but this one is not a keeper.

I doubled the recipe and added one each diced red and green bell peppers. After adding one teaspoon each of cumin, cayenne and hot red pepper flakes, I had a real crowd pleaser.

I mixed kidney beans with the black beans and threw in a small can of corn because I didn't have enough black beans. I spiced it up with some cayenne and red pepper. It is easy to prepare and especially delicious as left-overs!

This recipe was easy to make.  I was a little nervous about using ground turkey, but it tasted just like ground beef -- couldn't tell the difference.  I added a green pepper, 2 t of cumin and 1 1/2 T of chili powder to spice it up some.

I have made this for years and stubbornly refuse any other recipe for chili!  I make 2  changes of late.  As others have suggested,  I take out the tomatoes and put in its place a 28 oz can of ground tomatoes.  The other thing I do is after browning the turkey and onions and garlic, all of the ingredients go into my slow cooker on low for 4 to 6 hrs. And I use a liner, so no cleanup! The flavors seem to meld better.

This was super easy to make and I agree with the suggestions of adding the additional crushed tomatoes and Cumin.  I make this is large batches since it freezes well. I’m giving it 4 stars only because I felt the need to add additional ingredients.  Overall a really good chili.

Great base recipe, but I did follow the advice of cutting some of the beans and upping the tomato puree. Needs spices! I halved the recipe and still used 1 more tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of salt and one full diced chipotle pepper. Gave it a great smoky under taste.  I dumped everything in the slow cooker to give it time to mellow.

I found this recipe a few years ago and have been making it at least 2x per month fall and winter, with no one getting tired of it!  My husband watches carbs so I only use one can of black beans per pound of turkey but pretty much follow the recipe as is.  Fantastic is a fair description.

I made this added all the extra everyone else has mentioned already. I topped it with shredded cheese, green onion, fresh cilantro and sour cream for garnish. It was absolutely delicious! This one's a keeper...Apologies for the triple photo...My phone's a jerk.

Did it in the slow cooker but needed to add beef broth for liquid (because I always rinse my black beans — I don’t like the smell).  Regardless it was a hit served with cheddar cheese and Tostitos scoops.

I love this recipe, I've been making it for years now! I usually use a mix of black beans and pinto beans, occasionally add corn, and always add extra chili powder, chipotle or cayenne pepper, and cumin. I like it spicy! Sometimes I'll swap out the red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar. Serve with shredded cheese and sour cream, it's so delicious.

My husband and I enjoyed this chili. For my part, I would make it again but add some crushed red pepper to add some spice, a bit of salt and pepper and maybe can of water because my liquid cooked down too much during the 1 hour cooking time.

I've made this a few times now and love it.  It is hearty, affordable and tastes great.  Best of all it only takes a few minutes to put together.  I double the recipe because it doesn't last the night at my house and everyone wants more. Excellent recipe, thanks!

I made the recipe as it is written.  It was lacking in flavor.  I'd recommend increasing the chili powder, oregano and basil.  Maybe use ground beef or bison next time.

Used Hamburg in place of turkey and added cumen and a bit of chipotle powder for zip along with the other listed spices  Used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes .. I thought 1 can was perfect tho most seem to add another can.  My husband is not a big tomato person and he liked it a lot and probably wouldn't have  with more tomatoes  --thanks for a great recipe

Had to add a chopped zucchini (veggie nut) thus drained and rinsed one of the cans of beans to cut back on liquid. Added near the end about a cup of tomato sauce for flavor. Was very good.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I changed was switching out one can of beans with a cup and a half of thawed corn. Ooh and I added a diced jalapeno, but i like it hot.

The spice combination with red wine vinegar make this the best chili recipe I have ever made!  I make  it with regular red beans too and it's just as delicious.

I've made this dish so many times I can't even remember.  It's yummy, healthy and easy.  I keep a pound of turkey in the  freezer and I always have canned tomatoes and black beans at home...it's a go-to for my family, unexpected dinner guest, and a cold evening.

On the advice of others I made the following adjustments:  1 1/2 lbs. ground turkey, 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes, 14 oz can corn, (2) 14oz cans black beans & (1) 14oz can pinto bean (all drained), and added about 1 1/2 tsp. cumin along with spices.  It was a little thick for my taste so I added (1) 14oz can of diced tomatoes toward the end of simmering time and gave it an extra 10-15 minutes.  To add more zip I finely diced 1/2 a jalapeño and tossed that in when browning the meat.  I will definitely make again but perhaps use (2) 14 oz cans diced and (1) 14 oz crushed, I like the tomatoes more chunky.  My 11 year old son thought the flavor was great but suggested serving with rice to add more texture (we had it with chips for dipping/scooping).  I thought it still needed a bit more zip so I put some homemade "zesty salsa" in my bowl.  Overall a good, savory dish and it was a great new recipe, thanks Rebecca and reviewers!  ps.  I added about a Tbsp. dry Epazote to reduce the effects of the beans.

Good recipe.  I prefer my chili less thick with more tomato sauce so I add another can or 2 of crushed tomatoes.  We also use ground venison when we have it.  Other than that it’s fine, not too spicy. Thank you for posting.

I have made this chili dozens of times over the last several years - enough that I no longer need to look at the recipe (for me that's quite an accomplishment). I sometimes vary the type of beans or meat used depending on what I have on hand, but overall I follow the recipe as written and it turns out perfectly every time. I serve with cornbread, sour cream, and shredded cheddar. Always a hit!

This  chilli recipe was fantastic! So delicious. My family loved it.
I used ground beef only because that’s what I had.  Next time I’ll try ground turkey. I used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes like the other reviewers suggested. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cumin and some fresh ground pepper.  I also added chopped green pepper and one chopped poblano pepper.  I added a little water about 1/2 way through cooking just to thin out the sauce a bit, since it seemed too  thick and I like chilli a little saucy.  I served it with shredded cheddar and sour cream. It was easy and delicious!
I would definitely recommend and I will be making this again.

I didn't make any changes.  The only change I would make next time would be to rinse the black beans before adding to the meat.  Other than that, it was very good.

I make this recipe every two weeks so I can stock up for the week. It's the best! They say use black beans undrained, but I noticed it took a really long time to thicken (over an hour and a half). Instead, I started adding only half the juice from the black beans to make it not so runny. I finish it with sour cream, shredded cheddar and a dash of sea salt infused with ghost pepper to give it a kick. Amazing!

I was excited for this recipe,  because the spices were so different for chili... My kids ate it smothered in cheese, but my fiance and I really did not like it at all. It was like some weird Italian saucey chili...just strange spice combo.

I made this for dinner because the ingredients I had on hand. However, this was better than any chili "kit" I have ever bought at the store. I read other reviews and added a tbsp of cumin. Other than that, two cans of tomatoes and the chili came together perfectly. Everyone loved it, including my wife who is very picky about chili. I will definitely add this to the grocery list from now on.

Loved this recipe - easier and better tasting than my old recipe. I used 2 cans of beans and 2 cans of tomatoes. Also added a bit of worchestershire to the turkey as it was browning. I used Balsamic vinegar as that's what I had on hand. I got rave reviews and took second place in a chili cook off (should have been first)! This will be my new recipe!

My husband said it was my best chili yet!  Super easy and pretty much had all ingredients on hand. I also added 1T cumin as others suggested. It made a lot!  Next time I'll either half it or freeze some.

Loved it.  I used the twice the tomatoes with green chilis which added a huge kick.  Totally forgot cumin - which is odd because I love that spice, but didn't even notice until later.  I used extra extra basil - paste and fresh.  Also used Tony Chachere's More Spice instead of chili powder.  Everyone liked it - and the leftovers were even better a few days later.

Had a really good flavor and incredibly easy to make, cleanup was pretty easy too. I only used one can of black beans and added a can of pinto beans and a can of corn instead. As other reviewers have claimed, I also used the 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and was satisfied with the result. I was afraid the ground turkey would be too bland, but it was actually very delicious with the other flavors. Made it with an simple sweet cornbread I also found on here.  The chili was really filling as well-- would make again, no question.

Delicious and easy.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb., 7 oz of lean ground beef instead of turkey because that is what I had in the freezer.  The made no other substitutions and it really tasted great.  I have made black bean chili frequently and will use this recipe again.

I've made a lot of chilis, and thought this was an average one. I made it exactly as written. (I could only find 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes, so measured out just over half of it.) For one, the seasonings are too "Italian"; I like basil and oregano, but there was too much here for my taste. And there was no cumin, which is a must in my book. By the way, "Turkey" really should be in the title of the recipe; some people might avoid this, thinking it's vegetarian. I ate it all, and it was fine, but in comparison to the many chilis I've had and made over the years, it's "just OK".

Great way to use up black beans.  Not the best chili I've had because it lacked spice, but it was a great way to use up some black beans. I would eat it again but I'd make some changes. I'd prefer my regular chili though. It's good for something different every now and then.

So, this was such a simple dinner for a mom with two screaming children in the background. I only used 2 cans of beans and 1 can tomatoes and added 1tbl spn cumin. Salt and pepper too. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white. It tastes good. Took me about 10 minutes to get it to simmering point.

I'm upset with how "soupy" it turned out.  I still have it cooking on low to help evaporate the liquid.  I hope the more it sits the more it will thicken.

Best chili I have made! I only used one can of black beans and added a poblano and green pepper, one 14oz can of tomatoes and one can of chili beans. Served with sweet corn muffins. I made enough so I could freeze some for a busy night, however there is no leftovers. Great recipe!!

I made the changes that Tina Hamilton Stanley made (twice the tomatoes, only 2 cans of beans, add cumin) and it was delicious. Sometimes I add a can of corn. I have never made chili with black beans. I have always used kidney beans. I served it with corn muffin tops. This is my new chili recipe. Yum!

Easy and very delicious. I didn't have dried basil, and subbed with dried parsley. Only had 1/2 pound of grass fed organic ground beef, so I used that. Also added some chicken stock to deglaze. Topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream and had it with organic corn chips.

Good basic turkey chili. Great for a base to customize to your liking for sure. Not the best ever but pretty good and easy for a weeknight dinner.

I have used this chili recipe as a base for several different batches with great success! I've added some seasoning and different hot peppers each time to perfect it to my taste easily. I would recomend cooking it for an extra hour or two, because I find the flavors blend better with a little more time. One last suggestion would be to keep a can of tomato paste on hand. One or two batches ended up a little runny and the paste gave it some thickness without affecting flavor. Thanks for sharing with us, everyone is now a huge fan of this dish!

I read the comments and added a can of rotel.  Still was a little bland.  I should have added cumin - definitely would perk it up a bit.  I think maybe a little less black beans and a small can of corn?  I'll make it  again.  Very healthy meal.

Because I had to modify this recipe, which is a great base, I am giving it four stars instead of five. Like others, I doubled the tomato and added cumin. I also added some seasoning salt while cooking down the onion. I skipped the vinegar because I didn't have any. This was delicious!

Slow cooker version

: Now I have a slow cooker I've adapted it.  Brown the turkey and onion then put everything else in the same with one exemption. I lightly drain the beans by covering the cans with the lids so most of the water is taken out.  Turns out perfect. As others say I add some more ingredients such as taste Garlic salt and onion salt. Cook on low at least 6 hours even longer if you can make it the better.

Red wine vinegar definitely adds some zing. I make this using dried beans (let them soak in water overnight) and fresh ingredients (tomatoes, oregano, etc). Like to add a green bell pepper. Add some jalapeños , too.

Delicious. We liked this better than our ground beef and tomatoe tasting chili.  I took other's suggestions and added a 2nd can of diced tomatoes (Rotel actually, just to add some spice) and a tsp of Cumin.  I also thought it needed salt.  I will make this again.

This was indeed fantastic!  It gets 4 stars because we did add a little to it.  First, I left out 1 can of beans because it seemed it would be really "beany" but I think I'll add them back next time.  I added salt, pepper, a small amount of Tabasco, and some liquid smoke.  Absolutely awesome that way!

This is very good, easy and tasty. I Do cook my own black beans from dry beans in a pressure cooker.. Canned are ok,but are pretty salty, and cost much more. 

I also add a package of crushed red pepper, the kind that is delivered with pizzas.

I have also tried it more than once with green onions- Yummy also!

Made a vegetarian version and a turkey version, but started it in one pot and then separated into two pots. Both my meat-loving Texan man and my vegetarian midwestern mother loved it. It was delicious! I added several dashes of celery seed, curry, and hot sauce (I couldn't find my chili powder). Also, I doubled the garlic (I'm a garlic fanatic). Instead of using all black beans, I substituted one can for kidney beans. I think next time I make this (which will likely be very soon because this recipe is amazing), I will add a can of white beans. 

I put this over quinoa and sprinkled the top with cheddar cheese and a spoonful of sour cream. 

We had last night's batch again this morning for breakfast, and we realized that it was even better today. Next time I make this, I am going to put all the ingredients in a slow cooker in the morning, set it on low and let it cook all day. 

Make this -- you won't regret it. It's easy and yummy.

Great recipe...but try this! I used diced tomatoes (the type with chil peppers added) instead of crushed and add two 14.5 oz cans instead of one.   Kept the turkey at one pound, but after cooking for one hour, I added a can of low salt corn for color (and because I love corn).  My husband seasoned his bowl with Sriracha sauce and really enjoyed it!  Delicious!

Nice and easy recipe.  Tasty comfort food!  I did add an equal amount of celery as the onions and sauteed them together.   Additionally, our family likes the RWV kick and so I added an extra tbspn.  Finally, if you like your chili with a thicker consistenc like we do, I added a small can of vegetarian refried beans.

This is a stand-by, realible recipe that can be tweaked to the ingredients you have on hand/your diners enjoy.  My extra two cents:  food process for those who have a hard time with chili because of the consistency.  I dislike this recipe "chunky" and love it smooth!

This recipe had a very acidic taste when I attempted it, tried adding some brown sugar which didn't help, added a teaspoon of baking soda ( which I should have done first), it bubbles like crazy and looks like a science experiment, just keep stirring,  it worked great. Chili tasted great after that.  Not sure if the brown sugar was necessary, but probably since the recipe doesn't call for tomato sauce to sweeten it.  I used lean ground turkey, the entire pot if you are counting calories was under 1600 calories. I also rinsed 2 of the cans of beans to help lower the salt content. Very filling and good after tweaking a bit.

Wow what a great recipe...and SO easy to make.  I did use Rotel Tomatoes (with Green Chiles) instead of the crushed and I also added Red Pepper flakes.  I like the kick it gets.  I simmered for 2 hours and when it cooled, the thickness was fantastic.

Very good start. Next time I will increase spices and salt - specifically cumin. Will also add chili peppers. If you like spicy foods, use this as a base and dress it up.

This is the 1st time I've made chili, and this came out great. My variation (in addition to what is listed): 28 oz can of tomatoes, can o' corn, 1 tbs each of cumin, red pepper flakes, ancho and guajillo chili powder, 1/2 jalapeno, pinch of salt and pepper, and just 2 cans of black beans. Good heat, but not too much. And really easy to make. Will def make again. Thanks to the original poster:)

I already have a meatless recipe for black bean chili, but I was looking for something different.  This looked too simple to be great, but it was!  I used half lean ground beef and half ground turkey breast instead of regular ground turkey.  I loved it, my eldest devoured it, and my youngest liked it too.  Husband was out of town, so no vote from him!

Love this chili! Instead of using canned black beans, I used "Ivis' Black Beans" recipe from this site (which I had in my freezer) and beef chili meat instead of ground turkey (which I also had in my freezer). I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed because that was what I had in the pantry. I did add one can of tomato sauce as well. I will definitely make this again!

I made this with about a pound of cubed chicken since that's what I had.  1 can black beans, 1 can red beans, 1 can white beans.  I drained the beans before I noticed not to, so I added in a little salt.  I pureed a can of diced tomatoes, which added plenty of moisture.  Also added about a tsp sugar and a tsp of chicken boullion.  Oh, and used marjoram instead of oregano (which is a sub I usually make since I like the flavor better).  Served over white rice with sour cream on top.  My family adored this chili!  Even my picky kids inhaled it!  The herbs add a nice, savory flavor and the chili comes out flavorful, but not too spicy.  Didn't have a lot of time to let it simmer all together (about 10 minutes or so), so I bet it would taste even better after letting the flavors mix more.  Only have a tiny bit leftover to see!

Delicious!!! Easy!!! I eliminated the ground turkey and used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes.
Also added some diced red pepper and a bit of crushed red pepper.

I followed the directions. I did add an additional can of crushed tomatoes just to make it go a little further. I accidentally drained the beans (out of habit), so just added back in a can of water. Unfortunately, I was short a tablespoon of chili powder, but it was still loved by all. All kiddos asked if we could have it again some time. The recipe was quick and easy!

certainly needs double the crushed tomatoes it is to dry otherwise - we used ground pork and I added more spice.

This was great and easy enough that my husband was able to make it all by himself!  That makes it a real winner.  We loved the flavor.  We did use extra crushed tomatoes.

Very uncomplicated but very tasty.  I've made many chilis that were far more complex, but few have been more pleasing to the taste buds.  This one is a definite crowd pleaser!  My only suggestion is to add the spices to the turkey (after most of the grease has been drained off) while it's browning, so they're captured mostly by the meat, rather than the tomatoes.  The second (and third, and fourth...) time I made it, I added red pepper flakes for some extra zing, but only because my family likes their chili to be fiery, not because it needed it.

Incredibly easy to make and tasted spectacular. Only change was swapping 1 can of black beans for kidneys, and adding 1 tbsp cumin after reading other reviews.... good call. Topped with a lump of low-fat sour cream and a bit of shredded cheddar. Perfect with a pan of cornbread.

This was very nice.  I added some cumin to the spice mix and used Laura's Lean Beef.  Also didn't have black beans so I used 2 cans of pinto and 1 of small red beans and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with garlic.  Next time I will drain at least 2 cans of the beans.  Too much liquid.  I also added 1 beef bouillon cube and 1 garlic bouillon cube.  I think it's a success!

Thought the recipe could do with more tomatoes and less beans, so only added 1 can of beans and added 1 and a half cans of tomato. Also used less oregano because when I was weighing it out it looked like too much and added a bit of cream and sugar to smooth out the flavour. It was a hit with my family! My kids are very picky eaters and they had seconds and thirds! This is such an easy recipe, I will definitely be making it again. Just a note, I made this for 6 people and even though none of us had enormous helpings it was all gone by the end of dinner (and we are a family of five).

I love this recipe.  I used it in my restaurant and everyone loved it.  I used ground beef instead of turkey and added one serano pepper to the recipe.  Served with sides of sour cream, onions and cheddar.  Awesome.

This turned out great!  I left out the onion and added just a pinch of oregano just because oregano can be so strong.  My husband loved it!  We had alot left over and he packed it for lunch until the leftovers were gone!  He bragged about it for days and I am actually making it again tonight!

This turned out well for me, even I made some intentional and unintentional changes that I wanted to share. I followed the recipe to a "T" except that my ground turkey comes in 20 ounce packages AND I wanted to avoid canned beans and use homemade beans (1.5 cups dry) instead. I realized right about the time that I was going to add the beans that I would need a lot more liquid for the dish. I ended up using about 2-3 cups of vegetable broth that I needed to use up anyway and nearly doubled the spices. I added dried onion and garlic powder (on top of the fresh) and used some Tobasco sauce. It was spicy but not overwhelming. I used ground turkey breast which has almost no fat and maybe that contributed to the dryness? I can't stand the regular ground turkey but the breast is delicious. Anyhow, it was really good and I am looking forward to the leftovers too!

This was great.  I used venison rather than turkey simply because that is what I had on hand. Also added cumin per reviewers suggestions.  Yummo! This is a keeper.

Had a ton of ground turkey I needed to use up fast and was going to use a different chili recipe but only had black beans on hand. Wasn't disappointed. I nixed the vinegar and added a few other spices... Threw in a serrano pepper because we like it spicy... but all in all a very good chili recipe!

Good, hearty chili.  I added cumin to the meat as it was cooking and used one can of dark red of kidney beans for one of the cans of black beans.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine--more because I am bringing this to a potluck, some people attending don't drink wine for religious reasons, and I wasn't sure if red wine vinegar actually has wine in it.  It may not--I was too lazy to look it up.  Otherwise, I left everything the same.  I tried the chili and then decided it needed more cumin, so I added in about a tablespoon or so of cumin to make myself happy.  I plan on heating this chili up in the crock pot to help meld the flavors further.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure why, but I have always struggled making chili...but NOT ANYMORE !!!  This recipe is fantastic.  I didn't adhere to it completely as I also added tomato sauce and used diced tomatoes blended to a smooth consistency !!  It was outstanding !!  Thank you Rebecca :)

Very yummy recipe! Not enough kick for my liking. I added 1 tbsp crushed red pepper, 1.5 tbsp sriracha and 1 tbsp cumin, about, and it was just a little bland. Still hit the spot and worth another try!

This recipe is great as is. It's hardly spicy, but has a very good flavor, and you can always add some additional chili powder or red pepper if you want to add spice. It was incredibly easy to make, and made great leftovers. Even after a second reheating it still tasted just as good.

I didn't have time to cook this recipes, so I just browned 1 pound of ground turkey and 1/2 pound of ground turkey sausage with the onion and then poured everything into my crockpot, stirred it up and cooked on low for 6 hours.  I made the adjustments that other users had suggested and it turned out great!  It had excellent flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written and did not care for it.  I know that black bean soups can be more bland, but this is lacking depth of flavor.  I added cumin and hot sauce but it's still pretty bland for my taste, even a day later. First recipe on this site that I haven't liked.  Not terrible, but will not make again.

This is a good, healthy, easy chili recipe.  It wasn't the best chili I've ever had, but it was good and comforting.  No one complained, but no one raved about it either. I thought it was a little on the dry side, and it would be better with a cup of water added, and some salt.  Will make this again when I'm looking for an easy, healthy dish.

This is one of the best chili recipes I've had.  I used the whole package of ground turkey (1+ lbs), 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of kidney beans, and 1 can of white - just because that's what I had in my pantry.  I also put the tomatoes in food processor so they wouldn't be notice by my kids. :)  Will make again.

This chili is great.  I made a few modifications to suit my tastes.  I added jalepeno peppers and one extra clove of garlic.  I also substituted one can of black beans with garbonza beans.

Five stars after a few modifications. I used 28 oz of tomatoes and I added in quite a few extra spices: cumin, red pepper, etc. Perfect for fall!

This is an amazing chili! I used 1.25 pounds of ground turkey, threw in a small can of diced tomatoes, and 2 Jalapeno peppers. I also added some frozen corn, at the end, and it's the best chili I've ever eaten!

I hate to rate this recipe as is because I didn't give it a chance as is. It did turn out "fantastic" as stated though. I added 1 Tbsp Cumin, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, 2 diced fresh jalapenos with seeds, omitted 1 can of black beans and used pinto. Drained 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto, undrained 1 can black beans (bean juice is incredibly salty!), used 1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes, 5 dashes Tabasco. My boyfriend had no idea I used ground turkey, the flavor was that good. No leftovers. :(

I really liked this and so did my "pumpkin carving" friends.  It was easy and served with cornbread muffins - it was an excellent way to eat and carve.  The turkey was great for us. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and once can of pinto beans with some spices added because that's what I had on hand.  It made the chili a bit spicier and I thought it was probably better that way.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I found the flavors very mild and the whole thing lacking taste.  I'm not sure what it needs...paprika maybe?

This is a great recipe when I want to include a lot of beans into my diet.  Sometime I will substitute one can of black beans with one can of kidney beans just to add a new taste.  Super easy and very good.

We liked this, but the flavor of the black beans dominated the dish. How much you like this dish will depend on how much you like black beans.

I have to review this recipe because I made different versions of it. The first time I made it, I didn't have oregano and omitted it; I also used ground turkey instead of beef. We LOVED it. I made it last night and figured I'd follow the recipe this time. With the oregano, I did not like it half as much. It may be my personal taste because I don't care for an Italian restaurant that overloads every dish with oregano but I'm going to leave it out every time from now on.

I followed the instructions to a T and it came out pretty good! The only thing though I added cumin in as well as extra chili powder.  After adding in the 3 cans of beans with the liquids it ended up being very watery so I added in about a tablespoon of cornstarch to get to to thicken up.  My boyfriend loved it so we'll definitely be having it again since it was quick and easy!

This has become a winter favorite at my house. Wonderful recipie that can be easily tweaked to your family's preferences. I add cumin and omit the oregeno. Also, I throw in a jar of salsa and add a can of chili beans in place of one of the cans of black beans. Everything else as directed. Easy, hearty and SO delicious!

This chili was extremely easy and very tasty.  I have specific diet requirements and this one filled them all while being delicious.  I added some cumin and a dash of Tabasco for my personal taste...the red wine vinegar really gives it a kick, I love that!  Count me among those who used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, I wanted a little more liquid.

Very easy and quick recipe, thoroughly enjoyable. I actually substituted ground beef for the turkey and diced tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes and it was great.

I liked this recipe okay--followed it exact.  Definitely not a sweeter chili--I may add more tomatoes next time.  Got mixed reviews from the kids--one liked it, the other not so much. But still good and healthly--although not so much considering we added fritos, cheese and sour cream!

Love it, but did change it up a bit. For some reason I had never even thought of buying black beans, but now that I have tried them, I really the way they taste. I had to add kidney and garbanzo beans, I mean, it's chili, you just kind of have too. I didn't have red wine vinegar last time, but am making it again tomorrow and will use this time. Can't wait!

Marvelous *eating it as I type!*  Here are the adjustments I made: added 1 teaspoon of chipotle powder, used a combination of 1 14.5 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 1 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, used 2 cans of black beans and 1 can of pinto beans (because that's what I had on hand).  I also added a can of golden hominy (because it was in the pantry along with the beans and I didn't know what else to do with it!). I also used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar because that's what I had.  I let it simmer for and hour and a half.  Served with shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream...MMMMMM!  Thanks for the great recipe!

fantastic -- used 1 can cuban black beans, 1 can corn, and 1 can garbonzo beans (all from Trader Joes).  Didn't drain.  Used only a small can of crushed tomatoes and 1 lb 1/3 of ground turkey.

The basic recipe sounded great, but with the addition of a 10 oz. can of chopped tomatoes with chopped green chilies it was even better. I also used a 28 oz. can of the crushed tomatoes as was suggested by a lot of others. This has now become a staple in our house. I made a huge pot and froze most of it for a busy day with no time to cook.

I agree that this recipe is probably pretty bland as is. I made it with ground beef, added a can or rotel, halved the basil and oregano, added a tsp or so of cumin and half a packet of taco seasoning. At the last minute, I also added two packets of Taco Bell sauce. I gave this 5 stars because it DID end up REALLY good, but I suppose it barely resembled the original recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it really does require MORE SPICE/HEAT!  I made it as written, and my kids loved it, but anyone over 12 will want more heat.  I just added more chili powder and some salsa after serving my kiddos.

We thought this was okay but needed more "spice".  It was low on taste for chili.  I added a can of corn to add some color & texture which helped.

Wow, this was fantastic!  I used a can of pinto beans instead of one of the cans of black beans for a bit of variety.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned I also added some cumin.  This will definitely be a regular on my menu.

I doubled the garlic, used 1.3 pounds ground turkey, added 2 tsp. cumin, increased the chili powder to 2 tablespoons and added one can of Rotel.  It was spicy but not overly so. As suggested by others, I think an addition of some celery and green bell pepper would be nice.

This recipes was pretty good. My boyfriend liked it better than the chili recipe I usually make so it is a keeper. The only adjustments I made were some extra cumin and chili powder, and a pinch of dried chili flakes.

We loved this chili!!!!! I changed a few things after reading several reviews to spice it up a little. I used 1.3 pounds of turkey, a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, and added 1 T. of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. The rest of the ingredients I kept as written. Next time I might chop up a green pepper to give it a little something extra. Excellent flavor!!!

This turned out very good and was well liked at my house. I added more garlic just 'cus that's how it goes in my kitchen , I mostly drained the black beans and I added one can of diced tomatoes zesty chili style.
   We used a dollop of light sour cream and alittle shredded cheese( my bowl had mild sliced pepper rings in it too)and it was very good - thanks for sharing our "new" house chili.

I've made this chili for years and it's a hit at our house.  It's actually the only chili we eat.  Try 3T of chili power for a fuller tasting chili.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars. I needed a good recipe for Black bean Chili and I think I finally found it!! I pretty much followed the recipe but I made a few tweaks of my own with this one.... First my husband doesn't like ground turkey so I used 95% lean ground meat. I browned my meat seasoned with cumin chili powder, garlic powder and onions. I also sauted some celery. I put this on the bottom of my crock pot; I added the black beans and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chili's (14 1/2 oz cans) 1 sm can of tomatoe paste and I also added 1 sm can of diced green chilis a little green pepper diced and I also added one envelope of Old El Paso hot and spicy taco seasoning. I cooked this in my crockpot on high about 3 hrs...  then before we left for my son's football game I cut the crockpot on low for another 3 hrs.  After we came home from the game the house smelled so great! This chili was delicious and hearty!! I served this with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread also found on this site.  It was the perfect meal especially after being outside in the chill! Great recipe.... thanx for sharing.. I will be putting this in my fall/winter rotation of recipes.

This is good... I thought it was going to be too much (3 cans of black beans!?) but I have barely 2 cups leftover! I eyeballed the spices and upped the cumin, i used chicken cuz we don't have turkey readily available here in Singapore. My American husband and brother loved it, and ate waaay too much. Reminded us of our Tex-Mex days. Served it with "Golden Sweet Cornbread". A hit.

I made this chili tonight for my husband who is on a sodium-restricted diet.  I used no-salt added black beans, 14 oz. no-salt added diced tomatoes and 8 oz no-salt added tomato sauce.  I omitted the basil, reduced the oregano by half, added 1 T. cumin and sprinkled in more chili powder (homemade sodium free).  He dished his over low salt crackers and said it was delicious!  I served mine over Fritos Scoops and it was wonderful!!  YEA!  A low sodium chili that we both enjoy!  Thanks!

This was the first time I had ever made chili.   I used 19 oz of black beans and two large tins of crushed tomatoes.I substituted red wine for red wine vinegar.  I didn't use any thyme, but added cumin, red pepper flakes to taste.

I used fire roasted tomatoes, but I think next time I'll use a can of Rotel.  I also add some red pepper flakes for a little spice.  It's a good recipe, but I think it needs a little tweaking.

As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the amount of can tomatoes.  Also, I add in about 12 cut-up pieces of jalapenos to give it some extra spice.  I buy the canned jalapenos from the store that are already cut up.

I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this chili. I doubled the tomatoes, added 2 tablespoons cumin, four chipotle chiles (in Adobo sauce) and a bottle of Henry Weinhard's Blonde Ale. I will probably tinker with it even further as I still want a little more flavor, but it's a great start for a turkey and black bean chili.

This is absolutely delicious. A little too much oregano for us though, but other then that, great! After I tried it this way, I did add some things that I thought would make it better for us and it did. But still the recipe itself is great.

Delicious! I love black beans. I doubled the tomatoes and chili powder since some said it wasnt flavorful. I also added black pepper, garlic powder, and meat seasoning. I left out the actual garlic and wine vinegar. It came out a bit on the spicy side for my taste but it tastes great!

This was really good. Modifications I made: I had fresh corn on hand, so I cut the kernels off of two ears and added it, along with one cut-up red bell pepper. It really made it colorful.  I sauteed the onions first until they were soft, then added the spices and sauteed for a few seconds until they were fragrant. Then I added the turkey. After the turkey was browned I added all the ingredients to a crock-pot and cooked for 1.5 hours. Yummy!

Its not as flavorful as i imagined it would be but its still tasty and super easy to make in the crock pot. Maybe if I let it cook longer it will taste better.

i liked the black beans instead of the normal style of chili we make. ill make this every once in awhile, but i felt it was leaving me wanting more. ended up adding 1 can rotel, garlic & onion powder, more chili powder and adding cumin...still left wanting more spice. chili consistency was very good though, especially after it sat longer than 1 hr and cooled down.

I make this regularly as a side dish rather than chili; I omit the veg oil and meat and  cook everything else in the crockpot on low for several hours. It is great! I sometimes add a tsp of cumin too. Thanks for posting.

Absolutely perfect!  I didn't put the red wine vinegar in, only because I didn't have any and didn't feel like getting something I probably wouldn't use for a long time.  I did add a 12 oz can of corn.  I simmered for 2 hours.  Perfect!  Had it with "Best Ever Corn Muffins".

I've made this chili more times than I can count, since I first saw the recipe. It's absolutely YUMMY!  The vinegar is the secret ingredient here -- it takes it from great, to AMAZING!  I love this recipe -- and it's even better the next day!  If you're following the South Beach diet, this is a perfect recipe for phase 1.

I thought this was great chili as did my kids and husband!  I only used 2 cans of black beans and almost a whole bag of frozen white corn.  The red vinegar adds a little something and I will definitely make this again.  Great served over rice or on its own.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe. I would highly suggest substituting the crushed tomatoes for diced or stewed tomatoes for a less tomato-y flavor.

I added about half a can of drained corn and I used MorningStar Farms (vegan) veggie crumbles in place of the ground meat. It was very good, but in my opinion there is room for imporvement. I think next time I will probably use mexican style stewed tomatoes, increase the seassoning and probably add a bit of cumin. By the way this makes a very big pot of chili, way more than 6 servings.

This was very good, I substituted 1 can of beans for a can of corn because my fiancé doesn't really care for beans. 3 cans sounded like a lot of beans but after making it, it would have been just fine with all 3.  I did think it needed a little more kick so I added some extra chili powder, cayenne and a little salt.

I used this recipe and it was great.  I fed it to my mom who's always skeptical of my cooking and she asked to take home some leftovers, so I know it was good.  I also added cumin as others have suggested and put in a few bay leaves.

I did not like this recipe because it tasted too meaty for me.  Generally I prefer chili with the vegetables and beans as the main event.  

It was a pretty easy recipe to prepare.  Probably anyone who prefers a meatier chili will probably like it.

I have never made anything with ground turkey or black beans before. Since I am trying a lower calorie diet this looked hearty but much healthier than other options. It was soooo good I will make this over and over!!! A little non-fat sour cream on top and it was amazing.

Great chili and so easy to make!  I cooked the onion and garlic in olive oil, added about a tablespoon of cumin and a half tsp. of red pepper flakes, and increased the tomatoes to 28 oz.  After browning the meat, I put it all in the crockpot for several hours and it tasted wonderful!

Easy to make, hard to screw up, and tastes great.  I'm not the best cook, and substituted a lot of the ingredients (sweet corn for 1 can of beans, garlic powder, regular vinegar, diced tomatoes, and salsa instead of chili powder), still this recipe worked out really well.

This is one of my favorite chili recipe's ever! I love the vinegar in the chili and never would have thought to do that on my own! So good, everyone is surprised when they come over by how yummy it is. I always serve it with some sweet honey cornbread.

After a few modifications this recipe was great! My beef-loving fiance said this is the best chili he'd ever had! I used 3 cans of black beans and 1 can of hot chili beans (undrained). I used chili powder and 1/2 a packet of chili seasoning. I used more tomatoes, 1 (29 oz) can of concentrated crushed tomatoes. I also didn't add the oregano, basil, or red wine vinegar. I like a more authentic tasting chili.

I loved this chili recipe. I added a can of corn and left out one of the black bean cans. I also added some fresh green onion and some of my husbands frozen tomatoes from his garden last summer. We ate it with cheese melted on top. Yum! I'll definitely put this recipe in my book of favorites.

I also cooked it in the crock pot for 4 hours and that was perfect.  I like it extra spicy so I added about a tablespoon of crushed red pepper and 1/4 cup of red wine for some depth.

Delicious but we had a hard time calling it chili. We're from Texas and this isn't like any chili we've had before! We served it over rice and added sour cream and cheese. It was very good and filling. I will make this again soon.

Great recipe!  I made it vegetarian with LightLife Smart Ground, and also added about 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 green pepper.  Very easy to make, and not a ton of mess, which is great!  Perfect on a fall day.

This is one of the best chili recipes I've ever had.  It's savory, not too spicy & low fat.  Also, I like that it uses tomato puree instead of actual tomatoes.  I substituted ground turkey breast,  added in some sliced mushrooms & was very pleased with this dish.

I've made this recipe several times and its always a hit.  Although, I stick to the basic recipe, I have added more spices, 4 cans of beans rather than 6 and a little more turkey, its always produces a great taste!

This was good, I'd make it again with changes. I made mine in the crockpot and it was great, Used mornignstar farms burger crumbles instead of meat, didnt bother to saute the garlic and onion, just threw it into the crockpot. Only had 2 cans of beans, thought that was too much, next time will just use 1. used a 28oz can diced tomatoes. Could've been spicier.

LOVED this!  it was super easy, quite tasty and the leftovers fed us for a week.  i love the fact that i didn't need to use any kind of packaged flavoring with it, either.  it got a little soupy, so i added a spoonful or two of cornstarch and it thickened up nicely.  yummy with cornbread or crackers.

Just not my idea of chili. I could really taste the red wine vinegar and in my opinion that just shouldn't go in chili-I guess I prefer the traditional recipe.

My hubby is a big chili fan- usually likes the standard ground beef/kidney beans.  I made this to try something a little different than the norm.  I agree with previous reviews, nice flavor but it needed a little more ooommphh in the spice area.  I ended up adding salt, pepper, more garlic, red pepper, and a little cayenne.  My husband topped it off with tobasco as well.  Next time I think I will try as previously suggested substituting salsa for the tomatoes, adding corn for more texture, and playing around some more with the spices.  Good starting point though!

This was delicious!  We added a small can of diced green chiles, but otherwise made the recipe as stated.  It was pretty bland, so we doctored it up by adding about twice as much chili powder and a tbsp. of ground cumin.  Would probably be good with a can of corn thrown in there too.  This is a great base recipe that you can easily change to suit your own tastes!  Delicious with corn bread!!

We loved this chili, but adjusted the recipe as suggested in other reviews.  Only 2 cans beans instead of 3, dropped the vinegar, added some frozen corn, and a cup of salsa.  Cooked in crock pot all day on low to make it easy.  Will make again and again.

Very good recipe.  I did change a little by using Mexican Rotel.  We were pleasantly surprised, but we still feel that the chili is missing it's "chili-ness" without the meat.  VERY good though....we'll make it again.

Excellent meal, everyone loved it. I used 2 tins of tomatoes, one tin each of chickpeas, cannelini beans, pinto beans and sweetcorn. I wasnt keen on the vinegar taste and will omit this in the future.

This recipe is a good starting point.  I used a full 28 oz can of tomatoes as well as a jalapeno with the onion (I like a little heat).  I also didn't add the sweet spices.  Next time I'm going to use a mix of black beans and chick peas.

this was really good. even better on the second day! Hubby didn't like so much but he's not a big fan of chili. I thought he might go for it since it was so different from the regular beef chili. He said he prefers the beef. I loved it! mmm. and healthy for you too!

Hearty and delicious!  I followed other readers' suggestions by adding two teaspoons of cumin and a dash of cayenne pepper, as well as substituting an extra 1/2 lb. of ground turkey for a can of black beans.  Such a good meal.

Fantastic is putting it mildly!!!  I LOVE this chili!!  Funny thing is, I always cook with ground turkey, but didn't have any or time to make a trip to my "wholesale club".  I used ground chuck...tomatoes w/green chilies....and I had some green pepper in the fridge that I cut up and threw in.  I let it stew all day in the crockpot.  I just ate a HUGE bowl and I'm going back for seconds!!!  Only wish I had made some cornbread to go with, woulda been a perfect match!  Give this one a try!

I've been told I have to make this again and that it's better than our family chili recipe...in fact this chili inspired my sister to say that our regular ground beef chili, which I make often, is "ucky".  Very smooth and flavourful.  Serve in bowls with rice on bottom, chili on top.  I used 2 19-oz black bean cans (the size they sell here) and almost 29-oz of crushed tomatoes as that's the size of can and, the lid stuck, suddenly opened, and in it all went :-0  Also added half a chopped pepper to get some more veggies in.  Could easily make this veggie by taking out turkey and adding mushrooms, carrots etc.  A keeper!

This is really good! It was easy to make, and I love the black beans in it instead of the traditional kidney beans. I added some cumin and corn like other people said - and it's great.

I'm not a kidney bean fan so this recipe appealed to me.  I did add more garlic and found that I had to add some tomato sauce during while cooking or the chili would have been too dry.

Very good recipe.  I reworked it per some of the
reviews - added small can of tomato sauce, 
used diced tomatoes with chiles, and added 
a touch of cumin.  I also added some chicken
broth but regretted this later - made it far 
too runny the first night.  
Successive nights, though, with cheddar, sour
cream, and tortilla chips, were great.

Delicious!  I tripled the recipe for my Super Bowl Party.  I added 5 cans of Black beans, 2 Cans of Kidney Beans, and 2 cans of Mexican Corn.  (instead of 9 cans of black Beans)  It gave it the added color and flavor.  I also added extra spices as others have recommended.  It turned out great!

Great seasonings, especially a day or two after it has been cooked. I couldn't find ground turkey when I made this but had some leftover soy "veggie crumbles" (vegetarian ground burger) and they worked just great.

I prefer black beans over kidney beans so I picked this recipe. The garlic and red wine vinegar made it very flavorful!

This is delicious! It tastes best a day or two after you make it. I also tried it with kidney beans and hamburger and it was delicious but not as soupy - more chunky.

This is a very good chili recipe. I added some 1/2t cumin, small can of tomato sauce and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes. My boyfriend was a little skeptical about the ground turkey at first, but he loved it! He kept saying "this is REALLY good". I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

Great recipes.  I doubled the amount of tomatoes, but otherwise made it as written.  My husband, who doesn't like chili or black beans, thought it was wonderful.

This was excellent, I used a variety of beans (whatever I had in the pantry) - so there were black beans, chick peas, and kidney beans, and it came out great.  I was a bit skeptical, but I used 1/2 pound turkey and next time will use more.

I had never used black beans before and wanted to try something with this ingredient and I'm glad I found this recipe.  I used about 2 tablespoons of oil to saute the onions which was probably a little much but by the time I added the turkey it was about right.  I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. ground cumin when I added the other spices.  I thought about 1/2 hour into simmering that it would be too wet so I uncovered the pot and just put a spatter screen over it and by the time an hour passed it was perfect.  I served it with Mexican Corn Bread on the side and even my three picky boys loved it!  I will make this again for sure.

Simply great!  Easy and quick and freezes well.  If you love chili but don't like ground beef this is your ticket.

I simmered the chili for an hour, sampled it, and found it bland. I added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, season salt, black pepper, and a bit of cumin to perk it up. After a day of refrigeration, it tasted pretty good.
