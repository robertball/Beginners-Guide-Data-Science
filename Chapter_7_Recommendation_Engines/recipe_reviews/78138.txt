This pie is delicious.  A couple suggestions - use frozen rhubarb, not fresh as then it won't 'explode'. If you only have fresh, add a bit of water before microwaving.  I chopped it into fairly small pieces.   I had to microwave frozen rhubarb for about 6 minutes in my microwave to get it juicy.  I also recommend you let it cool completely to thicken up like the first reviewer said.  It is a bit too liquidy if you don't let it cool.   With these changes, this pie is is fantastic!

Although a big fan of rhubarb, I admit I was dubious of it's inclusion in a Saskatoon pie recipe, being somewhat of a purist. I am however, always open to trying new things, and am I ever glad about that, because rhubarb took saskatoon pie to another level. The submitter's claims are all spot on. Saskatoons aren't known for their incredible juiciness (although they have an unbeatable flavor), therefore the rhubarb adds the much needed juices, while still allowing the berries to be the star of the show. It also added a very pleasant 'just right' tartness that was a perfect complement. The filling was a perfect consistency, holding the fruit in nicely. Only wanting one pie this time, and using from scratch pie crust, I cut the recipe in half and filled my 9 inch, not 8 inch, pie plate. When I make this again, I'll make the entire recipe and fill my 9" deep dish pie pan for a mile high pie, especially in light of the fact that the filling holds itself so well. The rhubarb I used had been frozen, so it only needed a minute in the microwave to yield it's juices. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Stacy!

I wanted to note that this recipe makes TWO double crust pies!    It is better to make your own crusts if you can -  enough for two, double crust pies; but the frozen pie crusts work fine as well.  Just make sure you have enough for two, or else freeze the remaining filling for later.

This is our favorite pie, hands down.  Serve with vanilla ice cream after it's cooled and once the filling has firmed up.

Not a very good recipe at all.
First off, nuke the rhubarb for >1 minute, I put it in for 2 and it exploded.
Secondly, pie/soup is overly sweet, add maybe 1/2 the second batch of sugar
Thirdly, it turned out very liquidy, add maybe 1/2 the water.
Won't be a repeat

I put this mix in tart shells rather than a pie, and although it was nice and juicy, it also stayed thick enough to allow people to eat a tart out of their hand. However, I found that the cooking time was far too long - about 20 minutes at a lower temperature worked well. Don't worry too much about temp or time, just make sure that the mix clarifies to a deep reddish purple before you take them out, and it will be fine. If underdone, they will taste fine, but not have as striking a colour. Delicious!

I love this recipe... I too used frozen rhubarb and had no problems. Only problem I have had is trying to load a picture of the pie :)

This is great!  I used splenda instead of sugar to cut the calories and it worked fine. Now I know what to do with all those saskatoon berries I get off my tree every year! Lori W, St. Albert Alberta

Amazing combination of tart rhubarb and berries!  Very easy to make.  I used frozen rhubarb and also frozen saskatoons..   Easy to make this way but should have reduced the water by at least 1/2 cup as a result of using frozen berries… Recipes itself is fantastic  and produces a unique pie.

I picked at least a gallon of serviceberries one day, luckily had some fresh rhubarb in my garden and made this pie for a potluck dinner. It was delicious!  I've also used the filling and put a topping like apple crisp on top. That is also very good.

My brother gave me some saskatoons and I had rhubarb, so I gave this recipe a try.  I gave my brother one of the pies.  He came and gave me more saskatoons today, asking if I could make him another pie saying that it was the best pie he'd ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I lessened the sugar by a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe. I have added to my family cookbook.

I have made this several times and the rhubarb tangs this up so lovely. I did put in less sugar than it calls for as I don't have a great sweet tooth but others loved it as well

This was a very yummy pie and I don’t even like Rhubarb! Even though it says it makes 2, I have a large deep pie dish and the filling was perfect! Lovely sweet n tart balance.

After reading a few comments, I added a bit more cornstarch to thicken it more. I'll see how it is after it cools.

There are no shortage of Saskatoon (service) berries where I live, so I get to eat my share of Saskatoon berry pies. This is one of my favorite recipes, both for the ease of making it and for it's delightful flavour.

This is a delicious pie!!! Just what the description says it is. I cut the rhubarb in small pieces and nuked it a minute at a time, no problem. A keeper for sure.

Followed directions exactly except instead of putting the rhubarb in the microwave, i placed frozen rhubarb on the stove on low until they started to thaw, then added the sugar. This pie was a HIT. Everyone loved it! I will be saving this recipe for sure. Easy and delicious
