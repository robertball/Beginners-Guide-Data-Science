Crazy good. I LOVE ginger, and ginger ale. I can never find ginger ale with enough ginger for me. This was perfection. I used seltzer water instead of regular water to get my fizz on. One note I would like to make. The first time I made this I used jarred minced ginger. It does not have nearly enough flavor. Fresh ginger is imperative. My first attempt I cut the recipe down to five serving and I still ended up using nearly half a cup of jarred ginger. I really could not taste it. Another recipe on here that I tried said to use white balsamic. I used that in one of my experiments. I found that you can change up the profile of this just by playing around with your vinegar. I think when I get bored one day, I will try using vodka in or sherry in place of the vinegar just to see what would happen. Thanks again.

I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  After straining off the ginger, it was delicious to eat!  When adding the water to make the drink, I found that a 4 to 1 ratio was best!

This is so good. I stopped drinking wine about a month ago and this is a great relaxing subsitute. I only used 2 1/2 cup of sugar. I poured it with ice and fresh lemons.... Soooo Good and good for you! Thanks

Shut the front door! And the back door! Then lock em both cuz I'm not sharing this! Because I had frozen ginger, I added a quite bit more than called for. Don't be me. Man, is it spicy! It tones down a good deal when added to sparkling water, though. Such a weird and wonderful recipe! :o)

This is a delicious and refreshing drink just in time for summer. My family loved it! I like the fact that you can make it strong or just flavor your water slightly. I made it with the red wine vinegar, and I am looking forward to trying it with the white wine vinegar as well. Cheers!

Perfect. I have been digging ginger lately and thought there had to be some ginger flavored drink out there to satisfy my craving  and this nailed it. Made it exactly as written. Perfect for hot summer nights. This is the first recipe I have felt the need to leave a review on. Definitely worthy of five stars . can't believe it only has eight ratings(now)! Thank you so much for sharing

I sent my boyfriend to the grocery store for a few items and he came back with 2 ENORMOUS pieces of ginger (too funny!).  I decided to try this recipe so it wouldn't all go to waste!  It's delicious.

This is amazing mixed with club soda and has completely replaced store-bought soda in my home.  As a bonus, the ginger that is left over after straining makes a great addition to salad dressings or chicken salad with grapes and apples (and can be frozen for use later - wasting something that tasty would just be so wrong!)

Made this to use up some ginger root I had from another recipe and it was surprisingly delicious! Might try with less sugar next time.

This is so refreshing! I've made this four times now along with another similar recipe with strawberry by the same OP.  I'm playing with vinegar variations and so far my favorite is white balsamic, but white wine vinegar or apple cider is good too.

This is very much like the old-fashioned switchel that was popular in the old days (although they used honey or maple syrup for sweetener.)  I cut the sugar in half and it's plenty sweet! You simply cannot put too much ginger in it so grate to your heart's content if you love it as much as I do. I added a few sprinkles of cardamom and did half ACV/half white vinegar. Definitely freeze the ginger that you strain out to use for other dishes or drinks. My kids want to know why store-bought ginger ale can't taste as good as this! Store it in a pretty glass bottle in your fridge and keep sparkling water on hand for a refreshing drink when you're craving it.  So glad I came across your recipe.

So delish!  I love ginger and could easily drink this everyday as a yummy treat...so much better than anything that can be purchased in the stores.  Can easily adjust the sweetness or ginger strength based on personal preference.  I highly recommend you give it a try and share it with someone, yummy- pass it on!

This is AMAZINGLY good! I used white wine vinegar, and I am curious to try out some other options. Very refreshing with a glass of seltzer water. A little on the sweet side, but I love the gingery taste. YUM!

Followed recipe to the T not liking it at all! I'm thinking I used too much of the syrup to a glass of fizzy water.

One of the best refreshment for  summer and you can add some freshly grated CUCUMBER to your glass of sekanjabin sherbet and ... wow, it's awesome!
BTW, I subed apple cider vinegar and it tastes fruitier.

This is fabulous!  I didn't make it as sweet (cut back by 1/3 the sugar and  1/4 the vinegar). and used sparkling mineral water (I used Gerolsteiner). You could almost add more ginger if you want for a more peppery and zippier ginger flavor. Next time I will.
