I don't know why anyone makes microwave popcorn, when the stove top method is easy and so much better.  I make it like Lisa Douglas (review below) - canola oil, throw in a couple of kernels and wait until they pop and then throw in the remainder.  Because the oil is at the popping temperature, there is little need to shake it - just a couple times and within a minute or two your popcorn is ready.  I also keep flavored salts on hand - like cheddar cheese, to shake on top once it's done.  Cheap and way better than the micro.  If you find your popcorn doesn't pop well, try this:  add a tablespoon or two of water to your container of popcorn, shake it up and let it absorb for a day or two.  The moisture in the kernels is what makes it pop.
Edit:  I have to make a revision.  Although Canola oil generally is healthier, high heati creates trans fats which are BAD for you.  Peanut oil is a better choice because it has a higher smoke point.  (Coconut oil, while having a high smoke point, is high in saturated fats and one of the unhealthiest.)

This is okay, but using coconut oil is way better tasting!  That's exactly how movie theaters used to make it.  You can find coconut oil in the Asian section of the grocery store, and sometimes in health food stores.  It's white and firm at room temp, but it melts very easily and the second you smell it you'll be time-warped back to your childhood, and your friends will pledge their loyalty forever.

The brand of popping corn you use is key too - definitely go with the higher quality brand in a jar.  (you know, from the guy with the funny name)

This way of making popcorn was great!  After making many batches of popcorn, we now do the following:  We never use/have peanut oil in the house, so we use just the butter.  Being vegan, we use Earth’s Balance non-hydrogenated vegan ‘butter’.  The ratio that works best for us is:  6 Tbs. Butter (easier to measure on a scale - 84 grams),  1 cup Popcorn Kernels (we like the "white" popcorn best),  1 tsp. Salt.  Sometimes we sprinkle some Nutritional Yeast Flakes (available at health-food and many regular grocery stores) on the finished popcorn for a nice ‘cheesy’ flavor.  We use less butter/oil than the original recipe, but it tastes great and works well for us.  Combining all the ingredients in the pot before popping is much easier than melting butter separately, and having to mix it all evenly at the end.  Thank you so much "D.A. mommy" for sharing this great popping method!

I make this style of popcorn all the time using vegetable oil. This recipe is amazing I never thought about adding butter or salt to the pot and the peanut oil gives a better flavor then vegetable oil. This is a keeper

I could live off of this popcorn. I like canola oil best and omit the butter.  I let the pot heat, add the oil and three kernals of corn, add the remaining corn after the first three pop, and shake, shake, shake.  I only use 2 T of oil; I have non-stick pots, don't know if that makes a difference.

We eat popcorn all the time...great CHEAP snack food that our grandchildren love!

You may want to check into a whirly whirl popcorn cooker.  It has a wire spinner that you turn as the popcorn cooks.  It is GREAT!!

Well, I tried it and the popped corn didn't get as light and puffed as when I used only oil in the pan. The butter turned a little burnt before the popping was done too. I will stick to popping the corn in oil only-then melting butter and tossing it into the popped corn with the salt a bit at a time.

I really like the flavor of the peanut oil. Also, I use unsalted butter. I am not big on salty things. My batch started burning so I will have to practice. The top was still good! Thanks!

I highly recommend using coconut oil for several reasons. 1) You can get away with using only 2 TBSP oil to 1/2cup of popcorn, 2)it has a much higher smoke point than vegetable oil, 3)it makes wonderful tasting popcorn. 4)its being "unhealthy" is a myth. Just Google it and draw your own conclusions. I gave the recipe only 4 stars because 3 TBSP of oil is 50% more oil than you really need for 1/2 cup of popcorn.

To make it really taste like movie theater popcorn, after popping place it in a large turkey roaster and bake it in the oven at 250 for about 15 minutes.  It takes all the chewiness out and will keep in a sealed container for days.  Sunflower oil is great too, has a much lighter taste.  Also, we love our Whirly-Pop pan!

This is the popcorn of my childhood. So clean and simple and delicious. In case you're wondering, it's worth the extra work versus microwave popcorn.

Right. Will be selling the air popper on ebay post haste. How yummy was THAT? I won't make popcorn any other way from now on. This is really the safest, healthiest way and super easy. I followed the advice of a reviewer who said she added four tablespoons of butter and only one tablespoon of oil (I used canola). I really like buttery popcorn but I think I'll cut the butter back next time to three tablespoons because it was really rich/buttery with four tablespoons. I used "I Can't Believe it's not butter" stick butter straight from the fridge. I have an induction cooktop so I didn't really do the shaking thing as induction requires direct magnetic reaction to the bottom of your pot in order to heat well/evenly. It came out great. One tip: I sprayed the bottom and sides of the pan with cooking spray and nothing stuck. Yeeeeee-haw!! Fresh, safe popcorn. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Ican't stand microwave popcorn.  I've used a whirly pop popper for years.  It's great!  Another variation that I make often is to add about 1/2 cup of sugar to the oil just before adding the corn. Makes a sweet carmel corn-like taste.  I then add salt to it after pouring the popped corn into a bowl.  I love sweer and salty.

I made this tonight for an "Oldest Recipe in your Recipe Box" challenge. I used exact ingredients called for, including cheap bagged popcorn, not a premium brand, that I've had for about 3 months, and tonight it came out better than when I used my old stovetop recipe when it was fresh. I let the oil come to almost smoking before adding the other ingredients and had no problems with burning butter as some others did. The finished corn had a slightly darker golden color than if the butter is added after popping, but the taste was perfect. I did follow one reviewer's advice and vented the steam 3 times while popping. I think this helped keep the corn tender. I used a 5-qt. stockpot as 1/2 cup seemed like a lot of corn for a 3 qt. pan. I think the larger bottom surface was a good thing, too. I only had 24 (I counted them) un-popped kernels. That measured out to 1 teaspoon,  better than any other method I've ever tried. This recipe gave me much better results than the microwave popcorn recipe I tried. Hubs and I both really liked it, and this is going right into my "Easy Favorites" folder to be my standard popcorn recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing this easy, delicious recipe.

This is one of the first things I learned how to make on my own and I've got the scar between my forehead from a freshly popped kernel to prove it! A couple of notes: Don't lift the lid until your popcorn is mostly popped - if you let out the steam it doesn't pop as well. As well, my husband and daughter love flavored popcorn. I found it best to add flavorings after the popcorn has been lightly coated with butter. We've tried microwave, air popped and stovetop popcorn with and without butter, and this seems to be the best method.

This was SO good!  I used smart oil instead of peanut oil since my son has a peanut allergy and it was delicious!  Reminds me of the popcorn we ate as kids since my dad always made popcorn this way. So much better than microwave popcorn!

BEST Popcorn ever! JUST made this using the tip to soak the kernels in water for about 10mins prior to use--you could see them suck it up. I spread them out on a paper towel to dry them before use. I also used coconut oil and the tip to test the oil heat by tossing in a few kernels. ONce those popped I added the butter and the rest of the kernels--and Voila! Perfect amount of oil for salt and fresh ground cinnamon to adhere to AND Very few old maids remained! Thx to the reviewers and AR!

Can't figure out the big deal.  First, I grew up making popcorn in a pan like this, and still do it all the time.  An air popper is dry and microwave is full of trans fat and such.  I also have put the butter into the pan for a long time, when I use butter.  Except I agree with the person who said if you stick the butter in with the oil immediately, it just burns and doesn't work.  You have to wait until it starts popping -- have it on like a knife ready to go.  Wait until it's just getting a good pop going, but no longer or it won't melt right.  Open the lid enough to get the knife through and just scrap it on the side and let it slide down.  If it hasn't popped too much, it'll melt as it pops.  Too soon and it burns, or just cools it down so it stops popping.  Too late and it doesn't really melt.  It can take a little practice to get it perfect.  I've done this for years.  (Though I don't have peanut oil around.  And I absolutely will put more salt on anyway cause I'm unfortunately a salt-aholic.)

This is an excellent base recipe. You can substitute almost any oil in place of peanut oil. I've used olive oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil, toasted sesame oil, etc. I always have extra virgin olive oil on hand, so that's the oil I usually end up using. I use whipped butter, white kernels, and then sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on the popcorn once it's finished popping. Amazing.

Growing up this is the only way I ever had popcorn at home.  I don't think I'll ever eat microwave popcorn again!  I did make one small change, I used cannola oil instead of peanut because I didn't have the peanut oil.

Peanut oil is better than canola but coconut oil is by far the best tasting!

We were all a little disappointed with this version of "stove-top" popcorn, as my kids call it.  I found the salt almost burning on the bottom of the pan.  The oil & butter combo was less heat tolerant than my usual peanut oil.  All in all, I will stick with my version of "Stove-Top" and add the butter & salt just before serving.

You can make this with any size pot. Add enough oil to barely coat the pan, pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pan 1 kernel deep, add your butter and salt to your taste, and pop. Works in a soup kettle for a crowd, or a small saucepan for one person.

I agree, the home ingredients are tastier and probably better for us, especially the oils.  I do use one of my microwave popcorn bowels now - I don't like scorching the popcorn on the stove top.  And I use Canola or olive oil on doctor's orders and only two tablespoons.    Sometimes I sneak in a bit of butter too.  Or, for a special treat I also might add some powdered cheddar cheese after popping not before, and no butter.    Using the microwave cooker I can pop the corn without any oil at all but if I am going to coat later with cheddar cheese I find that I need to put the oil in so the corn has something for the cheddar to stick to.

Love this recipe!  Changes made based on other reviews:  I used coconut oil (adds a sweet clean taste, not oily), keep the pan moving (reduces burning), put in 3 kernels with oil (when they pop, you know the oil is hot enough and you can put in the rest), and add butter at the same time as the rest of the kernels.  Sea salt to finish!

It's nice to know what's in your popcorn, you know?  I have yet to use peanut oil--I use vegetable oil instead.  The butter adds a great flavor.  And talk about inexpensive!

Im so glad to see this recipe.  Younger cooks may not even be aware that one could make popcorn any other way than putting a bag in a microwave.  And it is SO much better this way - definitely more FUN - and without the nasty chemical tastes (and smells) that I notice when Im forced to eat nuked popcorn.

Since going to the movie theater for the first time, my 3 yr old has been a popcorn nut. I remember my mom used to make popcorn this way when I was a kid so finally decided to do it the old fashioned way for my son.  He LOVED it. Thanks for sharing and allowing me to share a childhood memory with my son of great popcorn.

Very good and easy.  I think next time I'll use coconut oil, though, because it has a milder flavor.

This is great recipe using coconut oil.  Kadwell should do some research on coconut oil and will find out just how healthy it is :) To make this even more healthful use sea salt.

You can also use virgin Coconut oil---it gives the popcorn an outstanding flavor without adding alot of salt or other seasonings.

Surprisingly when you consider all the stellar reviews, I was not impressed. It tastes like popcorn made by any other method (though the microwave variety contains that processed, fake-butter taste) at home. Because of the temperature the oil reaches, the butter molecules begin to burn, and the kernels were dotted with dark brown. I made both with vegetable oil and with coconut oil as suggested by another reviewer, and noted very little difference, if any, in taste. It's  not bad in any way, just OK, but definitely nothing special.

Basically good but with some variations:  Start with three kernels. When they pop, pour in the rest.  Leave the lid slightly ajar to let moisture out and make popcorn crisper.  You don't need to shake the pan.  Use Popcorn salt or pickling salt (extremely fine).  Yummy.

Ymmmmmie old fashioned popcorn. I use ready packaged for stovetop  or radiant heater type of popcorn cooker rather than microwave from Harlanfairbanks. They use coconut oil and seasoned popcorn salt, as as much or as little of the oil/ salt as you wish.

Who woulda thunk it?  LOL  Using half butter and half coconut oil was amazing.  And like another reviewer mentioned...  coconut oil is no longer considered unhealthy and is in fact the healthiest of oils (do use organic).  I used the 3-kernel system and when they popped I added the balance.  It really does work well to have the fat properly heated.  We topped ours with a good sprinkle of caramel pecan topping from Fireworks Popcorn in Wisconsin.  They have amazing toppings.

This is how popcorn was made before microwaves, air poppers, and the old fashioned popper you plugged in and put butter in the top.   I also remember having a special pan just for popcorn cooking.  That was the best.  Thanks for the memory and the snack for tomorrow!

I've been making this all summer before I finally submitted a review.  It is delicious.  I use coconut oil and usually only about 2 Tbsp, and I'm using blue popcorn that I got at the farmers market.  This may take a couple minutes longer than the microwave, but it's far superior in taste and worth the extra time!  It's very easy, and it really is fabulous.  Brought back great memories from my childhood.

i always cook popcorn on the stovetop.. and i have a popcorn maker designed for use over open fires when we go camping! the best way to stop it from scorching is to have a little water in a nearby sink and just put it in the water long enough to cool it down a little.. but dont leave it long enough to cool off the popcorn.... it has to be hot! thinking of buying one of those whirly pots.. not sure if they work as well as they say though..

I agree with the reviewer who questions why anyone would eat microwave popcorn when it is so easy to make great, much healthier stove-top popcorn.  All one has to do is read the ingredients on the microwave junk to know that it cannot be good for you.  This recipe was wonderful.  I have tried it twice so far; I like to add different flavors.  Once I did it with chili powder and it was delicious.  Another time we used parmesan cheese.  You can do a lot with flavoring.  And I definitely like using a little real butter.

Nostalgic? yes.  Better than microwave? Debatable.  This did taste similar to the oil popped version of my childhood, but if opting for a non-microwaved version for health reasons, I suggest air popped. This tasted heavy and oily to me.

I don't know why anyone would use vegetable oil, or shortening. We use coconut oil here. OTH This is a pretty cool recipe!

I love popcorn this way, I don't even do micro popcorn anymore.  I even sneak it into the movie theater.  This is just right for my new healthy lifestyle.  Sometimes I just use spray butter for flavor.  Thanks.

Very easy, worked great.  I used coconut oil (saturated fats that come from plant sources are OK) and did the 3 kernel first method.  Once it was almost all popped, I dumped out all of the popcorn into a brown paper bag and set the pot with unpopped kernels back over the stove until they had popped too.

This is pretty much the same way I make mine, but I no longer waste my taste buds on yellow popping corn. ALWAYS use white- you will *never go back! White kernels make the popcorn much fluffier and the hull is much smaller and thus not as hard. This is also safer if you are going to feed it to toddlers- less of a choking hazard.

Very Good, I never buy micro-wave corn anymore. Instead of using oils, or butters, I use Bacon Grease. about 2 tablespoons, let it heat up, do the same test, 2-3 kernels at first, then put in the rest and when done; top off with salt and butter. Serve with a big ole glass of cold sweet Iced Tea. That is movie watching.

I agree with the recipe submitter about the artificial ingredients in microwave popcorn, not to mention the use of radiation oven to cook it. I prefer to good ole' stovetop way. I use plain white seeds and olive oil. I sprinkle a bit of salt and some fresh cracked pepper. I even make this to take to the movie theatre with me. It makes a light snack for anytime.

My mom always made us stove top popcorn and therefore that's how I've always made it too. I've never been a big fan of buttered popcorn because it just makes it too mushy and there's normally waaaaaay too much of it. I have to say though that adding the butter to the pan is fantastc and you can adjust the amount to your own liking!!! Thanks for sharing!

I make popcorn with olive oil and add butter. Adding butter to the  pot before popping is an interesting alternative. Olive oil is healthy and imparts a great buttery flavor.

Excellent!  I'd never thought home made popcorn could taste so wonderful and far better than microwave types.  I've used vegetable oil since this is what I've had on hand, but I'll have to try it with the peanut oil sometime.

This has become a family favorite!  My family chooses this over chips or other snacks on a regular basis!  I skip the butter because it always seemed to burn in my Stir Crazy popper.  I also use olive oil & sea salt.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I made this last night, while watching the Oscars with my family. DELICIOUS.  Worked very well in my electric popper. I used 2 TBSP of sunflower oil instead of the peanut oil, and coarse sea salt. Needed just a pinch more salt once popped but nothing else. It will be our "go to" popcorn recipe from now on.

I never caught on to the microwave popcorn craze.  I have my heavy-duty popcorn pan that I have used well over 40 years now.  I use olive oil to pop in and a little real butter to top with.  The flavor is great and healthier than most.

Great! Olive oil works well too and you don't really need the butter IF you use a high quality extra virgin olive oil.

My family loves this recipe---no more microwave popcorn!  Due to nut allergies we use canola oil instead of peanut.  Also, we've used a variety of salt (garlic, onion, seasoning).  Thank you for the recipe!!

I've been making popcorn the old fashioned way for years. The only thing I would add is be sure you use WHITE popcorn kernals. It really tastes better then the yellow corn for some reason. Great recipe, thanks!

I have been using this recipe for a few weeks now and depending on my mood I either use more or less or only butter. You do have to be careful the butter doesn't burn but it's perfect either way.

This was very good.  If you want to try something a little different try adding some butter flavored cooking spray and cajun seasoning.  It gives it a little kick.

Perfect Theater Popcorn taste!!! When ever someone mentions popcorn I think of this recipe, I have always loved to munch on popcorn and I especially love this recipe and so do my kids, as soon as they see me making it all 3 line up with their bowls ready. The peanut oil really gives it a great taste,I love the original recipe but I sometimes leave out the butter and double the popcorn and add 1/4 teaspoon more salt, yummy thank you D.A. mommy for the fabulous recipe!!!!

I love stove top popcorn.  It is just as easy as microwave and it tastes much better.  The peanut oil adds extra flavor and it doesn't cause cancer like the imitation butter flavoring in microwave popcorn.

I've made this but used Piave cheese shaved over it, and just a smidge of salt - Piave is stronger, and salty so that's just a matter of taste - a very decadent party snack. Also I prefer to used authentic popped corn, rather than microwave bagged popcorn. Another trick to make it special is to pop the corn in coconut oil.  MMM

Delicious and easy! I wanted to try this now and didn't have canola oil or butter on hand. I used vegetable oil and margarine instead, it was fluffy, crunchy, buttery and delicious, thanks!

I use a mixture of peanut and coconut oil. Gives it a nice sweet flavor.

Medium high heat is too high, the butter burned. Will stick to the old fashioned tried and true way to pop corn, this was a hot mess!

This was made easily! First time making popcorn, and I thought it was going to turn out wrong but I was wrong. I used this to make caramel corn, so I did not add the butter or salt, which is why it is rated on 4 stars. Don't forget to constantly shake pan. Also, tilt the lid slightly so popcorn doesn't come out tough.

This is good stuff.  There's no reason to subject yourself to all the chemicals in microwave popcorn.  I heated two TBLS cococut oil, and then added a few kernels.  When those popped, I added the rest of the popcorn as well as the salt and butter, let it sit until the popping started, then shook the pan (with lid on) until it was done.  Dump it immediately into a bowl so it doesn't burn and add any additional seasonings to taste.  Easy and delicious!

My mom taught me that you have to vent the popcorn a little. Just lift the lid every so often, or keep it cocked open just a tiny bit. I also empty the popcorn into a paper grocery bag and sprinkle a bit of salt and shake to distribute the salt evenly. pour out into a large bowl. Enjoy!

This is great popcorn!  I used olive oil due to a peanut allergy.  Also used fine popcorn salt, no extra needed. So easy to add the butter before popping.  No soggy popcorn!

I didn't know making homemade popcorn could be so easy! Now that I have made it, I am never going to buy microwave popcorn again! I think everyone should make their popcorn homemade. It tastes a lot better : )  Note: I did make a slight change. I didn't have peanut oil so I used canola oil. The popcorn tasted fantastic! My friend loved it and took half the batch home!

I made popcorn on the stove for my grand daughters and they were fascinated!!  They wanted some of the cheese flavoring sprinkled on top,   but I didn't have any.. so instead decided to try sprinkling the popcorn with  some Cinnamon/sugar and it was a real HIT.  Can't beat the sweet and salty combo!!

I'm the only one in my house who likes popcorn, so whenever I had a craving I would pop some in the micro, and end up throwing out half the bag usually. I never realized how easy it was to pop your own! I love this recipe! Now I can make as little as I want, and it's ready in 5 minutes! I do also recommend coconut oil instead of peanut oil, it is so much better, and is what is used in the movie theater, plus now it's readily available in the supermarket. I don't think that you need to spend extra money to buy premium popcorn, I used the cheap stuff and it worked great!

Genius I never would have thought of putting the butter directly into the pain with the popping kernels but it makes the popcorn perfect with just the right amount of butter and crispiness. I loved making popcorn on the stove before learning this trick but now I will never buy microwave popcorn again ever.

In love! I made this recipe with the same quantities, the only change I made was using canola, I didn't want to go grocery shopping just for oil! This is so good! I can't believe how easy it was. No more microwave popcorn! It has just the right amount of salt and butter. Thank you for posting this. My hubby will love this!

This was pretty good but I prefer to just pop it with oil and salt.  My husband asked if it was leftover from a movie so it achieved what the name states.  It was a little greasy but tasty.

This came out really good.  Definitely better with the peanut oil (I first tried it w/ vegetable oil).  I also lift the lid off the pan about 3 or 4 times during popping, just to let some steam out, and that seems to make a difference for the better too.  The first time I reviewed this I gave it only 4 stars, but now it definiteley rates 5 stars!

absolutely delicious!  my family loves popcorn, but i am very wary of the ingredients in microwave popcorn.  this method takes about the same amount of time, and can be done using 100% organic ingredients.  the butter can also be omitted or lessened to whatever taste you like.  popcorn came out soft with a nice crunch, evenly salted, and not too oily.  perfect for covering with loads of nutritional yeast (which actually sticks to this, unlike microwave popcorn).  thanks for this great recipe!  it makes popcorn a great, healthy choice for a snack!

I had to use vegetable oil the first time I made this as we didn't have peanut oil, but it still turned out great. I have made it several times now. Our whole family loves it. I am even able to use locally grown Iowa popcorn. I'll never microwave again!

I have a stove top popper I use with vegetable oil and instead of adding butter i add johnny's seasoning salt to it! It's delicious and healthy and it even tastes good cold as a next day lunch snack!

This is a great recipe.  It really evenly coats the popcorn with the butter.  I use 1 tbsp coconut oil and 3 tbsp butter. It's a wonderful and cheap snack my kids and I eat nearly every day.

This was perfect! Tasted just like movie theater popcorn. I took the advice of a another review and used 1 Tbsp oil/4 Tbsp butter, and it was great. I also used vegetable oil because I had nothing else, and it turned out just fine. Thanks for the sharing!

I make stove-top popcorn all the time, but this recipe perfects the process!  I do use olive oil, even with the risk of it burning.  I love the idea of adding salt and butter (I used Smart Balance, though)while it cooks.  I always throw in a kernel while the oil heats and when it pops I know to add the popcorn.  The butter and salt must have some effect because the popcorn didn't start popping for awhile, whereas it always has done so when I just used oil.  This is the most evenly salted and flavored popcorn ever!  Thanks for the great idea!

This is by far the best popcorn recipe I've come across! It has lots of flavor without being too greasy and stays nice and crisp. I followed the ingredients list, but divided the recipe in half, which was just enough for two. This is a keeper and I will make it again.

used slightly over 1 tablespoon coconut oil and 2 tablespoons butter.  can probably cut back a bit as it was a bit on the greasier side but it actually really does taste like movie theatre popcorn when I was a kid.  I'm kind of afraid to find out what they're actually making the popcorn with now :(. I think probably 1/2 to 3/4 tablespoon coconut oil will be enough.  and yes heating oils will create trans fat so it's best to use a saturated fat oil which is more heat tolerant.  giant jar of coconut oil from Costco for cheap.

Why are people giving 5 star reviews when they didn’t follow the recipe as written? I did, and ended up with burnt (as in black) butter on all the popcorn. Next time I’d add butter at the start of the popping maybe.

Look no further! This is the only recipe you’ll ever need to make popcorn. I used two tablespoons of both coconut oil and butter, placed in pot on medium-high heat. I placed 5 kernels in the pot, with some salt , and waited until they popped and then put in the remaining 1/2 cup in. Shake, shake, shake until pops are 2 seconds apart.

The perfect pop!
I have never used this method of adding butter/salt before the kernels pop.
I used grapeseed oil, threw 3 kernels in, once popped added butter/salt and rest. 
Even my hubs who isn't a huge popcorn guy liked the balance of flavors. Great snack!

This is my new favorite way to make popcorn.  Not even close to being low calorie, but it tastes way better than what I was making with my air popper.

I always make mine this way! Nothing is better! I only use blue popcorn and cook It in a whirley pop, it is much crunchier and tastier than the funny name brand! Hoosier Hill Farms Persian Blue from Amazon has worked best for me!

Followed the recipe according to directions. My popcorn burned and the house stunk will stick with the recipe I usually use.  Ended up throwing it out and opening the windows to air out the house.

Thought the butter didn't help this. I make it in a heavy pot with oil and seasoned salt. I thought the butter would be good but I didn't taste it. I guess I just like it melted and poured on.

This beats 'waving popcorn, and buying pre-made, hands down! Adding the butter & salt  during the cooking is so much easier.

I've been making my own popcorn for years. The best pot to use is a wok with a glass lid.  I may make it exactly as this recipe goes, or with canola oil rather then peanut oil, and I may add Italian seasoning, grated or shredded Parmesan cheese,  or any of a number of other herbs or spices, or just as is. One of my favorite things to add after the popcorn has popped is fresh ground black pepper.
