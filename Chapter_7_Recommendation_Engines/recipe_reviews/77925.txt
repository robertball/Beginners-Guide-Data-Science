I sautéed an onion in the saucepot first and then added the stock and tomatoes. Rather than waiting for the chicken stock to reduce by 1/3 I drained the tomatoes to save time and I did also use closer to ¼ cup pesto. The hand blender worked perfectly to puree it right in the pot and the soup was delicious! Perfect for a rainy day! Next time I might have it with a grilled cheese sandwich and garnish with some fresh basil.

While this is very good, it is also a fairly common tomato soup recipe with the standard chicken broth, tomatoes and cream.  It's certainly easy to throw together in a pinch with pantry staples, but if you want to really make this special use homemade chicken broth (I had some in the freezer), homemade marinara (also in my freezer, put up from my garden) and heavy cream rather than the half and half.  I did use the half and half this time for comparison's sake and found that the soup is just not as good as it is with rich, heavy cream - and for some reason it even looks better made with cream too!  Loved the pesto swirl at the end -again, I used homemade that I'd frozen. Reducing the chicken broth really isn't necessary, and I don't add the cream until after the tomatoes and broth have simmered a bit.  Great soup for little time and effort.

Excellent! Used Caldo de Pollo dried to make the chicken stock, and had accidently bought cans of pureed tomato so didn't even need to use the blender at all. Wonderful flavor and *so* fast. Yum-O!

Excellent, and so simple! I used my own basil pesto, which I keep in small jars in the freezer. I also prefer to puree the soup and THEN add cream when I return the soup to the pan. I added the pesto to the pan vs. each bowl. 

My husband's favorite soup now!

Such a yummy soup! Heres what I did different:
I cooked some onion and garlic in the pot before adding the chicken broth. Let that simmer for maybe 15-20 minutes or so. I then added a can of homemade tomatoes and a can of condensed soup. I let that simmer for another 10 minutes to let it thicken up. I ran it through the blender to take out the chunks and then added the half and half. I also used much more pesto then what the recipe calls for. I stirred it right into the pot rather then spooning it out into the bowls...probably about a 1/4 cup or so. Turned out delicious! I served it with toasted chicken salad sandwiches for lunch.

Great Creamy Tomato Soup Recipe.  Just what I was looking for... I added some Garlic Pepper to it to give it a little more taste and used Whipping Cream instead to make it richer.

absoultely amazing i used this entire recipe the only thing i changed was that i changed was that i used a cup of whipped cream instead of the half and half. my 10 yr old son is a vegetarian and loves the tom. soup he cant tell it has chicken broth in it something u can change to have a richer taste (even though i dont do it if my son eats it) is that u can use chix stock instead of broth. this soup is amazing w french bread to dip or croutons in it if u like the bread in it. the pesto gives it an extra kick this is the first thing i have ever cooked off of here and its a must try.....

we fixed this recipe ALOT. instead of half and half we used grated cheese curd. that was a wondeful addition. we would also recommend more pesto. another change we made was putting orzo into the soup. it was a bit thin so we thought orzo might spice it up a bit. it sure did! definetly put orzo into this, it adds SO much to the flavor. best of all, this soup was fast and easy!!! we will definetly make this again!!

Very easy to prepare and tasty.  I used fat-free half & half in this recipe and it came out great.  I did not add the pesto.  I will make this again for guests.

This soup is amazing! Like another reviewer I did not wait for the chicken stock to reduce, just drained liquid from one can of tomatoes and it turned out fantastic! I also added some celery salt which added a ton of flavor and some dried basil. Also diced up some onion before blending. It was sooo good, I will definitely make this again.

I wanted a cream of tomato soup for a mid-day meeting, so I made the soup the night before and then kept it warm all morning, and stirred in the half-and-half and pesto right before serving.  I thought it was excellent and received numerous compliments.

Delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added the pesto to the tomato mixture before adding the half and half.  I also used fat free half and half to save on calories.  This is so much better than canned soup, it doesn't even compare.  Sure it's a little more work, but it's worth it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, added about 1/4C parmesan cheese to the pot, more like a 1/4C or so of basil pesto and coarsely crushed black pepper.  It was pretty runny for a tomato soup, so I added 1TB of cornstarch mixed with 1TB of water to thicken it up.  Pretty good.

Wonderful! Only warning, I substituted whole milk for the cream(Cream is much better, just didn't have any in the house). If you also happen to substitute, do not add milk until soup has cooled. Otherwise you'll have curdled milk.

The soup curdled.  It seems like everyone is happy with this recipe, and I followed it exactly against my better thoughts that cold cream added to hot soup would in fact curdle.  I don't understand why this didn't happen to anyone else?  The soup is also sort of thin even though I held back juice from one can of tomatos (the only change I made).  Frustrating.

Super easy and good!  This did turn out thin so after blending it I threw it back in the pan and added a cornstarch/water mix.  It thickened up nicely.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe!  My husband raves about it!  My own "tweaks" to this recipe are to add the pesto (I preferred sundried tomato pesto to green pesto) while the soup is heating and before adding the cream.  Also, as I didn't have canned tomatoes with garlic and onion, I added roughly 1/2 an onion and 2 garlic cloves before blending.  Thanks for a great recipe, DASKDS!

Great, easy soup! I decided not to blend mine at the last minute (surprise!), so I added just a little cornstarch mixed with water to bind it a bit. I would  probably not reduce the chicken broth next time, as the soup got a little salty for me. Still, excellent busy workday meal with Parmesan & Basil Chicken Salad from this site. Thanks for the recipe!

This wasn't bad.  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  I don't know if I will make it again, it is runny and I like a thicker tomato soup.  I did like the flavor that the pesto added to the soup.  I think I will make a different recipe (I like the Rich and Creamy Tomato Basil Soup recipe on this site) and add some pesto.  Thanks for the idea!

Very tasty soup! The only thing I added was a bit of parmesan cheese at the end for a bit more flavor. It gave it a nice touch when paired with the basil flavor of the pesto. My soup was a little more watery than I would've liked but I used 2 18 oz cans of diced tomatoes rather than 2 14.5 oz cans, so there may have been more juice as a result. Overall a very quick, easy, and tasty tomato soup!

Not the most popular soup with the testers, but the classroom team liked this one. You do need to be a pesto fan to enjoy this, maybe that was the key.

Good soup that seems to taste better after marinating as a left over. 
I like onions, so as the soup was simmering I sauted 1/2 onion that I then added to the soup after it went into the food processor.
I've made this recipe in 2 different ways- 1st way was processing the tomatoes and then adding it to the broth and half & half. The 2nd way was as the recipe says to do it, processing it all at the end.  The 2nd method is definitely better, as the half and half is homogenized this way.

I don't even like tomato soup, but I decided to give this a try for the family.  It was delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I added a bit more pesto and used zesty seasoned salt to taste instead of salt and pepper.

Thanks for sharing.  This will be a staple from now on.

I liked this - my husband did not.  I think he liked the taste of it, but the texture turned him off because it's not as smooth and creamy as canned soup.  I really liked the addition of the pesto.  I will probably just do canned soup next time because of it's simplicity and just add pesto to it, and maybe some half & half.  I did add the pesto to the whole pot instead of individual servings, but served each bowl with a bit of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Amazing and easy. If I want to make it faster, without waiting for the stock to cook down, and bullion cubes to the stock with out extra water for the cubes. My husband didn’t like tomato soup until I made this for him.

I sautéd the onions and garlic, used a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes and an extra can of tomato sauce. For the final summer, I added a package of cheese & spinach tortellini. I topped it with some feta. Delicious dinner!

Didn't love it.  Should have pureed the tomatoes BEFORE I put them into the pan.  Also, the half and half curdled from the acid in the tomatoes, and I didn't know how to counteract that except for tempering the half and half (which I did.)

Fan-Freakin-Tastic. Wicked easy! I had homemade chicken broth and had just canned my garden tomatoes. I had fresh garlic and onion. Minced/chopped those. Had a jar (sorry cooks!) pesto itching to be used up. Finished off soup with immersion blender. OMG!! I will NEVER - EVER eat canned tomato soup again. Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicious flavor, except the sodium content is off the charts. I did sub for 'no salt added' canned tomatoes and broth, and used a low fat plain yogurt to replace the 1/2 and 1/2.

Very yummy with a few tweaks: added 3T minced onion, 1T seasoning salt, 1t garlic powder, upped basil pesto to 3T, substituted whole milk Greek yogurt for cream (its all I had but it worked well!), I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of 2 cans diced (so I could skip the blending). I also added about 2 cups leftover white rice and some fresh shredded Parmesan. Super quick, easy, and DELICIOUS.

Well received at lunch today, so much so, everyone wanted the recipe! I added fresh tomatoes, so I put in a bit of salt and sugar. Also, I used one can of Fire Roasted tomatoes instead of garlic, so I just added some garlic powder. Also took the advice of another reviewer and added 2 tbsp of orzo, and added the pesto in before blending. I blended it before I added the cream. 
Served with broiled cheesy ciabatta bread slices. Just a wonderful lunch!

We thought it tasted great. Probably depends on your brand of pesto I would think (and tomatoes, too). I changed the method a little bit, added some onions and garlic bc you can never have too many of those, used fat free half & half off the heat so it wouldn't curdle, etc. All in all this came out to be very tasty and very low cal with my changes so I think this one will go in the "lean" rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I am going to make this again, but by substituting half and half with whole cream. I wanted the soup to be a little more creamy. It will be more fattening, but I am sure it will be worth it.

I did this for my child, left out the pesto and sauteed onions/garlic first. My daughter loved it at age 9, it was simple and not too flavorful, for adults I found it too watery.

Doubt I'll make it again due to the fact that the canned tomato taste was overpowering. The secondary taste was chicken broth. No amount of onion or garlic powder could overcome those two flavors.

The soup is great on its own but I put my own spin on it. I boiled some orzo and added it after the fact to give the soup a little texture. Also added a little pesto for flavor. To top it off, which is easily the best part. I made a couple grilled cheese sandwiches and cut them into tiny squares to use as croutons. It's amazing and I suggest you try it. Thanks!

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet!  I make this often (at least two to three times a month!) and separate into single serving containers so my hubby can take them to work with him.  It's a super easy and delicious recipe that I occasionally change up with different spices.

I think this is a pretty good recipe, but I found myself wanting more tomato flavor so I added about a half a can of tomato paste.  This thickened the soup nicely and also added the extra tomatoey kick I was looking for.

I thought this was too sour.  I added some sugar and tarragon in addition to what was called for, but it was still too sour.

The whole family went crazy over this and it was so easy to make. Goes great with grilled cheese sandwiches!

Overall, a very yummy dish.  I like the addition of pesto to give a little zip to the tomato soup.  However, I like tomato soup from the can just as well, so next time I will save the labor and use canned tomato soup.  But thanks for the pesto suggestion!
