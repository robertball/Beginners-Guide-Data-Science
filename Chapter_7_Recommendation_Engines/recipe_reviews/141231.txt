Taking suggestions from others, I used two 9 inch pans and two crusts. We choose a pound of lean mild pork saugage to crumble and brown and put on top of the cheeses and parsley. This one pound was plenty for two dishes. It also ensured sausage in every bite. The egg and milk was not enough for two pies, so I increased the eggs to 7 and the milk to 2 cups.

We used one and half large gala apples, snacking on the remaining apples while we waited on the quiche to bake.

Because I used disposbale pie pans I placed them on a large jellyroll pan in the oven. When I reduced the heat I also put a crust shield  (folded aluminum foil) around the pies to keep them from over drying and browning. It took about 15 minutes longer in our oven, which could be due to the extra pan under the pies and having two in the oven simultaneously.

The quiche was very good. It had a sweet savory flavor that was accented by the salty crust and cheese.

Bravo! This recipe has become the focal point of my favorite breakfast (with whole grain blueberry muffins and a bowl of fresh fruit).  There just couldn't be a prettier dish to set on the breakfast table in the morning, and the unique combination of flavors is a fun surprise for everyone.  I've made it...oh, probably 35 or 40 times in the past year, and although it sometimes doesn't set up as well as I would like (maybe depending on the varying moisture content of the apples and/or the cheese?), it always tastes so good that no one cares!  Even people who are skeptical of quiche have been enthusiastic.  I have made a couple of minor changes: Since it certainly doesn't need the sausage for its protein or fat content, I just sprinkle 1/4 pound of browned turkey sausage into the bottom of the crust -- just enough to get some in every bite for the flavor.  When I use a commercial frozen deepdish crust, I also cut the milk back to 1 cup; but in my own crust in a 10" pie plate, the full amount is perfect (but takes about 10 extra minutes in the oven).

This was really delicious!  My husband picked out the recipe and I made it for him and my in-laws ("foodie" people).  I tried making it in a 9" pie plate and had some trouble fitting all the links in, so I would recommend the 10" plate as per the directions.  We used the Original flavor links, but I would definitely try it with the Maple.

This is so delicious!  I love quiche and I'm always looking for new recipes - this one is definitely a keeper!  I only made a few slight changes: I used 2 chicken apple sausage links instead (6 oz.), shredded asiago cheese instead of swiss, and half of a Granny Smith apple.  It took a little longer to bake...I baked it for 20 minutes at 425 degrees then I reduced the temperature to 350 and covered the crust with aluminum foil so the edges wouldn't burn and baked for another 20-30 minutes.

my friends fought over the next piece then warred over the next quiche...(personally though i'm not a lover of any of my dishes).I made two quiches by going by someone else's review...7 medium eggs is perfect.  i used 1 tsp of sugar and salt. about a tsp of basil pesto (cos i didn't have parsley).  i used a lb. of reduced fat pork sausage instead of the links and i cooked a chopped granny smith and seasoned this w/pepper, some cayenne, and garlic.  i think i could ended up having just about enough of the sausage/apple for a third quiche.  I also only used a bag of preshredded mozzarella and had some left...but next time i'll use it all.  Works well, like i said they loved it and want more :)

I don't like vegetable quiches, but this one was great! I used cheddar cheese (I'm not a fan of swiss), plain sausages, and a golden delicious apple, and it turned out great. Next time I may add more herbs (I like lots). I got 2 frozen deep-dish pie crusts filled with just one recipe. If you use frozen pue crust, don't pre-bake.

It fine once it was on a plate but getting it there was a real hassel.   I think "Bob Evans", or whoever actually wrote this recipe, was dealing with a much deeper pie dish.  In short be careful when adding the liquid because there just might not be enough room.

Awesome flavor!  Used moz cheese.  Cut open sausages and crumbled them when they cooked.  Used 7 eggs and 2 c milk.  Made one with crust and one without and I think it was better without the crust (in a greased pie pan).

I took this to a potluck and it was a hit, I had none left to bring back home.  As others suggested, I did increase the eggs to 7, and used a pound of ground maple sausage, which made the ingredients perfect for 2 - 9" pie plates.  I certainly plan on making this again.

Very good. My family loved it! I have a 5 year old and 2 year old who don't hardly like anything and they were sneaking pieces of the leftovers.  I cut the sausage up so I could have enough for two quiches and there was sausage in every bite.  I also sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top. We will definitely be using this recipe again.

I think this would taste much better with cheddar cheese in place of the swiss and parmesan. I'll try that next time.

UPDATE: Made this again for my family. My dad liked it. I don't think the apples are really necessary, and kinda took away from the overall tastiness of the quiche. 12/25/2007 Took it over to a friend's for Christmas Brunch, it was great.

We thought this was pretty good.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh because I didn't have it on hand.  I used a Granny Smith apple.

I have gestational diabetes so I can't have pie crust. I made a potato crust instead. We also had a somewhat deep, glass pie dish so we used that. I shredded 4 small white skinned potatoes, mixed in 3tbsp of margarine, s&p, and nuked them for 5 minutes. I find this helps make them crispier when baked. I pressed them into the dish, bottom and sides, and put them in the oven for about 10 mins while we were preparing the rest of the dish. First time we tried this out, it had a nice buttery potato flavor which of course goes great with eggs. The sides were browned nice, the bottom not so much but it really did hold everything together. So definitely going to use this and tweak it for all future quiche recipes. 

We had Spolumbo's Chicken Apple sausage, took it out of the casing and cooked up 3 of them. Chopped up one Golden Delicious apple. We liked having chunks of sausage and apple rather then slices/whole. I used dried parsely cause thats what we had on hand. 1 cup of homo milk and 4 eggs fit perfectly in the dish. We also had Kraft Italiano shredded cheese and used that instead. We did everything else according to the recipe and it turned out amazing! So simple and so good, and I had great levels after. My husband and I had this for supper and ate half of the quiche. Had the other half for breakfast the next morning as well. With that said, I think it truly serves 4 people if you aren't having anything else with it.

This recipe calls for WAY too much milk.  After an hour and 10 minutes in the oven, there was still liquid sloshing around, but my crust was almost burned.  This might be a good combo of flavors, but I won't be able to tell since it never set up.

I've made a *lot* of quiches, and never had trouble with one setting up...they're so forgiving!

I really liked this recipe.  I made a few changes: I used 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup mozzarella instead of 3/4 cup swiss.  I cut the sausage to 8 oz and used Italian sauage and used only half of a green apple.  I also omitted the chives.  It took a full 45 minutes to cook but it was worth it.  Just enough spice to be good but not overpowering.  Will definitely make again.

Ok, but not great.  I like the flavors of apple and sausage, but it just didn't work well in this quiche.  I won't make it again.

I liked this a lot. I did use bulk sausage. I split the filling into 2 pie crusts (not necessary) so my apples didn't really have anything to sink into. In the future I will add another diced apple into the filling because I want apples in every bite. Thanks for another keeper quiche recipe!

I used what I had on hand - elk breakfast sausage which I browned and then added to the pie shell.  Sprinkled on chopped scallions and medium cheddar cheese.  Covered with the egg mixture (1 cup of milk), arranged the Gala apple slices around the outside edge pressing them down and baked as directed.  This came out perfectly and was a hit with my husband and boys - a definite "Do-over"!
