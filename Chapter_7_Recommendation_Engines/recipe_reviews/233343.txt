This was super fast, simple and excellent. It reheats nicely too. I used Hormel chili because that is the best in my opinion.  I made as written and added sliced olives because we love them. The one thing that would make this recipe even easier is to buy the chili with beans instead to buying chili without beans and then adding black beans to it. Just a thought.

Tasted great, I used 1/2 minced onions instead so it was even easier than the recipe said. I'm not sure if it was because I used a glass pan, but I did have to have it in the oven for about 15 minutes more than estimated. Finding gluten free recipes is tough, and since I can eat gluten but my husband can't, it's hard to find something we both really like...but we both really liked this one!
