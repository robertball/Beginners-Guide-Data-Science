MMMM....right up my alley, a tuna/egg salad sandwich. I left out the rosemary and the sour cream and it was still yummy!

Sorry but this was horrid. I turned my nose up when I added the rosemary, and threw it away once I mixed in the tuna. I'm just glad I was making it for one, and only wasted half a can of tuna. Thanks anyway.
