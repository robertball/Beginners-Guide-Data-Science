These were really good. I did grill them on an outside gas grill but that was the only change I made. These are VERY meaty and sure to please that meat loving man in your life. Great recipe!

I made half with lean beef and the other half with lean ground turkey for my hubby’s heart healthy diet. I toasted Pepperidge Farm Soft White Hamburger Buns and added green leaf lettuce and tomato.

Since it was just for the 2 of us I only made 1/4 of the recipe. I added an egg white and probably more mushrooms than what the recipe called for. I also used 90% lean ground beef and didn t add salt. (Trying to follow the DASH diet.) Topped each burger with a slice of Swiss cheese and served them open-faced (half a bun). They were yum!

Fabulous - I chose this recipe to help stretch my beef a little further as i only had one pound and it was great. I did add an egg to the mixture to help with binding everything together and am so glad I did. I m sure if I d had 2 lbs I wouldn t have needed it but it really did help. My 2 teenaged boys with giant appetites loved this recipe. Will definitely make again

I like to use lean ground beef for burgers but they are dry if cooked well done which is needed for safety. this recipe makes burgers that are juicy and very tasty. I left out the italian seasoning because I didn't want them to taste like meatballs but otherwise followed the recipe. I cooked them in my air fryer and they were perfect.
