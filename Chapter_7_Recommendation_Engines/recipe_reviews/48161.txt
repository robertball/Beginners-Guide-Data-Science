Great drink! - It tastes pretty much like a long island iced tea (one of my all time favorites)! They go down very easy. Honestly there's so much alcohol in these things things you really can't tell the difference between this and a long island and by the time you're done with it who cares anyway......

Good taste but nothing special or out of the ordinary.

Pretty good, though I preferred a bit more cola flavor so I kicked it up a bit.  It is silly that the alcohol is listed in fluid ounces yet the cola and sweet-and-sour are listed in cups.

BTW  - 1/4 cup = 2 fl oz

And for my taste I made the cola be in the range of 3 1/2 to 4 fl oz
