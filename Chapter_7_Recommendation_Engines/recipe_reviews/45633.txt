We substituted oranges and oj instead, and used a bit less of the sweetened condensed milk, it turned out like a creamsicle!

This is a quick and easy recipe to use with an ice cream maker. I prefer a less sweet flavor, so I increased the amount of lemon juice to 3 lemons, and reduced the milk.

This is yummy! I was worried it would be too sweet as the other reviews said, but I found it perfect. This was my first attempt with my new Ice Cream Maker. It reminds me of a lemon cream dessert my gran used to make at xmas time.

I used 3 sm lemons but forgot to zest (duh) till after I trashed the rinds.  Thus found it light on lemon flavor so I added 1.5 t. lemon extract.  Will play with this to get a standard juice amt and probably add another cup of milk.  Was good alone but fantastic served with raspberries and blueberries on top. Tweak Edit: I had half a can of sweetened milk to use and though of this recipe. I only had 2 lemons, juiced 2 and zested 1. Half can of sc milk, 1 cup of ff half and half, 1/2 cup whole milk.  DD liked it MUCH better this way for eating alone, less chalky. I think 4 juiced and 2 zested would suit our sour tastes better and next time I'll double my tweaks because it makes a tasty and cool treat in the heat.

Not as smooth tasting as I would have liked, but a great recipe using minimal ingredients I usually have on hand.  Even my picky son said it was good!

So good!!  My family loved it...even the pickiest of the picky!!  I never seem to use my icecream maker so it was great to get some mileage out of it. I can't imagine the taste of this dessert with strawberry syrup covering it but I guess to each his own?

Creamy not icey! I really wanted to like this recipe but found it "sour" as opposed to "tart".  I don't know why it surprised me but it is lemon and milk.  My ingredients were fresh.  To make this to our liking, Hubby added Hershey's strawberry syrup to his, and I made an orange float out of mine.  Very good this way so all was not lost!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, jem, I wish we had liked it with no changes.

Made for Mothers Day and everyone loved it. I did use zest of 2 lemons and the juice of both of them, everything else the same. I served it with blueberries and lemon sugar. Not a drop was left.

Made exactly as recipe states in ice cream maker. Consistency was perfect but flavor was awful - like sour milk. I often make homemade ice cream but this just did not taste good.

This tasted like condensed milk at first, but came out super thick and creamy. I added some more lemon juice and it tasted really good.

This was so easy to put together.  I agree with Shorecook that there was a smidgeon of a sour taste to the ice cream, but I expected that with lemons and milk.  I kept the ingredients as cold as possible,  and mixing them just before adding them to the ice cream maker.  I thought this rated four stars, but my husband loved it and said it was a cross between sherbet and ice cream and gave it five stars.  I made it to serve with a lemon pound cake.  They made a perfect dessert.
