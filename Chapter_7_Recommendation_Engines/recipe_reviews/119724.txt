This was really good. We didn't have enough  nectarines, so I used half nectarines and half plums (blanched to remove the skins). I added 1/3 cup flour and I'm really glad I did because the fruit was extremely juicy; I think it would've been pretty runny otherwise. I didn't have any macaroons so I substituted 3/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/3 cup butter, combined. I think this would be great with nearly any kind of fruit added to the nectarines and blueberries.

Pretty tasty, though the berries got really runny and saucy. So next time, I might throw in some corn starch or something to firm that up. I didn't use crushed macaroons, as I hate them, so I just made more topping with the oatmeal. I should make more of that too next time. But all in all, a good recipe with plenty of wiggle room to personalize it up some.

Loved this!  Made with white peaches, didn't have macaroons so did what first reviewer recommended, then added some quick cook oats, some coconut, and the egg white.  Really a phenomenal taste, people were moaning as they ate it :)

Couldn't find macaroons at the grocery store but I was dead set on making cobbler so I used cinnamon graham crackers instead, and it turned out so good!  I was also over at a friends and she had made a cobbler using ginger snaps for the crumb topping which was awesome and would definitely work in place of macaroons too.  I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup because my nectarines were really ripe and sweet to begin with.  Can't wait to try it with apples or maybe some mixed berries.  Yum!

Pretty much followed the recipes, except I used graham cracker crumbs in stead of the macaroons. I think the macaroons would have been better, but I just didn't have any.  This is a great, lower fat recipe for those summer fruits.  My kids aren't huge fans of fruity desserts, and after a few days, the crisp part was a bit gummy.  This would be a great recipe for a block party or get together.
