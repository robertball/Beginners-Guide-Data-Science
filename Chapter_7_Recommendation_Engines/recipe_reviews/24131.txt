This recipe needed a few alterations for success. I took the advice of some of the previous reviews and made the following changes ;I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter, as well as a 1/4 cup of canola oil. I chopped the rhubarb quite fine, and used thin stalks. I did not use the topping in the recipe, but used a 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1 tsp of cinnamon, mixed and sprinkled on top. Lastly, I seriously question the cooking temp. Most muffins seem to be in the 400*F range, and I found them still very undercooked following the recipes directions for time and temp. I had to cook them an additional 8 min. at 400*F. After all that.....it was a good muffin! With these changes I will use it again.

I think this is a successful non-fat muffin, with a couple of considerations. First, as with any muffin, chop the fruit small. As my rhubarb was already sliced into 1/8"-1/4" slices, cutting largest ones in half or thirds was tedious but worth it. Second, for more taste, I used some oat "flour" in the batter: I whirled 1 cup of Quick oats in food-processor, and substituted it for white flour (about 1/2 c.?)  Third, I'll add a bit more salt next time: 1 1/4 tsp or 1 1/2 tsp. I also thought that the lack of a fat in the recipe might have been a mistake, but when you look at it as a non-fat recipe, it is good! My topping didn't melt (did I use too little butter?) but did end up looking like chunks of crushed ice perched on the muffin tops. I think I'll just sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar next time.

I made these for a friend who is lactose intolerant and on a low-sugar diet. So I used Alpro vanilla soymilk instead of buttermilk and Stevia natural sweetener instead of sugar (available from health shops). They came out a little dry but still good.

This is a very moist and delicious muffin. I did do a couple of changes to the recipe. I added 1/2 white sugar and for the topping I used 1/4 brown sugar instead of the 1/2 of white sugar. I baked the muffins at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Turned out great, thank you for the recipe Michele!

These taste good but are very messy. They overflowed the muffin tins and the topping went everywhere. I might try eliminating the topping and putting a little oil/butter in the muffin plus a little more sugar.

Very good! I scaled the recipe to 8 servings and still came out with 12 normal size muffins... UPDATE 7/14: got 15 muffins out of the batch this time. I left out the walnuts. Took more like 30 minutes to bake.

The muffins didn't turn out as I expected - very heavy - not cake-like.

Isn't it odd that this doesn't contain any oil or butter?  The topping was too much and melted off of the muffins and all over my pan and oven.  Taste of muffins would be enhanced by some sort of oil or shortening---a bit dry.

Very moist! I loved the topping. It did make a bit of mess as the topping spilled over while they were baking but who cares! Very easy and quick to make. I would leave out the walnuts next time though - not a big walnut fan.

These had a good flavor, but the sugar/ butter topping was too much.  It made the muffins too moist to keep well & spilled out on the muffin tin.  I thought they were actually pretty easy to make!

These were okay.  We discovered we prefer rhubarb pie, crunch or coffee cake to muffins.

I should have read the reviews before I made these muffins. You definitely need the chop the rhubarb finely, otherwise it's just not really a muffin. The flavors are ok but could use some spicing up. Also it is way too dry for a muffin batter and could use some more baking soda or powder.

This recipe is quite good.  It should be noted to chop rhubarb finely.  My husband didn't care for the sugar topping - too sugary. The texture of the muffin is quite nice.

I am only a moderate lover of rhubarb, but my mouth watered when I ate these!  I did leave out the walmuts, and I was able to make 18!  If you stretch to 1 1/2 dozen, that helps on the overflow.  I will make these again for sure!

Like the reviewer above me, I really wanted to like this recipe, also.  I thought it was very bland. However, I didn't put the topping on; maybe that would have made a difference but I doubt it.  If someone wanted to try this recipe, I would suggest cutting back on the amount of rhubarb (2 cups would be enough), chope the rhubarb fine, and increase the brown sugar to one cup, or add 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I would also increase the cinnamon.  I most likely will not make this again.

At first I didn't like these muffins. I ate one as soon as is was cool enough to bare and they were quite slimy. The next morning, however, the exact same muffins were great! I love this recipe. I'm going to try to change the topping a bit, but otherwise they are fantastic.

I wanted to like this, i really did.. no oil and low sugar and a few good reviews, i thought i'd hit the jackpot. Alas... i found them heavy and bland punctuated by huge lumps of too-sour rhubarb. My son found them inedible. Maybe i didn't chop the rhubarb finely enough? Maybe i shouldn't have omitted the sugar topping? I didn't like the basic taste/texture enough to bother trying again with "tweaks". Too bad. :(

Great tasting muffin.  Yes the topping is a little messy but I always use paper muffin cups and it wasn't an issue.  I made sure to chop the rhubarb quite fine and press the mixture into the cups gently to fill. I used less sugar than required about 1/3 cup for the topping.
