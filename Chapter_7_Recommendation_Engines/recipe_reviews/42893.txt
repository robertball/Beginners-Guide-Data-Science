I had my predominately Hispanic Foods students make this and they all LOVED it.  They cooked it from start to finish in under 90 minutes (including clean-up).  I altered the directions by cooking the carrots until almost tender before adding the potatoes to avoid mushy potatoes. Fresh chiles, with varying degrees of heat, are abundant in our area so we used fresh in lieu of canned.  I think it really made the dish stand out.  We also increased the amount of broth to make it more soup-like and added shredded cheddar on top to garnish.

This was easy to make, I put it in the crock pot after browning the meat with the onion.  I also added some jalapeno pepper for extra flavor.  Makes a hearty meal with some corn tortillas.

This is good; I love the use of hominy!  I realized that it was going to need 'something', so I added some adobo seasoning, garlic, and some cumin.  Oh, I also added a ton of cilantro and red pepper.  My husband and kids loved it.

This makes enough to feed a small army.  I served it to about 20 people (with sandwiches).  They seemed to like it and some gave lots of compliments.  I thought it was kind of plain. After I made it and tasted, I added about 2 Tbsp. cumin and extra chili powder, salt and pepper.   This perked it up a bit.

I have made this recipe twice, first with alterations and now following it exactly. Interestingly, the first, modified version turned out better. Instead of putting the potatoes into the stew I served it over mash with cheese on top and that created more depth to the recipe. Today, making the actual dish, it turned out rather bland. Still ok, but not spectecular.

This was awsome!  I did change a little as my husband and I enjoy things more as a soup than a stew.  I drained the grd. bf., then added a touch of water to season with the chili powder. I also added a C of water and used 3 cans of beef broth, not 3 C., cut down the potatoes to 3 large size, and used 1 package of hot chili powder (we like it hot)!  Fabulous w/ warm tortillas.

My husband and I enjoyed this stew. It's an interesting variation of vegetable beef soup. We enjoyed the chili powder and canned chilies. Definitely not too hot. It could stand more heat if you like hot stuff.

WOW this make a ton of food and I cut most of the recipe in half. I only used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1 onion, 1 can chickpeas in place of the hominy, and 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and one can chicken broth, leaving everything else how the recipe stated, leaving out the 2 cans of diced green chiles since my diced tomatoes had jalapenos in them. I had to add a little water because the chicken broth wasn't enough to fill the pan with liquid. This is so good with a corn muffin crumbled on top. This woudl be awesome in the winter time!! Thanks for the great recipe. Oh yeah I did add a can of whole kernel corn, since it is hopi CORN stew!

Very tasty.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I thought at first it would be too spicy with the full can of chillies, but it was not at all.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe and used ground venison.  Other than adding some minced garlic while browning the meat and onions, I prepared the stew as directed.  I love hominy, and I can't imagine this stew being as good without it.

Delicious!  I only had 2 lbs ground beef, so added 4 small zucchini sliced thick to make up. Did also add whole cumin seeds while sauteing beef.  Makes a ton!

I want everyone to realize that while they are adding ingredients they are changing the traditional recipe.  In the "American" world this is not important.  But in the "Indian" world it is very important.  This is the reason the author pointed out that the recipe dated back to the 20's or 30's and that you could use venison or buffalo as was used back then.  And by the way is very lean and tastes great! Remember the Hopi didn't have the all spices we now have.

I created this Stew using venison that my husband harvested this hunting season.  I did not have any luck finding Hominy.  I live in upstate New York and could not find it in the local Walmart, Tops Market, or local non-commerical grociers.  

I made it using corn as a substitute.

I just made this tonight.  First off, it makes WAY more than 12 servings... more like 25!!!  The flavor is really good and reminds me of a hamburger stew my aunt makes.  I would probably add more hominy and take away 2 potatoes (or more).  I also added 2 Tbsp. garlic powder to the stew as well as about 3 cups more liquid; 1 cup beef broth and 2 cups water.  This is a really great stew for a cold winter night.  I will definitely make this again; Thanks!!!

This is a really good starting recipe, but it needs stuff!  I added a lot of garlic extra chili powder, cayenne pepper, dried chili flakes, and cumin. I also added veggies, green beans, peas and corn to make it go farther and have more veggie servings.   I also like a little more broth so I added an extra can of beef broth.

This is a wonderful basic recipe to make your own. Other reviewers have mentioned their additions and I have also made my own additions and subtractions. It is a very versatile recipe using hominy and has become a favorite in our home.

I needed to make this with ingredients on-hand, and I had no hominy, so I used frozen kernal corn. Also only had two pounds ground beef. Turned out really good. I had read other reviews, so knew to kick up the spices to 2 TBSP chili powder and 1 TBSP ground cumin (remember, this is to only two pounds meat. Very nice flavor, would recommend.

Awesome! We like spicy so added garlic & 1 tbs plus a shake of "Menudo Mix Chili" from the Hispanic grocery. It was perfect. Had no idea of the QUANTITY I would end up with...took it to work to share & nearly everyone that had some wanted the recipe! Yum!

Very good recipe, thank you!  I cut the recipe down by 1/3, added a tsp of crushed garlic and about a tablespoon of Grandma's Garden southwest seasoning but otherwise left it the same.  Hubby and I both liked it a lot.

A good, hearty soup, but it can be a bit bland.  More spice is needed.

This recipe is a keeper!  I'm always on the lookout for one-pot dishes that are healthy and satisfying.  I too decided to add garlic & cumin, based on other reviews.  I garnished ours with a dollop of sour cream, chopped avocado, a little fresh cilantro & a wedge of lime.  The flavor was vaguely reminiscent of tortilla soup.  It was flavorful, yet mild enough that my two small children raved about it and went back for seconds.  I sprinkled some dried chipotle powder over the adult's portions and it was great.  We've never had hominy in our home and I was pleasantly surprised by it's mild flavor and meaty texture.  Delicious!

This was really good! I drained and rinsed my ground beef after I browned it and before I added the onion. I added chopped garlic and some cumin, as some others suggested. Also, I don't like green chiles so I omitted them and added one 4 oz can of diced jalepenos. I think that added the "bite" some reviewers said it lacked. Recipe makes A LOT of food! Thank you!

This is very good! I used Chimayo Red Chile powder and Chipotle in Adobo Sauce, to it has such a kick and awesome flavor. Thanks for sharing a winner!

Made it tonight, made the house smell super yummy!  After reading the reviews, I added 1 tsp cumin, 2 cups water and served with chopped fresh cilantro and fresh lime.  Needs a lil more kick, so next time I will add something for some heat.

I have this in the crock pot right now.  I love hominy.  I read the reviews about cumin and have time to add that if I want.  I did end up chopping up garlic and adding without realizing it wasn't in the recipe.  For some reason I had it in my head I wouldn't like it with the canned tomatoes but it's great.  I think with just one tablespoon of chili powder this has some zing (and I'm a 4 star thai kind of person too).  I added just one because my kids aren't into spicy food yet.

This is my second time to make this stew and the original recipe is tasty. When I made it for dinner tonight I took the liberty of making changes specific to hubby and my taste. I increased the green chiles, onion and hominy, decreased the potato and carrot, added  fresh garlic and oregano as well as new mexico chile paste for the chili powder. It was served it with a simple avacado salad and corn tortillas. This made for a very satisfying dinner which I will make again.     Oh, do not mistake this stew for posole. Authentic posole does not include potatoes, carrots, tomatoes....etc. Traditionally it is a simple pork and corn stew to which various chile's are added. For todays convenience hominy usually substitutes for the corn (posole).

I noticed that some people wanted more kick with this recipe. I would suggest using a dried chipotle powder for the chile powder, or, like I would, a dried green chile powder. This is similar to Posole..being from Arizona I found it a yummy "comfort food." Great recipe.

I had fun with this recipe and appreciated the info on the history.  A thick stew, if thick is measured by meat/veggie to broth ratio, but the broth was strictly broth, meaning very thin. (Added another 1 1/2 cups broth, eight-ounce can tomato sauce, and a bit of flour/water slurry at the end.) I did use ground turkey...a dietary requirement for me. Since turkey can be bland, I added the onions and chili powder with the turkey. P.S. To those who wonder where the corn is in this corn stew : ) ...hominy *is* corn!

This was delicious. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and increased the spices. It was better the next day and the flavors were more intense. We topped with grated cheese.

Hi all, I made the recipes pretty much as written but adjusted the servings to 4. That makes a reasonable amount of food. after it was cooked I tasted and added some smoked paprika and cumin a little more pepper and salt and a cup of home cut-off-the-cob, roasted and frozen corn I needed to use up. It tastes wonderful! Thanks!

I used red skin potatoes, and this is a great venue for them. Delicious stew. Followed another cooks advice, and added a can of corn. I'm really pleased. Accompanied by corn bread.

awesome...1/2 the recipe....didnt have any broth so I didnt drain the fat off the 90/10 ground beef to compensate, added 1 tbsp cumin, minced some garlic....all added to what was called for in the recipe.  made enough for a family of 5 w/ leftovers.  will add to the circulation of supper menus.

Top it with Jalapeno cheese and boom, delicious. The recipe makes a lot so I would suggest halfing it or quartering it unless you are feeding a small army.

This was a very good soup/stew and the only change I made was to add some cumin, as others have suggested.   I also added a small amount of hot pepper to give it a bit of heat.  I love the hominy in it and will definitely make this again.
