I froze fresh sliced peaches, diet Sierra Mist soda and one 8 ounce container of nonfat plain yogurt to use in place of the ice cream. I did not use the ice as my peaches were frozen. VERY good, even when using yogurt in place of the ice cream. That made it a little less sweet and a little tangy which I loved.

I have been loving the smoothies lately and yours is one of the best I've tasted. The only difference is that I didn't have ice cream!! It's still Great!! YUM

This was great.  I made 1 mistake and added the ice cream in the blender and it came out perfect anyway.  Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe.

This was pretty good,a 10 year old made it.  It was kinda fun having the ice cream plopped in it.  We added more ice.  We used fresh peaches and it was very tasty. Next time we'll try it with vanilla yogurt instead of ice-cream and blend it.

This recipe is a little sour but the sourness mixed with the flavor of the icecream makes it very good!!!

My family and I sat by our fire and drank this tasty refreshing drink... I recommend adding 2 or 3 scoops of ice cream in the cup or glass

We really enjoyed this :)  Made with plain yogurt and blended into a smoothie ... I love the kick the fresh lemon juice gives it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for recipe!

Made it without carbonated water and minus the ice cream, but still surprisingly good. :)
