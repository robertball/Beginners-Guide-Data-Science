very easy to make, and so tasty! I don't have regular bread pans, just a set of four small ones, so I used those, and mini muffin tins. Also switched out the walnuts for pecans, and everything still worked out great!

This is very addictive and hard to stop eating!  I halved the recipe for just one loaf, but I kept the nuts the same, and used chopped pecans.  Since I only did one loaf, mine was done in 45 minutes.  Great for a nice breakfast treat :)

Very good bread! I used a 16 ounce bag of frozen cubed mango and chopped it up -- gives just about 2 cups. I heat slices of the bread up in the microwave and it comes out tender and moist! I agree, very addictive!

I used part wheat flour and added  yogurt with the oil. I used dried cherries instead of raisins and omitted the coconut. I baked it for 50 minutes. It is and excellent recipe I'll use again and again!

Very good. 

6-27-16 update :  Hmm... I'm back on Allrecipes after being away for awhile and notice that they have removed all of the notes I kept on some recipes. What is with that??? Also just noticed that when you update a review the date of the review changes to the update, not the original date of the posting. Noticed other changes they made  to the site as I am trying to print this recipe. ... why mess up a good site with all of these changes ...?..

This was excellent!  I also live in FL picked my own Mangoes, which are very big, one Mango , two cups.  When you pick Mangoes leave two inches of the stem on and they won't ooze, which can ruin your Mango.  Leave them on your counter until they give a little when you squeeze them,  then put them in refrigerator.  You don't have to pick them all at once.  This is what  I've learned thru the years I've been here, and I'm still learning.  Usually takes about a week on the counter to ripen.

Delicious!  Only changes ~I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and a little more coconut, and I toasted the coconut first.

It's mango time in Florida and it's great to get them right off the trees! I get so many sometimes and this was a perfect use for them. The coconut is a real compliment & bread was moist and delishous. I had to use sliced (toasted) almonds - all I had in the pantry. I will try some macadamia's next time as I will certainly make again. Also, 350 on convection bake in my oven, both loaves made in same pans were ready in 35 min. and I reduced the sugar by 1/4 c.

This has become our favorite sweet bread.  If you can get to a Sam's Club, they sell mangos cut up in a tray and you won't have the job of cutting up the mangos.  I made this for Christmas gifts and baked them in decorative ceramic bread trays.  I omit the nuts and add craisins that I soften in some boiling water and love them in this bread.

Amazing and delicious. Only thing I changed was using Swerve (sugar substitute) instead of sugar. Mangos are my favorite fruit of all time. This was actually the 1st loaf i have ever made.  Very happy with the results. I'm a guy and love cooking, so this was fun.

I used pecans, and this is a great recipe. We all loved it - it's exceptional. I sent one loaf half way around the world to Istanbul with my daughter as a hostess gift, with mangoes picked from our yard. Definitely will be a mainstay in our family. Thanks for sharing it, yumyum808!

Great recipe, thank you. Definitely will duplicate the walnuts next time. I used 1 cup of raw sugar so it took longer to bake but amazing flavor and presentation.

This recipe is wonderful! I only made one change, which was to cut the sugar in half, because my mangoes were VERY ripe and sweet.  I made 1 loaf and 6 muffins.  The muffins cooked in 25 minutes and were nice and soft.  The loaf is the main event, though - a perfect quick bread!

This came out so light and fluffy! I used Hayden mango and cut it into half inch chunks. They held up nicely throughout. I also didn‚Äôt have a loaf pan so I used a 9x13 cake pan and baked for 45 minutes. It‚Äôs golden and gorgeous.

It was delicious! I used Bob‚Äôs Red Mill 1to1 All-Purpose Gluten-free flour (396 grams) instead of all-purpose wheat flour because of gluten intolerance.  I pur√©ed the mangos as gluten-free flour sometimes requires additional moisture.

I substituted Bob‚Äôs Redmill 1 to 1 gluten free flour in this recipe and it turned out great!  I wasn‚Äôt sure which size loaf pans to use, but after mixing up the batter decided that three 5x3 pans would be perfect. I greased the pans but didn‚Äôt bother flouring them and the bread slipped right out. 45 minutes was definitely enough!  So good- my child with celiac disease loves this sweet treat!

I thought this was really good! It just came out really dense, but I loved it! I did try to make it healthier and subbed applesauce with some yogurt for the oil. It didn‚Äôt rise much because the baking soda has to be activated by an acid, so I added yogurt, but you could add Leon juice or something. Next time I think I‚Äôll swap a teaspoon of soda with baking powder, might help it rise.

When you have a mango tree this recipe comes in handy. I've made it several times and the bread comes out moist and delicious. It is not too sweet and the coconut is a nice touch.

I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I didn't quite have 2 cups of mango. It tastes great!

I did get a little carried away with the mangoes. I think I put in about 3 cups. It turned out more like bread pudding! After sharing it with friends I ended up making six loaves!!! Good thing my neighbor has a beautiful mango tree covered in fruit.
Will definitely be making it again. Wondering how it would taste made with peaches

I loved this! I made a few alterations based on personal preferences in the household. The alterations did not mess anything up, so it seems like the type of recipe you could really change up and have some fun with! My son and husband don't like coconut or walnuts, so I omitted both and added finely chopped pecans. I usually don't like things as sweet as they're intended to be, so I added 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 and 1/4 cups of white granulated sugar! I sliced it and sprinkled cinnamon & sugar on top. Yum!!!

This was a good, moist bread.  I didn't really chop the mango much so there were chunks in the bread.  Not very appetizing to look at but delicious to eat!

I veganized the recipe by replacing butter with canola oil and eggs with coconut milk, and left out the nuts and coconut (for allergen reasons), and it was delicious! Very moist.
