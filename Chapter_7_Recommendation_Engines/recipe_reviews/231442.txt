Chicken came from the meat market and was "Dolly Parton" sized so we cooked as directed and finished in the oven on 325 for about 15 minutes. It was very good. Half the gravy ingredients as it makes a whole cast iron skillet full.

We enjoyed this recipe but the tarragon & sage were a little over stated for us.  I would make this again but up the black pepper and cut back on the sage and tarragon.

I took the advice of another reviewer and left out the sage and tarragon. I also love pepper so I added a pinch more. Chicken was tender,juicy and flavorful. My entire family enjoyed it which is rare, I usually have one of my childrenâ€™s tastebuds not be excited when I try something different. Will make again.

Bland taste.  Would season chicken before egg/flour.  Very nice crispy coating!

Oh my.  Sooo good. I didn't have all the spices listed so improvised there and also I didn't measure for the seasoned flour.  I ended up using a "rub" that I liked because it seemed to contain most of the spices and I was getting lazy.  But it was spicy delicious and I really loved the texture of the breading!

I sliced the chicken breast in half horizontally and fried for minutes on each side.
