I have always used a plain salt brine for my poultry and decided it was time to try some flavours in the brine...This ia a great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 C of brown sugar and used some whole peppercorns instead of ground pepper.  I also added a bit of baking soda to the mixture to neutralize the acidity of the oranges and lemons; this helps the brine absorb into the meat better.  I dry the bird after removing from the brine and get it into the oven right away; this ensures the brine stays in the meat.  The weight of the food on itself begins to squeeze the brine out within minutes of leaving the bath.  I've used this brine many times and I'm never disappointed.  Works well for whole birds or pieces.  Thanks!

I have been brining my turkeys for several years now using a different recipe, but was not quite happy with it.  So I tried this one and give it 10 stars.  Incredibly moist, very flavorful the citrus flavor is subtle but there and yet it is still good with traditional sides.  I added a sliced orange, lemon, onion, and some garlic gloves to the cavity as it baked.  Great recipe!

I used orange juice and RealLemon instead of fresh fruit because that's what I had available.  Also, used less than a gallon of water.

Brined two turkeys, and they were both great.  Easily the best turkeys I have ever made.  The turkeys themselves were bargain basement frozen birds, not fancy high dollar fresh turkeys.

EXCELLENT!  Brined turkey is the moisted and most flavorful I've ever had.  I just mixed the salt, citrus and herbs into the water and dropped in my turkey.  I also added a 1/2 cup of sugar and some sprigs of rosemary.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.

I found that if the turkey is too salty that I could change the type of turkey and make a big difference.  Butterball adds lots of salt injected in the bird.
I like fresh local turkeys the best.

This is also great cook on a smoker if you have time (9-13hrs, depending on size).You will love what that citrus add in flavor to this bird. I use a tall kitchen trash bag to whole everything in the pot.It also is helpful in reducing the contact with air and other flavors in the frig. I have also use orange juice to replace some of the water, for extra flavor. Now I boil the brine solution and let cool to room temp,then add to plastic bag and let stand in frig overnight. Remember to let stand the next day to get to room temp, then cook as desired. Get ready for a juicey, flavoral, tender treat.

My turkey was superb! I used the brine, then cooked in a bag upside down (on it's breast) and it was the juiciest turkey ever!

My comment isnt on this recipe in particular, just a tip on brining in general.  Last year I brined for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, it they were the best birds Ive ever had.  My tip is this.....place bird in an oven roasting bag with brine ingredients, then place in a cooler with ice.  Slosh the bag around several times during the marinating process. This clears up MUCH needed refrigerator space during the crunch time before cooking!

I have used this brine several times for chickens as well as turkeys.  I should have rated it a long time ago.  

THIS WORKS FOR A GOOD JUICY CHICKEN, ROASTER OR TURKEY!!!!

I used this brine for the Thanksgiving turkey, and it resulted in the most tender, juiciest bird ever! I did have to more than double the recipe in order to completely sumberge my 17 pound turkey. I also stuffed the lemons, oranges, garlic and bay leaves in the cavity before roasting. Everyone raved!

This was excellent and well worth the effort.  Just make very sure you do not get a prebasted turkey.  A fresh turkey works best.

I haven't used this with turkey, but several times with a chicken! I let my chicken sit once for a half hour after cooking, and it still literally gushed with juices when I carved it! One thing to remember is that when you use a brine, you need to make sure you thoroughly wash your bird off afterwards or it will come out dry and salty. Thanks so much!!

I doubled the recipe for a 22.5 lb. turkey and put it in a clean 5 gal. bucket to brine the turkey.  I always brine because it provides moisture and flavor to the turkey.  However, this recipe was way too salty and I couldn't taste the fruit.  I added extra garlic, onion and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  If I were to try this again, I'd cut the amount of salt by 1/2 cup.  Maybe more fruit could be added as well.

i love this recipe! however, i do change it a bit. i add 4 cloves (you can leave 'em out) and zest half the oranges and lemons before throwing them in. i start with a half gallon of water and bring to a boil, then turn the heat off and let steep for an hour. this really blends and brings the flavors out!. then, i add ice until cooled and measures the gallon and a half. i put the turkey in a roasting bag to brine and as i pour the brine in, i make sure the citrus and onions go in the cavity. you can put in the fridge, or keep cool overnight on ice. smoke over cherrywood. Fantastic!

So easy! Thanks for sharing! 

I was wacky and this Easter we served turkey. Living in Southern CA our family has several citrus trees - oranges & lemons - so I wanted to incorporate that into this springtime meal.  Well this was perfect! 

I loved seeing the chagrin on my mother-in-laws face when she had to admit my turkey was delicious! It was juicy, flavorful and fresh tasting!

Really delicious, moist, and fragrant turkey, I only got to sample a little bit because the people I made it for gobbled it up in no time! Plus my friends originally didn't like turkey because it was dry but this recipe definitely changed their minds.

I've used this recipe (with a few additions) five times and I'm using it today to brine turkey for the holiday.  My additions: I add 3 Tablespoons of liquid smoke which is a fabulous addition if you don't smoke your bird.  I also add an equal amount of sugar to salt ratio which helps the bird brown beautifully and adds additional flavor.  Fantastic receipe!

Oh, this is so good.  I use kosher salt instead of regular table salt.  I know some of you are going yikes!  But if you rinse the turkey well, it will be fine.  I too use the leftover citrus and stuff the cavity with it.  I also use a little brown sugar and instead of pepper, I use peppercorns.  I cook the turkey breast down, for all the juices go there.  I served this last year, and got rave reviews.  This recipe is a keeper!

Ummm...maybe I did something wrong, but this was not good at all.  It was way too salty, and the flavors just did not work well.

I made this for xmas 2010 and I am planning on making it again for Easter 2011. Everyone who tasted this turkey loved it. The only modifications I made were (lemon juice instead of real lemons due to thats all I had on stock), and I used 2-3 cut up oranges and added no thyme. Also I substituted regular salt for kosher salt.

very easy and very good. I let mine sit for 24 hours, the turkey just fell apart after cooking it, gave off alot of juice for gravy, i stuffed my turkey with vegetables when cooking, anything i happen to have in the fridge, i find adding anything citrus in the cavity makes a terrible taste in the juice for gravy.

I used this brine last Thanksgiving.  In addition to doing the brine, I stuffed the turkey with citrus and herbs and rubbed it down with the same mixture.  In a bowl, I mix 1 onion, 1 lemon, 1 orange, all quartered with fresh thyme, sage, parsely (some roughly chopped, but most still on stems), salt, pepper, and some melted butter.  I stuff the big pieces into the bird and what's left in the bowl gets rubbed all over the turkey, including under the skin and poured into the cavity.  It was my first turkey and my entire family said that it was super moist and tender, which I totally attribute to the brine.  I'm definitely using it again this year, starting tonite.

This was my first brined turkey. Chose this recipe because it was economical and saw Emeril use citrus in his.  Came out wonderful. So much flavor. I even overcooked it to 185 degrees (by accident), and it was still juicy. Note-it will cook quicker than a nonbrined bird. Also used a cooler for the brine and left outside overnight with ice in it. It was below 30 outside and never frooze. I have been designated to do Thanksgiving turkey for now on. Happy but what did I get myself into.

What a great brine. It leaves such a nice, mellow citrus touch to turkey, and the added flavour to the gravy from the drippings is incredible.

As others have stated rubbing the salt is not necessary, it will be soaking in brine overnight. This was an awesome recipe.  I have brined before, but using citrus was the best!  I added a tart apple and sage as well.

I made this for a New Years Eve party this last January and it turned out perfect!  Even though everyone was stuffed, they kept going back to nibble on the turkey.  My husband asked if I could make the turkey for this Thanksgiving instead of my mom.  I will be keeping this one for years!  Thanks for the recipe.

It's Superbowl Eve, and I just put my turkey in the brine! I tried this recipe for the 1st time Thanksgiving-it was by far the juicest bird I'd ever prepared. NO LEFTOVERS AT ALL!!! I'm hoping for the same effect with this one. I'm not a big salty flavor fan, so I only let mine brine an hr per pound(learned this from "mistakes" of using the "brine for 24hrs" rule-of-thumb on a couple of previous tries). After taking the bird out of the brine, I rinse it under cold h2o for 3-5 mins. After dring it off, I spray it w/Pam and use a variety of seasonings EXCEPT salt. I use an electric  water smoker, with some pecan wood chunks. Talk about good eating!

This is an AMAZING recipe. I could not believe how moist and flavorful my turkey turned out! I soaked the turkey for appox 1 hour per lb. I added a little extra Lemon to the brine and then to my roasting pan I halved more oranges, lemons, onion and garlic. It made the gravy yummy!!! I am for sure going to use this recipe again. I think I might try it with some chicken next!!

This was the first time I ever brined a turkey, and only the second turkey I've ever attempted (we won't talk about the first.) It was an absolute winner! Hubby said it was the BEST turkey he's had! The flavor really infused into the meat and even the white meat was tender and juicy. The marinade wasn't quite enough to cover the turkey, so I mixed water, a little more salt, and couple ounces of orange juice to cover it. My bird was 14 lbs. I will be using this recipe for my next turkey.

I tried this with a roasting chicken.  It was delicious.  I did use 2 oranges and 2 onions instead of one.  I wanted to be sure I got enough of that flavor.  This recipe will be a favoerite at our house.

I'm so excited-still. I made my first Thanksgiving dinner and I have to tell you I have some mad respect for mothers who have done it for years. I was so nervous about trying a brine since I never heard of it. So with a what the heck attitude, I tried it and let my bird soak overnight. I only had half a lemon, so I added a lime. My turkey came out so moist and juicy. I have to admit that it was the best turkey I have ever eaten. My guests loved it and I have little leftovers!!! I'll be using this again for my turkey recipes whether it being Thanksgiving or not.

Easily the best turkey I ever made!  Even the boyfriend, who thought brining would make the meat so salty, could'nt stop eating it and then called friends to brag about it.  Leftovers are outstanding!

I had to omit the onion and garlic due to allergies in the family, otherwise followed the directions. I did brine for a full 24 hours as I had a 20 lb turkey. It was still very moist. I used butter and herbs under the skin, basted with oj, cooked breast side down for about 3/4 of the time then turned over, and it came out very good, very moist and tender. really went pretty quick, not a lot of leftovers.

I used this recipe last year and my family loved it! I did deviate slightly from the recipe. Along with the wedges of fruit in the brine, I also stuffed wedges in the cavity. The turkey was so tender and juicy, the meat literally came right off the bone. I did use a turkey roaster instead of the oven.

I used this recipe for my Thanksgiving turkey. The only modifications that I made was that I used 2 oranges and 2 lemons since our turkey was 24 lbs plus I had to used more than a gallon and a half of water. The turkey was very moist, juicy and flavorful. I had 2 people take this recipe home with them so they can use it. For the first time in years there was no left over turkey. I will be using this recipe from now on.

This is the first time I have ever brined a turkey.   It was deemed the best turkey I've ever made and asked for me to make it this way from now on. Moist and flavorable!  Wish I heard about this years ago.

This was my first time to brine and I definitely will continue doing it.  The only change I made was to use whole peppercorns.  I used a 5 gallon bucket and a 12 lb. turkey overnight, with ice on top of turkey.  I then rubbed butter under the skin, salted and peppered outside of skin and roasted in an oven bag.  It was ready in 2 hours and delicious!

Phenomenal. Use this on our turkey every Thanksgiving and get so many compliments! I will never cook a turkey any other way...this is the way to go! For less of a mess, we line the pan with a plastic bag so cleanup is a breeze.

I have used this brine for my Thanksgiving turkey for the last two years. I buy extra oranges, lemons, onions and thyme and stuff the bird with them to roast. The brine makes such a moist bird, it almost makes it impossible to carve! I'd rather have moist, flavorful meat than pretty, dry slices anyday.

My turkey is in the brine right now; I didn't have oranges but I think I'll add some tomorrow and let it brine another day. I'll also upload a photo of it once it's cooked. I'm really excited to try this since I've never had a brined turkey before! *** Update, the turkey was seriously the best turkey I've ever eaten... I couldn't stop picking at it when it was done; cooked it in a 16 qt roaster oven... I will use this from now on!..

This recipe made my fresh boneless turkey breasts moist, tender, and flavorful this Thanksgiving (finally!) Added 1/2 cup white sugar to the brine, and dissolved the salt in the water too. After brining I just rubbed the skin with olive oil and roasted as usual. A great choice using ingredients folks normally have on hand.

I was so disappointed when I realized I had purchased a Butterball turkey, which has basting added to it and so you can't brine it or it ends up too salty. So, having a bright idea, I called the folks at Butterball and they confirmed my idea. If you want to brine your turkey, and find the one you purchased already has added basting to it, simply don't add salt to your brine. So, my brine will consist of apples and juice, oranges and juice, lemons and juice, vegetable broth, garlic, rosemary, thyme, sage, summer savory and onions. NO SALT. They said at Butterball that I could still brine my turkey as long as I cut down on the salt I used in it. I will also, when I roast the bird, stuff it with apples, oranges, lemans, celery, garlic and the herbs inside the cavity as well as a butter of butter, savory, sage, thyme, garlic and Rosemary put under the skin.  I will let everyone know how it turns out.

This was the first time I have ever had a brined turkey and I have to say the juice just poured out of it like never before. I do not particularly like turkey, but I always cook a 20 to 24 pound bird for Thanksgiving. I did not rub salt on the bird first, but put all of the dry ingredients in a sauce pan with about one quart of water. I dissolved the salt in the water over medium heat. I then transferred the mixture to a large stainless bowl, added ice, water, the sliced fruit, onion, and garlic. I put my turkey in two Reynolds oven bags (I doubled them to prevent leaking). Then I placed the turkey in a large party ice bucket, poured the cold brine into the bags, removed the air and double tied it before putting it in my fridge for 36 hours. Thanksgiving morning I took the bird out three hours before it was to go into the oven, rinsed it thoroughly, dried, and stuffed with dressing. The turkey roasted for five hours and I let it rest for 30 minutes before carving. I did not baste the turkey at all and the pan drippings yielded one quart with the fat removed. I made my gravy from the pan drippings and neck meat. The most important thing about the gravy – do NOT season before tasting it. Mine had the maximum amount of salt in it to still be OK. If I had added salt to the gravy, it might have been inedible due to the salt coming out of the turkey from the brining. I found the meat to be flavorful and moist, and not salty tasting since I used an unbasted store bought turkey.

Dark meat tasted spectacular. Breast seemed a bit odd on first taste, but as leftovers the breast was so moist and delicious. The only real complaint was that the skin didn't crisp up very nicely. Too moist maybe? We made this in the Weber barbecue as we always do. I wasn't sure at first if I would do this again, but after tasting the leftovers that were in the freezer for  1-1/2 months, I'm sold. Best Thanksgiving leftovers ever.

Everyone raved about the moistness of the turkey, and the overall flavor.  Everyone wanted to know what I did to make the turkey so moist.  I will definitely use this recipe again, and now so will others.

Fantastic! All my previous brines have been simply salt water.  This is a nice blend of seasonings, citrus, and herbs. If only my turkey knew he was prepared with love and enjoyed by many...  Give it a try.

This was so simple but the turkey came out so moist.  My husband said it was the moistest turkey he's ever had.  We didn't need a knife, the meat fell off the bone, and it was like butter in your mouth.  The skin was bursting with flavors from all the citrus and herbs.  One minor alteration was less salt and added soy sauce.

I had such high hopes for this brine as it was my first time brining a turkey.  I have to say the turkey was moist and delicious BUT I could not taste any of the flavors that went into the brine at all.  So I probably won't use this again for a turkey.  The citrus brine didn't seem to give it anymore flavor than a plain salt and water brine would.  I would like to try it again using a smaller piece of meat.  I had a 23 pound turkey that I brined for 24 hours.  Maybe if I had brined it for 48 hours then it would have been more flavorful.  All in all it seemed like a lot of work for not a lot of flavor.

This was an easy and delicious brine recipe.  Even after overcooking my turkey for over an hour (waiting for other items to cook), it was moist and yummy.  I didn't taste the citrus at all, but I wonder if the acid helps the moistness of the bird.  The only thing I eliminated was the onions, because my husband's stomach is very sensitive to them.  I will use this for all future turkeys! Thanks.

I used this on chicken and it turned out alright. It wasn't as moist as my usual chicken which really had me disappointed. I've never used a brine before and I was hoping for something moister. The flavor of the chicken was lacking as well - the skin was delicious but the bird itself didn't have any flavor from the brine or seem to have retained any moisture. I did as others instructed and put the bird into the oven right out of the brine and it didn't seem to help. This was my test chicken to see if I'd want to use the brine for my Thanksgiving turkey. I don't think I'm going to use it. I'm still on the fence - I might combine this brine with my usual method of roasting and put some butter under the skin to keep it moist while roasting. The meat turns out much more tender and  moist this way.

This is amazing! I use this for my chicken and my turkey. I stuff my poultry with the same ingredients used in the brine and then bake it for the recommended time. The meat is always tender and flavorful.And the gravy from the drippings is to die for!

Used this reciepe this Thanksgiving.  Got rave reviews from the family.  I cut the salt in half and added a half cup brown sugar, and doubled the whole thing for my 22 lb. turkey and let it soak in a 5 gal. bucket.  It was wonderful.

I've used this brine for years at Thanksgiving and it has always resulted in rave reviews by our family and guests. I think a huge part of that success is that I drain the turkey from the brine and stuff with new wedges of oranges, lemons, onions and add celery. I grill our turkey on a gas grill (turkey is placed in a conventional roasting pan with a rack/cooking grate) at 350 degrees and amazingly I don't have to baste but once and this turkey cooks far faster than an oven. For those who feel the recipe doesn't work - don't use a frozen turkey, always use fresh ingredients (including thyme), and keep it refrigerated, not cool, but cold. I have looked for alternative recipes and this one just beats them all.

Great, great, great! This brine recipe makes for a succulent, juicy bird. I did heat the brine to boiling, then cooled before placing the bird in the brine. I also liked one reviewer's suggestion to put some citrus juice into the brine, which I did in my second time using the recipe. I also recommended this recipe to my son's father-in-law for a Christmas dinner we were invited to. Super flavor! Funny how you are able to enjoy more a meal you don't cook.

I'm not sold on this. I changed the servings to 5 for a chicken. It didn't taste citrus-y at all. The chicken legs also turned out very salty. However, the chicken breast turned out very well, and not even dry after re-heating twice. I think I'll still stick with other brines, but this wasn't bad.

This was fabulous! Before roasting the turkey I stuffed the cavity with the fruits from the brine. I also added a large sprig of rosemary both in the abdominal and neck cavities. I rubbed olive oil on the skin and sprinkled with some kosher salt. Everyone agreed that this was the best turkey ever! The meat was so moist and flavorful! Absolutely wonderful!

This was amazing! It was so easy, I used a cooler chest lined with a big clean plastic trash bag and made sure the water covered over the turkey and that there were plenty of ice cubes. My giant turkey disappeared the day after Thanksgiving. NO LEFTOVERS. The juiciest best tasting turkey I ever made.

I never have trouble with a dry turkey, but I am not always happy with the depth of flavour, this brought the flavour out beautifully. Will use this brine from now on.

I won a frozen turkey and decided to prepare it in a brine solution the weekend after Thanksgiving.  My husband's quote "I really liked the turkey we had at my sisters for Thanksgiving but THIS is even better."  It was flavorful and moist and this was starting with a frozen in store brand bird. I imagine if you used it for a wild or heritage bird it would be amazing!

Amazing! Made the turkey fork tender and juicy! We stuff the bird with dressing and I was worried it would make the dressing and drippings (for gravy) to salty, but it did not at all. SO amazing!  I was skeptical if brining really made a difference - but it was totally worth the effort! I also made a herb butter and rubbed it under the skin before cooking (no salt).

WONDERFUL! Used on an older turkey, which would have a strong flavor (too strong for my taste), and this really complemented and tenderized the meat.

This was absolutely great. I didn't really taste the citrus but that acid must really break down the meat. Thank you for the recipe!!

I have done this brine for many years and it is hands down my favorite. It is wonderful as is,but over the years it has morphed  into its own. I replace 1/2 gallon of water with orange juice, throw in a poultry pack of fresh herbs and an extra orange and lemon. We deep fry instead of bake. 5 stars as is and 5 stars with the changes.

Wow! This was the most flavorful, moist turkey I ever ate! It did not really taste of citrus, but just had an incredible flavor! Will definitely use again.

We brined our turkey for the first time and followed this recipe adding 1/2 c. brown sugar as suggested in some reviews.  It turned out so moist and nice.  Will definately do this again.  The only thing is that the brine smelled so good but none of the flavor is in the turkey when its cooked.  Perhaps all that's needed is the salt and water.

First time to brine a turkey and it was fantastic! I was afraid it would be saltly so I reduced the salt but next time I will go with what the recipie calls for. Also I used a "cheap" off brand turkey that was injected with some kind of broth solution but this was not a problem as far as worrying about it being too salty. This was the most moist turkey I have ever had...everyone loved it!

I used to hate turkey because it was so dry but this brine made me love it :). I've used this recipe for 3yrs and it never dissapoints. My friends and family love the way it comes out, extremely juicy and tasty. So far the comments I get for my turkey have been awesome. Thanks for this recipe, now I'm making it a family tradition :-)

I used this recipe to brine 2 small chickens. It was my first time to actually do that. I roasted the chickens in the oven after brining them and they turned out very moist! I didn't use the onion, but I did everything else according to the instructions.

I followed this recipe to the T. The turkey was so moist and delicious.  I hardly had any left overs! Anyone complaining that it was to salty must not have rinsed the bird after it was removed from the brine. As many have already stated, you must rinse, pat dry and bring the bird to room temperature before you baking.

I increased the salt, which I think may have been a mistake.  I would stick to the recipe on that one if I were you.
I brought all the ingredients to a boil with some water in a pot first and then let cool before I added to the turkey in a larger bucket with some more water.  This helps to bring out the flavors.
I also added a little rice vinegar and used whole peppercorns instead of ground pepper.  Good recipe for a springtime bird!  Brining is a MUST.

One reviewer suggested boiling the brine to bring out all the flavors. We did that and then smoked our 8 pound turkey for about three hours. BEST TURKEY EVER!

I was skeptical, but I wanted to try something new with turkey, and boy am I glad I did! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly (substituted iodized sea salt though) and the turkey was very moist and tender... It smelled heavenly too! The only negative I had about this was the flavors of the citrus and spices did not transfer to the meat, and I would recommend to flavor the turkey with the seasonings you'd like if you do want meat that has some flavor to it (flavor other than the juicy, tender, delicious poultry flavor this brine enables, of course).

I have tried a plain brine once before but this was much better.  I used a fresh turkey for the first time and, because my turkey was 22 pounds, I did not have a pot big enough.  I used a large kitchen trash bag to hold the brine against the turkey better, and then put the bag with the turkey's tail up in the pot. It was a good thing I did because it did get a pin hole leak so I will use a heavy duty bag next year.   For extra flavor I also rubbed oil and a mixture of herbs (sage, thyme, paprika, salt and pepper) all over the bird, including the cavity and under the skin and I put all the items from the brine back in the cavity.  I barbequed the turkey for about 4 hours till the multiple poppers popped up. (I always use at least three). Everyone said it was the best, most tender, juiciest turkey they've had.

I have never brined a turkey before but will from now on!  It was so juicy and husband said it was THE best turkey he's ever had.  I didn't follow the directions exactly - I was a little nervous of soaking overnight in essentially a salt water mixture, so I reduced the salt some, but it was wonderful.  Will follow to a T next time!

Our first "brined" turkey...what a moist turkey!!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding some orange juice and increasing the garlic.  Incredible difference in tenderness and moisture.  I didn't find any difference in cooking time as some people had noted (decreased from non-brined), but I did not let it reach room temperature before cooking as some did...we grill ours outside in a Weber Kettle...All our future turkeys will be prepared this way!  Thanks!

This was a delicious brine to our Thanksgiving Turkery. Very easy, fix it and forget it! I placed mine in one of the oven bags, turkery sized and placed it in a cooler with ice all around it and left it, just adding more ice as it melted. It remained nice and cold overnight (total of 24 hours actually). I'm in AL so it sat on my back porch. Thanks for this easy brine. (I even used a butterball turkey and the breast was even more flavorful and juicy.

This is the first year that I have brined a turkey.  I only had a turkey breast since it was just me.  I was worried it would be too salty, but was very happy with the outcome.  The citrus)not the same pieces used in brine) I also put inside along with sprig of rosemary and it was tender and delish!

Very quick and easy to prepare. I salted the whole bird, then stuffed it with the ingredients for the brine. The citrus flavor was not too strong. Everyone enjoyed the bird.

I put the turkey in this for 24 hours. My meat was falling off the bone after 4 hours of baking. My husband and son normally hate turkey. They couldn't stop eating this one.

Omit the step of "rubbing salt", it's not neccesary. I let the turkey brine for 2 days in the fridge, IT WAS PERFECT!!! We used the fruit and onions to stuff it with, along with some sausage. After that, we smoked it (13LBS) for 9 hours. Doesn't get much better than that!!!  WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYONE!!!!

We halved the salt and added about 1/4 cup white wine to brine a 5lbs turkey breast, and the result was fabulous. The brine gave the turkey a much more deep and complex flavor than simply roasting it does, and our turkey was wonderfully moist! I can't wait to try out this brine on a chicken! : )

I am a firm believer that once you trying brining, you will NEVER go back to regular seasoning. I used this for 2 turkey breasts and we had thanksgiving in March. Together with the awesome apple, sausage and cranberry stuffing recipe there were no leftovers!!!

oh my a wonderful bird.  I had never cooked a bird with out putting it in a bag to cook. I forgot the bag so decided to try this .  the hardest part was finding a place to soak the bird. Used a 5 gallon bucket in the fridge and every thing from the fridge to the care over night thank goodness it was cold.  Will forget the bag from now on the bird was bueatiful and juicy.  Cooked 1/2 way with the breast down and covered with wine soaked towel except for the last hour.

This brine made all the difference in my first turkey. I rubbed the bird with some salt then warmed up the water & other items plus added the additional salt. I wanted to ensure the salt dissolved. I placed in a clean, garbage bag & placed in the fridge. I had to omit the thyme because I had none on hand & used what I did have. 

The only thing negative to say was that while the bird was perfect the drippings came out too salty. When I used the drippings for the gravy & stuffing they both were edible but too salty for my taste. Nevertheless, I look forward to using this recipe again especially with chicken.

After all the hype, I finally brined a bird, and it was worth it! Very moist throughout. This is a nice brine, but would suggest adding more citrus wedges, even some orange juice, to enhance the citrus flavor.

This is the first time I've brined a turkey, and I have to say it was the most moist ever!  Instead of using a lemon and an orange, I used 1/2 cup Real Lemon juice, and 3/4 cup orange juice.  Also used coarse kosher salt.  Turned out delicious!

I have struggled with Turkeys all my life...so did my mom, who was a really good homemaker and cook. For a long time I've cooked them in a sealed foil tent to hold in the moisture and flavor, basting at the end to get some good sizzle on it.  This year I brined with this recipie (being very liberal with the quantities of ingredients, as it was a 20 lb bird) and then baked it in a tent, as usual......oh my goodnees. I will never not brine again. This is outstanding. Have a gourmet cook in the extended family, and my nieces and daughter were all comparing this bird to his (which are a seriously religious experience to eat, but I suspect he goes to a lot of trouble)... For the little bit of extra work involved, this is a superb way to treat a bird.

Best turkey I've ever made was with this brine! I followed the suggestion to cook the ingredients on the stove first, to dissolve the salt and allow flavors to steep (mostly because I hate touching raw poultry).  Easy, and the flavor was excellent.
I had to get the bird in the oven early in the morning so I brined it all day the day before, and let the skin dry in the fridge over night.  I'll never cook a turkey any other way!

We have used this recipe for years and it produces a marvelous turkey. I have spent kagillions of dollars on fresh birds and now can make a utility bird taste just as good with the brine. 24 lb bird + 2 lemons 2 limes 2 oranges 1 onion 6 cloves of garlic sliced peppercorns brown sugar fresh thyme rosemary and oregano and a 8 oz container of frozen orange juice and 1 cup kosher salt - iodized salt is too salty.. I make the brine the day before and simmer for 1 hour then cool till it is cool. Do not place the turkey in a warm brind.  Place bird and brine in a large bucket adding water if necessary to cover entire bird and let sit for minimum 24 hours. Keep in a cool place, sometimes there isn't room in my refrigerator so I keep it on the cold garage floor. I add a tray of ice cubes every few hours to make sure it stays cold. Rinse bird really well.  Those who say it's too salty don't rinse the bird enough. Enjoy and thanks for posting this recipe it's a holiday tradition in our house!

I have always used Alton Brown's Salt Brine recipe and thought I would try this one.   I really liked the moistness and flavor.  I used a 5 gallon bucket from the hardware store that was doubled lined with two garbage bags.   I used the recipe rather closely but added sliced candied ginger.  For the liquid I used 8 cups of water and 2 quarts of orange juice.  Then to make sure the entire bird was cover, I topped it off with water.  The turkey brined for almost 24 hours then I removed the liquid, wrapped up the bird in the garbage bag and store it in the refrigerator for 12 hours.  To roast I added to the cavity, two quartered small oranges, a quartered lemon, fresh parsley and thyme.  It was delicious!

All I have to say is WOW! Made the best turkey that I and all of my guests have ever had because of this brine. I must do for Thanksgiving! I will never cook another turkey without using this brine first. But double it because it's not enough to cover the turkey completely.

THRILLED with the results. I didn't have a big enough pan to submerse it, so I used a cooking bag inside a 3" high rimmed pan. Someone mentioned cooking it upside down for super moist breast meat. Fantastic!

Used this two years ago and everyone raved. Going to do it again this year because I have more people and no time to try something I don't trust! It was a lot easier than I thought brining would be, and so juicy!

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving for my my husband who is not a big fan of turkey.  He loved it! I'm making it again this year.

This the the juiciest turkey you will ever eat. I give it a BIG 10!!

This was great, though I think it was a combination of the brine and method of cooking.  I used a 4 lb. chicken instead, and got some great roast chicken tips from a food blog.  Simply great presentation and even better tasting. Thanks!

This brine recipe is fantastic.  I used this for a turkey which I cooked on my smoker.  The meat was so juicy and tender and you could taste the citrus in the meat.  Only change I made was the addition of a little rosemary.

I love brining.  It is so good.  I don't ever put in the garlic this recipe calls for as my husband hates garlic.  I also double the lemons and don't include the orange.  You may want to use Kosher or salt other than just table salt for a more potent flavor.  Make sure to squeeze the lemon and put it into the cavity.  We cook it in a bag just for more juice.

I tried this recipe over Thanksgiving- it was the best turkey I have ever had!!  Even the white meat was juicy and tasty, for days afterwards too.  Like others said I added a bit of orange juice to the water, and stuffed the oranges, lemons, onions and other things in the cavity of the bird while it cooked.  I love this brine, I'm going to try it on everything now!!

This is the first time I have ever used a brine on poultry. My grandmother used to brine duck before roasting but I never had the chance to ask her what the ingredients were before she passed away. I used a split turkey breast and cut the recipe in half, soaked it overnite and roasted the breasts in the oven at 375 for about an hour and 45 mins. While the meat was juicy and tasted great I didn't notice any of the brine flavors like other reviewers had mentioned. Maybe I should have pierced the breasts with a fork or squeezed the lemon and orange to get more juice out? Not sure if I will bother to brine my turkey or chicken again since I've never really had a problem with poultry turning out dry. I think basting with citrus juice while roasting might be interesting though!

I'm giving this 4 stars because the chicken did turn out very tneder but as for flavor I guess I expected more. I read alot about brining beforehand and it says not to brine more than 5-6 hours and also to brine even for a couple days so I was afraid to brine for too long so only did it for 6 hours.  I put the fruit in the cavity along with a few garlic cloves.  If not for that I don't think the chicken would have much taste.  My usual method of heavy seasoning inside/outside of the chicken with lemons & garlic in the cavity tastes better, I think. And much less work.  But I may try it again and brine for a longer period next time.

I am giving five stars b/c the turkey was so moist, but I am not sure if the oranges and onion and all that did anything.  Maybe it added a depth of flavor I would have missed had I not added it.  Very good over all I used one person's suggestion to brine my turkey in my veggie crisper drawer in my fridge.  Worked perfectly.  I will only brine a turkey from now on!

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars b/c I didn't follow it exactly; I'd rather give it 2 or 3...   I used juices instead of the fresh fruit, b/c that's what I had.  Other people did that with great success, though.  

My issue was that parts of the turkey were very salty (especially the leg/thigh meat) and others were fine.  I was so excited about trying this recipe based on the reviews, but I probably won't be brining any poultry in the future.  Seems like an awful lot of work when the turkey didn't taste any better than the turkeys I normally make.

Excellent!  Follows is how to brine a turkey, Wisconsin winter style!

I never had brined a turkey before, mostly because I had no idea of what container to use that would be big enough.  I thought of using a 5 gallon pail lined with a large oven cooking bag.  I covered the pail with a pizza pan, and put it in my cold garage overnight.  Worked perfectly!

Excellent! Only one thing.  I believe that the citrus helps "pre-cook" the turkey kind of like a ceviche. It shaved off almost an hour of cooking time.

Perfect brine for my turkey. I brined for 48 hours then removed, dried, and used a dry rub, stuffing the cavity with a cut onion, the rind of one lemon and the rind of one orange. 5 hours of smoke time later, I achieved perfection. The turkey was to die for. Thank you for the post!

I am making 2 whole turkey breast for Easter along with a ham I have been using a Brine by Kikomans for quite a few years. It's a great brine, but I am looking for another great brine and this one I can work with. I am going to swap out the water for an unsweetened lemonade (homestyle) and orange juice plus adding the fresh fruit for a freshness. As for the rest of the ingredients I will most likely keep them as is for now. I might add or switch some things because I love the taste of celery seed in brine. This and my butter compound will make for some tender and juicy birds! Thank you for posting!

This is the first time I brined a turkey and I would do it again.  I zested the citrus, cooked the brine to enhance the flavors, then let it cool before adding the turkey.  I left it in the brine for about 20 hours.  I was afraid of a salty bird so I thoroughly rinsed it.  The meat was tender and flavorful, the citrus was subtle but definitely detectable.  My only issue with this process was the gravy made from the drippings was plenty salty.  It was edible, but I wish I could have had less salt.  I would try this again, making gravy without the pan drippings.

Please do not brine your turkey with table salt,  way too easy to oversalt and is just plain a bad/harsh flavor, this is just plain BAD advice.  Use sea salt or Himalayan or other good salt for a nice subtle and more flavorful brine that lets the citrus shine through. I also thought more citrus was needed and ended up adding a can of orange juice concentrate to be able to even taste the citrus.

I made this over the weekend for our belated family Thanksgiving celebration.  I read somewhere that someone had used apple juice , so I did. I added a bit more seasoning.  The results were fantastic, and three days later the left overs are still magnificent and moist.  I will be using this brine again.  Christmas is coming.  My oven is small, so I had to cook two turkeys, one on Saturday, and one on Sunday.  Not a lot of left overs.  Next time, I might try the brine without apple juice, just to taste the difference.   This is so much better than the brine recipe I had been using.  I did use 3/4 cups of salt instead of 1 cup.  Maybe I will try 1/2 cup next time as my oven will only hold up to a 9 or so Kg. bird at a time.  I hate my oven, but it came built into the house.   do try this great recipe.  I love it.  Even Mr. Cranky Pants liked the results.

First brining ever and I will brine again.  It really did make the low grade turkey I bought very moist.  I did find the skin on the wings a little salty....but there's a lot of skin per bite on a wing.  There was the ever so subtle citrus flavour....it you weren't looking for it you wouldn't notice it. But it was pleasant.

Brined a 22 lb turkey using this recipe for 36 hours.  I then slow roasted it, and couldn't have had a juicier turkey.  Everyone commented on the subtle citrus flavors, and even my non-citrus-loving kid (and a moody teenager at that) loved it. This is a keeper.  The only modification I made, other than upping the brine to accommodate the larger bird, was to add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the mix.  Other than that, it was done as written.

I used this recipe for my very first turkey.  My turkey was 20 pounds and it soaked in the brine overnight, about 12 hours.  I didn't really taste the citrus,  but it did turn out incredibly moist.  I've read that a bag could be used instead of a pot.  Sadly, the bag (turkey oven bag, won't mention brand, but it was a name brand) burst and I used a bucket instead.  I would use this recipe again, but soak for a bit longer.

I usually don't eat turkey on Thanksgiving because no matter how it's cooked, it is always dry.  I used this exact recipe last Thanksgiving and it was amazing!!  Everyone raved about it and now I'm so excited  to use it again this year :)

I have used many meat marinades in the past, but this was my first time brining whole poultry. This recipe is great! I used a 5-gallon bucket and brined a small turkey, then rotisserie-cooked it on the grill. It turned out super moist, with a kind of smokey flavor, and really tasty! No problem using up all that left-over turkey in just a couple of days. Then just yesterday I used the same recipe and method with a whole chicken. Excellent!

This is a great brine!  I've used this recipe for the last 3 years and my turkey has been fantastic every time!  The juice from the turkey also makes an amazing gravy when using this brine.  There's no need to add any bouillon when making gravy.  I have become the official turkey maker of my family because of this brine!  ;o)

I made it...I added 1 extra lemon, 1 extra orange...1 cup pineapple juice and WOW!
I cooked two turkeys for Thanksgiving using this recipe.  Each bird was sealed in an airtight oven baking bag and both placed in a cooler then covered with ice for  48 hours ( not intentionally).  But what a magnificent outcome came about!
Each bird was very moist, juicy, and "0h so flavorful!"
My dinner guests were trying to name "each" spice they tasted.  All positive remarks.  My male guests (all self-proclaimed chefs) were comparing my birds to their best "previous " feats of clamor.
Today I received a few positive comments from dinner guests about how good the turkeys were.  This brine works!

taking the base recpie and what others suggested i made a version i really loved. cut the salt in half and replace with brown sugar in the water. i did a 2 to 1 ratio of oranges to lemons, make sure you zest them and put the zest in the water! the rest is the same but i did also make a sage and thyme infused butter and put it under the turkey breast skin and it brought it all togeather!

I always dissolve the kosher salt and brown sugar in boiling water, while the water's hot, add the fruit, bay leaves, whole black pepper, fresh thyme and sage.  Then I add ice to the mixture. I keep an ice chest that is only used for brining and use disinfectant  ( white vinegar usually) to clean it out.  Add 10 pounds of ice, add the warm/hot brine mixture, add Turkey, add more ice/water as needed to make sure the Turkey is covered.  Place something heavy over the top of the Turkey to keep it submerged.  Add ice as needed.  I normally brine for at least one day but sometimes two.  SO good.

I always get rave reviews on my Turkey when I use this brine!!! Because I have an extremely large turkey, I double the recipe. Instead of adding all the water, I add some orange, lime and cranberry juice. Like I said.....RAVE reviews!!!

This is my favorite brine!  I do add 1/2c. brown sugar and boil the ingredients with about 1/3 of the water.  After the water cools completely add the rest of the water--sometimes I even add orange juice-then add the turkey to the brine.  I do rinse and dry the turkey before baking.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, and it was delicious  - very juicy and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it is definitely a keeper, but I wish that it included cooking instructions. I was able to find a similar recipe on another site and followed the instructions there.

THIS RECIPE MADE ME MONEY! I catered a Christmas party using this brine and the techniques from the "Perfect turkey" recipe from this same site. 25 turkeys all perfect, all juicy, and all with that flavor "I just can't put my finger on." My customers were a very diverse group and we heard a lot of positive feed back. If you follow this recipe and the perfect turkey recipe this Thanksgiving/Christmas, your nieces and nephews will ask "Are you making the turkey  next year?" Great brine.

It was my first time ever cooking a turkey (19lbs)—let alone brining one and I did it using an electric roaster! Talk about audacity! I followed the recipe to the letter, had sensational results and more giblet gravy(another first for me) than we needed. The turkey was juicy and aromatic. There wasn't enough. It was picked to the bone. Thanks for the recipe! 

I found this cooking method for the roaster (no water is needed):
1. Cook turkey at the highest temp of your roaster (ours is 450 degrees) for 30 minutes
2. Reduce to 325 degrees for the rest of the time.
3. DO NOT OPEN THE LID AT ANY TIME!! The bird will self-baste. You must have faith! :)

Cooking times (including steps 1 & 2): 
8-12lbs  2h 45m - 3h; 
12-14lbs 3h - 3h 45min; 
14-18lbs 3h 45m - 4h 15m; 
18-20lbs 4h 15m - 4h 30m; 

If you are stuffing your bird add about 15-30m to the above times. A brined bird really protects against drying out your meat.

I used this all the time to marinade a whole chicken, it would work well with chicken parts, too.  I use lemon juice when I don't have lemons and I have subbed orange juice when I don't have oranges, which is often.

I frequently use this brine.  It's perfect for Beer Butt Chicken.  Everyone raves about the juiciness and flavor.  I add black peppercorns and bring to a boil to dissolve the salt and get the flavors going.  I'm thinking of throwing in a few dried hot chilies next time.!

I have used this same general recipe on a Capon and followed up with the classic forty cloved of garlic James Beard was so famous for contriving. I took it to the lake with family and I had to leave for a few hours and when I returned they had eaten it like wolves! They "saved" me the bony pieces! They couldn't quit eating it!Needless to say, this is a winning way to prepare poultry.

Have used this recipe several times now and find that the brine helps with the final defrosting of the turkey and to improve the flavour and texture of the cooked bird.

Used this brine for a 6lb. turkey breast so I should have cut the salt back somewhat but overall the brine was great! I juiced some of the oranges limes and lemon for the brine instead of just slicing them all. Turkey was very flavorful and juicy. As a side note: To cook, I "buttered" the breast with bacon grease and basted it with (no pun intended!) Wild Turkey bourbon!

Made this for Thanksgiving using a fresh free-range heirloom turkey breast and organic tree-ripened citrus. So perfect! Everyone loved it; thank you so much for sharing it with us!

We did this brine for Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys.  It was a very moist and will continue to use a "brine" from now on.

I used this brine this Thanksgiving and it was lovely. I threw in a sliced grapefurit too. The turkey I made (Maple turkey from this site) came out juicy and tender. I will likely repeat this for Christmas.

This was really great. The entire family loved it, declaring it moist and very tasty. Although the prep work took a little time, I noticed that my boys and their wives were busily wrapping the leftovers to take home!!
Great! I will do it again.

This was pretty good!  My family said it was the juciest turkey they ever had.  I couldn't really taste how the brine seasoned the bird but it was moist.

Made my turkey VERY juicy and tender last year. I cooked a 22 lb turkey for 10 people, and there was none leftover!
