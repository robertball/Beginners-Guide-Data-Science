YUM!!!!! This was great. I cut back on the peppers (personal preference) and used 1/3 cup fresh parsley and 1/3 cup fresh basil. This was wonderful and got rave reviews.

Read the other reviews and was worried about lack of taste. We added a little more salt after serving and it really let the flavor pop.   It's a little dry, but you can always help that with some wine. :)

I was excited to try this, but was disappointed. It just didn't have much taste other than all that garlic. Not sure if it was the quality of my peppers or what. Had to add lots of salt and pepper when eating it, and my husband wasn't impressed, either. Won't be making it again.

We thought this recipe was okay, but not exceptional.  I substituted roasted red peppers from a jar because that's what I had on hand, but the real problem was the goat cheese -- we felt it gave the dish an odd musty flavor.  We like goat cheese, but it just didn't work in this recipe.

Nice pasta.  I had a bunch of red and yellow peppers that were looking kind of sad, so I decided to use this recipe to use them up.  I halved it--that looks like a lot of pasta!--and waited to mix in the feta until the pasta and peppers had cooled.  Recipe doesn't say to do that, but I didn't want the feta to melt.  I think I'd roast garlic with the peppers next time--just personal preference.  Bc I had the peppers already chopped in a plastic container, I just drizzed olive oil in there, put the lid on, and shook it so all the peppers would be coated.  Worked really well.  I used tricolor rotini pasta in this; glad I did.  This is a very simple pasta salad that bursts with flavor when you bite into it as a result of the goat cheese, roasted pepper, and capers.  I would add the goat cheese to taste--a little goes a long way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy cow!!! This is wonderful! I used this recipe as the base of a "fridge clean out". In other words I had all of these ingredients in my fridge that needed to be used up. I had one more thing though and it was three quarters of a 46 ounce bottle of tomato juice that I had left over from making veggie chili. So I reduced the tomato juice by about a quarter and went on with the regular recipe from there. I minced the garlic and seasoned the garlic and peppers before they went into the oven with salt and pepper. I also took about half of the tomato juice and the roasted garlic and peppers and put it in the blender and then mixed it back in to the rest of the chopped roasted garlic and peppers and tomato juice mixture. I used both chopped parsley and basil adding them at the very end with the goat and parm cheeses. My Hubby loved it too! My taste buds are happy happy tonight! Thank you, FCF, for posting the recipe!
