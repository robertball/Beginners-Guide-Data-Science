I have been making a version of this dip for years, and it is always a favorite! The trick I use to keep it creamy & tasty is to add a 10 3/4oz can of cream of mushroom soup (regular or reduced fat) mixed with 1 cup of milk. I haved used many different kinds of sausage (bulk italian, breakfast sausage, mild, spicy) and they all come out yummy. Serving with "scoops" (Fritos or Tostitos) or small deli bread seems to work best. I recently made this for my hubby to bring to a poker tournament, and he said that the guys were licking the dish, and asking him for the recipe! This also freezes well, so it's easy to make a double batch, freeze, then thaw & throw in a crock pot.

Always a hit and so easy to make. This recipe has gotten the nickname "danger dip" in our family because we can't stop eating it and often other appetizers are forgotten (in danger)when this is served.  Brought it to a local fire dept. picnic and last summer and there was nothing left.

I gave this a three because I hate when people make a ton of changes and rate the original a 5 when on it's own the original is not that good. I made this before as written and thought i was too salty. I just remade it now and I made some changes. I used a full pound of lean ground beef and eliminated the sausage. Then I used 2 cans of Rotel with green chili's instead of salsa and a large Velveeta loaf. It was amazing like that and way less salty and more flavorful. I will make this version a lot

I read about this in the reviews of another dip recipe, so decided to try it instead.  I used green salsa instead of the traditional red because that's what I had.  WOW!!  I will definitely make it again and again, with the green salsa.  I also used chorizo for the sausage.  This is definitely a hit record.

This is such an easy recipe!! It was a family favorite. I served it with a dollop of sour cream  and Frito Scoops! My niece LOVED it she had 2 or 3 bowls. It's best served warm so I suggest cooking it in a slow cooker and keeping it on low as you serve it or even just putting it in a slow cooker to just keep warm.

Looking back, I don't know why I thought I would like this based on the ingredients, but the good reviews fooled me into thinking that it would be more than it was.  This is pretty much just the traditional "rotel" style nacho dip plus LOTS of meat.  I cut the meat in half and it was still too meaty.  Not very impressive, and a lot was left in the serving dish at the end of my party.  I have been searching for a dip similar to one a friend's mother made in high school that we all loved and I thought this might be it, but it looks like I will have to keep looking.

Yummy!!! I often substitute a can of Rotel for the salsa. I also usually only use a pound of beef or a pound of sausage...I've never used more than a pound of meat...I think 2 pounds would be too much for my taste. But it's very yummy and a great simple recipe!

My husband loved this. I used a can of Ro-Tel brand diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of salsa. I only used half a pound of each meat and didn't have any green onions. I only used 1 pan and after draining the grease form the cooked meats, I just tossed in the can of Ro-Tel and chunks of Velveeta. This was really good with tortilla chips. Almost a meal in itself, this is soooo good. Thanks for a great recipe.

A tip for the vegetarians out there. This is old favorite of mine! When I became a vegetarian I thought I was going to have to give this up. Instead I learned from a friend that it is just as good if you substitute black beans for the beef!

I made this for a family gathering, it was a huge hit. Very easy to make and inexpensive per serving. I had people asking for the recipe.
 I browned the meat with the onions together in a skillet. Then put the everything in a Slow cooker for a few hours on low and stirred occasionally.
 I made mine spicy with pepper flakes a little hot sauce and hot salsa. Served with corn and tortilla chips. This is a keeper.

This is the best. The kids loved it as well as adults.  It tasted like a nacho cheese dip.  Good for potlucks too. And very easy and quick.

I made this for Super Bowl and everyone really liked it. I served it with tortilla chips, But everyone said it should have been served on Party Rye bread like "Hanky Pankys".  Still a big hit.

I made this in the crock pot for my boyfriend and I. We both really liked it but we agree it could use a little more flavor. All we could taste was the cheese. I'm not sure what to add to get more flavor...

I'm not a big velveeta fan at all, but I made this for my son's bday party today.  It was a last minute decision - I made it in 15 min from start to pouring it in the crock.  fast, easy and EVERYONE loved it.  Esp the kids.  I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and 1 lb of ground beef.  I didn't have green onions but no one seemed to notice nor care.  thank you.

I LOVE this recipe!  Like everyone else said, it's very easy to make and very tasty!  I made the cheese, salsa, and onions in my electric fondue pot.  I also added some red pepper flakes for zip.  I think next time I make this, I will try just one pound of sausage when I want it to be more cheesy, or two pounds of sausage (instead of just one pound of ground beef) to switch the flavor up a bit.  There is SO much you can do with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful dip!  I like to spice it up a little by adding a can of refried beans and some jalapeno peppers with the juice!  It is a tasty dip on it's own without these adjustments though!  Thanks!

This was very good! I used more cheese than it called for, just a little to make it creamier. I will make this again!

I was hoping it would taste better, but I don't think pork sausage mixes well with fake cheese.

I made this recipe to take to work for Cheese Day.  I cooked the meat the night before, and this morning threw everything into the crockpot.  It was awesome!  The two kinds of meat really gave it a nice flavor.  Everyone that tried it thought it was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  :)

BEST meat/cheese dip I have ever had.  I used hot italian sausage (taken out of the case) and mexi-velveeta.  It was spicy, but we love it that way!

Oh my freaking gosh, is this good!  If there are men in your life, this is the way to their hearts.  Needs no changes in my opinion.  I now always get requests for "the dip" when I have parties.

To give this a bit more kick and flavor, I added a packet of taco seasoning, a can of diced green chiles, and a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot sauce.  I served as an appetizer before a casual meal with friends, and it was INHALED.  :-)

This is a solid recipe, but being from Louisiana, I found the need add some flavor. The cheese was overpowering and it was very thick. I used cajun hot sausage, a pack of chili seasoning, put 20 or so leftover Taco Bell sauce packets to work, a few good splashes of Louisiana Crystal hot sauce, and some jalepeños. I also added around a cup of milk to thin it out a bit.

this is the best dip ever. The only thing I did different was added shredded monteray jack cheese only because I was short of velveeta. It would've been fine without it I'm sure. Thanks Stephanie

Excellent!  I've made this many times, and I'm always asked to bring it to parties.  You do have to stir to keep it from burning on the sides, but many times, it doesn't that long.  Yum!

This recipe was a big hit. I used mild salsa and ended up adding a can of drained rotel-style tomatoes to give it a kick.  I also added some chili powder (about a teaspoon). And what other reviewers has said is true: there really wasn't anything left to bring home . . . darn it all anyway.  :)

My boyfriend and I made this for a joint birthday party for friends, and we were all pleasantly surprised with how delicious it was. We were at first worried about an overpowering sausage taste, but everything blended so well together that nothing overpowered anything. A simple recipe but definitely worth making again!

I make this all the time but only use a 1lb of meat I season the meat with onions and garlic and chili power, cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika instead of a taco mix, they are way to salty for me.  never tried with the sausage will have to do half and half. I also make pico de gallo and have sliced jalepeno's to top the nachos.

Delicious!!
I used Velveeta simply because it melts beautifully and I added two heaping spoons of cream cheese because after tasting it, I felt it needed it. I also added onion powder, garlic powder and salt simply because we add those to everything. Will be freezing the leftovers for later use.

I used 1 lb. ground venison,  and 1 lb. of  hot ground sausage. Yum, Yum!!  Sometimes I will use just sausage, or sausage and ground beef. Depends upon what I have.  Often I will also add a can of rotel with (or w/o) green chiles/peppers.   This is always a large hit!

This is a great dip my family and friends loved it!! I made some changes I only used one meat which was ground beef and I added a taco seasoning pack for some extra flavor and a little milk to keep the cheese loose.!

I used 1 lb tennessee pride hot sausauge and 1 lb gr beef. Added meat to 2 lbs melted cheese, but as I was adding meat realized it was too much. Only added 1/2 of the meat mixture. I decided to use other half for family to make tacos. My kids don't like tomatoes in the dip, so I have to add about 1 cup milk to make it creamy. I always use taco seasoning for flavor but didn't have any - used ground cumin, garlic salt, and a bit of turmeric (just because). My husband adds salsa on his plate, and I add fresh diced grape tomatoes and iceburg lettuce. Will post a picture to show.

I love this recipe! It turned out amazing and tasted so good. I did use ground turkey and turkey sausage instead to make it lower fat and it still tasted so good.

I used the suggestion of cream of mushroom soup, and mixed all ingredients before adding the meat.  I used Jacks salsa from Costco.  Let me tell you that DH was sooo excited because before the meat it tasted just like his favorite Tumbleweed queso!  I did go ahead and add the meat mix b/c I had already cooked it and this recipe had such rave reviews.  It was too meaty for us.  BUT, we will be making this again and again without the meat!  Thank you  for  leading me to  such a great find!!!

This was okay. I think someone who uses/eats processed cheese often would enjoy it more than someone like me, who has only eaten processed cheese once or twice in their life. It took a few minutes while I was eating the dip to get beyond the weird texture and unfamiliar taste of processed cheese. It also lacked flavor. The green onions add some flavor, but garlic, taco seasonining, or maybe seasoning salt would help. Overall, it wasn't bad... it's just not something I'll ever make again.

This was good.  The only complaint is that there was too much meat....but seriously who says that.  We thought it was good.  I did want a little more kick so I might add some hot peppers next time.  Thanks for the post.

Since previous reviews had said it was thick, I used Tostitos Restaruant style salsa which is a bit watery.  The store only had light Velveta and I think that also made it thinner maybe,  I added the green chillis as suggested and used dehydrated onion.  I actually added about a half cup or more of shredded cheddar to thicken it up.  Needed stirred frequently, but it was very good served with fritos and golden Tostitos. Will make it again because everyone liked it.

It's easy to rely on a recipe like this.  First, it can be prepared easily with just a few common ingredients, which one often has on hand.  Secondly, it's delicious--a recipe that will be a hit anytime, anywhere.  Thirdly, it's flexible.  One can add and subtract a items to suit specialized or regional taste buds.  I used medium salsa, but look forward to making this recipe again with the hot stuff.  If I get really gutsy, I'd like see what a few red pepper flakes add to it.  Spectacular!

Awesome!  This dip is so easy to make, and it tastes great.  I added a cup of milk to thin it out a bit.  I used Tostito's HOT salsa and Jimmy Dean's ground sausage.  I might use a little less sausage or maybe a different type of sausage next time... it has a little too much kick in it.

I will definitely be making this time and time again.

Great dip for a large group.....not sure how to keep it fluid without frequent stirring.  My only question is what kind of 'sausage' does everyone use to prepare this?  Ground Italian?  Sausage pieces in casings? Spicy chorizo with casings removed?   This  ingredient is too vague for me to rate this recipe more than three stars.

This is absolutely deliciious.  No changes needed at all.  Once you get started tasting it, it's hard to stop.  It can be spiced up with hot sausage or by adding red pepper flakes.  A definite keeper.
