I LOVE Poppy Seed Breads and this was no exception!  I cut the recipe in half and used lemon extract in place of the butter extract and added some lemon zest to heighten the lemon flavor.  For the glaze I subbed lemon juice for the orange juice.  It smelled wonderful while it baked and tasted even better.  Perfect with a cup of tea!

I made it for my church's bible school-it was a hit!! My oven browned the sides too quickly so I'll try 325 F next go-around. I added a few drops of almond extract to the glaze as well. Delicious!

Good and scrumptious - everyone in the house enjoyed it. I've made it twice so far, once with the glaze and once without.  I preferred without, as the glaze made the bread a little soggy and made it fall apart easier.

This is a SUPER good bread! The almond flavoring totally makes it, and the glaze is superb. My husband loved it too - he takes it to work with him for breakfast.

Very good and easy to make...I made about 3 dozen mini muffins, a dozen muffins, and a mini loaf...will definitely double up on the lemon flavoring next time around though....but merely because that's my taste, my friend thought it was wonderful as is!

Delicious recipe! I didnt have butter extract so I left that out. I didnt have lemon extract but I used the juice of 1.5 lemons and the peel of one lemon. I doubled the poppy seeds. Family loved it!
