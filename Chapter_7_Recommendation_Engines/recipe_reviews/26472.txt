My 4 year old daughter wanted to make chicken soup.  Time would not allow us to make my usual crock pot recipe.  So, I visited allrecipes.com and found this already 5 star rated recipe and it lives up to that rating!  My daughter had the greatest time making this with me.  We followed the recipe to the "T" and loved every bite!  I know anyone who tries this recipe will thoroughly enjoy it!  Its restaurant quality in our opinion.  My husband and I have recently returned from London.  There we dined in many fine restuarants of which none have come close to this recipe.  A chicken consomme from our 5 star hotel did not compare to the flavors of this recipe.  Try it, enjoy it then share it with others.

I've made this many times and I love it.  I have enhanced/extended it by adding a package of dry Knorr Leek Soup.  It makes it a little creamy and adds vegetable content and color.  I usually use a cooked rotiserie chicken and cook up the carcass for stock after cutting off the meat.

I know it's not quite fair to rate a soup that you have not made as the recipe states...but it was an excellent starting point and for someone who have not made CNS from scratch before I needed a starting point.  As with almost all recipes, I fixed it a little more to my liking and to what I had on hand.
I wouldn't buy a whole chicken simply to boil and make a soup out of.  That's what leftovers are for...to make soup.  Take a broiled chix...eat it and then boil the carcass in enough water to cover.  Shred leftover meat, keep aside.  Drain boiled carcass..toss bones, keep broth.  Add to broth 2 tbsp chix boullion, 2 cubes beef boullion, sliced carrot, onion, celery and chix.  Add the following spices as you see fit: Thyme, basil,parsely, pepper, red pepper flakes (Careful! 1/2 tsp goes a LONG way) noodles of your choice and simmer for 30-40 mins and voila!  Easy chix soup!

This was FANTATIC! I used chicken breasts since we are white meat eaters. I used 32 ounces of chicken stock instead of broth for more flavors and less salt. I've made it twice and just can't force myself to put the packet of chicken soup mix in it. We like diced potatoes and corn in our soup so I addes about 4 small potaotes and 1 cup of corn. Both times, this was the best chicken soup I've ever made. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this soup for my boyfriend who has a cold and it was excellent!  I used 4 chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and since my boyfriend does not like onions I put 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic instead.  I also added more celery, 2 cut up potatoes and sliced zucchini.  The soup was so hearty that I probably did not need to add the pasta.  Thank you so much for this!!! We loved it!

This recipe turned out well for me with three bone-in chicken breasts.  Note she doesn't say how much water to cook the chicken in so the spices and seasonings are all approximate amounts depending on how much water is used in the soup.  This recipe is just right for the experienced chicken soup maker but for those new to it, beware you have to put in seasonings to taste.

I used medium shell pasta and it worked out well.

Awesome soup!  This was my first time making homemade chicken noodle soup and it was fantastic.  I left out the soup packet and subsituted 1 chicken bouillon cube for the 2 beef bouillon cubes that the recipe called for.  My husband said it tastes just like his grandmothers.  Thanks for the recipe...it's definitely a keeper.

This soup is simply delicious.  As it stands, It deserves a 5.  I use the McCormick Slow Cooker - Chicken noodle soup mix.  It has nothing but a bunch of seasonings that riddle this dish with wonderful flavor.  I have made it several times and have found that the liquids get absorbed at different rates if based on your length of cook time.  I have found that as the recipe stands, it absorbs too much of the liquid for my preference, so I usually don't just cover the chicken, but go a few inches over.  I like to add my carrot peels along with the celery leaves when I boil the chicken - may not make much difference, but I think it adds to the nutrients.  I also use about 1 1/2 lbs of boneless chicken breasts if I don't have the whole chicken.  I have reduced the noodles by about half at times and it still turns out great with less liquid absorption.  These suggestions don't seem to detract from the original flavor.  If you like chicken soup, this is the recipe that rocks!!!

Question...Found this recipe and by the review it sounds great.  I have one question I hope someone can answer.  It calls for 1 packet of chicken noodle soup mix...I can only think of Lipton Chicken Noodle??  Is there another soup mix it my be referring to?  Thank you.

This was very good.  My husband and I have bad colds and this was a satisfying meal - made us feel much better!  I used such a big pot though that I feel I had too much water and the way I read the recipe it seemed you were to keep the water even though you did add broth later.  I also added salt and pepper and a bay leaf while I was cooking the whole chicken.  I did feel it was a little light on the vegetables, but that could be due to my having a little too much water.

We made this recipe pretty much as-is, and it was fantastic.   The only thing I might suggest as a change is to not put the pasta in during cooking, as this reduced the amount of broth significantly, and after a night in the fridge, the leftover soup had almost no liquid left. For our next prep, we'll cook the noodles separately, and add them per bowl.

If you really want to make this the BEST Chicken Soup ever...

1) Make a ton.  5 - 6 lb chicken, and double everything.
2) Don't be shy with the pinches.  It needs seasoning.  (Like a Marinara...).  Plenty of pepper, salt, and a little sweetener too.
3) Nix the Soup Mix.  Don't need it.
4) Peppers!  Couple Green and a medley of colored sweet.  Adds color.
5) Bell Seasoning is critical.
6) Garlic should be added.


Regarding the water - it says cover it, that's it.  

I use Egg Noodles instead of bowties.  Looks more like authentic.

Enjoy!

Though I eyeballed the ingredient ratios and tweaked this a bit (added corn, used egg noodles, added garlic, etc.) this was a PHENOMENAL chicken noodle soup base.  The beef broth and dry soup mix (along with the great blend of spices) gave this such a depth of flavor.  AWESOME for a snow storm weekend!  Thanks!

This is the best recipe for Chicken Soup I have ever tried. I have done a lot of chicken soups but never found them to have enough flavour. My Grandmother taught me how to make chicken soup, but this is amazing..I make it all the time and everyone loves it. I was visiting my home town and friend ended up with a bad cold, well chicken soup to the rescue, he could not believe how this soup tasted...top quality...better than you would get at any restaurant. I do change the noodle to an egg noodle that is fine or alphabet ones, but whatever makes you smile is what I make it with.

I hate to say this...but this soup had a funky taste.  I don't know if it was from the soup mix, but that's what I think.  I never add unnatural ingredients to my soups and should have stayed true to that.

I'm a huge soup lover but this was my first experience making homemade chicken soup. It won't be my last this was perfect! Everyone in my family was sick with a bad cold. So, despite being August and 90 degrees outside I decided a batch of chicken soup is just what we needed! This was also my first try at boiling a whole chicken I boiled mine on low for nearly two hours and it was so yummy! The meat was literally falling off the bone. I also boiled my chicken with a few stalks of celery and an onion. I then used my homemade chicken stock instead of using canned broth. It was delicious! I also added garlic, a chopped onion and a package of cream of spinach. Added a bit of color and nutrients. It was wonderful! Just what we needed. Even my picky three year old enjoyed it. It made enough to feed an army. We ate leftovers for 3 days! I will definitely make this again. Next time I might use egg noodles instead of the bow tie. There were a little large and hard for my kids to spoon. Otherwise perfect!!

I love this recipe. It is the one that started me off on this site. I use barill medium shells instead of bow tie and also add about .5 teaspoons full of red pepper flakes.  Additionally, I add a can of tomato sauce and a full bag of fresh spinach.    Delicious with the quick yeast roll recipe I have saved.  Yum!

I am a complete novice. I've never made soup in my life. I don't enjoy cooking..however, I wanted to try this recipe for a very sick friend. Well, the soup turned out fantastic! Easy and great! The best I've ever had!  I tweeked it as other reviewers said to do, I added the Leek soup mix, (awesome)and corn. The longer you simmer it the more tasty it gets..SO excellent! My friend was amazed and my family had a really great meal as well.  The recipe does not say how much water to add at the beginning, but I just made sure the chicken was immersed when boiling it. I did not cover it, ever, so the water evaporated and it worked out perfectly! Bon appetit!

Best soup ever.  I followed it to a tee and there wasn't any leftovers at all. My son doesn't like onions and I don't like texture of cooked celery, so I chop these very fine and when I remove the chicken I strain the stock.  You still have the flavor and my son doesn't even know he is eating onion.  Definate keeper!

Well, I dont have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen, so I threw the chicken into a pressure cooker! Covered with water, added the celery, and brought it up to pressure. According to the chart, it only needed 15 minutes at that point, so I gave it 20. Worked great! Chicken was very soft and tender. recommend it in a time crunch. followed various other suggestions regarding spices and other veggies.

THAT WAS GOOD! I had 2 large skinless chicken breasts and 2 thighs with skin in the fridge and decided to make this.  I'm thinking that using an entire chicken probably would have given the broth more flavor, but this worked.  Put the chicken in a soup pot and added cold water so that the chicken was immersed with about an inch or so of water over the chicken (figured it would boil off).  Boiled the chicken for about 30 minutes.  Used tongs and a meat thermometer to make sure the chicken was done (I'm a total novice).  Put the chicken aside to cool and left the stock liquid in the pot.  Basically followed #2 after that...added some peppercorns thyme and parsley without measuring..just a bit of each.  Also added some salt..probably 2 tbsp.  Did not add poultry seasoning or basil or bay leaves 'cause I didn't have them.  The soup mix I used was Shore Lunch Chicken Soup mix that my wife bought at Whole Foods (I think). Once the vegies were about done (prob 30 more minutes), I added the chicken back and 1/2 box of Barilla Farfale noodles (the soup mix had noodles, but not enough).  Let it simmer till the noodles were done..thats it..tasty and delicious..

This is the second time I've LOVE it. I don't use the packet of dried soup, but add extra broth. I use orzo instead of bow tie pasta. My only problem is My "pinch" is about a teaspoon. I will make this many more times.

This is a good recipe to start with when you can't remember how to make chicken soup!  This is fairly close to what my mom and aunt use to make when I was growing up.  I did not use the chicken noodle soup mix and I boiled the chicken with the celery and carrots and onions first.  Spices should be used to taste too. After straining the broth when the chicken was cooked, I added additional carrots to the broth and simmered until the carrots were cooked.  I personally like more carrots in my soup.    I used orzo as the pasta.  Do not put the pasta into the soup, it will absorb too much of the broth.  I cook the pasta (your choice) and then put it into individual soup bowls and then add the soup into each bowl.  Store leftover pasta separately from your soup.  I love the Orzo or Asini De Pepe pasta with chicken soup instead of the larger types of pasta that can be used.  Turned out really good!  Nothing like chicken soup on a cold rainy day.

I hate soup in general but it was snowing... THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST SOUP I HAVE EVER TASTED. Good enough that I'm putting it in our family cookbook that I plan on giving to my daughter when she goes to college. The only changes I made was using boneless breasts & putting everything in the crockpot after the chicken was boiled. I didn't have the chicken stock but I think it would've only made it taste even better. I added water.

This really is the best chicken soup! I followed this recipe almost to the T, I had a 3 1/2 chicken, only used 1/4 of a onion and no peppercorns, used 1/4 tsp pepper instead. The directions confused me because I wasn't sure how much water to use but I followed as directed and just covered the chicken. it turned out perfect.  I noticed that others used chicken breast because they didn't like dark meat. I don't recommended using just the breast. There is much more flavor when you use a whole chicken. Plus if you use a slightly larger chicken you can get more white meat.

This really is wonderful! It makes a huge amount of soup but my husband and two friends finished it off in less than two days! I didn't use a whole chicken--3lbs. of bone-in half breasts was actually a lot easier and was plenty of meat. This is truly comfort food at its best.

I hate to say anything negative about this recipe, I really loved it... BUT it needs a bit of revision! I was going to use the entire 1 pound of baby carrots, but when I started adding them, realized I would wind up with carrot soup with chicken. Amount of carrots needed to be cut WAY back.  I used 1/2 and it was still way too much.  I wound up scooping lots out after cooking. (And I do like carrots!) Also needs lots more liquid. This boiled down too much. Added almost a quart more broth and water.  Needs more liquid, way fewer carrots. I loved the flavor. And don't add any salt!!!!

Like others I was skeptical of adding boullion cubes and powdered chicken soup to what could be a nice natural soup.  But, it did boost the flavor in a wonderful way  - and boy did I get the compliments.  When I simmered my chicken parts I added the usual celery, carrot, onion, and some herbs to make my own broth. Try it - you will be suprised!

Very good recipe for basic chicken noodle soup.  I added my own extra touches (spices and vegetables on hand) to customize it.  Didn't use the chicken noodle soup mix (yuck) as I wanted to keep it as healthy as possible.  Also didn't use canned chicken broth, but my own homemade chicken stock to add more volume.  You can experiment with this recipe to make it your own...use what you have on hand and it will be great!  Cooked it for many hours to develop the flavors and added the pasta during the last 10 minutes before serving.

This was a good base. I ended up adding a few things to the soup ...  Plus I used a whole chicken and adding fresh herbs, garlic, onion and mushrooms making a stock out of the liquid. I used a rotini pasta as I had it in my pantry. Turned out great.

SOOOOOOO GOOOOODDDD!!!! I made this last year for my husband who gets recurrent tonsillitis infections but forgot to save the recipe. Sure enough he got a 2nd one and I was frantically searching through all of the site's recipes until I found it once again. I made it with boneless chicken breasts for more time/convenience and added peas, corn and potatoes. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!! My husband and I love love love this recipe!!!!

My sister said this was "as good" as our Mothers chicken soup..but we won't tell Mom! (wink wink): Followed closely although didn't add the chicken noodle soup mix as I wanted to keep it au natural: natural stock and broth were enough chicken flavor....used wide egg noodles instead of bow-ties, and chopped fresh carrots instead of babies. Simply wonderful...even better second and third days!!!

great ideas for amazing soup. I used all natural chicken broth only no beef bouillon, no noodle soup mix. I used whole wheat egg noodles and added diced red potato and garlic. I always cook my noodles seperately then add at the last minute as they will soak up the good broth. Mmmmm! Gave it 4 stars just cuz I made it my own. Make it yours!

This soup was excellent! It had a lot of flavor and I only changed a few things: used chicken breasts with bones instead of the whole chicken, used chicken bouillon instead of beef and whole wheat noodles instead of regular farfalle.

I made this recipe on a cold spring day and it was a great comfort food!  I used 4 cubed chicken breasts, covered the meat with water, threw all of the other ingredients in the pot at once and simmered away.  I added one xtra bag of chicken soup mix which gave me extra flavor & all the pasta I needed without adding anything extra at the end.  I also added lots of garlic and some peas and corn.  If you do add more pasta, be sure to cook it separately first to avoid losing all of your tasty broth. I also made fresh bread to go with and it was great for dipping.  Like most soups/stews I can hardly wait to see how much better it gets over the next one or two days......can it get any better?  This is one for everyone's recipe book.  Easy and delicious. No fuss all flavor!!!

My husband was up all night very ill with a stomach virus. Since he was still a bit queasy, I wanted to make him a healthy chicken soup. This fit the bill. I followed the recipe exactly, with the only exceptions being following other reviewers tips and adding a bit of garlic and spinach. He and I just finished eating it. It really is a delicious soup, although I am glad it makes plenty because I feel sure it will taste better the next day. The only ingredient I wasn't crazy about in this soup was the addition of the chicken noodle soup mix, it seemed I could taste it in every bite. But that is a personal thing because a few years ago I lost 110 pounds and I ate a lot of that stuff, so it is not a taste I like to relive!! Though I didn't really love this soup as I had hoped, it was something I felt really good about serving to my sick hubby. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent chicken soup recipe. I always get asked for the recipe. My family isn't crazy about pasta so I put in more veggies. Sometimes I prefer a more "sagey" flavor, so I double the poultry seasoning. Thanks for sharing,Carrie.

This turned out to be very good chicken soup.  Instead of cutting the chicken into pieces I shredded mine by hand (time consuming) but well worth it.  My wife and 16 month old daughter loved it.  It is great.

Excellent! Used what I had on hand (daughter and grandson both have colds with fevers). I used 4 chicken leg quarters, added some mixed veggies--didn't have any pasta so I threw in the macaroni from a boxed mac & cheese. Also used chicken soup base since I didn't have the chicken soup mix.

I made this for my family that was visiting from Fla. Being that is was cold here I thought this would be a good idea never done homemade before. This was a really great recipe with a few changes. I put it all in the crockpot and cooked it all day long,didn't use the soup mix(didn't need it)I used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken(less grease)No noodles.Added more celery less carrots. It was sooo good.

I have to say that I will keep this easy recipe for ever. I follow this recipe to the T but I added two garlic cloves and didn't put the chicken soup powder pocket  because I didn't I have any. Instead of pasta I always use 1/2 cup of rice. This chicken soup turn out to be Delicious!!! Thank you ones again.

I made this a couple of days ago, after having dealt with a miserable cold all week, and it was a perfect, healthy and delicious soup.  I made no real changes to the recipe, just made it as the recipe stated.  Everyone loved it, and I have to agree, its the best chicken soup I've ever made.  I will be making this one again!

All hail the best chicken soup ever!  I made a few additions... I used all fresh herbs, and added fresh dill, (a few small sprigs.  Also, Shitake Mushrooms are a fantastic addition.  This was the PERFECT cure for my boyfriends stomach flu and some very satisfying helpings for me.  REALLY looking forward to making this one again.  It will become a regular recipe for us.

Hmmm, this is a hard one for me to rate because I was unsure of the packet of chicken noodle soup mix.....I didn't want to put dehydrated veges in my homemade soup so I omitted it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, and again was unsure of the beef bouillon, but it seemed to work.  I do think that the broth lacked the "chicken" flavor that my normal broth has, but it was well worth the shot.  I cooked my pasta before adding it to the soup so it didn't consume all of the broth.  Thanks for the post Carrie.

Wonderful! The only thing that I did different was, I didn't have beef bouillon cubes, so I used 2 tsp of beef bouillon granules. Also I used 3 carrots and chopped them finely. I only used 1/2 of an onion, my family is not big on onions. I also added salt.

I was looking for a good, hearty chicken noodle soup recipe to chase my daughter's and wife's Summer colds away...and this one exceeded my expectations!! The package of dry chicken noodle soup and the beef boullion seemed like overkill at first, but they don't add body woithout over-powering the soup.  Likewise, the basil, thyme, and other seasonings do not overpower either.  Rather they contibute to a sweet, clean taste to compliment the soup's full body.  No, this is not your mother's chicken soup.  It is much, much better.

One of our local grocery stores has wonderful roasted whole chickens at a very fair price. I buy one almost every week and make stock from the bones when it's almost gone. Great broth and with this recipe, great soup. Thank you.

This recipe was not only easy but it was EXACT with the measurements. The only thing I added was additional poultry seasoning as there is not an exact amount and it needed more than a "pinch". I also added salt.

Crazy good.  I made a few modifications:

- My husband likes egg drop soup, so right before serving, I let the soup get to a rolling boil and slowly poured the mixture of 4 eggs into it.

- Rosemary is a great substitute for any of the spices below that you don't happen to have.

- My husband has comforting memories of his mother using Lipton Noodle soup, so I used angel hair pasta broken into small pieces for the noodles.  It really did have the "look" of that old standby for sick kids.

Oh My God!  Best chicken soup I've ever made!  The noodle soup mix definitely gives it more dimension.  Here were my changes: I Googled poultry seasoning as I did not have it on hand, was able to make it from scratch with various spices.  Also used a rotissertie chicken from the store and 10 cups of chicken broth.  Only 1 onion.  Thank you Carrie K.!

I concur!  This is the best chicken soup ever!  I've also made it with barley instead of bow tie pasta and it was just as tasty.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Today I woke up with a cold and the urge to cook something from scratch so what better to make than chicken soup - except I'm not a fan chicken noodle soup.  Considering that my only experience with chicken noodle soup was from a can, I decided to throw caution to the wind and make this soup.  Coming from someone who doesn't like celery or cooked onions, this soup is quite good.  The vegetables cooked up nice and soft so they're a non-issue, and combined with the pasta and the chicken, the soup is quite satisfying.   If I had it to do again, I think I would use dark meat chicken only as it's wonderfully moist. Oh! And after having a bowl of this soup, my cold feels much better!

Pretty Good bowl of soup.  I thought the recipe was really good and I make alot of soups.  I put much more of the spices than called for, as I thought it would be pretty bland without.  I also used little shells instead of bowties.  All in all it was a winner.  Only 4 stars because of spices. Thanks Carrie  for posting it!

This soup is awesome. It was my first time to ever use a whole chicken, and I went for a 5.5 pounder and doubled the recipe as I was making it for a few sick friends.  I was hesitant to use so much water at the beginning because it just seemed like a TON of broth.  In the end, though, it was not as liquidy as I would have liked, and I ended up adding about 6 extra cups of water. I did have to add a LOT more of every spice, or I believe this would have ended up pretty bland.  I also did not use the 2 cans of chicken broth since it seemed like so much liquid at that point.  Then I was able to add some salt for flavor and not worry too much about sodium content!

I was very excited to try making this homemade soup because of the recipes, but I have to say that I found this recipe bland beyond belief.  I followed everything to a "t", but was not impressed with the finished product.

this is delicious. While I was making it, my husband kept telling me I was wasting time because we could just eat the stuff in the can. When I gave him a bowl for dinner the next day he changed his tune and asked when I would be making it next. Thank you for a wonderful recipe and remember that it is worth the time and extra attention.

I have never made homemade chicken soup.  I've always enjoyed others.  It was quite chilly today so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was fabulous!!!  I did add a bit of salt to it though and simmered it for about 4 hours.  Didn't get a whole lot of meat off of the whole chicken but it was sufficient.  Served the soup with a a salad and crescent rolls.  The bow tie pasta was adorable.  My husband thought it was a unique touch!  We will definitely add this soup to our favorites list!

This was so good.  I added a potato and a can of corn.  I didn't cook it as long as it said because then everything would be too mushy.  I didn't have all the ingredients, like the package of chicken soup mix, but this still turned out really good.  And I had some fresh green beans so I added those, too.  Really yummy.

This is a super recipe. I would be careful about putting too much bow-tie pasta in though. The Pasta absorbs a LOT of broth. The recipe makes a TON of soup so be prepared to store some leftovers.

I enjoyed this a lot.  I didn't have any thyme, so I left that out and small egg noodles - not bow tie. 

Very good flavor and better the second and third days - yum.

This is a keeper.

This was the perfect soup for me to make, I wanted Chicken Soup, but not all day.  I used only chicken breasts, two large one, did not have chicken soup on hand, but used dry vegetable soup w/ noodle, (great choice).  I did not use farfel as I wanted to used amish egg noodles.    This soup really is the best, just enough seasoning, not saltly.   Love this soup

I have made this soup many times and we just love it!  I must confess though, that I add about 3 times the spices that the original recipe calls for--"pinches" of these marvelous flavors are just not enough!  Also, we live in Bulgaria and the soup mix and the canned broth are not available to purchase.

It's a keeper.  My husband says it's the best .... so , for us that's what it is!!   It was worth making if it was only for the amazing aroma that permeated our home!  Lol.   It just smelled so good.  Definitely will make it again.  I thought i had too much liquid so I kept the extra aside and then after adding the noodles, which I went sparingly on, I realised that extra liquid was needed, and poured it back in.

The taste was great.  If you like alot of liquid (as I do), you should consider cooking the pasta on the side and add it as required.  If you add the whole box, it soaks up most of the liquid.  Addition of garlic might be appealing to some.

I submerged the chicken in the pot in lo sodium chicken broth and a bit of water to just cover chicken. As beef boullion is too salty for me, I added a beef bone to my soup which made it incredibly delicious! Added celery, dashes of salt and pepper and after boiling for 10 minutes or so turned it to simmer for an hour or so. Processed and added sliced carrots and chopped onion and bag of frozen egg noodles and spices and brought broth to boiling again then turned to simmer for about an hour. Really really good! 
It is sitting now out on the patio table covered (away from my dogs)  in the wintry cold for grease to solidify to easily scoop off and enjoy for lunch and throughout the week!

I actually only used this recipe for  guidance on timing, measurement of  liquid and seasonings. Did NOT use soup mix or beef bouillon as did not want the MSG. Instead I used Better Than Bouillon(organic) by Superior Touch. It's hard to find in the average grocery store but I find it in Kings in the North Jersey area.  The seasonings suggested resulted in a delicious soup. Thank you:-)

I've made and played with this recipe countless times and honestly it cant be improved very much. I recommend using much more onion than the recipe calls for. The biggest thing to watch out by far for is adding too much salt, you'll quickly have a bowl of chicken flavored salt.

Delicious! My husband raved about it. Dry herbs can be expensive. Subbed with 1-2 TBS of Herbs de Provence. Worked great ...

I'm sick right now.  BAD cold, feeling really yucky.  I decided to make this soup.  It feels like it's a bit time consuming to chop everything up, but I don't feel well, so I'm a little grumpy :-/  ANYWAY, I got this done and WOW!  It is delicious!  I read ALL of the reviews, so I took some advice and added 3 cloves of garlic, minced to the broth.  I had about 3 cups of leftover chicken from the Peruvian Beer Can Chicken I made from this site so I was thrilled to not have to go out and buy anything.  I had everything I needed for this recipe already in my pantry with the exception of the chicken noodle soup mix.  I had some Swanson's Flavor Boost packets of chicken flavoring, so I just used them.  This soup is OUTSTANDING and I am eating it as I am writing this.  I'm already starting to feel better :-)  Thanks CarrieK   I'm such a foodie, I actually took a picture of it too!

Tried recipe and it is truly the best.I used low sodium chicken stock with no msg, use your favorite chicken can or liquid boxed chicken stock. I used two different brands cause Iran out and found not all stocks taste the same, but it still turned out to be a great chicken soup. I recommend you try this recipe, you will keep making it years to come for your family. I cooked this soup in the crock pot for six hours on high and added the noodles after it was done.

My family just loved this.  I boiled the whole chicken, like the instructions state but I always have to add extra spices- I'm so bad about not measuring spices but I added black grinder peppercorn, ground red pepper, garlic powder, parsley, Ms. Dash (garlic), some more garlic powder, nutmeg, garlic powder, salt, garlic powder, thyme, garlic powder, bay leaves, garlic powder, rubbed sage and garlic powder. 
I didn't have celery so instead I added added 3 potatoes, with skin, clubbed, a head of broccoli, cauliflower, big bag of baby carrots and fresh spinach leaves (add spinach leaves when soup is just about done).   This was just AMAZING!!!

Love this!  It was not "easy" but worth the effort.  I didn't add carrots because I didn't have any and did not add the pasta but it still turned out incredibly flavorable.  We'll have leftovers tonight (can't wait!) and I may add some shredded cabbage to it - just because I like it.  Would be wonderful with dumplings, too!  I'll do this again!

Love this recipe.  Have made it many times and it always gets good reviews.  Have learned over time to go with large chicken - 3 lbs and thus more water to start off with.  Fill the pot until the chicken is completely submerged. Also later on when simmering I cover the pot as you lose too much liquid to evaporation otherwise.  Lastly try to buy the small bow ties (if you have the option) so they don't overwhelm the soup.  It really is fabulous - I rarely see anyone adding salt or pepper at the table!

Just love this chicken soup, must cook chicken  low and slow though so it doesn't get tough. I don't see the need to put the chicken back in and cook it like crazy after initial 30 minutes; I did add the bones back in to the broth after removing the chicken for the final cooking with vegies.

This recipe was a hit with me! I found it a very classic delicious chicken noodle soup. I used whole grain bow tie pasta, too add more healthiness to it, and cheated with a already cooked rotissere chicken.

Delicious! I increased this recipe and used 2 whole chickens and 4 gallons of water. Don't overcook the bowtie pasta as it will swell and get a bit mushy. Used a bit more of the spices. Great soup!

I made this a few weeks ago and loved it! I added about a pound of chopped potatoes, a few cloves of garlic and used a smaller pasta. This was my first time making soup and I was very happy with the way it came out. Will definitely make it again!

I made this for my husband when he was sick, despite not having an appetite...he had three bowls! We are garlic lovers so I always load mine with garlic. I am making it again today! With all of the spices, it makes the house smell wonderful as well.

I have to agree tith the name of this recipe.  Very good!  I used an extra beef bullion cube and extra garlic to tone down the chicken-y flavor.

Excellent starter. I added additional two cans of chicken broth.  Used about a cup of the liquid that I cooked the chicken in with a crumbled chicken bouillon. Shredded chicken and added a box of frozen peas to the soup.  Instead of farfalle I used a cup of try ACINI DI PEPE a very tiny pasta to the last 15 minutes of simmering.  THAT'S WHY I NEED THE EXTRA LIQUID.. Yummy!!

This chicken soup is fantastic--but it turns out more like a stew than a soup. I make it for my husband every time he's sick, usually while he's sleeping, and the aromas from the kitchen waft into the bedroom and wake him with a smile on his face. It's definitely enough soup to feed a family of two for an entire week, and you won't want to stop eating it! Fantastic recipe, thank you!

Great recipe!  I used my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving to make this soup.  The only change other than the turkey was fresh parsley and oregano and I used fresh ground pepper.  I also added two additional chicken bouillon cubes.  For the water I put everything together and then added water to my desired consistency.  Delicious!  Thanks.

My family really liked this soup!  I omitted the celery & onion, and replaced it with celery seed and onion powder.  It was still very hearty with just the noodles, chicken, and carrots, and the broth was full of flavor.  My teenage boys gave this soup an A+.  I will definitely make this again!

Husband and kids loved it.  I thought it was a little greasy.  I might try using chicken pieces next time instead of a whole chicken.  Will definitely be making again.

great soup.  I usually follow the directions religiously the first time I make something, but I didn't have any thyme and I did add some garlic powder.  The family loved it, especially the bow tie pasta instead of the usual noodles.

This soup is worthy of its name!!  It is SO good and very easy to make.  The only changes that I made were to use split chicken breasts (with bone in) and I left out the celery .. didn't have any.  I used some celery seed and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Excellent!!  Thanks!!

My family loved this soup. You would have thought my 2 year old had never eaten before, the way she was eating. I also had no chicken noodle soup mix, but I did also add 4 chicken bouillon cubes. This is so delicious and so much better than the canned overpriced Progresso and Campbell's soups.

I let the chicken simmer for about 4 hours,then left the chicken in the pot for a few more hours so the broth is really flavored.Omitted the canned broth as we like our food fresh.Added a tablespoon of fresh basil,and a tablespoon of fresh parsley,and a 1/2 teaspoon of Turkish sweet hot red pepper paste.Also put in a whole onion did'nt chop the onion.Removed it after soup cools.Also omitted the beef bouillon cubes.Omitted the thyme.Used Birds tongue pasta(smaller pasta,doesnt get mushy)

I thought this was pretty good, but not nearly as fantastic and other reviewers have stated. I used a large boneless chicken breast to make 2 servings. I didn't have farfalle so I just broke in half some thin linguine, and threw that in. Finally, I had half a spud that needed using up so I diced it, and added it too. Not bad, but I think I prefer cream-based soups.

This was the best chicken noodle soup I have ever tasted...but I made a LOT of adjustments to taste.  Alot more seasonings and more boullion cubes...I also had to add more water often because the noodles do absorb a lot of the broth.  Fantastic soup, though!

This was very good but I agree with others that you really have to play with the spices depending on how much water it takes to cover the chicken.  We had a snowstorm last night and this hit the spot just right served with a warm bread.  Thanks Carrie

mine turned out to be more of a mush than a soup, after over an hour of simmering, my broth has disappeared. The beef bouillon flavor has taken over making it a very beefy flavored chicken soup.

Wow!  Great comfort food especially on a rainy day.  I followed this recipe exactly and thought it came out perfect.  Just season to your taste and it couldn't be easier.  The bow tie pasta really dresses it up!

My first experience with making my own home-made soup...I also add a little flour/cornstarch and water to thicken it. This is my all-time favorite to make (and eat!) now. My husband loves it, too!  Highly recommended, you can't get much better than this!

This soup was great, except that I added more chicken cubes, 3 to be exact afer it was done.  I used a 3 1/2 lb chicken, let it boil for over an hour, and followed the recipe after that.  I found that there wasn't enough chicken, or it was hiding behind WAY too many bowties, which I believe, are way too big for a soup.  I will use this recipe again, but definitely use soup-sized shells or something as small and use more chicken to begin with.  This is a great Rx for these cold winter months and it freezes well.  Thanks Carrie.

This makes a lot of soup!!!  Great if you have a big family or want to share.  The recipe is really nice - I altered it a bit though.  I had to use a lot more than two boullion cubes, and I used chicken instead of beef.  I didn't add the peppercorns - didn't have any so I just added regular pepper.  It tasted really chickeny and good - perfect for a cold winter day or if you're feeling puny.  I'll definitely make again.  Loved the bow-tie pasta in it!

My standby recipe for comfort food or cold weather food. I Love This Soup!  My family loves it when they see me cooking this soup and start with a whole chicken because they know how great it turns out every time. One friend of mine encouraged me to make a side business out of selling this soup!  LOL! I never tried that but only make it for friends and family.

This was excellent! I just needed some help with spices and the broth to create a yummy chicken soup and this was perfect! I didn't boil the whole chicken - just used leftover, cooked diced chicken (2 cups). I also didn't have carrots or celery, but I had 2 medium sweet potatoes, which I diced. They made a nice substitute. I don't keep poultry seasoning on hand, so I put in a pinch of sage instead and I added a little extra basil. 1/4 tsp pepper instead of the peppercorns. Because I didn't boil the whole chicken to create a stock, I needed extra liquid. I mixed 4 cups boiling water with the 2 beef bouillon cubes. I also added 4 cups extra boiling water with the chicken broth. That was about perfect. One reviewer asked where to find chicken soup mix. The recipe called for chicken noodle soup mix - which would be the larger version of lipton's cup o' soup - it DOES have noodles, but they were nice in the soup. My family all really enjoyed this and it was easy with the diced chicken!

This is a good base but one of my favorite secret ingredients to add to really give chicken soup AMAZING flavor is Worcheshire sauce!  Add just a little or a lot for a great bit of zest!  Try it, you'll like it!

I suggest using chicken soup base instead of chicken soup package. Also found it more flavourful to use chunks of whole carrots instead of preformed baby carrots.

Always a favorite here! First time my son had it he said"Mom, you can make this every night and I will eat it". And he is a picky eater! Wonderful!

Very good. I added some curry powder. I also sliced regular carrots. I used tagliatelle egg noodles. Perfect.

This is such a great and basic recipe for chicken soup. You really can add whatever vegetable you want. In addition to the veggies listed here I also add parsnips and escarole and fresh parsley. I didn't use the chicken soup mix just added more bouillon and chicken broth. It's great!

Wow! Amazing soup! Our new favourite! The flavour was fantastic. Only made some minor adjustments. Used chicken stock (3 litres) rather than make my own - just makes it easier. I love a tasty soup and this far exceeded my expectations. Best chicken soup ever is correct! 10/10. Thank you for an awesome recipe. Everyone MUST try this soup. So worth it! Have made it 3 times already!

Wonderful recipe! Added some onion, and carrot to the chicken while boiling. Added in zucchini, and spinach. Couldn't find chicken noodle soup mix so I left it out. Tasted and added salt and pepper to taste. Not feeling well and this hit the spot! Ty for the recipe:-)

This recipe was delicious.  I would definitely make it again.   I know that a whole chicken with the bones do add a lot of flavor to a stock, but I think next time I may make it with a few chicken breasts to cut down on the length of time it took.   I just wonder how much fat is in this recipe?

I made this last night. I did not have chicken soup flavor(whatever that is).  Some people said they made it without that. I don't think it had enough chicken taste so I had to go get chicken bouillon to give it more chicken flavor. Otherwise great recipe.

This dish was absolutely delicious and easy to prepare! Finally a chicken soup with lots of meat (yum) and not overly salted! My very picky daughter told me it was her second favorite dish (next to mac & cheese of course). I don't like to alter recipes but I did leave out the soup mix, I wanted to keep it as natural and wholesome as possible-- the herbs and spices required for the recipe offer plenty of flavor and saltiness.

I think my big mistake with this was to not take the skin off the chicken before boiling it; made for a lot of fat but my mistake. My only other suggestion might be to add the vegetables a little later as they seem kind of overcooked.

This was REALLY good - I loved the bow ties in it and the flavor was excellent.  Next time I will DEFINITELY use chicken breasts instead....there was a lot of work involved.  I did not use the chicken soup packet because I didn't want anything packaged with all my fresh veggies.  Overall I will make this again!

Kids liked it but when I tried to make it again, they said no. They wanted "canned soup." Good basic recipe. I thought it was great though with a few other additions.

This recipe is really good.  I made very few changes.  I left out the beef bullion and added lots of garlic.  I also used 3 bone in chicken breasts.  I will have enough left over to add a few more veggies thicken it and make a chicken pot pie for another meal.

Very good.  I didn't keep any of the broth from cooking the chicken, but needed too.  The chicken soup mix that I needed left it so that I didn't need to add the noodles.  Very good, would do again.

This was excellent.  Instead of bow tie, I used gnocchi pasta shells (which I hadn't seen before) which gave a little bowl of broth in every bite.  Yummy!!!!  The whole family enjoyed this.  Just what the doctor ordered with all the colds going around.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe. As I didn't have any celery on hand I omitted it. I don't think it hurt it a bit. Thanks.
