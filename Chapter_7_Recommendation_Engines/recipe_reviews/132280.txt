As others have mentioned, this is a common way to serve jicama in Mexico. If you have a Mexican section in your supermarket, try to find a seasoning in a shaker bottle called "tajin"  that combines lime, salt and chiles. It is used for everything here, and is what I use to sprinkle on jicama. Love it.

Fabuloso! I used to eat this all the time when I was a student in Mexico.  You can use lemon juice if you don't have fresh lime juice, although lime is better to me.

Great for adding fiber to your diet.  In many areas of Central and Southern Mexico you'll find this as a traditional restaurant mainstay, served at the table like the bread basket when you first sit down.

I have been eating Jicama like this for years. This is the normal in Mexico.  You have to like lime or you won't like this.  It does have a lot of flavor and people who do not like anything spicie probably won't like it. If you like your food bland then this is not for you. I personally love it.

My jicama was on the small side, so I only used one tablepoon of chili powder.  Also, before I juiced the limes, I zested them and threw the zest in as well.  I thought this tasted a little flat, so I added a sprinkling of garlic powder, some kosher salt and a good grinding of pepper.  I probably ended up using more than 2 tablespoons of lime juice, I just squeezed two limes over the jicama.  I was quite pleased with the end result and I'm taking these to work to snack on.  Thanks so much for the post, BECCAS911!

This didn't do it for us, so we poured rice wine vinegar over it and added salt, and that was better. I think there's not enough lime juice called for here, probably because the size of "1 jicama" can vary a lot; you may need to adjust on the fly. For our tastes this required the addition of salt. (Note: I added a cucumber and doubled the recipe, but left the chili powder measurement the same, due to the color.)

I wasn't thrilled with this at first, as was used to jicama tasting sweet, but it grew on me.  The next day it was even better... and now I am a big fan!  Thanks for introducing me to this new idea!!

This is delicious, nutritious (very high in Vit. C), very low calorie, and so easy!  Love the crunch.  I've used just cayenne pepper before but chili powder is much better.  To get the jicama completely covered with lime juice I put it in a container with a sealable top, add the juice, cover and shake. I didn't measure but did use more than 2 T lime juice. Then I put it on a serving plate and sprinkle with the chili powder. Any leftovers stay fresh in the fridge for quick snacks, and to add smaller pieces to a salad for a nice crunch.

I did not like this very much, but I was happy to have tried jicama.  Now my experience with it will give me a better idea of what to do with it in the future.

Jicama is a very unusual root to me, but as I was looking for new and unusual things to try, I made this recipe.  This was very easy to do and very hydrating and healthy treat.

This was my first time buying jicama. I actually had some in Mexico once but didn't know that is what I was eating. I enjoyed this and will make again.

Sorry, I don't like giving negative reviews, but just thought I'd share.  I love jicama, but this just tasted "tinny."  I followed this as written, and just didn't care for the taste.  I'll dip my jicama in ranch dressing instead.

I've at Jicama like this since I was a child. To add some sweetness to the recipe, cut some pears into it! I promise you won't be disappointed!! Continue with the Chile and lime! Healthy, light and fresh.

Simple, easy, refreshing. A great thing to put out there with the guac, salsa, and chips. I used bottled lime juice (shhhhh), but people thought it was great.

Tasty, very easy, crunchy and refreshing.  My Mex-Flavors-loving hubby really likes it as an accompaniment to our noontime meal.  I seem to rarely use a whole jicama when I’m making other recipes and now I have a simple way to add spice to a meal AND use up the rest of the jicama!

I remember my mother making a jicama fruit salad. She would put oranges, jicama, cucumbers and mango, lime juice, salt and Chile powder. Sometimes it was just the jicama, like this recipe. Delicious either way. I use Tajin (a combo of spices, Chile and lime juice) and fresh squeezed lime juice. I love it!

This is a very common way to serve jicama cold in  many of the southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and the Hawaiian Islands besides in some central and South American countries. The crunchy sweet mixed with the fresh lime juice and a kick of the chili s so refreshing.  Easy to make and a big hit with a crowd.

I have never worked with jicama before and it showed. I wanted this as a go-to snack in the fridge and it didn't work well for me. I think it still could be a good recipe

All new to me and wonderful. Loved it plain.  Loved it this way. And also made jicama hash with diced jicama, onions, peppers, and a smidge of garlic sauteed in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, salt, chili powder....good with eggs. I am delighted to discover a new (to me)  taste and texture

I liked it, and my husband did also, but we both thought that 2 tablespoons chili pepper was way too much. It was thick and pasty on the jicama, and I ended up rubbing my pieces off on a paper towel to remove some of the powder. Next time I will just sprinkle a  light coating on and add to taste.

This was simple and a little nicer than just being plain.  I’ll make it again.

My preferred seasoning of choice is Tajin. This needed more lime juice.

As posted, it is bland.  I doctored it and it turned out very tasty: Blend cilantro, 1/2  de-veined and seeded jalepeno, honey, rice vinegar and fresh squeezed lime.
