Delicious. Easy to make and the smell in the house while the pork cooks was so mouthwatering.  The smokiness was intoxicating, the sweet salty tastes were well flushed. I served it on polenta and drizzled the sauce over the pork and polenta.  This recipe was most excellent.

Yummy!  I made it just as he directed, loved it!  The next day I chopped up the leftovers, added some frozen corn, and put sweet cornbread batter on top and baked it until the cornbread was cooked through.  That was also amazing!

I cooked pork tenderloin in the slow cooker and prepared the sauce separately. It came out very nicely. The sauce was fantastic. Nice work, Chef John!

Incredible. Don't give it a second thought  just make it. My only modification was to use apple cider vinegar. I think I will double the braising sauce and reserve half for left overs. Not sure how to thicken it yet, but I will.

This was fine but I would have enjoyed using the sauce as a BBQ sauce and using the pork shoulder in another recipe (such as Irish Pork Stew), a lot more than  this recipe. Personal taste.

This was extremely tasty. I didn't have honey so I used molasses and I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and it turned out very nice. I didn't want to cook it in the oven so I put it in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over it and let it slow cook for about 5 hours

First Chef John recipe that we just did not care for at all.  The sauce was not flavorable at all.

No changes made to the recipe. This was legitimately one of the tastiest pork dishes I have ever eaten or made.

Made it for dinner last night and my wife and I both enjoyed it.  Definitely a unique taste considering the blend of seasonings and additives.  Served it over Ricotta - Parmesan Mashed potatoes, which added to the cacophony of flavors, but am not sure was necessary.  Perhaps rice or pasta would have been a better choice.  Will definitely make it again.

I rarely make anything exactly as the recipe states as I put my family's taste and my very limited budget first.  Typically I skip the videos and move on to the ingredients, I don't know why I watched this particular video but, I'm so happy I did!  Your comments regarding the agro..., Then dolce and substitutes, they were perfect and spot on.
