i'm giving it this many stars ONLY because of the alterations i made.  like other said, i cooked the onions and brocolli a bit before putting it in the cresent roll dough.  instead of 2 tablespoons of mustard i put 1 tablespoon and 1/2 cup sour cream.  the filling turned out moist and creamy and delicious!  and i brushed a little butter on the top of the cresent dough(which was reduced fat) before putting it in the oven.  i LOVED how it turned out and would definitely make it my way again.

This was good but after reading previous reviews..made many alterations. I opted to use the pizza crust and only one, used about a cup and a half of ham and just eyed the brocoli,cheese, and mayo.Heated the mixture in microwave for about 3-5 min. stirring. Next time I would make even less filling (serving two people) and possibly try using velveeta the shredded cheese is much too greasy and made for soggy left-overs..Also I sprinkled the crust with Mrs.Dash seasoning mix after cutting strips which really boosted the flavor..Other than that very yummy..Good with chicken too!! And it really does look beautiful when golden brown.

This was excellant.  I made some changes based on the remarks above.  I added an extra half cup broccoli.  I also used 3/4 a tbsp of yellow mustard and 1/4 tbsp of dijon mustard and 4 oz of sour cream.  I sauteed the onions in butter until soft and the broccoli I steamed for about three mins.  I prepared the filling early in the day and put in the refrigerator until dinner time.  I then took the filling and put into waxpaper rolled to a tight roll the size of the filling.  Then I did an eggwash on the pastry and it turned out great.  I will definately do this again and will also try with different veggies and meats.

I used less ham and more broccoli. I used purple onion and cheddar cheese. I also used reduced-fat crescent rolls. I shaped it into a ring. It was very good. I liked it more than a chicken one I had that included mayo in the mix.

I have made this recipe through Pampered Chef quite a few times and its one of our favorites.  I don't see the need to cook brocolli or onion before hand because if they are fine enough, there is no need.  I also tend to use a montery jack mixture for the cheese insted of swiss.  I highly recommend this recipe and will make again soon.

Good recipe that used up the rest of our leftover Easter ham. But I wouldn't rush to make it again soon. As other reveiwers mentioned, maybe it was the mustard that overpowered the recipe.

We liked this a lot, I have made it with broccoli and also with frozen asparagus.  Its very helpful to precook the veges in microwave before putting into the braid. 
I made these as an appetizer for a party, everyone raved, no leftovers.  Many copies of the recipe were requested.  Use your imagination for other fillings.

I've had better ham braids.  The onion should be pre-cooked a little, because the oven time just isn't enough to cook them.  It was also a bit dry with only the dijon mustard as a sauce.  Looked more beautiful than it tasted.  I'll keep searching for a better recipe.

Very filling. The directions weren't very clear as I used a large cookie sheet & had left over dough. (didn't know if I should double up the dough or not) Also the braiding part was confusing, but figured it out later. (I was used to having long stripes when braiding not short ones) I accidently bought smoked swiss with cheddar cheese & it was excellent, but next time I'd use only 1/2 what it calls for since the smoke cheddar taste is strong. Will make again.

My family loved my version. Its quick and easy. Cook the broccoli with onions til tender. Drain, rinse with cold water. Lay out crescent dough as specified. Layer with sliced ham, sliced cheese (I used pepper jack and swiss) then sprinkle with grated cheddar. Mix broccoli and onions with dijon mustard and 1/4 c. mayo then spread ontop of cheese. Braid dough over inside stuff and bake until golden brown...makes enough for atleast 6 people. And funny thing, everyone says that they switched the mayo with something else, but there is no mayo or sour cream in this recipe. :) STILL GREAT THOUGH! Everyone has their own take on it :)

We really like this recipe, however, every time I make it I am having to cook it a lot longer to have the crust be done completely. Tonight I cooked it for 25 min at 350..turned it up to 375 and cooked another 10 and there were parts that were still raw! Ugh...so frustrating...but not the recipes fault! :) I add the sour cream and leave out the mustard and let everyone dip it in mustard. I also use cheddar cheese...yummy!

This was really good. I gave 4 stars because I didn't follow exact recipe and went with some of the reviews changes. I added a little bit of sour cream and did half of the mustard.  Also, I steamed the broccoli and sauted the onions beforehand.  

These changes made it a great lunch.  Next time I'll try with chicken.

This is very good! I cooked the onion, broccoli and ham together along with one minced clove of garlic. I also added about 1/4 cup of sour cream and a dollop of mayonnaise to the dijon. In addition to swiss, I added sharp cheddar cheese--about a 50/50 blend. I also only used 1 crescent roll instead of two and it turned out to be the perfect size for just us two. Very tasty!! A keeper! Update: I made this again last night and used 2 Pillsbury Crescent Seamless Dough Sheets and it was perfect! I liked it the first time I made it, but loved it the second time. I am going to experiment using chicken instead of ham. Also, if you think about it--it is technically the same thing as a stromboli, so you could make it with pizza fillings. Yummy!

We loved this recipe. It was super easy to make and tasted delicious.  A few times:  Cook the broccoli maybe halfway before putting it in this recipe, as it was still kind of crunchy.  Also, maybe saute the onions first instead of putting them in raw.  Otherwise, it was great!

This was a HUGE hit at my house!  I made a ton of alterations though (sorry person who made up the recipe!):

I added a half a cup of sour cream
I subbed grated raw milk cheddar for the swiss and added a little Parmesan as well
I omitted the ham (my sister only eats meat on the weekends, don't ask)
I added an entire leek very thinly sliced
I forgot to add the mustard..  oops!
I omitted the parsley (I didn't have any) and added a little grilling seasoning and some black and red pepper instead

I bought one of the microwave steam bags of broccoli so the broccoli was fully cooked when I put it in the oven..  because the leeks were so thin, they came out very slightly undercooked, but still nice and mild. 

I'm sure the original recipe is awesome too, I was just in a hurry and added what I wanted.  It came out really well :)

I cut this recipe in half and made a small braid since it was just the 2 of us.  Other than that I followed it exactly and it is quite good!  While it was in the oven baking I remembered I had a nice bottle of Rose' wine from our Virginia wine trip this summer. It went fantastic with this!  I might add mushrooms next time.

Wonderful after adjusting to my taste. Try using mushrooms, swiss and ham as filling. Saute fresh mushrooms with onion in butter prior. I also brushed top with butter (or eggwash) and sprinkled poppy seeds on top mid way through baking.

This was good, but not fantastic. I would make it again though.I sauted the onions, ham & broccoli a bit before baking. As other reviews suggested, I sprinkled seasoning salt over dough before baking &that added great flavor. Presentation is beautiful (& impressinve!) Thanks for the recipe.

My husband doesn't like cheese or anything creamy, but he liked this recipe and so did I. I followed the recipe and didn't pre cook onions or broccoli. Half way through I increased the oven temp to 375 and the end result was good..  I'll use this recipe again.

WOW.  I halfed the recipe.  Very good.  I used mozarella because it was what I had leftover along with christmas ham.  No mustard or onion because I did not have any.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for the formula to the secret braid.

This was absolutely delectable! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because I changed up the original recipe to some of those suggested. I used 1/2 c. sour cream and nearly doubled the broccoli. (We're fans of broccoli!) I used an egg wash and the crust came out beautiful! Might also be good with cheddar. Very filling meal as well!

This might become my new FAVORITE comfort food!!!!  

I made a few tweaks, but this recipe could be SO versatile, you'll find yourself trying new combos on this pocket of goodness!

Instead on a long loaf, I made 2 smaller loafs, each stuffed.  Perfect entree size!  Great for entertaining!  I also used sour cream and some yellow mustard in mine, as other reviewers suggested, and pre-sauteed my onions.

I did not need any egg wash for the top.  It was golden brown and crisp and perfect.  I did have to bake the smaller guys for about 5 more minutes than recommended.

They were delicious and creamy and homemade tasting last night, and I brought the leftovers to work today- and they taste GREAT microwaved today too!  I can't wait to make more of these.  They would be good with turkey & cheddar, taco fixings, chicken peas and rice, you name it!  THANK YOU Horton for this recipe!

I made a few changes to the original and it wasn't too bad.  There was a flavor in there that both my boyfriend and I weren't too crazy about - but that could have been due to my alterations (using TS Onion Onion instead of an actual chopped onion because I didn't have one, and adding a tbsp of garlic powder, and used cheddar cheese instead of swiss because I dont' care for swiss).  Next time I will try this with no garlic and probably leave out the onion as well and try using provolone cheese.  Overall good recipe just need to tweak it to my taste!

This was great, only one tip..make sure your dough is chilled, I left mine out while I was prepping everything, and it was very difficult to work with. I didn't get the braid so much as another flat cover...but it tasted great!

I didn't have dijon mustard so I used spicy brown instead.  I also didn't have enough swiss cheese so I added an Italian blend shredded cheese.  I didn't add anything additional but did use less onion (dried minced) and it turned out great.  If you chop your broccoli and ham fine enough, it cooks properly in the time stated.  Delicious!

I've made this twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Its a simple recipe that tastes like a complicated one! I took some of the other suggestions and added sour cream. I also brushed it with butter while it was baking.

Delicious. The broccoli is a little crunchy at the end, so it helps to steam it first.

You can't go wrong with a recipe calling for crescent rolls and ham. This was good. My son says it's like having homemade hot pockets. The possibilities are endless with this. Thanks!

Ummmm. Very good and easy, too.  I used more ham, probably 2-1/2 cups and I had to use cheddar instead of swiss. Will surely make this again with leftover ham.  Thanks for posting!

I enjoyed this recipe and it's easy to adapt to what you have on hand. I followed the suggestion from other reviewers and steamed the broccoli before. I also substituted cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again and again.

A very easy and different way to prepare ham leftovers! I did tweek this recipe a bit based on user reviews. I used cheddar (thats what I had on hand) and because some users felt that it was a bit dry I tossed a half a can of cream of chicken soup in the mix for a nice creamy consistancy. I also found that my dough didn't cook all the way through so I would suggest a longer cooking time. Bake on a silicone or silipat liner to prevent the bottom being burned with the longer cook time. Other than that it way great. We all really liked it, it actually tasted like a homemade Hot Pocket!!

My kids really liked this, as is (in fact, this morning they asked if they could have it again).  I used a pizza dough rather than the cresent roll mix.

Looked beautiful!  However, I agree with some of the previous reviews, the amount of Dijon was a little overpowering (and I'm a mustard lover).  Next time I will reduce and perhaps add a touch of mayo.  Also my husband and son agreed that the onions were all wrong.  Either they need to be omitted completely or the amount should be reduced and sauteed in butter before adding to the filling.

Used frozen broccoli/cauliflower mix and placed in a food processor to make tiny so my son would eat it. If he has large pieces he won't touch broccoli. 25 minutes was perfect and everything was hot and cheesy. Very easy recipe but needs better directions as I didn't know how to use the 2nd can of crescent dough. ( It makes 2 braids as I now know)

Made this as directed, except that I cooked the broccoli before adding to the braids. It wasn't too bad, but the swiss/dijon combo was powerful and it was kind of a strange combination with the also sweet crescent rolls. I may try this again with pizza dough as another reviewer suggested.

Makes up quickly and easily - love the presentation.  Used a grated cheddar and mozza mix and added some spices.  As suggested on other reviews, sauted onions, broccoli and ham first.  Turned out great, but for two would only use 1/2 the recipe.  Will definetly make it again.  Thanks!

This was a huge hit with my husband, a picky 2 year old and a picky 5 year old.  Plus, it was a great way to use up some leftover Easter ham.  I followed the directions exactly.  Since it uses two crescent rolls, I made one without onions since my kids don't like them.  Next time, I might saute the onions first b/c they were still pretty powerful.  We'll definitely make this again.

Very good idea and base recipe.  I used 1 cup frozen brocolli, 2 cups leftover ham, 2 mushroom caps diced, 3 green onions diced, and a clove of garlic crushed.  Microwaved the broc for 2 minutes to defrost then sauteed all above ingredients in olive oil with a dash of mrs dash.  Then I mixed 2 tbs stone ground sweet and spicy mustard, 1 tbs regular yellow mustard, a squeeze of lemon juice, tsp of relish (from a similar recipe on the site) and heaping tbs each  of sour cream and a mayo. Mixed it all up with a generous cup of baby swiss. The braid part was a little tricky, i had two much dough and think 1.5 cans would be perfect, may even try to use one can next time or make 2 with 3 cans.  Brushed with butter before baking. Looked sloppy going in oven but came out pretty and delicious.Very good use of christmas leftovers and my bf loved it.  Can't wait to try other fillings especially taco combo. MMMMMmmmm Thanks for the post!

Great Pampered Chef recipe! I halved it for our family and added 1/3 cup sour cream instead of mayo, and used honey mustard but culd barely taste it. I mixed ham, broccoli (cut up), no onion or parsley, and put on dough that had been cut, then I layered pieces of swiss on top, then folded dough over. Sprinkled garlic salt and Penzey's Tuscan Sunset (Italian seasonings) on top of dough, and baked 25 mins to perfection.

I made this for my husband and I, I'm a vegetarian and he's not, so I made half with ham and half without (with extra cheese on my half). I used cheddar instead of swiss, and it came out a bit greasy, maybe Velveeta next time. I had extra dough, so I ended up re-rolling it, shorter and wider, and then it worked fine. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

I've been using this recipe to take care of leftover ham for years.  I did change things up a little when I made it last night.  I sauteed the onion for a few minutes before adding, added the juice from half of a lemon, and used Dijonaise instead of the dijon mustard.  The Dijonaise is creamier and took the bite out of the regular mustard.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I made it exactly as written. I didn't think the mustard flavor was too much like some reviewers said, in fact, I thought it could use more of a kick. I can see how adding some sour cream would help a bit. Also, I think its totally unnecessary to cook the onion or broccoli ahead of time unless you really want to mask their taste. I just finely chopped them both and they were fine. One last thing, I had trouble making one braid that would fit nicely on a cookie sheet so I just made two, this might help those who had raw dough on the inside and burning on the outside. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good and the flavors went well together. I used 1 TBS of mustard and 1/4 cup of sour cream. I wish I would have added more broccoli. I did saute the onions and steamed the broccoli. I put the ham in my food processor and rough chopped it - I think next time I will take the extra time and chop the ham with a knife - it kind of had the texture of ham salad. Overall it was a tasty way to use leftover ham.

We enjoyed this recipe, and it was pretty easy and very different from anything I usually make.  I made just a couple of changes: only used 1 TBL of mustard, since our ham was leftover from Easter and already had some mustard in the glaze.  I thought there was plenty of mustard taste with just the one TBL.  Also used colby-jack cheese instead of swiss - personal preference.  And added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sour cream to the mixture.  I chopped the broccoli up into very small pieces and didn't see any reason to cook it ahead of time, but next time I would saute the onions in a little butter to soften them - I didn't like their crunch. (I used about 3/4 cup of finely chopped onion.)  Also, some of the bread didn't bake completely while the rest turned golden brown.  I took it out of the oven because I didn't want it to burn.  But next time I'll have to see if I can get it to cook evenly.

I did what some of the previous reviews suggested and only used 1 tbsp. dijon, aside from that followed the recipe.  It was good, my husband loved it!  To me it tasted just like quiche without the egg, not bad!

This was a really easy recipe for a quick meal!  I made it in the wreath shape instead of the braid.  So delicious!

This recipe was just ok with me. I thought the filling was a little rich. To much ham mabye. I liked the crust though and how nice it looked with the braid. I think I will use the braid now with many different fillings. would be great a fruit filling and glazed on top! mmmmm.

5** My husband and I thought this recipe was 5star stars!  We tweaked it a bit to our liking, but we both were raving about it!  I don't usually make things twice, but this I will make again & again!

I used others advice and used 1/4 cup sour cream & 1/4 cup mayo.  I also substituted monterrey Jack for Swiss & turkey ham for pork ham.  I cooked my braid on a pizza stone and it took atleast 15 minutes longer to cook.  I don't know if it was because I cooked it on the stone or not, but just FYI!

I'm allergic to mustard, so I skipped the dijon and instead of swiss, tried cheddar since I had it on hand.  I loved it, but my husband thinks the swiss would make it better.  I did saute the broccoli and onion together in margarine, which helped to soften them.  I was completely happy with my little altered version, and will make it again.

I wanted this to work because I liked the ingredients.  It turned out well & was easy to make, but I did not like it.  It was too salty, & I felt like I was eating something too processed & unhealthy.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Although I love crescent rolls, I found them too sweet for this recipe.  Will try it again with pizza crust or maybe biscuit dough.  Also thought it rather bland; my brother suggested adding pepperoni slices; sister suggested more onion and less broccoli!  I thought one reviewer's asparagus suggestion was interesting, too.

I make similar recipe using a can of drained tuna, a package of thawed and well drained spinach, a cup of drained cottage cheese and a tsp. of minced garlic or garlic powder.  Mix this together and put it down the center of the crescent roll dough.  Top with overlapping rounds of sliced provolone cheese and braid the dough over the top.  Bake according to the instructions on the crescent roll package.  This makes a delicious complete meal for 4 people.

This came out great and will be one of my regulars now! I did add 1/4 cup of sour cream to the mixture and sauteed the onions (I'm not a fan of crunchy onions) also I used monterey jack cheese because that's what I had. Overall, very tasty!

This was an eye-catching, appetite-inspiring dish ... until I tasted it.  The more I ate, the worse it got.  Then, I realized what was wrong: the mustard.  Though I usually like a little mustard with ham, in this recipe it was over-powering and gave the ham/broccoli/bread a sharp sour taste.  I'll make something similar, based on this recipe, because I think that giving it a chance without the mustard (maybe with a little sour cream ?)will result in a tasty, attractive dish.

Good, easy, and impressive-looking. Only downside is onions were not cooked all the way through. Next time I'll saute them first as other reviewers have suggested.
Here's my changes: I don't like mustard, so I used 2 tbsp Miracle Whip and 4 tbsp cottage cheese. It stuck together nicely without being too runny. Also substituted cheddar cheese since I didn't have swiss on hand. For herbs, I used 6 big leaves of fresh cilantro and a little chopped basil.

Great, but hard to get together. It may be easier to set the mixture in fridge for 30 minutes and then roll in wax paper to give it a more firm shape before placing it on dough for braiding. Also, the mustard was a bit strong - I would use less next time - 1 TB Dijon Mustard, 1 TB Mayo - to keep the consistency without being so pungent. It was hard to taste the other flavors over the mustard. I will definitley make again - just tweaked a little.

Turned out great.  Had to make a few adjustments due to what I had on hand, and took another reviewer's advice to use 1T dijon and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I didn't have enough broccoli, so I added some shredded zucchini.  I also only had block cheddar, so I shredded that, but added slices of swiss before I "closed" the braid.   Oh, and I didn't include the onions because the fam doesn't like them. Everyone enjoyed it!

So since I didn't follow EXACTLY--I used leftover roasted broccoli and garlic, I felt compelled to refrain from the 5 stars. But my family and friends (6 adults) LOVED this. I used 2 tubes of the big and flakey crescent rolls and threw the chopped onion with a bit a water under the broiler for about 5 minutes before adding to the chopped mixture. After sealing the dough, I sprayed with oil and topped with sesame seeds. Delicious with cole slaw. We'll have this again.

I found this to be a difficult and not so delicious recipe. I made it according to the alterations the other reviewer suggested and was still not impressed. The directions for braiding the crescent rolls were difficult to understand and time consuming to practice. I finally gave up after 20 minutes and braided it similar to braiding hair. If I were to make it again I would leave out the mustard all together it overpowered the rest of the flavors. Three stars is generous!

Great tasting and easy as well as pretty!  I changed the mustard to 1 tsp. of dry mustard and 3 TBS of sour cream; par boiled the broccoli; and used fresh parsley instead of dry.  I basted butter on top after it came out of the oven.

Family favorite.   You can use roast beef and cheddar instead of ham and Swiss.  Or change the dressing to ranch instead of honey mustard.  Very easy.

this is sensational!!

I made a few alterations,  using a mixture of Dijon and French mustard with a sprinkle of dried tarragon and vegeta vegetable stock powder, also sautéed the onions for a few minutes and added garlic. 

The braid was gone within 30 minutes, the family really enjoyed it and I loved the crunch of the broccoli.

This will definitely be on our weekend menu from now on!

It was delicious.  

Requires some attention to make sure the ingredients get blended well.  I cubed the ham; chopped the onion and added the Dijon to the onion and blended so it would mix well through the filling.  I put the ham in a large bowl, mixed in the shredded Swiss (good Jarlsberg from Trader Joes) and broccoli, mixed in the parsley, then added the onion/mustard mixture and blended it all.

I also made a white wine sauce which was a nice touch over the sliced braid, but not essential.

Next time, I'll try to find a dough that doesn't have ingredients I usually try to avoid, but once a year, I guess I can have some saturated this and hydrogenated that.

I made exactly as directed and that is what I rated the recipe on. It was pretty (I even posted a picture on facebook) but the kids didnt gobble it up like expected. I think the crescent roll perforation were difficult to pinch together and then upon eating it, didnt have the substance needed. Next time I will use the pillsbury bread in a can instead. The filling was overpowered with the mustard and onion flavor. I think a plain ham, brocolli and cheese filling without anything else would have been moist and flavorful enough. When I try again with alterations, I will update my rating.

Easy and tasty. I used leftover ham, cheddar and mozzarella (because that is what I had), modified with 1 T of mustard (based on reviews) and 2 T of mayo. Also made my own pizza dough and wrapped it like a Stromboli. Not as pretty but worked for family dinner.

very easy and fairly quick to make. As other reviewers suggested, I used only 1 Tbsp mustard (used brown mustard since I didn't have dijon) and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I didn't have any parsley on hand either, so I just left it out.  One can of crescent roll dough made a fairly large braid, especially for two people, so I froze the the leftover mix for later use :)   husband gave it a thumbs up!

This was really good!!  I used cheddar cheese and honey mustard because I didn't have swiss and dijon.  I might use pepperjack cheese next time.  I added twice the amount of broccoli as well, because the filling didn't seem like enough for the braid.  My boyfriend didn't like it though, probably because of the mustard.

For me, this recipe was just okay. I steamed the broccoli prior to using it in the recipe. I also used cheddar because that's what we had on hand. It wasn't horrible or anything, just not the home run I was expecting.

Yummy! This was great. My husband who is adamantly against broccoli went back for thirds and said it was a keeper. The only thing i did differently was to use cheddar instead of swiss cheese, since i didnt have any swiss on hand.

This was awesome. I added about half the mustard (I used spicy brown mustard) it called for, and included 1/2 cup sour cream as members suggested. It was outstanding. The perfect amount of mustard flavor really made this an interesting flavor. These are a lot of our favorite ingredients, so it was a hit!

Thank you for this delicious recipe.
I used cheddar because that was what I had; however, will try swiss at some later time - will definitely use again.
Thanks again1

I make this after Christmas every year using the left over ham and turkey. I change the cheeses up by using monteray jack and chedder. I use half of the mustad because it can be over powering. Over all it is a great dish.

This would have been good if it was made with a different protein.  The ham made the recipe far too salty.

Excellent!!!  This was a huge hit with my hubby's card party fellas.  They all raved and asked for more.  I did add a Tbs. of garlic powder and a couple Tbs. of lemon juice. I have left over filling and hubby picked up more crescents...wants more for the game Sunday.

Very quick and easy. Great recipe for fast working Day meal. I made some changes by adding 2 oz sour cream and 2 tablespoon mayo and 1 teaspoon tabasco thrown in. Made this with broccoli and without - Good either way.

Really great recipe, good flavor and my husband LOVED it... but very rich. I think maybe in my own personal *tweaking* I'll cook the onions first with some butter before hand, and maybe even try some cheddar rather than swiss.

Loved it! I made several changes after reading some other reviews.  Added sour cream, mayo, not as much mustard and sprinkled with seasoning salt.  Will make again!

My wife likes to make this recipe.  All I can say is that with a family of 6, there is more than half of the dish left.  Not our favorite, but my wife likes it so i guess we will keep getting it.

I agree w/ the others- saute onions first, cut back on the mustard a bit,( i used spicy brown) and the dough was a PAIN to work with, 
but after you get it together - it tasted really good, hot or cold

I cut back on the mustard as others suggested and added a bit of mayo.  Still not anything I would ever make again.  Taste was too pungent.
