My Mom found this recipe when she first got married in 1938.  It was from the "American Woman's Cook Book" which is an old 3" thick green book that has seen better days, but is still in my cupboard. The rhubard pie is just as good now as it was in 1938.  The only hint I can tell you is to add a tablespoon or so of flour and one of sugar in the bottom of the pie crust before you add the filling.  Mom said that keeps the crust from getting soggy.  Now I have to go out and find some rhubarb.  I NEED to make this again.

This pie is so good! It's just like my mom used to make...just one comment - make sure you let it cool completely before cutting it or it will be too runny.

To be fair, I can't really rate this recipe because I modified it quite a bit.  I wanted to share my version since it turned out very good.  Preheat oven to 425.  Beat 3 egg yolk till pale yellow, add 1 c white sugar, 3 T milk.  Beat until smooth.  Add 1/2 c more white sugar and 1/4 c flour and beat until smooth.  Add 1 T milk, 1/4 c white sugar, 1/4 t cinnamon, 1 t vanilla.  Beat until smooth.  Stir in 2 1/2 c sliced rhubard (0.5 inch pieces).  Pour into prepared pie shell (I used Baker's Secret Pie Crust from this site-- perfect!!), dot with 2 T butter.  Cover with second pie crust.  Brush with milk and sprinkle white sugar on top.  Bake on bottom rack of oven at 425 for 10 minutes.  Drop temperature to 375 and bake until crust turns golden brown, approximately 40 more minutes.  Watch the time carefully at the end because if you overdo it, the top might collapse in a bit (and it just doesn't look as nice).  Hope you enjoy this.

This pie was awesome!!  It had a great sweet yet tart flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I added a cup more of rhubarb to fill in the pie plate a little more.

Sooooo yummy!!! I've made this pie 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  I added an extra tbspn of flour to thicken the recipe and sprinkled the crust with 1 tbspn of flour and 1 tbspn of sugar, just like another rater suggested to do.  I'm glad I did because it made the pie ready to eat just as soon as it wasn't piping hot!  I'll definitely make this pie again and again!!!

This is the first time I have cooked with rhubarb, I thought it would be really hard and turn out sour.  This receipt rocks.  My mother-in-law said it was the best she's had.  I am making it for my father-in-law with Splenda instead of sugar.

I only added 3/4 c. of sugar, but it was still way too sweet. I tried the rhubarb pie from allrecipes that calls for 1 1/3 c. sugar per 4 cups of rhubarb and that ratio was much better.

This is everything my mom used to make.  I was adventurous with the recipe one day and wondered what exactly I could use this 'custard pie' recipe for.  I ended up making a berry custard pie (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries frozen store bought mix), substituting said berry mix for rhubarb and adding orange zest (about one teaspoon fresh grated).  Amazing stuff, truly.  This recipe is ridiculously versatile.

I made this pie and my husband said, "Why have we been together 9 years and this is the first time you've made this?" and then proceeded to inhale half of it. 

I was raised eating rhubarb pie (no strawberries added pleeeease) so when I saw the pretty rhubarb in the store the other day I just felt like making one. Glad I did!  The "custard" part makes the sugary juice sort of creamy, which is a nice addition but doesn't take away from the yummy flavor.

It's great as is, but this time when I made it I tried something new! I used the whole eggs, not just the yolks. I added a drop of vanilla, zested a clementine, and sprinkled in some sea salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. I doubled the flour and added 1/4c milk like my mom used to do. Finally, I added 1 1/2c fresh, ripe strawberries. My kids made a lattice for the top crust. WOW!!! My family went bonkers for this pie! The flavor really has depth and character. I would suggest decreasing the sugar because the ripe strawberries made it a lot sweeter.

very easy to make and very delicious. my family loved this pie. I recommend it to everyone. Even quicker to make if you use ready made pie crusts.
Make sure to let it cool completely or the filling is runny.

Wow~ Great pie.  Very easy to make and super delicious! I added 1 Tbsp of tapioca to avoid the runny fruit problem and made mini empanada pies out of the filling.  Really wonderful flavor!

Although I used Pillsbury ready-made crusts for this recipe, the filling itself was followed to the letter.  I am a real lover of rhubarb, and this recipe was absolutely delicious.  I took it to work, and my male co-workers were ecstatic about the pie.  My biggest problem now is finding more rhubarb.  A classic recipe to be added to my collection.

This pie takes the cake (insert dorky snicker here).  It is easy, inexpensive, and non-messy.  I pair it with the Basic Flaky Pie Crust here (http://pie.allrecipes.com/az/BasicFlakyPieCrust.asp), using butter instead of shortening for the crust.  It always gets compliments and makes up fast.

I'm giving this 4 stars just because it's not what I was looking for.  It didn't turn out "custardly"...if that makes any sense.  It is delicious and the texture was great.  My daughter loved it and my wife conceded that it was pretty good considering that rhubarb is supposed to be cattle food.  I'm still trying to find my Grandma Fox's recipe.

I wish I could give this 0 stars, because it was nothing more than pieces of rhubard floating around in liquid, and I even let it cool completely.  I followed the recipe exactly.  So, I don't know what you all did to give it 5 stars!  I don't even know where the "custard" part of the equation comes in either.  Even when I mixing it all up, I was skeptical about what sort of consitancy it would turn out to be.  It looked like rhubarb mixed with crumbs. The only good thing is that I used the flaky pie crust suggest by reviewer kelly h.  That was good.  Grrrr...

This pie was very good.  It has a sweet yet tart flavor.  I was surprised to have it turn out like a custard pie with no custard-like filling.  I will make it again as it is so easy.

Easy, excellent tasting pie!  I slightly increased the flour (used 3 tbl) with frozen rhubarb.  Also brushed the top crust with milk and sprinkled lightly with white sugar.

This pie had a very good flavor, but the bottom was like soup!  Runny and soggy bottom crust.  I made this for my mother in law for her birthday.  She loved it though.  We ended up cutting it up and spooning the unplanned "sauce" over it.  It wasn't very attractive but tasted great!  Not sure what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly.

This pie turns out great. Instead of a top pastry crust, I substitute a crumble topping similar to a Dutch apple pie. Should be baked on the lowest shelf in the oven to get a nice brown, completely cooked bottom crust.

I tried this recipe for my July barbeque..it was a soggy , yucky mess
I have been looking for years for the recipe to duplicate a rhubarb custard pie I tasted back in the mid "80s...it was firm and juicy yet the custard part had a distinct layer on the bottom. the bottom crust was flaky and almost caramelized.  this recipe is a no go for me.. not unless you want Rhubarb soup in a soggy crust.

one my mom used to make. I made it exactly
like the recipe and it was perfect. I made
it twice in one week.

It was good -very mild flavor.  Not my favorite rhubarb dessert, yet different and fun to try.

This tasted pretty good, but the crust was SO soggy, even after I sprinkled the crust with extra flour.  I also think the 'custard' mix is a bit strange, more like crumbs.  Good flavour, but I'll try a different recipe next time.
