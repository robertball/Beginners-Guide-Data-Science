So easy.  I found that the moisture from rinsing the greens was ample to cook the greens.

After cooking the bacon (and removing half of the grease) I placed the greens into the skillet with the other ingredients and simmered until tender. I served these on new years day with  "slow cooker spicy black-eyed peas" submited by MJ46NY. A delicious combination.

Great recipe as written. Tonight, I had a vegetarian guest at dinner, so I made this recipe without bacon - I added 1 tbsp olive oil and 2 tsp liquid smoke to the boiling water instead. It turned out great, and everyone was asking what gave it the great flavour. It seems like a lot of vinegar, but most of the vinegar taste burns off, leaving a nice fresh taste. Yum!

I used a 16oz bag of frozen turnip greens in place of the bunch of collards.  The other change I made was to add 2 packets of splenda to try and counteract the bitterness frozen greens tend to have.  Really really yummy.  Will use this for the rest of the greens in my freezer!

This is a GREAT, simple recipe! In fact, I made my New Year's greens last year using this recipe and, when I wanted to make them again this year, realized I had lost the recipe! Thankfully, I've found it and will keep it this time. As one of the true "GRITS" (Girls Raised in the South), I can honestly say this is one of the best recipes for good Southern-style greens I've found! :)

I too have southern back ground and we have always put some sort of pork in with the collard's, but what make's this recipe so good and different is the chicken stock. Plain water just doesn't cut it for me any more... I used a mild hot sauce because of the pepper and it was just great. Thanks for the gift. nan

This was my first time making greens and I was so proud of myself because of this recipe. It took longer than 30 mins to cook but everything worked out. I used smoked hamhock instead of bacon.

Thank you for the great recipe.  I like my greens sweet, so I added some sugar.  I am sure I will make this again.

GREAT recipe, but I would change a few things next time.  I used 3 slices of turkey bacon and it still overpowered the greens.  Also, it only took about 15-20 minutes (on high) for the greens to soften.  I added a splash of sugar to help with the bitterness.  Pretty good.

I am a Southerner but I am not a huge fan of greens. My 8-year-old daughter is though, so I cooked these for her and her mother using collards from our garden. Fantastic! They haven't stopped raving about them since. Even I loved them. I added 2 cloves minced garlic to the bacon drippings at first, cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and added a couple of tablespoons of sugar because we have not had a frost yet. Great recipe!

Delicious!  I used a little less bacon. It took longer than 30 minutes to cook. Everyone enjoyed them. I will use this recipe again.

Really good!  This was my first time tasting collard greens.  The cayenne adds some spice and the vinegar adds some tang, and it's all offset by the saltiness of the bacon.  The water from washing the greens was enough to cook it.

First time trying collards, added WAY to much cayenne but besides that it was great. Very simple recipe. I did add some brown sugar to my serving and it was great. 

Will try again with less/no cayenne

I used 16oz of mixed greens, and turkey bacon.  It came out OK, but I'm not big on greens.  I'm trying.  Mike didn't even touch them.
