This was just awesome!  I always have trouble with pie crust.  I just blended all of the dry ingredients into my mix master then threw in the shortening and when it was crumbly I added the water.  When it was just combined it was ready.  The combination of peaches and blackberries is perfect.  I will make this over and over, thanks for the recipe!

This was a lot easier than making a pie! I only used peaches and I sprinkled sugar on top before baking, for added sweetness!  It was so good!  I will make this again.

This was a great recipe! Though being in Australia I changed shortening to butter, and used a gelatin powder (made up with hot water, available at European-style stores) glaze over the fruit. It was a big hit to the Christmas party I brought it to!

When I made this tart I used Apricot Jelly and melted it and watered it down and poured over my fruit and man it gave it a good flavor and a prettieness to it.

Wow! I have never had dough roll out so easily.  Usually I can make things that taste good, but don't look perfect.  This one made me feel like Martha Stewart--it was beautiful!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe makes a very impressive dessert and is not very hard. I used dark chocolate instead of white and it was delicious, especially when made with berries. I think that the time should be taken to arrange the fruit into a beautiful pattern (it's fun!). I also melted apricot preserves in the microwave for an easy glaze.

This recipe really is very easy to make!! Some changes though..I used just a pinch of salt, about 2 tablespoons of water (instead of 1/2 cup water). Also, I added 1 egg and mixed it with the butter and sugar (like u make cakes)..this helps make the dough stick together better....be sure to use plenty of peaches!
- Superb and has a very professional look! Everyone at home was very impressed!

These were great!  I added a little Polaner's All Fruit on the bottom, and blackberries, raspberries and blueberries on top.  It was really wonderful with some whipped cream on top.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is outstanding and amazingly easy. I made it with peaches, strawberries, and plums. The crust was perfect (thanks especially to my stand mixer)! It was a big hit at home and I will definitely keep this one on file. If you're looking for a quick, yummy dessert, this is a great one. 

This crust is so good I've also used it for pie. I've gotten a ton of compliments on the crust and requests for the recipe. It's the best pie crust I've made.)

I gave this recipe an extra star for ease of prep. However pretty and easy to handle, the crust tasted bland and doughy.  We ate the fruit out of the middle.

Scored MAJOR points with the new boyfriend for this fruit tart!  The crust got the most compliments and looked so pretty in the rippled tort pie pan I found at IKEA.  Perfect recipe!  Will make AGAIN and AGAIN!  I used an electric mixer.  I also did not fold the dough up over the fruit but instead pressed it into the ripples of my tart pan.  Baked the night before and served for dessert the next night and breakfast the day after!  Used blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.  Heavenly!

Easy and delicious! I used two ripe peaches and a handful of strawberries. The crust was flaky and contained the fruit well. (I used a combination of crisco, margarine and butter because it's what I had on hand.) I can't wait to make this again!

Easy to make, great to look at, and wonderful to eat! I used margarine instead of shortening and added a little vanilla to the crust and I thought it was wonderful!

This was SO easy to make!  I've never handmade pie crust so this was truly an experiment.  I used strawberries and served it with vanilla ice cream.  It was really great and really easy!

I struggle with pie crust and was quite pleased with how easy the crust was to work with. The tarts came out looking beautiful, however I was really very disappointed with the taste of the crust. Rather than being flaky and buttery I found the crust to be crumbly but greasy, and overwhelming to the dessert as a whole. I ate the fruit out of the middle.

Super simple and impressive appearing dessert. I made it extra-simple by using refrigerated pie crust from a box at the store. I used fresh apricots and frozen raspberries. It was so easy and my family loved it. We even topped it with a bit of cream...mmmmm.  I'll make this again for sure.

The fruit part was great!  The crust tasted too salty for my family.  We ended peeling off the crust and just eating the fruit.

This recipe surprised me at how good and simple it is. I like the open top, it looks so pretty. I have made it twice once with just peaches, and once with peaches and raspberries, which was delicious. I will take another reviewers idea and make the individual tarts in cupcake pans, I like the idea of the chocolate drizzle topping also.

I love this recipe!  We can not use refined sugar in our house, so I use 3T agave nectar instead.  I have made this as a torte several times and as mini tartlettes and have used a variety of fruits.  It always comes out wonderful.  Thank you for this great recipe!

this recipe was so strange i put the crust in a tart dish i thought it would crumble apart while baking you should never bake the fruit with the crust i have learned that from this recipe all the fruit turned sour and the glaze didnt melt properly it was very VERY strange.

I made the tart into little individual tartlets.  To me the crust was a little salty but no one else thought so.  Everyone loved it with the blackberry and peaches.  The only thing that I would change to make it into tartlets again would be to roll the crust a little thinner, but it is probably perfect for a normal tart.

This is my mother's favorite thing to make! Do not forget the step of draining the fruit while in the bowl. The second time I made this the crust did not fold up like before because the juices sank into the crust making it a little soggy. Love this!

I used blueberries instead of peaches and blackberries. And since I didn't have as much fruit as this recipe asked for I halved the measurements. The crust was nice and buttery and my family loved it. The blueberries were kinda bitter? I don't know why. But great recipe. The family loved it and it was both quick and easy (took me under ten minutes to prepare).

Excellent dessert that my 12 year old made all by himself :) We used an apple and a pear, and served with dulce de leche ice cream, yum yum.
