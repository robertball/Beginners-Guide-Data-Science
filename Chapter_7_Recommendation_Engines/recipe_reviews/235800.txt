I love roasted Brussels Sprouts but I wasn't sure how the mustard and agave would work with them.  It works!  I doubt I would buy agave to make this because honey seems to me to be a better choice, agave having no flavor.  I used a coarse spicy mustard, which was what I had but I think a smoother texture would be better.  This recipe will be used again in my kitchen.  Thanks Zoodleman

The glaze for the sprouts is delicious.  It goes well over any roasted veggie.  I combined Brussel sprouts, asparagus, red bell pepper, onion and a bit of garlic.  My husband who swears he doesn't like either Brussel sprouts or asparagus went back for seconds. I will use this often. Made my kitchen smell YUMMMMMY! Thanks for sharing.

I'd highly recommend NOT using this recipe bc it uses agave nectar. Agave nectar has more high fructose than corn syrup. Causes weight gain(esp belly fat) heart disease, & raises uric acid. Avoid completely if you suffer from gout. I love 99% of all the recipes here, however I had to post this. There are many other great Brussel sprout recipes.And Brussel sprouts have amazing benefits. Please research agave nectar(syrup) before using to weigh whether the use is worth the risk

Delicious! I made these exactly as the recipe stated but tossed the Brussels sprouts with feta cheese when they came out of the oven. These were great!

Simple and delicious. I loved the agave and spicy mustard combo.  As suggested by others, I will have to try on other roasted vegetables.

Made as written and these were excellent. I used a super hot mustard which complimented the agave nectar nicely. If you don't have agave nectar on hand, honey would work nicely too and might actual caramelize them more. I plan on playing around with different types of mustard for variety but this one is a keeper. Thanks Zoodleman!

This is a wonderful recipe. There were only two of us, and we ate it all! I added 1 cup of pecans. They add more protein and  lots of flavor.

I always add Caraway seeds, to taste, before roasting.  Try it.
