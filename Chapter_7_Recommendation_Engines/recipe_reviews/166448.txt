Delicious! The fresh onion taste is really nice with the white Cheddar (I used Cabot Cheddar).

I made this exactly by the recipe except I left out the red onion because of other reviewers' comments.  There was still entirely too much onion flavor.  It really overpowered the cheese taste.

I was looking for a recipe that would be close to the one I get at the Tuesday farmer's market here in Houston. I was AMAZED at this recipe's flavor. It tasted exactly like the one from the market, only better! I was very pleased with this recipe and will continue to use it as often as I can.

This is such a great recipe. I have always really liked the concept of pimento cheese, but usually find the execution to be mediocre.  This version is not overly sweet and doesn't overdose on mayo.  The onions add a great kick. Give it a shot!

I love this as a base, but I used 3 T. light mayo and only 1 T of worcestershire sauce. I am not a huge pimento fan, so I used roasted red peppers to sub. I also added a little yellow mustard and a few drops of hot sauce. Love it!( Okay, I changed it a tad.. :) )

I was very pleased with this recipe!  I am a pimento cheese fan, only homemade, no store bought.  I was a tiny bit nervous about the white cheddar, but I absolutely loved it!  The onions give it a great splash of taste.  Cannot wait to eat it for lunch today!

Love this recipe!! Followed the directions as is and it was great! Highly recommend letting it sit overnight in the fridge to let the flavors meld.

Excellent.  The Worcestershire Sauce is the secret in my opinion.  Loved it.  I will make it again.

This is hands down the best pimento cheese I have made. I believe I've actually been using too many pimentos...and less is definitely more! The blend of the flavors was wonderful. I made it the night before so the wonderful ingredients could meld. Everyone loved it, and my husband has asked me to make this again, and again! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe had way too much onion in it, though it was a good base.  I added about 1/2 cup sour cream and 1tbs sugar to cut the onion flavor.  Tasted great after the additions...love the white cheddar.

This had a very strong onion flavor, too strong for me.  It overpowered the cheese.

I love this as a base recipe!  In addition, I add chopped olives, diced jalape√±o, a bit of garlic salt, and pepper.  Delicious!

Very good, but a little too oniony for our taste.  I will add less onion next time, BUT will make this again.   I plan on trying it in a grilled cheese or on a hamburger.
