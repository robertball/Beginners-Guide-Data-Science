Indeed it is a lovely lasagna and added more garlic and a large bag of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen which I sauted briefly with the onion and garlic.  Also cheated and purchased pesto from Costco.

I exchanged cream cheese melted into my pesto sauce instead of ricotta cheese. Delicious recipe!

Very good! I thought it bland, and doubled the pesto (from a jar). That helped! I'd make it again, and would add more garlic tooThis is a one dish meal, with all the spinach.
