I really dressed this recipe up for flavor.  It is bland the way it is.  
I used 1 lb beef, 1 lb hot sausage, 1 lb Velveeta and shredded Colby Jack & Mozzarella to top it off.  I added 1 tsp garlic power, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper & 1/4 tsp salt to the meat mixture before adding the cheese.  For the bread, I used Rye cocktail bread.

These are great appetizers for parties. You can make the mixture ahead of time. I remember these as a kid.  They were called ZZ's party breads and instead of worcestershire sauce we used tabasco or hot sauce and the mixture was spread onto rye party bread and then baked in the oven at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes.  Without cooking them in the oven, they really aren't done and don't have a crispiness to them.

I usually make this without the worcestershire sauce and put it on party rye, add a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, and bake at 350°F for 10 minutes.  It's always the first to go at parties--DEE-LISH!

I make this with 1lb Lean ground beef, 1lb hot italian sausage and 1lb mexican style velveta. Then I take a good scoop of it an spread it on a slices of party rye. Then I place them on a cookie sheet and freeze them. Then  put them into ziplock bags,        When ready to cook I pre-heat oven  to 375* and cook how ever many I need on a cookie sheet for 10 min. My husband likes hot sauce on his!!!

Very very good.  Where I grew up we used to make the same mixture and put it on little party rye bread and bake in the oven for 15 minutes or so.  Called them polish mistakes.  They are great for a party, too.

Grandma made this quite a bit for her kids growing up (and for us grandkids, too) only she called it Sweepstakes. She schmeared the meat on the bread, covered it with cheese and then placed it under the broiler so the cheese would be melted. It's quite cheap to make and benefits from your own choice of spices and the addition of onion and garlic. The original calls for american or processed cheese but it works with just about any cheese you have on hand. GREAT boy food.

Like many of the other reviewers, we always served this on cocktail rye growing up, but we called the Pizza Ryes or Buffalo Chips. (very appetizing!) Nowadays, my kids prefer this mixture as a dip with restaurant style tortilla chips. However you eat it, it's awesome!

Love this. My mom has been making it for years, and now I do too. Served on cocktail rye bread. Also good for a low carb diet with no bread.

I made this as directed and I was ....ok...not spectacular.  My family ate it but no one really loved it.  Probably won't make it again.

I wasn't a fan. I did stray from the original recipe and used mexican velveeta and spicy sausage. We love heat! I think it would've tasted much better with cheddar cheese.

I use only sausage (1hot & 1mild), add in cheese and place on bread. Place the bread on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 10-15 minutes or until brown

My family has made a version of these for years.  The only difference is that we use a mild and hot breakfast sausage, and we don't use any mozzarella.  After we spread the ingredients on the bread we put them in the oven(400 degrees) for about 10 minutes. They are delicious!

I use 1lb of  hot sausage and beef each.  The meat tastes better with a little enhancement of  garlic powder and a touch of hot sauce.  We make it every Christmas Eve and call them Alpo Treats. :-) 

Rye cocktail bread tends to work better than pumpernickel because pumpernickel burns quicker.

It was great with Worcestershire sauce, ground beef, spicy pork sausage and red pepper flakes. Yum, my guests loved it.
