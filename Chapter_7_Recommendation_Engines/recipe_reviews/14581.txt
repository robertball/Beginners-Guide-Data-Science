This recipe provided a great, very tasty base for a marinade!  i improvised on portions, using slightly more soy sauce than oil and lemon juice.  i also added about 1-2 tbsp. honey and then the garlic.  it really was fabulous!!  2 of us ate all of the vegetables - a yellow squash, half an onion and 6 large brussel sprouts, quartered.  wonderful!

Nothing says summer like grilled veggies - especially if they're fresh from the garden (or in our case your neighbor's garden)! This is one of the easiest and most delicious ways to cook veggies. I cut way back on the oil and used low sodium soy sauce. After the veggies were done marinating. We put everything into a foil pan that we sprayed with a bit of Pam so nothing would stick. Great side dish for grilled meats.

I left out the tomatoes because they turn to mush anyway. Other than that I followed the recipe, but didn't measure precisely. This is wonderful.  I love everything about this recipe - the choice of vegetables, the cooking method, and particularly the marinade, which was just down right perfect. Light, fresh, and not overly seasoned, so the flavors of the vegetables are crisp and clean.  Hubs cooked this over a charcoal fire in a perforated grill pan, about 10 minutes. This went over well not only with Hubs and me, but with our dinner guests too.  I know Hubs will make sure this makes a repeat appearance as he was especially fond of this.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I marinated the veggies in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag (for about two hours) and grilled them in an aluminum foil pocket sprayed with cooking oil.  I sprinkled the veggies with fresh ground pepper and sea salt before wrapping them.  We grilled them for 8 minutes on each side and the veggies were cooked aldente.  They held their shape and color and the flavor was magnificent.  We will definitely make these marinated vegetables again – soon.  We may also experiment with some fresh herbs from our garden (basil or rosemary?).  Thanks for such a healthy, delicious side dish.

This is one of the best veggie recipes I've ever made.  So simple I tell my friends "it only has 4 easy to remember ingredients in the marinade...." It is just delicious!

This is one of the recipes that you look at and think that you'll try it, but you don't have much expectations about it being anything extraordinary.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  I used red peppers, baby zucchini, and eggplant and marinated them all day long.  I then grilled them inside on my Cuisinart Griddler.  My husband loved them and said this is the only recipe I should use when I grill vegetables.  Well, I will certainly take that into consideration, but as for me -- it was great, easy, and the marinade permeated the veggies.  Great recipe!

Excellent with Tandoori Chicken and Roasted Red Potatoes.  I used less marinade and used an entire zucchini, yellow squash, red pepper, and red onion.  I also roasted the vegetables in the oven (400 degrees for about 10-15 minutes until crisp and tender).  Very good!

This marinade kept the vegetables moist. It enhanced, and didn't cover up, the veggies' natural flavor. I reduced the lemon juice a bit and replaced that amount with balsamic vinegar, added oregano and marinated all for no longer than 40 minutes.
Succulent!

Delicious - I wrapped them in foil to make the grilling easier.  You can even make a packet per person, if you like!

This was really good, the only change I made; instead of placing veggies directly on grill, I placed them on a baking rack inside of a large metal roasting pan, than I placed them on the grill. I roasted on med-high for about 15 mintes. They were wonderful!!

I used low-sodium soy sauce in this recipe along with zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper & Vidalia onion.  The lemon was too pronounced and the garlic was lost among the other flavors.

I personally thought this marinade contained too much oil and lacked flavor. My husband couldn't even taste it and I had marinated it over the time specified. I guess I may use this recipe as a "base" recipe, but I will definitely reduce the oil and experiment with different seasonings in the future.

I really enjoyed this.  I laid tinfoil on the grill to keep the veggies from falling through. I poured the excess marinade onto the veggies on the foil.  I also cooked chicken with the veggies.  Cut the veggies and chicken in sizes that get done at the same time.

The best veggie marinade I've ever tried.  I used yellow squash, zucchini, red pepper, eggplant, cherry tomatoes and pieces of asparagus.  Marinated the veggies for about an hour.  Absolutely fabulous!

This recipe inspired me to review...
I only used the last four ingred. (used 1 full clove of garlic) with my own choice of veggies.  Fabulous!  Eggplant and portabella mushrooms are especially good.  I even liked it with raw veggies.

I make this for every bbq and I'll even broil it if the weather isn't cooperating.  Just be sure to slice your veggies fairly thick so they don't fall through the grill.  My vegetarian friends never feel left out of bbq and the carnivores love it too.

This recipe was fantastic.  Everyone loved it, even some 10-12 year olds, which surprised me.  I used more than 1/2 cup of each veggie (used 3 kinds of bell peppers, a whole pkg. of portabello mushrooms, and a whole container of (about 35) cherry tomatoes).  This was very good on the grill.

Wow...I have served this twice to company and they absolutely loved it.  I don't really measure the veggies - just throw everything in a glass bowl and double the amount of oil, soy, lemon and garlic.  This is really an impressive side dish!

Was not what it cracked up to be. Marinade was kind of bland and seasoning is definitely missing.

added 2 T honey, not able to do lemon juice, bit more soy sauce than oil. 
In mass quantity, make marinade, keep in jug. Put individual types of veggies in their own bags to marinade. Use everything carrots, beets, onion, peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, try gr beans. etc grill separately then mix.
EXCELLENT FLAVOR - FANTASTIC!

These are the best veggies in the world. this carnivore could almost turn vegetarian with this recipe! Don't marinate too long (that's why the one reviewer that didn't like them just tasted soy sauce).

I make a lot of different marinated veggies and this recipe was the best of all I've tried! I did add some fresh rosemary and oregano. I used low-sodium soy, which is what I always use. Grilled in my grill pan/basket over charcoal after marinating in a bag (on the counter, no need to refrigerate) for a little over an hour. Definitely will use this recipe again. Even the grape tomatoes I used turned out fabulous - but I chose tomatoes that were firm.

I loved this combo of veggies, and I'll definitely grill them together again. But the marinade wasn't great. I guess it was too much lemon, because the veggies -- especially the squash -- tasted sour. I'll try again next time with less lemon.

These were just OK. I feel as if the soy sauce is overpowering, a more natural 
flavor from the grilling process. I am still in the hunt, for a really good marinade.

Worked well on the mushrooms and onions but came out kind of bland on the squash. Somehow, the squash doesn't soak up the marinade as well as the other veggies.

I subbed a lot of the veggies:  used broccoli, zucchini, tomatoes, onion, baby carrots and red bell pepper.  I also didn't have enough lemon juice, so I added a few dashes of lemon pepper.  Everyone loved the way they turned out.  Great, simple recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe, Mathilda - thank you!  Because I was using sesame oil for "Grilled Asian Chicken" from this site by Janet M. (fantastic dish also BTW), I decided to replace a little of the olive oil for this recipe with some sesame oil and it worked well.  This is definitely going in my "Family Favorites" folder!!!

This is excellent, I had my reservations before i made this and almost didn't (due to the amount of soy sauce). My husband is no vegetarian, but even he comment on how good this was.  I did not add the squash (had none) and used less peppers (don't like them) and added heaps of mushrooms and zucchinis (love them) and marinated the whole lot for over 4 hours.  Did this on the BBQ (an Aussie thing - love my BBQ).  Would recommend this to anyone!

I too added teriyaki to the marinade and only used green and yellow squash and broccoli. I had a ton of vegies going on, yet my family just about devoured all of it. Did this on top of my stove with my grill pan. Great Mathilda and thanks!

I like these but I just wanted to say there is no way a 15 minute marinade is long enough. I did it for about 40 and think it could have used at least an hour to an hour and a half. I am going to try the honey next time and increase the marinating time.

Excellent.  My family loved this recipe.  I marinated the veggies, skewered them and grilled them on the bbq.  My daughter is a very picky eater but with this recipe she was asking for seconds of mushrooms, onions, and even zucchini.

Made as recipe stated, plus added the honey as someone had suggested.  SO GOOD!  Used yellow and red peppers, egg plant, zucchini and  sliced mushrooms.  Marinated it for 2 1/2 hours, put it in tin foil and grilled it.

This was tasty...the overall taste is nice, the lemon and soy just make any vegetable taste fresh and tangy...the only issue is that the oils and acids cause the vegetables to cook a bit differently so they don't come out crispy or crunchy but , rather, a bit soggy and overcooked.  I have found it very tough to find a good vegetable marinade,  I have tried nearly 10 on the internet and every single one is lackluster.I would give this recipe a 6 out of 10 but keep in mind the best one I've found so far is a 7 out of 10

I have made this recipe several times but I made so adjustments. I use zucchini, squash, onion, peppers, and mushrooms when I have them. Then I marinate them in 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce and 1-2 cloves of garlic minced. I leave out the lemon juice because I just don't care for it. Then I marinate the veggies for about 4 hours. Then I either grill them or sauté them in my wok. Either way they turn out great. I fix these several times a week with different meats or rice.

This recipe was very good, but I learned one thing that makes the difference: you want to have just enough marinade to gloss up all the vegetables, I had a big soupy pile in the bottom (not enough vegetables for the amount of marinade).  It is A LOT of marinade.  I used chopped red onions, sliced mushroom and chopped asparagus.  I only had it on the grill for about 6 minutes and everything was perfect!  I cooked it at the same time as my salmon and it all came out at the same time.  I also sprinkled "perfect pinch vegetable" over the top which made it even tastier.

I loved this recipe!!  I read the reviews and added fresh basil and oregano as suggested and marinated the veggies for about 6 hours.  Then I tossed them into a grilling pan and grilled them for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.   I think the trick was the length of time I marinated them.
Be sure to drain the marinade before grilling, and have a squirt bottle of water handy to put out any flair ups.

Thought it was great and would highly recommend.  To reduce the salt content I made a soy substitute from low salt chicken broth.  I also added some of our families favorite seasonings like basil, oregano, pepper and additional garlic powder.

super yummy! I was skeptical and thought it would be  kind of bland, but it was delicious!  I didn't use quite as much oil as it called for.  And I grilled in an aluminum pan that I poked holes into, to drain the juice. (Grilling right on the grates, I tend to lose lots of my veggies!)

This was delicious!!  I made just a couple tweaks - used less sodium soy sauce, juice from 1/2 a lemon and used a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Put the veg & marinade in a gallon ziplock bag and marinated for about five hours.  Removed the veg from the marinade and grilled in a foil grill pan.  I brought two bags of this to a BBQ at a friend's house and everyone seemed to like it.  I couldn't have been happier with this recipe!  Will DEFINITELY be making this again!!

I've made this as a side dish for a couple of BBQ's and it's always been a hit. I've even used eggplant with this, have fun with it you can't go wrong...I will say I didn't measure everything out for the marinade and I used fresh lemon juice and minced garlic but either way it's great. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

I made it pretty much as recipe said. I added the honey the reviewers mentioned.  I was a little short on lemon juice, but it was OK.  We had a large batch, a double layer  on grilling tray and 15-20 min. made them soft with just a little browning.  Maybe try cooking a little longer to make them a little browner?

Me & my spouse both agreed that the taste was just 'off'...for us, the flavors didn't blend harmoniously.  We enjoyed the grilling part of the veggies, but will be looking for a different marinade.

Yum!  The marinade is absolutely delicious.  It also brings out the natural sweet flavours of the onion, peppers and zucchini. The longer you marinate, the better it is.  My boyfriend who rarely eats vegetables, even thought it tasted great.  You can pretty much add lib any vegetables you have in the fridge.

Sorry.  My daughter and I weren't fans, but my husband liked it.   I thought it had too much lemon juice or maybe not enough Soy Sauce.  Basically, the lemon overpowered it.  Also--very bland.  Needed seasoning.

LOVED IT!!  The only thing I will change next time (probably tomorrow, in fact) is to use a little less oil.  But the flavour was great, and it cooked up really, really good on our raclette (hot stone fondue).  Thanks!

Loved this marinade. Found three long skewers of cut veggies  marked down at Sams.  Bought a rotiserre chicken , grilled the marinated veggies (tripled the recipe), easy supper on a hot summer night.  Two hours later had small watermellon that had been cooling 2 days on the air conditioning floor vent.

I'm not a big lemon fan so I substituted white balsamic vinegar in its place.  Also added the tomatoes at the half way point. It received good reviews.

This recipe was great. I made a couple changes since I only had 1/4 cup of lemon juice that's what I used and I only used 1/4 of a cup soy sauce. I also used 1/4 cup of vinaigrette since I had some on hand. I thought the recipe said to marinade for 2 hours so that's what I did. Next time I'll marinade it for an hour since one person commented that 1/2 wasn't long enough. I will make this again.

Made as is, but skipped the tomatoes and added asparagus, eggplant, and medium sized portabella mushrooms (whole.) Everyone loved it.

Made this for a big crowd tonight. Followed directions as written and added a teaspoon of honey as some recommended.  Overall this had good flavor but I’d agree with the person who suggested adding some seasoning.  Next time I’ll add more garlic and Italian seasonings.

Instead of using grill, I baked in uncovered casserole dish in 400 F oven for approximately 30 minutes.  Marinade was left in also.

I made this for a bbq for 20 people. Doubled the recipe and did add some honey to the marinade to soften the soy sauce flavor a bit. It was really delicious. Next time, I'll make rice and grilled chicken for a complete stir fry meal.

Left out the tomatoes as they just turn to mush on the grill, added brussel spouts, baby carrots and the rest of the veggies as directed.  I can live without the squash in this and won't use it again.  The problem with this type of recipe is that some veggies take a lot less time then others so while the zucchini was a little overdone, the squash wasn't done nearly at all.  It was okay and edible but not sure if I'll repeat this as directed. The marinade was great so possibly just have to nail down the veggie combo.

I tried this for Father's Day because my previous grilled veggie recipes were too oily. The marinade was simple and enhanced the charred vegetable flavor perfectly. I added one large jalapeño for a little kick which was absorbed entirely by the zucchini and yellow squash. It added too much heat for most guests. In the future, I will reduce jalapeño and double up on sweet peppers, mushrooms and onions as they offer the greatest depth in flavor.

Ok - too sour tasting to me and my guests. Would cut down to 1/2 the lemon juice (which I used fresh squeezed). I marinated for about 30 min, which was fine.

Wonderful.  I took the advice and added honey and then marinaded in fridge for 2 hours in a ziploc bag.  I didn't add any other seasoning.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce but otherwise this was great and the flavor of the veggies was not overwhelmed.  I have a 12 year old who will not eat ANY veggies (sigh) and she said this was "ok" which is a five star rating coming from her, since she spits out most veggies!! Thanks for posting this.

Mine turned out BAD! I did it exactly like in the recipe and my veggies were sour! They had lost all their natural flavor too... I don't know what I did wrong but next time I think i'll omit the marinade!

The marinade was awesome.  My family doesn't care for such veggies but tonight they went for seconds and even thirds!  I did make a couple changes...I did not have any lemon juice so I used lime juice instead.  Also added some honey to counter balance the soy sauce salt!

There are too many exception grilled vegetable recipes on this site to give this a good rating even when adding the honey. I made this for a big bbq and it barely got eaten. Turns out sour and very soya salty! Wish I would have stuck with Great Grilled Smokey Vegetables with Avocado and Goat Cheese (I leave out the avocado).

This was a very mild tasting marinade. Good flavor for veggies next to a spicy meat. I made a big batch and let my veggies marinate for a day or so until I was ready for them. They tasted great!

Loved this recipe.  Our grill ran out of gas but it still was great in the oven on a broiler.

I found this recipe a refreshing way  to do vegetables.  I used cucumber and red pepper and celery along with the vegtables listed in the recipe which  turned out quite nice.  The marinade is really excellent.  I cooked this in  the  oven  under  the broiler.
Very nice.
