OLE!  This is a wonderful guacamole that could be used as a side dish to any Mexican feast (like we did!).  I love the colors and the fact that it's FULL of vegetables, and even my 10 year old ate it happily.  10 stars!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

LOVE IT! Left out the red peppers and replaced it with tomatoes. Came out delicious. My family, friends and co workers love it! Always a hit when I make this.

My husband and I like a lot of flavor, and this guacamole, as written, was a little too bland for us.  I increased the amount of salt and lime juice and added a minced jalapeño, cumin, and chili powder.  I will make it again with the changes and will probably roast the corn as well,

I just made this and it is excellent, the only ingredient that I added was Jalapeno peppers (2) to give it a little kick. I will be making this often.

My family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it. We even spread it on some burgers that we grilled for dinner.  The next day they asked me to make it again.  Each time, I followed the recipe and did not change a thing, except for cutting up the avocado, rather than slicing it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this all the time. I add a jalepeno, cumin, and  a dash of chili powder. It also needs more salt and lime. Five star rating with these changes.

I don’t like avocado and neither do my kids. We call this guacamole for people who don’t like guacamole and it’s delicious!

I love this recipe, you can add to it to make it more colorful or just make it the way the recipe reads and you still won't be disappointed.

I thought the proportions all worked well.  However, we like our guac spicier, so we added more garlic, 2/3 cup of our favorite salsa, and chipolte hot sauce to taste.

This was such an easy dip to make.  All the vegetables make the taste explode...so yummy.  After half of it was gone, I added some chipotle flakes to add a smoky flavor.  Both ways were excellent.

Found this to be a little bland.  Subbed tomatoes for corn (we don't eat whole corn) and  added cumin and jalapeño  to spice it up a bit.

Just made for the first time today.... And, my daughter who will NEVER touch guacamole dip of any kind , tried this... Could NOT stop eating it, and took the left over home with her!! My husband said, " it was the best he has ever had and wants me to make it again this week"!  I too have to admit the favors were wonderful, I used 4 cloves of garlic and squeezed the juice of 2 limes,... This is a must try!!!!

Love this recipe!!  I didn't put black beans (forgot to buy) or cilantro (allergic). Still delicious. Also added dribble of olive oil & apple cider vinegar, and used lemon instead of lime.  Soooo good!  I will double recipe for parties.

I made this for a party and it was a big hit.  One person was allergic to bell peppers, so I substituted seeded tomato.  SInce the recipe called for half cans of the beans and corn, I made a double batch.  I put the extras in single serve containers and handed them out to people who asked for some.  I also put some in the freezer.
