I couldn't find any dry onion soup mix so I used onion gravy.  The tomato sauce comes in 8 oz. cans. I also browned a white onion with the beef AND drained the beef and onions.  I did not put all the shells in the casserole as it seemed like it would be too much.  Yummy!

I don't typically alter recipes but after reading some of the reviews and quickly taste testing, I thought I should. It didn't have much flavor. I followed the recipe but then added a little pepper, salt, garlic powder, paprika, and sour cream to taste. I also don't have a Dutch oven so I just used my stovetop and transferred to a baking dish for the oven. Turned out very good!

Needs a lot of changes to make it memorable, recipe as shown is very bland.  Kind of like a Hamburger Helper dish.

Taking a cue from other reviewers, I used spaghetti sauce (an ample amount) instead of tomato sauce. Overall, a pretty tasty dish.

I doctored it up like I do everything else. Added garlic, also used marinara sauce and threw in half of a jar of salsa. It was really really good that way.

Inexpensive, filling, and makes a lot. Unfortunately the flavor is nothing special. Good enough recipe when you need something in quantity, fast.

This is a tasty and filling casserole, but you really need to go heavy on seasoning.  I added lots of chili powder and doubled the cheese -- I also replaced whole-kernel corn with mixed vegetables to round out the nutrients.

Didn't have the dish called for, so I made the mix in a saucepan and switched everything over to a casserole dish, and it turned out just fine. It looks great!

Really good. Instead of using creamed corn, I just used whole kernel corn and added in zucchini.  My kids really liked it too!

It was good but not overly flavorful. First time I've made it so I will probably adjust some spices to see if I can give it a little more taste. Family loved it and great for a busy schedule. Great to have it in the refrigerator to heat up.

It was pretty good and I liked how easy and fast it was.  Good weekday meal.  I did use corn with peppers in it instead of plain corn.  I may use less a Tablespoon less of onion mix next time and add another 1.2c of cheese.  This may also be good topped with sourcream.   Definitely a good recipe to play with.  Thx!
