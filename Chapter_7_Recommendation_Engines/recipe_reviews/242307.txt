Very Good! This bread is VERY filling, so I think it would be great w/ just a salad for a light dinner or cut up small for appy's. I only used 1/2 of the seasoned salt and that was plenty, IMO, and I also cut back on the sour cream a bit b/c I didn't have the full 16oz. on hand. I really liked the idea of toasting the insides of the bread in butter and garlic...it tasted really good, lol. Nice flavors...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was OK.  My husband liked it, but  he said the flavors were "interesting."   I'm not sure I will make it again.
