I really liked this quick meal. I left out the carrots so it was fast and used wide egg noodles instead of elbow. I also used more sauce and less water so it was kinda like a stew, it was great!

This is a very yummy recipe, but I'm not sure how much it reminds me of a stew.  It's like a stew/chilli/hamburger helper/soup, type of thing.  Very good and easy though.  I left out the celery because I didn't have any.  For the vegetables I used a 1/2 cup of canned diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of frozen corn, 1/2 cup frozen green beans, and a 1/2 cup of frozen peas.  Used shell noodles instead of macaroni and kept everything else about the recipe the same.  Husband really liked it and so do I.

I thought this was very good, and very easy to make.  I too added some garlic. Only problem was I used Italian style mixed veggies, and they are pretty large cuts, they took alittle longer to get tender, next time I would cook them a little while in the micowave before adding to the stew. I will make this again.

Made this with a large can of V-8 juice instead of water and tomato sauce. Also didn't use celery and fresh carrots, only the frozen veggies.

My family loved it - more than I did!  I did as others mentioned and added more italian seasoning as well as some garlic powder.  I had no frozen veggies so used fresh green beans, along with the carrots, celery and onion.  I also added more pasta to make it more of a meal, instead of a stew.  I say 4 stars, my family says 5!

This is a great recipe. I had no elbow macaroni so I used seashell macaroni. We all loved it including my 5 yr. old grand daughter, who is very picky about food. She called it Seashell Stew. It was great for a cold winters night in Ohio too! Thanks! Carole

Made this last night - was VERY easy and yummy.  I didn't have any celery on hand, so I just skipped it.  Added some extra seasoning... garlic powder and Tony's. Instead of noodles, I added some extra tomato sauce, water and minute rice.  We really enjoyed it!  :)

DEICIOUS is all I can say about this recipe. We thought is was very tasty!! I added garlic when frying my hamburg. The veg's I used were 1 cup of can whole tomatoes cut up (plus some liquid), 3/4 cup of frozen corn, 3/4 cup of fresh green beans cut up small( precooked them for a while), plus the 3 carrots stated in the recipe, and shell pasta. I followed the rest of the recipe, and this turned out delicious. I love the Italian seasoning flavor. We did sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on it when serving. It was thick...but so what! The flavor was there and that was important. Very healthy and filling. Good meal for these chilly nights. Served with buttered dinner rolls...EXCELLENT !! Thanks so much for the recipe...it definitely is a keeper in my house..

This will be a regular in our house! I received this in an email and the amusing name prompted me to open it. I had several ingredients in the fridge (a couple were about to get tossed). I keep cooked hamburger in the freezer in 1-cup baggies. I used 2 for this recipe. I simmered the onions, celery, and carrots in the water until the carrots were done, then added the cooked hamburger. I followed everything else to a T, except my pasta was whole wheat rotini (it's prettier). This recipe will be my excuse to start saving the 1/2 serving of leftover vegies from other meals in a tub in the freezer. This time I used all the partial bags that had accumulated in the back of the freezer. :-) I think corn should always be included for the little burst of sweetness it adds.

This was a great recipe for using things I already had on hand and my family seemed to enjoy it although I thought it was a little bland.  Might add a little more seasoning and/or garlic next time.

Healthy comfort food? It's almost too good to be true! I used fresh zucchini, mushrooms and frozen peas instead of a bag of frozen veggies. I also skipped the celery because we don't care for it.

Originally I followed this recipe to a T, but upon tasting, I changed quite a few things to improve it. I used at least twice as much Italian seasoning as it called for (I confess that after a while I stopped measuring) and added more water to it. I used the Italian Seasoning I from this site; it gave the stew a nice herb-y flavor, but it was still very bland. Instead of pasta, I used left-over white rice I'd cooked in chicken broth. It added some nice flavor, but sucked up all the liquid and gave the stew an odd, grainy texture. Next time I'll use pasta as the recipe states. It was still bland, however, so I added a can of diced tomatoes and plenty of salt. (Around 2 tbsp) I added cheese and hot sauce to mine at the table. That helped a lot! Next time I'll use spicy Rotel with chilies and pasta instead of rice. I will make again, but without my adjustments I would rate this recipe maybe 2-3 stars. Thanks for the idea though, this can be a great recipe if you play with it some.

I made this the other night and it was good but needs more flavor and next time instead of water I'm going to add extra tomato sauce. Other than that it was a hit & easy to make!

I made this with fresh vegies as I didn't have frozen and I left out the celery.  It was nice and thick.  Good flavor.  I paired it with fresh baked bread. My kids loved it, thanks.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS OKAY. IT WAS VERY BLAND. I ADDED HOT SAUCE, EXTRA SEASONING AND ALOT OF SALT TO GIVE IT IN FLAVOR. IT WAS QUICK AND EASY SO I MIGHT MAKE IT IN AGAIN IF IM IN A HURRY.

After I browned the meat, celery, and onions I threw everything in the slow cooker (except the pasta) on high for 2 hrs and low for 4 hrs. I ended up leaving out the pasta entirely and it was just fine without it. I found this recipe to use up some leftover spaghetti sauce from the jar. Inexpensive, easy, and tasty. Served with Super Easy Rosemary Bread Machine Bread recipe also from this site.

My husband and I liked this very much.  As it was cooking, however, I did have to add an extra can of tomato sauce and a bit more water.  Also extra Italian seasoning.  I also agree with other reviews that it was even better on day 2.  I'll be making it again!

I liked it more than my 13 year old. I used leftover green/yellow peppers instead of mixed veggies. I more than doubled the use of Italian spice & would recommend it. Very filling and very tasty!

It wasn't good.  It had no flavor.  I had to add so many herbs, seasonings and cheeses just to make it edible.

I made this recipe and my family loved it.  I didn't have any celery so I didnt add it and I used canned mixed vegetables and it was really tasty.  Although, when I made it I didnt realize the recipe called for 2 cups of "cooked" macaroni so when I used 2 cups of uncooked macaroni, that kinda soaked up most of the sauce..but it was still good and next time I will only stir in 1 cup of uncooked macaroni.  Will definitely have again soon!

It is literally a pot full of veggies and ground beef, but I guess that's why it's called cheapskate stew.  Simple and loved it.  Perfect for busy people that want leftovers for next day.  Would make it over and over.  Thank you!

Fabulous....IMy only changes were Dill weed, chopped garlic, fresh basil, and topped each bowl with a dollip of sour cream/chives.  I needed to use up some meat juice (from a roast)so I used this instead of water.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good basic, last minute dinner idea. I substituted 1 cup of chicken broth for 1 of the cups of water. I used mixed veggies (carrots, beans and corn) and added a handful of chopped frozen spinach. I also added a dash or two of granulated garlic (I would've done fresh but it hit me after I'd sauteed the onions and beef. 

Smells quite good! Serving with crusty Italian bread for a low maintenance dinner after a hard day with the kiddoes...

I thought this recipe was good. I followed the advice of other reviews and added garlic, a spicy pepper blend, and twice the amount of italian seasoning. I also added fresh greenbeans and a can o mushrooms. Wonderful served with cornbread!

My family loved this recipe!!  We ate it hot off the stove.  I then let it sit for about an hour after it was finished cooking (only about 1/2 was left).  The macaroni soaked up most of the soup.  I then added 8 oz. of tomato sauce and one can of water and simmered it until it was warm.  This made the leftovers as great as the first meal!

I have to admit, this recipe was a little dissapointing after all the great reviews I read. It wasn't horrible, but I don't think I'll be making it again. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested adding cheese, it made a world of difference.

It was quite good until I added the pasta. It seemed that the pasta absorbed alot of the liquid even though it was pre-cooked. I will try this again but without the pasta.

I’ve made this many times now and would love it if it only used up leftover vegetables.  But, it also uses up Spaghetti-O’s (which I consider inedible otherwise).  It also brings back memories — my husband’s mom made essentially the same dish for him for a quick lunch — hamburger and alphabet soup, and we as newlyweds, carried on the tradition.  I use only half the ground meat and canned or cooked carrots, and the Spaghetti-O’s with additional sauce in place of the pasta.

Super easy to tweak to your personal tastes / preferences by changing up the added veggies and the seasonings. I had pre-cooked ground beef and onion, so used that (but less then the called for amount), and didn't have cooked macaroni noodles, so just threw everything in with the raw macaroni to simmer until the noodles were tender (I just used a little extra water). I added a chicken bouillon cube and otherwise followed seasoning instructions. Simple, filling, tasty, and packed with veggies. Perfect!!

This was far better than I expected.  I just loved it.  I had to add a little extra water because I simmered it so long that some of the water evaporated.  It still turned out wonderfully.  Will certainly make again.

I have made this recipe many times as written and really love it.  The last time I made it, however, I made a delicious mistake.  I realized at the last minute that I didn't have tomato sauce and was forced to use a can of enchilada sauce instead.  It really added a lot of zing!  Now I add it every time!

The end result of this recipe resembled recipes I have called "Peasant Pasta".   I only had 1 lb. ground beef and 1 c (when raw) elbow macaroni so I used those quantities instead of what was listed.  I added some additional seasoning as recommended by other readers.   My family like it, and I will make it again.

Not bad, but not gourmet - definitely traditional all American homecooked meal.  I added garlic powder and extra italian seasoning like other reviews suggested.  I froze half of it for a cold winter night.
