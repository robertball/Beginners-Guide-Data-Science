I scaled this way, way, WAY down and loved it. I cooked it a little longer to reduce it a bit. This is one of those recipes where you need to be able to adjust on the fly to what you need -- I used bottled lime juice so I just guessed at it and added a little extra later. Not every lime yields the same amount of juice, so keep more OJ handy in case you need to dilute this sauce to get the saltiness down, and taste as you go! Thanks ajt1120, I think this is my new favorite dipping sauce!

This stuff is great! I used pineapple juice instead of orange because it's what i had on hand. Also i didn't have sesame oil, so i just upped the amount of sesame seeds used to give the sauce  more sesame flavor. A little spicy for me, but i don't like a lot of heat. Next time a little less pepper. Over all a wonderful and versatile sauce.

Great flavor, but, I wish it were not so thin.

Very good with baked coconut shrimp.  I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, so I had to substitute ground ginger.

To reduce the thinness, I stir in a little cornstarch or arrowroot starch before cooking. These are commonly used thickening agents in just about any Asian style sauce.

Amounts waaaay too big...would reduce by 2./3 next time. Good recipe, a little spicey for our liking and I had used only 3 tsp instead of 4.5 tsp of red pepper flakes. I used as a stir fry sauce instead of just a dipping sauce. worked out well!

Absolutely delicious....mine was also very thin but I fixed that by making a slurry with cornstarch and adding that in when the mixture was bubbling. I used it to dip teriyaki pork kebobs in. My company loved it!

This is a great dipping sauce recipe!!! I made coconut shrimp earlier in the day and felt that I needed a dipping sauce different from the cocktail sauce I normally use. I had to scale this sauce down from 56 servings to ten. Other than that, this was quick and easy to make. My husband loved it too. I just wish it wasn't so thin

My husband and I tried it last night. It was very delicious. We used less less of honey, soy sauce (a 1/4 of a cup each) and orange juice (a half cup) and forgot to put in the sesame oil. I am using the left over sauce with salmon tonight. I would make it again in a heart beat.

I really liked this with some shrimp I made.  I cut the recipe to make for 6 and it was still way too much for just the 2 of us :)
