I used fresh green beans instead of canned...I also partially cooked the bacon so that it would be nice and crisp once cooked.  I wasn't sure if I should cover the pan before baking, so I didn't.  The green beans came out very crisp.  I think next time I make this I will cover the dish with aluminum foil so that the beans can steam.  This probably wouldn't be a problem with canned beans, but I like the taste of fresh beans much more than canned.

I was a little worried about the sweetness, however there was nothing to worry about. The brown sugar mixture enhances the beans and bacon making each bite a real treat.

This was both super yummy and uber easy  win-win!  I made this after I couldn't find a critical ingredient for another dish to take to a dinner and games party.  So it was very last-minute.  I had pre-cooked the bacon for the other dish, which I'm glad I did.  Not sure it could have cooked to a crispy point in the oven on top of the beans.  

I, too, was a little worried about the sweetness but the garlic powder helps mitigate it.  Bottom line, I was disappointed when they ran out before I was able to get seconds.  Guess I'll have to make it again ;)

Everyone said this was the BOMB!!!!! Definitely a great twist on green beans. I used applewood smoked bacon, it really complimented the brown sugar, butter and garlic mixture. I also added a little crushed red pepper, just for a little kick. Will be making this again!

This was good. I used fresh green beans (because they needed used up) and microwaved them for approx. 5 minutes.  Then made the casserole as suggested (except I forgot the bacon until half way through, so I microwaved my bacon until it was half cooked, and added it on top of the beans in the oven).  This was enjoyable; my husband quite liked it and I thought it was pretty good, considering I don't like cooked green beans as a rule.

I used maple sugar bacon so reduced the amount of brown sugar in the recipe by half. To make better I would cut the bacon into smaller pieces (still lay on top) so that it's easier to eat.  All my guests ended up cutting the bacon to eat with the beans anyway, so then they'd be precut.

Made these for Thanksgiving lunch and should have doubled the recipe as it was one of the few sides with no leftovers! Used fresh beans and microwaved slightly per another reviewer's suggestion.  Added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of black pepper which gave it a nice kick. And mixed dry ingredients, chopped up apple maple smoked bacon night before and prepared in the a.m.

This was a really good recipe. I often make green bean bundles using these same ingredients; wrapping the bundles in the bacon then topping with the brown sugar/butter mixture before baking. This is like a deconstructed version of the bundles, it's very quick and easy and tastes delicious. It also reheats very well. I halved the recipe since there are only two of us.

I used fresh green, yellow and purple beans. I added a splash of maple syrup, splash of canola oil, walnut pieces and used smoked cured bacon. Cover to bake. Fabulous!

Oh man, I am turned! I usually hate beans, but this was so good. There's no way to mess these beans up, I eyeballed the recipe a few times and they turned out great every time. I always skip the bacon to cut the fat, but I can imagine how good it must be along with it. However, if you don't have a sweet tooth, or prefer your food more savoury and salty, this isn't for you.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it (except my nine-year-old, who only likes green beans made the way I usually make them). I'm vegetarian, so I omitted the bacon and used vegan bacon salt in place of it. It was great! I'll definitely make this recipe again!

I was quite skeptical on the amt of Brown Sugar  due to me not being much of a sweets person but i tried it anyway. Needless to say the wife and kids loved it and so did I... So much that i had to make it again 2 times within the following week! The only things i changed on the recipe was the use of the almonds. Not an almond fan myself, also i use light brown sugar and cooked the bacon a bit, maybe 2 min on the skillet other than that it was to the T and Delicious!

What a delicious side dish. Next time I will use fresh beans and slightly microwave before. I like the idea of cutting the bacon into smaller pieces. This recipe is a win, win.

I used fresh beans a well.  This was very good but I would cut back on the brown sugar mixture.  It made the dish way too sweet.

My family loves this!  I took it to a family reunion, and they loved it too!  So easy to make.  I made it the way it was written the first time, and it was great, but I cooked the bacon some after that so it would be a little crisper.  (My husband suggested cooking the bacon some, as he likes it crisper. )

Very good green beans with great flavor.  I used a thawed, frozen package of Italian Green Beans.  I'm glad I microwaved the bacon pieces for a 1 minute 30 seconds, otherwise I don't think that it would have gotten crispy.  I would make these again.  Served it with 'Slow Cooker Barbeque Chicken' from AR.

After years of making the green bean casserole I tried this recipe to make something different. It was a huge hit BUT, now I have to make both during family dinners. Not sure it was worth it but it rivals the green bean casserole! Totally different taste but everybody loved it! I made a double batch and it was just as good. Now it's double batches of both!

These were delicious! If you live at altitude like I do give these an extra 10 minutes at 375 degrees to get them just right.

Also, you can easily adjust the butter/brown sugar amounts to your own taste. The recipe as listed may be a little sweet for some people, but not for me. I'm a sugar fiend. Just cut back on the amount of brown sugar and butter you use if they are too sweet for you.

Yummy, easy, everyone loved it & several people requested the recipe.  The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly & it was divine but this is a recipe you can play with & it's still awesome.  Sometimes I just stir in real bacon bits for the last 5 minutes or so of baking (if you add them right away
they can get too hard).  I've also made it without bacon & other times I cut the brown sugar back to 1 or 2 tablespoons  but no matter what,  it comes out great every time.

Our teenage son, who normally is not fond of green beans, took a second helping and emptied the dish.  Other than using frozen green beans and starting with bacon that I had previously partially cooked and stashed in the freezer, I followed the directions as is.  The recipe used ingredients that I always have on hand, it was very simple to make, and the family loved it.

Excellent recipe. Very good flavor. I followed the recipe with fresh beans cooked in the microwave for 4 minutes before putting the mixture in the oven. I cut the bacon in pieces 1/4th inches & mixed it with the other ingredients before putting everything in the oven.

I used fresh green beans and left the dish uncovered. They turned out great, everyone even my unveggy loving son liked these. Not too sweet which I was a bit worried about. We will make these lots! Thank you for this easy tasty dish.

I too was  skeptical about the amount of brown sugar but it turned out great!  I did cook the bacon a bit before putting it in the oven since I wanted to ensure it was crispy.

Family loved it, even my husband who does not like green beans! I halved the sugar, dumped in a bunch of real Bacon bits, and used frozen beans. Super easy and very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, every time I cook it I get great complements. The longer you cook it the best it tastes because the sugar becomes caramalized. Make sure the green beans are well drained, or defrosted before  preparing.
