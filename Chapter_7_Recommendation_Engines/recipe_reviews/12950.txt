I am from Louisiana and I have eaten better gumbo but it was not bad.  A few of you are saying the okra was very slimy.  This is because you must boil your okra in a seperate pot with lots of water for about an hour before you put it into your gumbo.  Also using frozen okra is not as slimy to begin with.  Chop one medium yellow onion and add at same time as other vegetables.  Be very careful of when making your roux(the flour and oil mixture) it can be very tricky.  If you burn it throw it away do not use it, your gumbo will taste burnt.  Also do not cook your roux with the top on.  It is a very delicate thing.  Roux may be purchaseable at your local grocer depending on where you live.  Good luck!

This is the kind of meal that sings to my hubby! I did change a few things though. I used my leftover turkey carcass with onions, celery and carrots to make my stock. I've made several tomato based gumbos before and wanted to stay away from that with this recipe, so I omitted them. In order to obtain a really rich flavor, which this recipe is famous for, the roux needs to become a deep caramel color. Six minutes would never cut it. Forty five minutes of constant stirring will do the trick. Time consuming, but worth it. I also used a whole chopped onion, a cup of green onion and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. Very delicious, satisfying and loved by the whole gang Christine! (this was my original review, but I just wanted to thank "Gettinghealthy" for the "dry roux" suggestion. He/she didn't say how to brown the flour in the oven so I researched it on the net. Boy oh boy, did this ever save a lot of work!!!! You can put whatever amount of flour onto either a cookie sheet or in a cast iron skillet and pop it into the oven at 400 for an hour. Give it a stir every fifteen minutes. The whole house will smell nutty and the flour browns up beautifully. Save and store any remaining flour to add flavor to any gravy. This sure beats standing over that stove and stirring for a half hour. Thanks!)

A real keeper! Having made this several times now, here are my helpful hints: I use 8 (not 4) cups cooking liquid, diced (not whole) tomatos, a chopped yellow onion and no file powder. I use frozen sliced okra - just dump it into a pan of boiling water, boil for 12 minutes, then drain in a colander before adding with the rest of the veggies. To make the roux in 6 minutes the oil should be barely simmering but not smoking when you add the flour then stir, stir, stir! If using frozen shrimp make sure you thaw them first, then press between layers of paper towels to remove excess water before adding to the gumbo - they act like little sponges. Lastly, use the leftover chicken liquid when making the rice. Yum!

Delicious gumbo.  I modified it a bit (looking for a low cal dish).  I used 4 cups chicken broth instead (used in lieu of reserved chicken boiling water), 4 boneless chicken breasts not chicken parts (boiled in water).  I used 1 stick of butter instead of oil for the roux.  I omitted the file powder (gumbo is very thick without it).  I added one large onion & 1 Tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning (it was a bit bland without it).

I estimated the calories on the whole dish to be around 3117.  A heaping 1/2 cup white rice + 1 heaping cup gumbo would be around 385 calories.  I figure you will get a minimum of 11 servings from one batch of gumbo.

Excellent recipe.  We love cajun cooking but there's a lot of fat in this because of the oil.  I have learned to brown flour on a cookie sheet in the oven until it's nice and dark and flavorful, and it adds just as much roux flavor as a traditional oil/flour roux made in a skillet.  I also omitted the tomatoes, we prefer our gumbo to not have any.  You can also boil a few uncracked eggs directly in the pot about 10 minutes before serving and then crack and peel the hot eggs and eat with the gumbo, really yummy and very cajun!

This was great!  The only thing I did differently was not add the file powder-I believe that if you have okra, you don't need file-at any rate, it was great.  I'm from Louisiana so I know my gumbo!  I also just used a hot link sausage-they don't sell andouille where I live.

This is my husband's favorite food that I make.  The roux takes longer than 6 minutes, more like 20. I add chopped onion (about 1 cup) and several cloves of minced garlic, and don't use celery or bell pepper. I add 2 cans of "Roasted Garlic" diced tomatoes (Hunt's) Use frozen okra and simmer separately for about 20 mins. then strain off the goo. That way the okra is not slimey in the soup. I also add shrimp - the "Easy-Peel" frozen kind at the market - and I simmer the shells in just enough water to cover them, for about 10 minutes. I strain the shells out and use this flavorful broth as part of the water required. Then I add the raw shrimp in the last 5 mins. of cooking - don't overcook your shrimp or they'll be tough!  I add Zatarain's Creole Seasoning to taste. Serve over hot rice.  This is so good that my neighbors will come around when they smell this cooking at my house. It's work-intensive but so worth it. Leftovers freeze and reheat well.

This recipe takes a long time - I cooked it on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  The only thing about it that's remotely difficult is browning the flour - just keep an eye on it.

This dish was a huge hit at my house.  Some of us like to ladle it over rice in our bowls, others like it as is.  Some of us added Tobasco, some not.  

I substituted 1 lb of peeled, deveined shrimp for some of the chicken, and put them in for the last simmering.  

This dish freezes well.

Yum!!! Just a few changes, but I otherwise followed the recipe. I used a stick of butter with the flour to make the roux, and used less chicken but added shrimp. Used red pepper instead of green, and threw in some of Emeril's creole seasoning (his recipe from the website, not the premade bought stuff). Served it over white rice. Tasted great that day and the next, but there was no third day! We will be making this many more times!!

Good stuff...  I love a food full of flavor.  I don't have okra so I use a can of corn.  And Andouille sausage isn't easy to come by in these parts either.  I use spicy Italian sausage...a nice substitute if I do say so myself.

I make my own Reux.  I found some store bought File powder too...very nice.  They make it just that much more authentic.

Now everyone thinks I'm a great cook!!  This stuff is awesome.

I have lived all my life (45 years) down the bayou and I have eaten many, many different chicken gumbos.  I have never tasted or even heard of putting tomatoes in a gumbo.

This was OK. I've made better pots of gumbo with my own recipe. It didn't have the strong gumbo flavor I was looking for. 
I prefer flouring and seasoning my chicken before frying them in the oil. We take the chicken pieces out of the oil and then make the roux...the darker the better! We add our "trinity" vegetables to the hot roux (stand back!)and sautee them until just tender. Add chicken stock/broth instead of water (more flavor) and then add GOOD QUALITY smoked pork sausage (as mild or spicy as you like) and then simmer for a bit while I debone the chicken. I add some smoked pork or turkey tasso and the chicken and simmer until chicken is tender. If I've seasoned my chicken properly I shouldn't have to season again...but you can add some creole seasoning, cayenne, salt, pepper or file. Serve over hot rice and top with more file or green onions.

WOW!  It's got a kick!  I used close to 3 lbs of chicken breast and a lb of shrimp.  I didn't have pepper so I added in 1/4 cp cajun seasoning.  I also put rice on the bottom of each bowl.  It definitely makes 10 servings (medium size bowls) but three of us finished it in one setting!  This was my first gumbo and I served it to 2 born and bred Louisianna men, I couldn't get a word out of them just moans.  :)
I followed advice and cooked the ruex for 20 minutes.  It turned out great but I forgot it was hot oil so beware when you pour in the rest of the ingredients.  I would definitely only serve this with honey cornbread.  Anything else would overstimulate the tastebuds.  My 4 year old had a small bowl of the soup part and dipped his cornbread in it for his dinner.  He liked it, too!

I go to a vocational school, and am in the culinary arts program. I made this to serve on the lunch line and everyone who had it loved it - including myself! The only thing is I had to substitute andouille for keilbasa.. [because andouille is a bit expensive/hard to find around here!]

Crock pot! I made this entire thing in my crock pot because I didn't have the time to make this later at night when I needed it, but had time earlier during the day. I browned 4 large chicken breasts and put them in the crock pot, made the roux over the stove, added chicken broth and some chicken bullion to the roux, and then stuck everything the veggies and sausage into the crock pot raw. I poured the roux/broth mixture and spices ect over top and set it on low for about 5 hours, added brown minute rice to thicken this up (I don't like soupy gumbo, I want a thick eat with a fork gumbo) and let it set another hour or so with the shrimp in there, too. This was delicious. I thought that it'd be too spicy with the cayenne, but I thought it was just perfect. This was so easy and delicious. Everyone at the dinner really liked it.

This was my first attempt to make gumbo.  We have always enjoyed it out. It is amazing!  I couldn't find andouille sausage so I used a pkg of each spicy and sweet sausages and a bag of chicken breasts.  I cooked my roux 25 minutes until it was really dark brown and I think that is where the flavor comes in.  Didn't use the File powder did use the Okra but didn't get the purpose of it for it didn't seem to add much flavor it was my first time using it.  Frankly it was gross.  But will make this recipe again.  My Brother in Law requested it for Christmas dinner! It's a keeper!  Thanks for submitting it!

I found this recipe a few years ago and I've made it regularly since.  Time consuming, but worth it.  It makes a lot and I've made it ahead to take on trips and such.  I use about 3/4 lb each shrimp & scallops in place of 2 lbs of the chicken.  I have a hard time finding andouillle so I use italian turkey sausage and it's fine.  I do cook the roux for 25 - 30 minutes and I think that's essential for the flavor and it wasn't as difficult as I'd imagined.  I don't care for okra but I did use it the first few times feeling it wouldn't be "authentic" w/o it, but it's sort of a pain to de-goo it first so I eventually cut it out and it's been good w/o.  I only began using the file the last couple of times and I like it - I do add it after I turned the burner off. I reduce the cayenne a bit, maybe by half, because I'm a bit of a sissy w/ the heat.  Other than that the seasonings are perfect for me.  This recipe is very versatile and forgiving - Love it!

I love gumbo and this recipe is really good.  I make a few changes (main one is flour small chicken pieces and brown in canola oil first) but the recipe is great as is.  I think a key to good andouille gumbo is to get the beswt andouille sausage you can.  More smoke = better flavor in the end.

My boyfriend is an avid cajun fan, and because of work, goes to New Olreans all the time (well, before Katrina). However, I made this, and he said it was BETTER than what he usually has there! I did boil my okra about 30 minutes instead of sauteing it.

My husband for years has sworn that he does not like gumbo.  I made a batch (sticking as close to the recipe as my personality allows me to). He not only had a second helping, but when he met a gentleman from Louisiana the next day, bragged that his wife made the best gumbo!  Excellent Recipe!!!! Thanks, now I can enjoy homemade gumbo again!!

This is a great dish! Don't let it intimadate you. I use chicken breast instead of awhole chicken. Smoked sausage instead of andouille, because the andouille is really too spicy for my young children, and shrimp. I also don't use the file powder, and I still get rave reviews! It's my 'go to' dish these days for guests. Everyone thinks it must be hard to make,but it is really so simple!Thanks

Cher Christine, you cannnot have a proper Cajun dish without the "Trinity", i.e., ONIONS, celery and bell peppers. I would saute the trinity for a few minutes, adding the Pope (garlic) about half way through before adding the tomatos.  Adding file powder to hot gumbo 15 minutes before serving will make a some thick dish.

With some very minor changes after reading reviews, I thought this was delicious, as did my familyl!  Added extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt, used frozen okra, and held off on the cayenne till the end - andouille can really spice up a dish.  Used less than 1/2 teasppon of cayenne and thought it had the perfect spice.  Also added some extra smoked turkey sausage just because I had it.  Doubled the batch and freezing the rest.  I am not a gumbo expert, but I do make a lot of soups and I thought this was great!!!

California perspective: The MOST excellent gumbo!  Family friendly if you have children 9 and older.  Replace the andouille sausage with smoked sausage for younger ages.  Ones who like it hotter can add jalepenos to theirs.  I left out the file gumbo as the consistency was thick enough.

I have made this gumbo for our neighborhood Mardi Gras party for the past three years.  I love it and so does everyone else.  This year I tried leg quarters because that's what was in the freezer - too fatty.  Chicken should be on the bone, though.  Can't get Andouille in NC so I just leave it out - you don't miss it.  I also sub canned okra for fresh - save a step.  I make three recipes and put it in three crock pots and warm all day while preparing my other recipes.  Love it!!

What I do differently is use chicken broth instead of water, saute my veggies (not the okra) first and okra in at the end. My family loves it.

A great fall and winter dish to warm you up. I added 2-tablespoons of Louisiana hot sauce to the mix just because I like the flavor.

I've only had gumbo once before and it was at a cajun place in Santa Barbara so I do not know what authentic gumbo tastes like. Taking that into account, my family really liked this recipe.  I made it as stated and I used "fresh" andouille sausage.  I had read somewhere that andouille by definition is smoked but for some reason this one was not.  (bought at uli's at pike's market)  I even found the file powder at world spices near pike's market which I was ecstatic about b/c it was hard to find at local chain grocery stores.  Anyhow, we did find it a bit spicy so next time I would tone it down maybe 1/4 of what it asks for but that is personal preference.  It makes a lot so if two people are eating it, be prepared for lots of leftovers.  I would recommend adding the okra last, maybe even the next day if you are making it a day ahead.  It fell apart by the time we ate it the next day as I made it ahead of time.  The roux took about 25 minutes to darken a golden brown. Next time I will darken it more to a milk chocolate color.  I'm making it for a mardi gras party next week so hopefully it will go over well with the crowd.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Took this to a party and everyone asked for the recipe - didn't have any leftovers to take home.  Will definitely make again and again.  Will try to get file powder for next batch.  I added one lb. of cooked, peeled shrimp at the end.  I also cooked frozen okra (couldn't find fresh) in separate pot and drained before adding to the gumbo.  The amount of spices added was perfect!

I demonstrate sausage on weekends and so had lots of Cajun andouille sausage on hand.  I added shrimp and some crab meat and it was good, not as good as I remember eating in New Orleans.  I will make it again however.

Loved it!  I don't give it 5 only because I have lived down south and had some very incredible gumbo dishes, but this one is by far the best that I have been able to make at home.  My husband has never used the term "really delicious" with any of my dishes, until now!  This is my first review, because I finally found a recipe worth coming back to comment on.  I followed it exactly and everything was perfect.

This was just ok. The flavor, even after several adjustments, was just too bland. I roasted the peppers for a little more flavor, and threw a jalapeño and a red bell pepper into the mix. I also added a few whole cumin seeds and a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder. The cocoa helped the flavor quite a bit - I don't think I would have liked the stew otherwise. Now the roux, I disagreed with the recipe on. If you’re inexperienced with making roux, I suppose I could see the point in the double boiler, but it’s such a pain in the neck and it takes FOREVER. A whisk and a well pre-heated cast iron skillet over medium-low heat is the trick. It took me about 6 or 7 minutes, whisking constantly, to get the nice, deep golden roux. If you feel it’s getting too hot, just slide the pan off the burner for a moment or two to cool a bit and knock down your heat a notch. Next time I’m going to let it darken a little more. It was also requested that I add shrimp to the next batch.

excellent recipe. i made a few changes. substituted chicken broth for water, added 1 stick of unsalted butter to the roux, and cooked the roux for 30 minutes (can't imagine 6 being enough) added one chopped yellow onion and next time will substitute 1/2 the chicken for shrimp or crawfish tails. i also overdid the cayenne and garlic a bit. used frozen okra, so i sauteed it frozen for about 75% longer than suggested. AN EXCELLENT AND HEARTY MEAL

This is a great gumbo recipe.  I used a 14 ounce can of okra and cooked it for a few minutes before adding.  I also decreased the chicken to 2 pounds and added a pound of shrimp.  I couldn't find file powder and thought I might use cajun seasoning instead, but I thought that it was seasoned perfectly and might have been a bit too spicy with anything else.  I also agree that the roux takes longer than 6 minutes for a nice, deep golden brown.  I also added a small onion.  We ate it that same night, but it was delicious the next day since the flavors really settled in.  It takes a while, but it's worth it!

Great Basic recipe!! My So loved it, and told me it was better then his mother's gumbo

I Used an extra 1/2 pound of adouille, added a 6 ounce Smoked Tasso thinly sliced and chopped, a little extra garlic, I then allowed it to simmer on low all day. I also sprinkled a bit of vinegar on the okra to make it less sticky during cooking and to speed of the okra step. Overall great recipe :-) And if you omit the okra it freezes great

Best gumbo I ever had. My 11 year old daughter wanted to make gumbo for a school project. She did it all herself except for the roux. It was easy to put together, and the neighbors were even asking about the fantastic smell coming from the house! One recipe was not enough for our family of 6...definitely will double it for left overs, next time!

Used polksa kielbasa instead of andouille since I have small children and added onions. Very good recipe! I also added whole boiled eggs which is how the backwoods cajuns do it. I make gumbo often in winter but have never followed a recipe. This is a great guide for those wanting to learn.

I took the two days to prepare.  Just got back from New Orleans, the recipe is so go, felt like I was in the French Quarter again!  Everyone loves it and had enough left left over to freeze.  This is one of those dishes that does not last, even in the freezer.  The family ate it all.

This dish is delicious! I followed it fairly closely but substituted frozen okra for the fresh (my grocer didn't have any in stock), added an onion, and added extra chili pepper because we like things spicy.  I also made it a day in advance thinking it would be better the day after. It was thick and flavorful.  I served it over rice along with cheesy corn spoonbread.  This dish will be an Easter Sunday tradition from now on!

A great recipe.  Although did some substitutions:  used 1/2 lb. turkey kielbasa instead of andouille (to lower fat content), used 2 smaller cans of tomatoes (cajun style and no-salt) which I had on hand, used more than the 4 cups of the broth (I like gumbo on the soupy side), cooked the roux much longer than 6 minutes (about 20 to get to a deep caramel brown), used 1 tsp salt (it was plenty salty already), and did not use the file (thickened already due to the okra).  It made a LOT - great for leftovers and freezes fine.  Next time, I think I'll cook the garlic, celery and bell pepper just a bit in oil rather than dumping them in raw - although I don't think it matters too much (I just happen to like a milder garlic taste). Also - added a few staples to the broth while cooking (celery, onion, whole peppercorns, a few sprigs parsley) which I strained out. I don't think this is critical however - would even just use canned broth if in a hurry.

To make this work, I doubled the liquid, using more of the chicken broth and some red wine, and added a chopped onion, which completed the "holy trinity" of celery, onion and green pepper. Finally, instead of cooking the file the last 15 minutes, I sprinkled some on top of the gumbo when serving.

had never had Gumbo but my husband asked for it, so I found this recipe.  used hot lnks instead of Andouille and added onions. Other than that followed the recipe.  was a lttle afraid of the okra when I saw how gooey t was but it turned out amazing! I am now a fan of Gumbo and this recipe is a keeper!

The only problem with this recipe is that is never last long.  I think I have made a dinner and a week's worth of lunches and it's all gone in days!!  

I don't use the file powder and I generally saute the okra for nearly an hour.

As a Cajun, this is a Creole Gumbo.  We Cajun's don't put tomatoes IN our gumbos.  It's okay, but not by any means good.  The roux is thin and not enough to make a true gumbo, very soupy.  NEVER add file to a cooking gumbo, it turns stringy.  File is ALWAYS added to bowl of rice THEN gumbo is ladled over rice. So recipe is fair to middling.  Much better recipes available, even on this site.

This is pretty authentic. I suggest that you omit the thyme and basil, saute a whole onion with the pepper and the celery. Add a good 2 tbls of worcestershire. You cannot make a roux in 6 minutes. 1/2 hour minimum. Going to try the roux oven method as another reader suggested. It's hard to get andouille here, so I use keilbasa and a pinch of cayenne.

Am always asked for the recipe when I serve this to someone who has never tried it before.  I use shrimp instead of chicken and cut back some on the amount of oil for the roux. Delicious!

This is one of my all time favorite meals.  It takes a lot of work, but it is definitely worth the time.  I have consistently made it with a roux, cheated by using a frozen package of gumbo mix, and used ham seasoned with cajun seasoning (in my opinion it isn't worth all the effort without the ham).

Yummmy.  Had to add an onion!  And used the oven for browning the flour, worked very well. But was afraid of burning the flour so used 375 and only went for 30 mins or so, stirring between 5 and 10 mins. The whole thing takes a while and several pots but was worth it!

I followed the recipe without out adding basil, used diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled, and substituted butter for the vegetable oil when making my roux. Also, I took another user's advice and added a pinch of cajun seasoning. Tastes delicious.The first time I made the roux, I used vegetable oil as directed, but vegetable oil makes the roux smell burnt, and when your roux smells burnt, your food will taste burnt. So try it with butter (I used one cup = whole stick unsalted).

This was good but way too salty and I didn't even add the salt that the recipe called for.  It was too salty from just the sausage! I can my own tomatoes so I know there is no salt in those either.  Other than the salt factor, this was good.  The reason I gave 4 stars is because I can't imagine how salty it would have been by adding the 2 teaspoons of salt in addition to the rest.

I haven't had homemade gumbo in years, and have never actually made it myself.  Since this recipe looked the closest to what I was looking for, I decided to give it a whirl... YUM! My husband raved over it (only he added waaaay more red pepper, likes his gumbo HOT).  The only changes I made were using slightly less okra, used polish sausage (no andouille here) and I added shrimp per husband's request.  The only thing I will change for next time, is maybe using just one can of tomatoes.  Also, if anyone is having a hard time finding file powder, sometimes your local grocery store will have a separate display of cajun/seafood seasonings--Not necessarily by the spice section.  I found the Zatarain's brand and it worked great.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it to the T. It was pretty good. Second time I made following changes and holy gumbo what a difference. Firstly, I used chicken breast(bone/skinless) with drumsticks (no skin) and the broth was great. For the last step I added the drumsticks with bone in stew. YUM! It's a treat for folks that like drum stick. Great flavor! Go with the diced tomatoes. Whole tomato and paste dominated all other flavors. Cook roux on low heat (NOT MEDIUM) and constantly stir. Boil okra for about half hour if too slimy. Shake dry in colander. I used frozen sliced okra (not whole). Worcestershire advice was a plus(1 tsp) and made big difference. After simmering for an hour I added medium shrimp with tail and half an onion diced. Yellow bell pepper was great advice as well. If you DON'T like spicy go easy on the cayenne. Have fun with this and GO SAINTS!

Substituted Chorizo sausage for Andouille and it turned out unbelievable.  The gumbo actually tasted its best the next day when we had it for left overs.  All the flavors came out to play and it was great.  All the TLC put into it really helps!

This recipe is a good basic starting point for a gumbo.  We prefer stock-based rather than roux.  The thing to remember about gumbo is that whatever you have to put in, well, that's what goes into the pot.  That a gumbo.  We use chicken thighs for this recipe - and we don't make a roux.  The andouille is a 'must have' for this . . . nothing like it . . . and chicken thighs make a good stock.  The file' is a 'must have' as well.  If you can't find andouille or file', please contact me.

I think this is a great gumbo!  I changed the vegetable oil to L-A-R-D and crisped some pork jowel in it for more flavor.  I took out the pork jowel and just follwed the rest of the recipe.  The lard and rendered pork jowel [rather than vegetable oil] is the bomb!!!

This was an excellent recipe. Even for a first time fixing a roux it came out better than expected. I did encounter a few problems. Andouille sausage was not to be found here in Raleigh, N.C. I used kiebasa instead, and it came out great.Also, fine powder is hard to find. Our neighbors had some so it worked out ok.The prep time is more than 10 min, but whatever time it takes it is well worth the effort. Be sure to make it a day in advance. The flavors need to mingle.

This recipe is really great. Only thing different I did was add onion, garlic & used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead on Italian style. Also added some crawfish because I love it. I have even made it with a bone-in boston butt that was left over. Excellent recipe, just added things I really like to it. And no one says gumbo is a "quick fix meal". If you want it to turn out right you have to do it the right way with no shortcuts or substitutions just to save time, not fair to complain in a review when you dont do it the right way to begin with.  This is an excellent recipe, thank you for sharing.

To start off, I made the roux in the microwave using the following method: mix 3/4 cups of oil and flour in a glass measuring cup and microwave on high, uncovered, for 6 to 7 minutes. Check and stir at 6 minutes and continued cooking on high for up to a minute more to reach the desired color brown. Add 1 cup celery and 2 cups chopped green bell pepper to roux and cook on high for 3 minutes more. Add 4 cloves garlic, minced and 2 Tbsp. dried parsley and saute on high for 2 minutes more. Voila! perfect roux mixed with veggies in less than 15 minutes and practically no stirring. I also cooked the gumbo in the slow cooker on low for 6 hrs adding 1 cup non-instant rice in last hour. I used smoked sausage, 1 1/2 lbs. boneless chicken, didn't precook the okra (I used frozen), used 14.5 oz can of Italian stewed tomatoes, and added 1/2 lb. cooked shrimp with the rice. I kept the spices the same except for the red pepper; I used 1/8 tsp. The results were wonderful, but beware this recipe makes a big batch. Don't know if I'll be making this again b/c it was a lot of work. Anyway, thanks for posting even though I altered the recipe quite a bit. BTW served with Corn Casserole II from this site.

I made this one yesterday. It was my first time ever making gumbo, but WOW! It was total success. I also made alterations to the recipie. I used part of Emeril's Chicken and Sausage Gumbo recipie and used the trinity (onions, bell pepper, and celery). Added 3 cloves of garlic too. My fiance likes his gumbo THICK so you can eat it with a fork.  I added an extra pound of chicken, and instead of half a cup of flour and half a cup of oil, Emeril used 1 cup of oil and 1 cup of flour for extra thickness. Roux turned out great, but was time consuming. Being a gumbo lover, I understand that this is the most crucial part of making gumbo so it was okay. I also omitted the tomatoes, because homestyle Lousiana Gumbo usually does not have tomatoes. I also used Tony Chechrerre's instead of the seasoning mix and I used Earl Campbell's spicy sausage instead of andoullie. Also, omitted the okra cause fiance does not like it. My fiance said it could have used more salt, but I am sick (can't taste too much now) and would rather under season it than over season it. He gave it two thumbs and a big toe up. I say that it's a great base for a recipie, but the whole point of cooking is too make it your own. Stop following recipies to the T. Sometimes you have to freestyle a bit to get recipies (especially soul food) the way you want it.

This was delicious!  I did make a few changes.  I started out with maybe one to two strips of bacon that I chopped up in the pan.  Added one med onion (we love onion) and the okra once the bacon had browned a bit.  Made the oil and flour in a separate pan and added the stock to that pan then poured it all into my big dutch oven with the bacon, onion, okra mix.  then added the rest of the ingredients as listed.  I did use orange pepper instead of green and I also added about 1/2 head of green cabbage that I chopped up since I am always trying to get in more veggies.  Did not use the File Powder as I didn't have any but did sprinkle in some Wondra Flour towards the end.  Also didn't add the tsp of Cayenne, just a sprinkling as the Andouille was spicy and I didn't want to over do the heat.  Served over long grain brown rice which I cooked in the remaining chicken stock.  Very Good and got rave reviews from guests and hubby.

I've never made gumbo before because I'm not a big fan of ocra. BUT, this is GREAT!! I did a few things different from the recipe. I boiled boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of chicken part (that's what I had on hand), used boxed chicken broth instead of the chicken stock from boiing the chicken. I used a small pinch of ceyenne pepper because I don't like really spicy foods. It turned out fabulous. Even my 17 month old son ate it. Will definitely make again.

Simply wonderful.  Aside from doubling the sausage (cause I love it), I followed the recipe exactly.  Served over brown rice.  Didn't expect hubby to like (he's VERY picky) but he loved it and has asked me to make again.

This was just too good! 
I made a few changes, but the original recipe is such a great place to start. Like others, I could not get my okra any way but slimy, so I just threw it out. I really like okra, though, so I may have to learn how to cook it! The roux took me about 20 minutes to get to the perfect color (it really makes a difference). I used 2 lbs chicken thighs, chopped; 2 links (about 1/2 lb) Italian sausage, chopped; and 1 lb smoked beef sausage, chopped. I didn't like the beef sausage but everyone else in the house did so I may add more Italian next time. I think this may have been even better with shrimp or crab, so I will definitely try that! I used 4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth instead of boiling my chicken; 2 14-oz cans italian diced tomatoes (with a little extra italian seasoning); 4 large cloves garlic; 2 small green bell peppers, diced; and 1 med onion, diced. I omitted the celery and file powder. I think the addition of a little extra meat next time will mean a little extra broth (maybe 1/2 cup) because it was so thick without the okra or file! I think this was absolutely delicious served over white rice with cornbread! I also took other reviewer's advice and added whole eggs near the end to hard-boil. This was unbelievably good!
This wasn't nearly as spicy as I had anticipated... which made it perfect for my picky eaters and I just added a little extra red pepper to mine for the perfect heat!
Thank you for the recipe!

Not knowing much about gumbo, I followed the recipe exactly, except for the file powder which I couldn't find - and I used frozen okra.  My husband and I were a little leary, not being okra fans, but you really wouldn't even know it was there - apparently it acts as a thickener.  We both thought it was very good - and I would make it again.

This was just a disaster in a pot on the stove.  I've never cooked with okra, and I don't think I will ever again.  A lot of mess over something that was just so bland.  Sorry!

Wow!  I'm impressed!  This was great!  I've eaten my fair share of gumbos over the years but have never attempted to prepare it.  While time consuming, it's very easy.  The only draw-back is that I made it on one hottest day of the summer in an attempt to use up some of the okra from my garden that's growing like mad!

You have got to try this!!  The very first time i made this, i took it to work for a carry in dinner.  EVERYONE loved it.  I add another can of tomatoes, and also add a small can of tomatoe paste.  This is really easy to make.  I am asked to make this for work at least twice a month!!

Very Good.  I made a double batch of this gumbo for a Super Bowl party and everyone raved.  Leftovers freeze well.  Will make again.

This one is a keeper!  It smells great bubbling on the stove during the Superbowl and everybody loved it! My only suggestion is to cut back on the cayenne or maybe leave it out altogether.  I put in the full teaspoon and my wife and kids complained it was too spicy. I realize it's gumbo, it's supposed to be spicy, but I usually put hot sauce on everything and didn't find myself wanting to add more. This is still an outstanding recipe!

Wow!  This recipe was full of flavor and texture.  I added oysters to the mix, along with some additional cajun seasonings to make it extra spicy.  Yum.  Thanks, Christine, for submitting this great recipe. :)

This recipe is outstanding...give me a hurricane and some shiny beads and it would be just like Bourbon Street.  I did tweak it a little.  I added onion and cooked the roux for 6 minutes,added the onion, green pepper and celery and cooked for another 5 minutes or so before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also used l/f smoked turkey sausage to cut the calories.  I highly recommend the recipe and I can't wait to make it again for my chef type friends to show off!

Awsome!! My husband loves gumbo and he is the harshest critic having lived in New Orleans.  I beleive by cooking the okra separate first is crucial! Making your own stock from the boiled chickens really makes a difference.

I've been making this recipe for at least 5 years now -it is awesome! I am revising my last review due to my frustration with subsequent reviews. Please, don't "short cut" this one with canned stock and chicken breasts. Seriously, I've made it both ways. Its good "short-cutted", but it is unbelievable if made using the stewed chicken and broth. The only changes I make are to add onion and to brown the sausage before adding to reduce the fat.

I really enjoyed making this! It was a lot of work but worth it.  I like shrimp in my gumbo so I substituted 1 pound of shrimp for one pund of the chicken.  I also needed to add extra chicken broth when reheating the next day because it was a little thick for me.  I had rice on the side, and it was delicious!!

I changed almost everything and emptied the leftovers fridge on this recipe!! First I cut the recipe in half (but still added 4 cups of water) I had some cooked chicken from the other day so I skipped step 1- cutting the time in half. I had a few pieces of grilled Hillshire Farms Turkey sausage or kielbasa hanging out in the fridge so I threw those in. I used a small leftover bag of frozen mixed veggies (carrots incl.) and a few frozen tri-colored pepper slices in place of the okra. I still added 4 cups of water (and the chicken stock granules) and half of all the spice ingredients. I didn't have Cayenne Pepper so I added chili powder and I subbed marjoram and oregano. I used a can of diced tomatoes with no flavor. I had some leftover cooked rice too, which I just put a scoop in the bowls and poured the rice right on top. This Soup base is a keeper and this recipe is very dynamic- you can throw in whatever you have its delicious!

I added onions and baked (350F for about 45min stirring occasionally) the flower. The okra took a very long time (1.5hrs)to cook down. Maybe steaming it would have been better. All around delicious and you will have plenty of chicken broth for another soup. i also used some spicy turkey sausage which was very tasty.

My husband said I should open a restaurant and serve only gumbo!  I used 6 boneless breats (we like white meat) and did what others suggested....boiled the okra so it was not slimey and the very best helpful hint was to spread the flour on a cookie sheet and cook it at 400 degrees for an hour,  stirring every 15 minutes.

My children love this gumbo. The girls aren't big spice lovers, so they add extra rice because they can't resist the flavors. My boy on the other hand always asks me to make extra sausage to add to his gumbo. My husband & I love the flavor with the bonus of a quiet dinner. The kids are too busy to talk.

Best gumbo we ever had.  Thank you for a nice hearty filling dinner!  Will be adding this recipe to the rotation.  Only changes I made was I don't care for the taste of boiled chicken so I pan-fried chicken quarters in some bacon grease.  I them used the combined bacon grease and rendered chicken fat to make the roux, which also helped me reclaim the browned bits.  I did add about a half pound of shrimp and so I've saved the bones and shells from the shrimp to make stock for the next time I make gumbo.

This tastes awesome!  Not extremely spicy yet still very flavorful.  I was worried about the slimy okra, but in the end it wasn't noticeable.  The roux never turned "deep golden brown", but I was probably just impatient (or because I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil).  It still tasted great to me!

I modified a few things with great results. I cooked a whole chicken in the slow cooker first. This made dealing with the chicken a snap. While it was cooking, I skillet fried the sausage (could not find andouille so I used chorizo) set aside, then sautéed “the trinity” in the sausage grease, adding a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning. Then I broke up the chicken and poured the slow cooker liquids into the stock pot, added some of the chicken (including a few bones), sausage, and the sauteed vegetables. Meanwhile I made the roux in a separate skillet, (although never have done this before, it came out great), then poured it in the stock pot. Simmered it for 1 ½ hours. I was a little nervous about the okra, since I have never eaten or cooked with it before, so a shyly threw a handful of frozen okra in during the last half hour. It all came out great! I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was the closest I have found to my Uncle Bob's recipe.   I did, however, leave out the tomatoes as the traditional gumbos that I have had do not have tomatoes in them.  Great winter meal and freezes well.

definitely one of my favorites. it was a hit with my family who loves spicy foods! of course, i added more cayenne pepper to it too. turkey/chicken andouille worked really well as an alternative too. no one even noticed a difference!

Well this tasted great, but mine didn't look at all like the pictures! I have no idea how theirs turned out that way unless they used a slotted spoon to strain it when serving. Mine was much juicier, which I like just fine. I didn't think I would like the addition of tomatoes, but I used Rotel (canned diced tomatoes with diced mild chile peppers) and I DID like it with tomatoes in it. I would not have liked the whole peeled tomatoes the recipe called for. Mine came out super greasy but that wasn't the recipe's fault (rather it was the fault of my specific type of sausage) so the picture won't be beautiful, but it was definitely tasty. I still have a different favorite recipe for gumbo but I *would* recommend this to people. Only please note that 6 minutes isn't long enough to achieve a dark roux--google gumbo roux to see methods & reasons why some people do it darker or lighter if you don't know what you prefer! Thanks for the lovely Mardi Gras dinner :-)

Love this recipe!  I've never made gumbo and this was so easy.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used diced tomatoes instead.  I also substituted yellow pepper instead of green pepper (yellow is so much sweeter).  I also used boneless skinless chicken breast and thighs instead of bone in.  Added a can of chicken broth to the first step to enhance the flavor since it was without bones.  Great recipe, will make again!

Liked this one!  I used a stick of butter instead of oil.    Used frozen okra and just threw it in, didn't seem slimy to me.  I'd never tasted Andouille sausage before and considered subbing with smoked sausage, but it really gave the dish a nice spicy flavor.  Added some shrimp.

This was a huge hit with my family. It was spicy, but not too spicy and had a wonderfully rich flavor. I used frozen okra, since that's all I could find locally and it worked out great. Others have mentioned boiling the okra. I sauteed mine for a good 20 minutes or so, until it wasn't sticky. Because I was feeling lazy, I used a rotisserie chicken and stock I had on hand. I think I'd like to add shrimp to this the next time around! This recipe is going into the "keepers" file!

The only thing I did differently was use kielbasa instead of andouille.  I didn't have any.  It turned out wonderfully anyway.  My family loved it!

Pretty good, but needs more meat.  I couldn't find andouille and I short cut the chicken.  My first attempt at the roux burned, but the second attempt was fine.  Got it to peanut butter color on a low-med temp.  I used frozen okra, which I dumped in at the end.  Couldn't find file powder either.  I made hush puppies to go with it.  I wouldn't have wanted it any spicier.  Time consuming, even with my short cuts.  Definitely would make it again.

Made this again.  I think you could easily cut the oil in half.  Very yummy!  Made cornbread to go with it.  Froze a bunch of it for quick fall dinners.

This is my second review - I took the advice of other reviewers and boiled the okra.  HUGE MISTAKE!  The okra was still slimey when I drained it and basically fell apart.  Stick to cooking it how the recipe calls for which is the way I did it the first time and it works.  Not sure why I tried to improve on something that didnt need improving on. 1st review - Wow! This is fantastic.  I used frozen okra, and boneless chicken breasts.  I also put 6 chicken bouillon cubes in the water.  Hubby and kids loved it!

Loved this. Next time I'm making it with shrimp, crab and sausage. Oh and you forgot the ONION!! (the trinity...onion, celery and bell pepper) It was also a little bland so I added a few tablespoons of Cajun Seasoning.

This is a great recipe with a little tweaking.

I used a whole chicken cut up, 1 bag of frozen sliced okra (I skip that part where the okra had to be cooked, I think it's unnecessary) I add a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes - crushed, added a chopped onion, I double all the spices, Double the sausage, slice the sausage and brown it (you can also use Italian Hot sausage and it turns out great, if not better) then I also add about 6 cups more chicken stock.  

With these changes this is probably the best gumbo I've ever had.  Thanks for sharing.

The spices in this recipe are great. It was easy to alter it slightly for our tender mouths - we just used smoked sausage instead of andouille which is a little too hot for us.  I did add like 5-6 drops of hot sauce for that underlying 'kick of taste'. I cut down time spent by using chicken tenders. Browned them lightly with a mirepoix (carrots/onions/celery)and then added the rest of the ingredients. Also a can of fireroasted tomatoes and garlic in with the italian added another depth of flavor. Super nice recipe - we served it with Sweet Thai Black Rice - and it's mildly nutty flavor and color really added awesome visual and flavor interest.

This recipe was alright. It came out way too spicy for my husband and I and we both love spicy foods. I actually had to add milk at the end to try and cut the spiciness.

Very good recipe. I made a few modifications, based on the spices I had on hand and left out the okra. I definitely agree that it's worth the time to brown the roux properly--I say as dark as you can get without burning it! I think I took between 30 and 45 minutes to accomplish this, with the heat a little lower than medium.

This recipe makes way more than the 8 servings that it says it makes.  It's a very good gumbo, but I felt like a lot went to waste because of how much it made.  Also, I couldn't find file powder, so I just left it out.

I made this gumbo yesterday (Sat. 8/4/07). I was able to find the file powder in a Natural Food Store: its call Gumbo File. However, I substituted the Andouille sausage for Italian sausage. The recipe was "GREAT". My two: 15-yr old sons and husband thoroughly enjoyed the dish over rice.  However, the flavors seemed much better as it marinated over night.   
This will be a wonderful soup to make in the fall and winter months.  I can’t wait to make it again.

I love this recipe! I've made it many times, and each time its been a hit. This recipe can be easily altered to fit your taste. I usually add corn and 1/2 an onion. Also I have yet to find filo powder, but it comes out great anyway. For a little more heat I add 1 tsp crushed red pepper. Its helpful to use a stock pot if you're making 6+ servings (I had to use 2 stew pots before). And instead of cooking a whole chicken I use boneless chicken breasts & use kitchen shears to cut into pieces.
If you have time make this 1 day ahead to let the spices really come out :-)For those who may be curious the gumbo freezes well.

Fabulous! Just the right amount of heat and flavor. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for 2 small changes. I added to garlic chicken bouillion cubes to the water while chicken was boiling. I substitued a 28 oz can of tomato sauce for the can of stewed tomatoes (my preference, I hate chunky tomatoes =P), and that worked out just fine.

I'll definitely be making this again and again. Thank you!!

This was a wonderful recipe! Very flavorful and delicious - my family loved it. Used frozen okra & sauteed for about 20 minutes to remove the slimy texture - added perfect thickness to gumbo. No need for file powder. Time consuming, but definitely worth the effort. We will be making this again & again.

Wow - what flavor! I had to look for andouille pretty hard at the grocery, but there it was way on the top shelf and I'm glad I didn't give up since it added so much great flavor and the texture was nice. Like others, you do have to cook the roux much longer.  It took about 35 min. to get a rich dark golden brown.  Well worth the effort for flavor. I did add a half a yellow onion with the green pepper.  I don't like gumbo that's too hot, so I used only 3/4 tsp of cayenne and black pepper.  I cut back on the salt since I salted the cooking chicken with a liberal amount.  It went over really well with my husband.  I've had some serious gumbo disasters in the past, so this was a welcome change!

Like many of you, I am from Louisiana, and I thought this was a great recipe!  Because I don't eat pork, I used smoked beef sausage instead.  I sauteed the sausage and then cooked the okra in the leftover meat fat.  It makes for an even better flavor.  I also used about 6 garlic gloves, too.  Everyone who I have made it for always asks for more...

This was wonderful! It was time consuming but well worth it. This will be a great cold night dinner but living in Houston we don't get many of those.  Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this, and I don't even like okra!  I used kielbasa instead of andouille sausage, and it tasted great.  Also instead of boiling the chicken, deboning it, and saving the broth, I went the easy way: cooked boneless skinless thighs in a skillet and a little oil, and used chicken broth instead of the cooking liquid.  Worked great.  I also put in 2 cans of tomatoes, since we prefer a more tomatoey gumbo.  Didn't use file powder, and it was plenty thick after simmering in my crock pot on hi for about 4 hours.

This was really good.  Not as spicey as I thought it would be. My only changes were to use diced tomatoes and I used a cheap brand of cajun sausage.  I don't know if frying the okra first really makes much difference, I might cut this step out the next time I make it.

I have tried numerous gumbo recipes, and this recipe has by far been the best!  My husband is a Louisiana native, and he raves this is the best gumbo. I used a whole roast chicken from the market, which made for an easy and tender chicken.  Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! I did make some changes to the recipe though. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and habanero sausage because that's I had on hand. I added about 1/2 cup diced onion, and used a little more cayenne. I didn't have italian style tomatoes, so I used plain ones and added a dash of italian seasoning. The gumbo was thick enough for our taste, so I didn't add any file powder. Served it over white rice, and we loved it. I will definitely make this again.

excellent, fairly easy to make too. i added shrimp to the recipe, didn't use file powder because i couldn't find the stuff, and had to substitute hot italian sausage instead of andouille because of unavailablity (i live in podunk), and it still came out great! just as good the second day, too...

edit: I have found file powder, and it helps with the thickening.

Tasty! Most recipes don't call for both okra and file powder as both are thickening agents. I vary the spices a bit, like extra cayenne for a little kick. Remember if using file, add it after it comes off of the heat, it wont be stringy. I cook my roux until a dark nut brown for extra flavor. Careful though if you burn it throw it out and start again. Et toi!

Oh wow. This is sooo good. I served this to some friends and they both just loved it. I don't like spicy foods so I just used smoked pork sausage and left out the cayenne pepper. Wonderful and full of flavor. To make the roux I cook it at med high heat for 5 minutes (stir constantly) then turn the heat to medium and cook for 10-15 minutes more, until the roux is the color of an old penny. The roux is what gives it the right texture and flavor, so be patient with it. Also, I think the file powder is optional, after I added it I had no liquid left, it thickened up a lot.

Great tasting without the file (this is used more as a thickener than anything else). Used andoille sausage and added a cup of chopped frozen onion. Added additional dashes of tabasco and Emeril's seasoning as well as some beer. Made a lot of gumbo. Was even better the next day.

I was a little intimdated by this recipe but my husband really likes gumbo. After making it, I have to say it was really good but the cayenne pepper was a bit too spicy for me. I couldn't find any italian style tomatoes so I bought the plain ones. The tomatoes were too big to eat. I'll try a can of the diced tomatoes next time. Other than the cayenne pepper and the tomatoes, it was delicious and I recommend it for anyone, even those like me who are unsure of their cooking ability.

God, this was good. Like one of the reviewers, I was intimidated by this Louisiana staple.  I didn't use Andouille (just regular smoked) because I thought it would be too spicy for the sensitive palates in my family. I should have, though. Definitely go for it. Instead of cayenne, I used Tabasco. Yum. Loved this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this.

I made this recipe for 25 people...should have cooked it for 50.  It is absolutely one of the best I've ever done.  I used sweet Italian sausage instead of andouille and I added baby shrimp but otherwise I stuck with the original.  What a treat.  Thanks!

This recipe rocks!!!  I substituted a spicy smoked
sausage (I live in Texas now) for the andouille and added 2 more cups of water to the gumbo itself.
Turned out great!  Kids loved it and husband and I took it for lunch the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is very good although I prefer my gumbo soupy but this recipe does rock.  I did not use chicken, file powder or okra because I do not like okra I used Krab meat, old bay seasoning, Jalepeno peppers and added a bit of rice.  But this is a great recipe for all and easy to make.

Excellent! Fairly easy to make, too! Substituted hot italian sausage for the andouille. I even tried adding some shrimp, and they worked quite well, too, didn't add a fishy flavor.

This is a good recipe as written, but I will offer some suggestions.  Number one, add onions. Dice up an amount equal to your green peppers. Previous reviews that have said 6 minutes is not long enough for a good roux are correct.  Plan on up to one hour for an authentic chocolate colored roux.  I make mine in the oven.  Look up Alton Brown's Oven Roux. For the chicken parts I recommend legs and thighs.  Also you don't really need to cook the chicken an hour.  40 minutes is fine if using dark meat, probably closer to 30 minutes if using breasts.  Don't worry f it isn't cooked all the way through.  It will finish cooking in the gumbo. However, I would add it more like the final 30 minutes rather than 15 to let the flavors blend with the other ingredients.   As mentioned in other reviews, frozen okra has much less tendency to be slimy than fresh. If you cook the gumbo long enough the okra will almost melt into the broth, which provides the thickening. I agree with the comments about not needing file powder if you are using okra. Cajun, country style gumbo doesn't have tomatoes.  New Orleans Creole style does.  It's up to you.  And definitely make this the day before if at all possible.  It helps the flavors meld.   Finally, the dry roux idea sounds awesome, I just might have to try that method next time.

Great recipe. I did saute some diced onion, omitted the file powder (I was out), and used boneless skinless chicken breasts (that's the only kind of chicken we like). The end result was delicious; my fiance proclaimed this to be the best version I've gumbo I've made so far.

I like this recipe.  I did make my own adjustments for my and my families preferences.  I sliced the okra and fried it first.  My husband does not like the 'slimy' texture of it.  I could not find Andouille sausage so I substituted a chicken type Andouille sausage instead.  I used cut up chicken breast instead of chicken parts. I added shrimp that I sautéed In olive oil with Old Bay Seasoning and a pinch of creole seasoning (we like a little heat but not much for the kids), along with the listed salt, black pepper, thyme and basil.  I used the seasoned olive oil that I sautéed the shrimp in and add it to the recipe.  I used butter with flour for the roux and chopped some fresh collard greens to be added to the onion, green pepper, garlic and celery.

This recipe was a great base for a delicious gumbo that my family loved! I added diced onion, extra garlic and used frozen okra. I also cooked the roux to a dark milk chocolate color instead of golden brown. It gives the gumbo more of a richness in my opinion. I will be making this again!

I could not make the roux work for the life of me. I was trying to make this dish gluten free and it just wasn't happening. I instead started with cold liquid, added my gf flour and then slowly heated it. The sausage was too spicy for my kiddos so I won't make it again. I think it is more an issue on my part as opposed to the recipe itself.

Great recipe.  Only change I made was to add an onion.  I did this based off several of the other reviews and I think it turned out good.  Even got my picky 7 year old to eat it.

This gumbo was excellent!  It was the first time I ever made roux and it turned out great.  The only comment I would give is to cook the roux on low heat for at least 30 minutes.  I will bring this dish to my son tomorrow for his birthday as a surprise.  I know he will love it!!

Used summer squash instead of okra...big mistake, was very mushy.  One tsp of cayenne pepper didn't give it nearly enough kick, would double or triple next time.  Definitely need to take the time to get that roux nice and brown...gives the dish its color. Served over grits...very tasty, would make again!

This was great! People keep saying that 6 minutes for the roux is not enough, but that's just because they think it should be "black" roux. I did mine for about 10 minutes and it got to a brown roux and it still tasted fine. I burnt it the first time trying to take it all the way to black. I used butter on the second go for the roux and mixed in what little vegetable oil I had left, and it actually worked really well. We love spicy, but if you're not a fan of super-hot things, cut back on the pepper quite a bit. I added in some Worcestershire sauce (a little less than 1 T) and some Tony Chachere's seasoning (1 t or so), and it helped make it more flavorful. I also used a lot more garlic (like 4 cloves) and added Hunt's diced tomatoes with garlic instead of the stewed tomatoes. I also used all-white chicken breasts instead of chicken parts, and used chicken broth instead of used the stuff from the pan of boiled chicken. Very good stuff! Served over white rice with cheesy jalapeno garlic biscuits. Will be making again!

Followed the recipe to the letter with a few small alterations,my okra.... *cough* didn't turn out well, even cooked on its own. So I substituted in a 16oz can of corn and a can of green beans, and a medium yellow onion as well. I was unable to find any Andouille, so I went with carolina smoked sausage. I added about 1/2 tsp more black pepper and only 1/2 a tsp of cayenne. I prepared my roux by browning the flour in a cast iron skillet in the oven, 400 degrees for about 15 minutes,the flour came out about the color of light brown sugar, mixed into a fairly dark roux, a shade lighter than onion gravy. I also sauteed the onion,celery,green pepper and garlic in olive oil till the onions were slightly browned on the edges. Served over Zatarains long grain & wild rice, unquestionably a crowd pleaser!

Delicious!
My dad's side of the family is all cajun, so whenever we went to visit them I always got to look forward to their gumbo. Craving something similar, and it being near Mardi Gras, I decided to give making my own gumbo a try.
Completely new to the process of making gumbo but I did a lot of research before I attempted this recipe and read a lot of reviews on it.
I made the okra according to the recipe and it turned out fine- not slimey. the andouille sausage I bought wasn't that great so it really didn't add anything, could've left it out. My roux definitely took more than 6 minutes- more like 45! very easy but extremely time consuming. I added onions to the vegetable mix (gotta have onions). Other than that I left the rest of the recipe alone and it turned out just like I remember gumbo and just the right amount of spice. My husband and my friends, who have never had gumbo, love it too!

I had excellent results but take issue on a couple of items in the recipe: 1. I see no point in pre-cooking the okra and did not do that, and 2. thank goodness that I had the foresight to just add 1/2 t. cayenne to start with. That was a gracious plenty, and I am a lover of spicy food. Instead of chicken alone, I used chx boneless thighs and two smoked turkey wings and some smoked turkey stock that I had on hand, frozen. I doubled the gumbo file, and it was still pretty juicy, but that didn't matter or detract at all.

It was decent gumbo.  Put the okra in the last 10 minutes of cooking or it will fall apart.

I threw everything into the pot at once, using frozen kielbasa, frozen okra, and frozen broth and chicken I had put away.  This made the recipe VERY quick and easy.  Cutting back on the meat made the recipe low calorie and fairly healthy, too.

Excellent recipe.  I've made it twice now and have made a few adjustments.  I've added about half a teaspoon extra of cayanne and black pepper to add spice and also added a little more broth than the four cups.  Also used tomato chunks instead of whole tomatos.  Turned out awesome the second time.

Oh wow, was this yummy!!  When I told my husband I was going to try and make this recipe, he rolled his eyes at me (I'm not known to be a good cook). I found this recipe easy to make and it smelled wonderful while cooking.  When my husband tasted it he exclaimed "This is GOOD!!".  He also requested that I make this a part of my "regular" meals.  We really enjoyed it, and so did my 4.5 year old daughter.  I couldn't find file powder anywhere so I just bought some cajun seasoning and sprinkled it in.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will surely be making this over and over again!!!

Absolutely yummy and so easy. The only things I changed was:  Used 4 large boneless chicken breasts and boiled it in 9 cups of water; used Louisiana hot links instead of andouille based on what my local market had available; decreased fresh okra to 1 lb. and sliced before I sauteed them. Thanks Christine!

Great recipe! I usually roast a chicken one night, make broth with the bones, then make this soup the next day with leftover roasted chicken. Nice change from traditional chicken stew.

This is the best.  Made a few minor changes.  I used boneless skinless thighs and poached them 30 minutes.  Added a quarter of an onion, chopped and sauteed along with the green pepper, etc mixture.  Also used plain canned tomatoes and added about 1/2 tsp oregano.  The last 5 minutes of simmering, added 24 large peeled and deveined shrimp, tails removed.  Omitted the file powder

Really Good stuff!!!  However, I did make a few variations.  I followed the recipe except for the following:  I used two types of sausage (regular smoked sausage and the real cajun kind); I cooked the split chicken breasts on high for about 30-40 minutes until it was not quite tender;  I added onion and about half of the okra the recipe called for;  I made the roux in a cast iron skillet (not sure if that makes a difference!) and cooked and constantly stirred it for about 10-12 minutes; I added more cayenne for some extra spice.  During the last 30-40 minutes of cooking time I placed the chicken and a pound of medium cooked shrimp in the pot, with an additional cup of the chicken stock.  I added very little of the file as I had never cooked with it.  I made it last night so we could eat it today but we ate some of it last night!!!  It was good even without the rice!!Really good recipe, will for sure make again!  Thanks

I asked my husband to rate this recipe because I am not a true fan of gumbo and he has eaten a lot of gumbo in his days.  I also used polish sausage instead of the andouille.  I added white onion and green onion as some other reviewers suggested. I used Rotel tomatoes instead of Italian and added some roasted green chili peppers.  I cut the cayenne in half and upped the other seasonings except the salt   I must say the aroma as it was cooking in my slow cooker was wonderful.  The smell of the fresh vegetables with the spices simmering was aromatherapy at it's best!  I just let it simmer all day since many reviewers said it was even better the next day.  I figured the longer it simmered the better.  I didn't add the meat until the last hour of simmering.  My husband ate his over rice and I ate mine over cornbread.  My son however tasted the gumbo with rice and said it was not his favorite, so he elected to eat apple pie with ice cream.  I will make this again.  If I can just figure out how to get ALL the slime out of the okra I think I could become a gumbo fan.

Great recipe!  I couldn't find fresh okra and had to use frozen.  I boiled the frozen okra for a while to help eliminate the sticky substance prior to adding it to the roux.  I also added shrimp at the end with the chicken.  We love spicy things and with the addition of the andouille sausage this fit the bill!

It doesn't get anymore authentic than this!  This was easy to make and the flavor is wonderful.  The chicken andouille sausage is very easy to find these days in all the larger grocery stores and Costco.  I will make this again and again and again and.....thanks Christine!

This recipe is one of my favorite!  There are enough for my husband and I to have 3 meals. 1 the day of cooking, then the following night, and I freeze the rest for a later time. Be sure you use andouille sausage, or it just doesn't taste that good.   Thanks Christine!

Wonderful! My family loved this, I've never had Gumbo but this was really good. I served it over white rice, I couldn't find file powder but since we've never had gumbo it didn't matter. I added some Old Bay as suggested....good. Thanks

This was EXCELLENT!!! My boyfriend has been hassling me forever to make him gumbo,and I've been putting it off... Lets just say he was ECSTATIC when he tasted this.  I cut down the chicken to 2lbs and threw in 2 lbs of shrimp.  Will definitely make time and time again!!

Made this without the okra and tomatoes.  I use chicken thighs, allow them to cook well and then before serving, debone them using two forks, the bone slips right off, super easy. And no basil. But otherwise, it is a great gumbo!

This is a delicious recipe that happens to take a while to prepare.  I used chicken breast tenderloins rather than chicken parts and it worked great and probably had less fat (although more expensive).

don't buy spicy andouille sausage, mild is just right.

My husband and oldest son (requesting party ;) ) loved it. I cut the cayenne in half for our younger ones- hubby said it’s not too hot, but very flavorful. He was so happy to have gumbo. I have to say, I’m not a fan. But I do love to make something my men are excited to come home for!!!! Thank you for this recipe. :)

I also made this with some changes, and it turned out soooo delish! I used chicken bone broth instead of water. I used chopped, fire roasted tomatoes, and I added a whole medium-sized chopped onion. Also, instead of the chicken, I used half of a grilled pork tenderloin that we had leftover, it really added a nice smoky flavor to the gumbo! I spent more like 25 minutes on my roux, and used real butter instead of oil. I did not add the salt that the recipe called for, as it seemed to be salty enough when I tasted it during the cooking process. File powder is a MUST (but it’s really expensive here!). And I used frozen okra instead of fresh (hard to find right now as it’s out of season). But WOW!! This really turned out spectacular! Just served over a scoop of plain white steamed rice. Great for this rainy, chilly evening!

I had a bunch of chicken already cooked, so I skipped the first part of cooking the chicken.  I used half chicken stock and half homemade shrimp stock.  Instead of making the roux with vegetable oil, I used butter.  Added some extra  cayenne just because we like spice.  Everyone loved it!

While I have enjoyed gumbo before I had never  made it.  Too much turkey and sausage  left over from Thanksgiving took me to the stove.  I liked this recipe.  I did know enough about gumbo to add 2 onions.  I did use frozen okra and stirred it for the 20 minutes and was happy with the results. The next time I make this I will add the cayenne after I know how spicy my sausage is.  Same with the salt. The recipe made a nice sized pot; enough to give away two quarts, then to freeze some.

This was soo good. I made a couple adjustments after reading the comments but my husband and I could not stop eating it. Firstly I just used chicken stock that I already had to cut down on cooking time and used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. I also added half of a diced yellow onion, about 1.5 teaspoons of cajun seasoning, and a dash of Worchestershire. I boiled the okra before adding it to the dish and there was no sliminess that some other commenters are mentioning. I served it with  brown rice and biscuits on the side. 

4 servings made for two BIG dinners (for 2 people) with enough for a leftover lunch. Will definitely be making this again!!

Used boiled chicken breasts and 1/2 of reserved stock with fat skimmed off and 32 oz low sodium chicken broth.  I added some good cleaned raw gulf shrimp and some Old Bay seasoning.  Work your roux low and slow in a good cast iron dutch oven until the color of a Hershey bar.   I boil my frozen okra for 10 minutes and rinse w/ cold water to cut back on the slime factor.  1.5 lbs okra is a little heavy for my taste.  I love this stuff over rice w/ some fresh chopped parsley and a side of cornbread.

I had never made gumbo before, but I have eaten it and like it.  This is a good recipe.  I followed it as written, except I used just over 2 pounds of chicken and almost a pound of shrimp along with the Andouille sausage.   I cooked my rice in the remaining chicken water for added flavor.  I made cornbread muffins to go along with it.  A great meal for a chilly day!

I haven't made gumbo in years and needed a reminder of what went in it.  This was excellent and I will be using it again.  What I do differently is flouring my chicken pieces and frying them till they are golden brown.  Take the chicken out and place on a plate in the oven to keep warm.  Then I add the flour into the pot for the rouge stirring until it is the color of a copper penny.  Then I add the onions and cook until soft.  Add chicken broth (I used 2 cans),  spices,  sausage, chicken and rest of veggies.  Finish cooking as above.

I followed it exactly except there was no fresh okra to be had.   It came out gummy .   I'm going to add a good amount of chicken stock to the leftovers.  Could use onion next time .  Maybe leave the file powder out ... that might have made it too gummy if not the frozen okra.

I added a Sam Adams Boston Lager after adding the broth. I always add beer to my gumbo for a little extra something

Loved it. I have never made gumbo before due to my prejudice against okra. Pre-cooking it and adding it at the last moment made for a slime-free, delicious experience. The okra and I are friends now. I hope to hang out again soon.

I used this recipe the first time i tried making gumbo and don't see any reason to go looking elsewhere. Great basic recipe that leaves room for making it your own. Second time i made it, i boiled up a big batch of mudbugs to go along with it! I make a big pot every Marti Gras. Only problem is i end up saying things like gair-on-tee and Pontchartrain while cooking it.

A little bland following the recipe. Will have to improvise next time to get it up to par.

Delicious!
I used a turkey sausage and gluten-free flour blend. I was happy the rue turned out well with the gluten free flour. Like others, I also added onion and extra garlic. We will definitely make this again!!!

I made this recipe and it came out great. My family loved it. I used a rotisserie chicken to cut down on my cooking time and it was still flavorful.

I made a TON of changes based on some of the other reviews.  This 3-star review was based on the recipe as given, not as I made it.

the biggest thing was the okra.  I used fresh (hubby doesn't like frozen).  I sauteed it in olive oil. While sauteing the okra fresh (didn't boil it first) I added 2 tablespoons of white vinegar (one at a time, a few minutes apart) as someone suggested to get rid of the sliminess.  I did it after most of the stickiness was gone.  This seemed to work perfectly and hubby said it was not slimy at all.

I changed quite a few things.  Used half and half chicken broth and water to boil the chicken (also used breast tenders rather than parts).  As I said, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to saute the okra.  Also cut up a white onion and sauteed that in olive oil as well.  However, I used unsalted butter for the roux.  I did not brown the flour in the oven as some reviewers suggested but added it a little bit at a time and stirred constantly, and it came out with a nice dark tan color.  Andouille sausage is too spicy besides being too difficult to find in this area so used kielbasa.  Could not find Italian-style whole or crushed tomatoes so used Italian-style diced tomatoes instead.  Used a red bell pepper instead of green for color. I used 2 small pinches of cayenne pepper and no file powder whatsoever (can't find up here anyway).  Because I only made half the recipe most of the ingredients were halved but used the full amount of pepper, sausa

Like others reviewers I too felt that the flour needs to cook a bit longer. I added a seafood mix to the recipe because that is how my husbands prefers it. It's a simple recipe that is going into my monthly rotation.

I departed from my usual south american menu and made this for some friends from Louisiana. They loved it! Naturally, there is always a bit of tinker room with any recipe but, I didn't stray much with this one. Served with Dirty Rice, it's killer!I did make the Okra in two batches, one fully cooked and one crispy at the last.Great!

I loved this recipe. I had to adapt a few things. I could not find fresh okra so I used frozen. I also used fresh basil. And I used Smoked Beef Sausage not andouille sausage.  At the end of the cooking time I ladled off the fat at the top of the gumbo before serving. My husband said it tasted just like the gumbo he had had in the past so he was well pleased.

Very good and easy to make. We added zucchini and onions to ours, only because we have an abundance of both from our garden.

This recipe was just ok. Of course, I went to 3 grocery stores and couldn't find file powder, so I added cajun seasoning but it was still very bland.

So I've made this twice now, the first time I made the okra and chickened out of using it because it was very slimy, and quite honestly I wasn't sure if I would like it. So the second time I omitted it completely. I know it technically wasn't even Gumbo the way I made it since I also omitted the file powder as well but it was still good. The second time I made it I used a different "no fillers/all natural" sausage and it was not half as good as the first time. The first time I used Johnsonville New Orleans sausage and it came out good and spicey, so I recommend that. I gave it 4 stars versus 5 because it wasn't that good the second time with a less spicey sausage, so it could maybe use more seasoning or something, I ended up adding jalapenos. I also, like many other reviewers noted, added onions to the recipe.

A good springboard recipe that you can modify to your tastes (I added onion, for instance).  Good on it's own too.
