I'm a  huge fan of Thai Chicken Pizza -  this is an especially good recipe. However, I like to make my own peanut sauce out of a mixture of creamy peanut butter (hydrogenated), soy sauce, Asian chili oil, and honey. The Chili oil gives it a little extra kick that you won't find in store-bought Thai peanut sauce.

I used Thai-Style Peanut Sauce w/ Honey from this site and thought this pizza was delicious...very similar to my fave one @ California Pizza.

this was awesome! we made half with tofu because one of our guests was vegetarian. we followed the instructions for "mock chicken" from this site and then sliced it thin and sauteed it in a tiny bit of sesame oil and some of the peanut sauce before tossing it with the peanut sauce/peanut butter as instructed in this recipe. then we shredded it and added it to half the pizza. yummy! (i almost liked the tofu side better!) i'll definitely be making this again

My friend and I agreed that this was pretty good, but not great.  Picking a peanut sauce you love is key.

Phenomenal!!!  I made my own pizza crust (Jiffy from a box) and added some garlic powder and ground ginger.  Added a little lime juice to the peanut sauce to cut down on the sweet flavor a little.  2 med carrots was plenty but lots of cilantro makes it even better.  I will definitely make this up as an appetizer!

This has become our new family favorite!!!  It is truly amazing pizza.  This is a great dairy free recipe.  I make dough in our bread machine, and our own home made peanut sauce, and it is fabulous together with this recipe!!!

So delicious!  I used the Thai peanut sauce with honey recipe also from allrecipes and used a frozen loaf of bread dough for the crust.  We grilled it on our pizza stone on the grill and it was identical to CPK's version!

This was good, but could be better.  Maybe I should have added some lime or sprouts or something???  I used the Peanut Sauce II recipe for the sauce, it was delicious, but I should have been more generous with it.

This was very good.  I have had Thai chicken pizza at restaurants and this recipe came very close.  Although it seemed a little dry to me.  Maybe I cooked it just a little to long. Overall, I enjoyed it and so did my husband.

Wonderful!  Of course, I have my changes due to diet.  Used whole wheat pizza dough and barbequed it directly on the grill for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  Added a small amount of part skim mozarella, as well as a handful of bean sprouts.  Neighbors loved it and asked for the recipe!

I LOVED this pizza, which reminds me of the pizza I crave at Californa Pizza Kitchen. I used half the jar of peanut sauce, and half the peanut butter. I'm not so sure my family loved it, but I did. Ooo, the Boboli pizza crust was awesome!

Very highly recommended. I made this as an appetizer for a party and my daughter kept sneaking pieces of it before we actually got there. She loved it. And then at the party, I was greeted by lots of oooohs and aaaahs, and my appetizer disappeared with in minutes. Highly recommended! It's very attractive too because of the colors, always a plus!

Wow! This was great! I omited the cilantro and chicken, and added bean sprouts. This was great and tasty! I made my own peanut sauce and took left overs for lunch for 3 days! This is amazing!

This sounds weird just reading the ingredients, but wow, it's really really good! I only used 1 chicken breast and only 1 carrot, and it seemed plenty. I used dried chives instead of green onion, and dried cilantro leaves. Neither of my guys liked this at all, they both only took one bite. I'm not sure how to describe this as it's not like anything I've ever had before, but I'm definitely going to make this one again! I don't even like cilantro much and it's great on this. Thanks Pam for another winner!

We really enjoyed this pizza. We went against our instincts to make pizza dough from scratch for the crust (we are snobbish about our crusts!) and bought a thin crust Boboli. We were surprised at how good it was. The flavors in the toppings greatly resemble the Thai Chicken Pizza from California Pizza Kitchen. Yum! Even though many toppings are added after the pizza comes out of the oven, the leftovers reheated very nicely the next two days! Can't beat that! I followed the recipe exactly, so no adjustments were needed from our kitchen.

I've made this before but tried a new pizza dough recipe.  I would highly recommend doubling the sauce for this pizza.  I forgot to do that and mine was a little dry.

Really authentic taste. Cooked on grill and used the whole wheat pizza dough from here, not precooked. Did add some Thai basil to it other wise made as per recipe. Hubby loved it as well.

We enjoyed this. It seemed strange at first, but it combined flavors that we like, so we gave it a try. I am glad that we did. Now we have a new way to use up these ingredients. Thanks!

I love this recipe and have been making it ever since I tasted it at a national chain restaurant.  I do a couple of things diferently, mostly because I'm lazy.  Instead of a pizza cust, I use wheat tortillas.  I spritz the bottom of the tortilla with cooking spray so it crisps in the oven.  Using the tortillas instead of pizza dough allows my niece and nephew to make their own pizzas.  I use apricot glazed rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and I also add a little low fat mozzerella.

I gave this 5 * long ago, but forgot to add my comments. We absolutely LOVE this pizza! It is 'da bomb'! I did not have peanut sauce on hand so I made my own from a recipe on this site (Thai Style Peanut Sauce with Honey - excellent!) Everyone loves this following recipe as is. Thanks Pam!

We are huge fans of Thai food but didn't care for this at all.  The sauce pretty much tasted like peanut butter without much spice and the whole thing was awfully dry.  To me it tasted like peanut butter toast with toppings.  My fiancé didn't love it but he did eat 3/4 of the pizza in one sitting!  The problem also just could have been the sauce I used.

This was just ok for us. It was very easy to make, and had a lot of flavor, I think it was just a little too spicy for our taste

This pizza was very similar to a pizza my boyfriend had at a restaurant once (and loved), so I made it for him. He loved it just as much as in the restuarant! I used Boboli thin crust and omitted the green onions...it was a huge hit!

I loved this, but my husband found it too spicy, due to the peanut sauce I used. I boiled the chicken breasts and pulled it apart and it worked fine.  Very different and delicious!

This recipe was just okay. It has way too much peanut butter flavor for my taste. I might make this again, but I will definitely have to figure out some changes before I do.

I love Thai chicken pizza and this was the first time I attempted making it at home.  I thought it turned out great!  Didn't use the carrots, but added some sliced red pepper and a little mozzarella cheese. Would maybe cut back a little on the peanut butter next time since the peanut flavor was strong, but still enjoyed it.

This was very tasy but a bit too dry. Maybe next time I will increase the sauce amount?? Not sure yet but I WILL make it again. Thanks :)

If you like Thai food, MAKE THIS PIZZA.  The peanut sauce combined with peanut butter is incredible as a sauce.  I used a boxed hot roll mix instead of the pre-made Italian crust.
