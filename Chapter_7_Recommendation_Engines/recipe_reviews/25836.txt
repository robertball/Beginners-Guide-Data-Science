Very good! I used Splenda in place of sugar and reduced brown sugar by 1/4 c (personal preference to eliminate some of the sweetness). Reduced butter by 2 tablesppons and Added 1/8c extra of flour and this eliminated the spreading. Chopped the cherries for cost saving to add more of that flavor throughout cookies. Sometimes I use choc chips and sometimes I use white choc chips (the white compliment the cherries wonderfully)

This is a favorite cookie in my house. They are crisp on the outside, and slightly chewy in the center.  I add 1/4 whole wheat flour to the recipe to address the speading problem and add a nutty flavor.  This also allows me to skip refrigeration first, to save time.  Like others, I also use craisins unless it is a holiday.

I find that if you cut the amount of toffee bits by half (use 1/2 cup) there is no spreading.

These were great!  I substituted whole wheat flour and the oats I used were 5 grain (Red Mill).  These changes didn't make the cookies taste "too healthy" (not that the are!) - probably due to the amount of sugar and sweetness from the chips.
Only wish they were a tad bit chewier, however I will play around with my next batch as I have some dough frozen.

Best cookie recipe I know.  To reduce
cost I use craisins instead of dried cherries but for special occasions the
cherries are so good.

Very good.  Read the reviews 1st then made adjustments.  I thought toffee would make them too sweet so I added 1 cup chopped almonds instead.  I also reduced brown sugar by 1/4 c and increased white sugar by 1/4 cup (cookies didnt spread too much.  I also substituted 1/2 c shortening and 3 tbs water (or milk) for 1/2 c butter (also reduces spreading).  I added 1/2 tsp almond extract for more flavor.  I, too chopped the cherries for cost purposes and there is plenty of cherry throughout!  Delicious!

Here's what I changed and mine turned out perfect.  I used 1/2 cup butter and two eggs - all the other ingredients were the same.  I also just dropped them onto the cookie sheet, I didn't roll into logs and cut.  That way they didn't start out thin and spread so 
much-that was my thinking anyway and they turned out perfect!  The blend of flavors in this cookie is phenomenal!  Definitely a keeper for me!

Really excellent and a nice change from our usual household favorites of chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies.  I didn't change a thing!

These do have a good flavor, but I just could not get past how greasy they were.  Too much butter!  I chopped the cherries like another reviewer had suggested and was glad I did.  They were very good on the first day, but became soggy and greasy after that.

I was a little worried about all the ingredients, but I needed to use up my holiday baking supplies.  They actually compliment each other nicely.  I used craisins because that's what I had--I think they have an odd aftertaste, but that was not evident in these cookies.  My baking time was 14 minutes and the batch made about 46 fairly large, delightfully crunchy cookies.

There must be a serious error to this recipe.  I wanted just to put in toffee and chips and all I got was a cookie sheet of goo.  Cookies wouldn't set up but would burn, and burn into a goo. I don't think this recipe even deserves one star.  I added more flour to get a decent cookie.

I loved this cookies with these changes.  I used cherry flavored crasins since they were cheaper.  I also perfer them without the toffee chips and with 1 cup pecans in their place.

These taste great. However mine seemed almost runny. While they were baking they spread out pretty thin, tried altering the size of them etc. but they all were very thin, maybe that is how they are supposed to be. That didn't affect their taste though. One thing I would have done differently is to chop up the dried cherries so they are more spread out in the dough.

I didn't realize until I was half way through making the dough that I had used up all my toffee bits so I substituted a cup of coconut instead.  It also turned out that I only had a half cup of dried cherries left so I chopped them up so they'd go further.  These ended up tasting like granola bar cookies.  Great texture, not overly sweet, and the semi-sweet chocolate was perfect with the pop from the dried cherries

I used white chocolate instead of chocolate and no toffee chips. It was pretty good. A bit crunchy. I was In a hurry when I made them. Didn't realize I was to put in three parts and then the fridge. I have some left over I'm getting ready to be in the oven
