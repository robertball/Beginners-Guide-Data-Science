too many potatoes for sauce - onion soup mix kind of overpowered the flavour - kids really did not like it...

Yeah Blah is right. Try this...  Use 3 cans cream of chicken soup.  1/4 cup milk. One sweet onion.  And hears the secret... LONG HORN CHEESE.  Mix all well with potatoes, put a few slices of butter on top and bake.  If you like add some long horn on top for last 15 mins or so, and bake uncovered. It is delicious, I promise.

Took this to our Christmas dinner at the RV park and had lots, lots of compliments.  I covered the potatoes with aluminum foil after 45 minutes. Also, 10 lbs. of potatoes feed a lot more than 10 people.  I used 2 9 x 13 x 2-inch pans; fed 16 persons and had 1 whole pan left over.

It would have been really good if it was less the onion soup mix.  It made it very very salty!!!.  I remade it with fresh onions and it was great!!!!

I made these potatoes (all 10 pounds of them) for a family BBQ and it was the first empty pan on the table. They are really good and not super 'saucy'. I cut the recipe in half for at home cooking and just freeze the other half of the CoC soup.

The condensed soups do not taste good to us paired with the potatoes.  None of my family cared for this version, sorry.

At best I would say this recipe is OK.  Taste was a litte too artificial for me.  I cannot tolerate artificial tasting food.  Other than that is was not bad, family enjoyed it more than I did.  I did not add any salt - the cans of soup has plenty of salt and if added it would be too salty.  I won't say I will never make this again but I will be in search of a better recipe.

Full of flavour and a snap to make!  Was a hit with my entire family, even my husband who dislikes scallop potatoes.
