It was so fun. I substituted Green olives stuffed with garlic for the cloves in the center of the eyes. By cuttint the onion at stock end you can easily have a larger hole and the olives pop right in. Made it tonight on halloween for my 4 kiddos and hubby and everyone loved it. Tried to add my picture but it says its too small.

The only thing I did differently was to put cooked mummy under the broiler for a few minutes, so the bacon could crisp up.  It was a hit with my adult children and hubby.   They all went back for seconds.

Reactivated my AllRecipes login just now to comment on this. First, we discovered Chef John on YouTube and love his work. Second, this was AMAZING. The flavor was great, it was moist, everything you want in a meatloaf. Our dinner guests (a whole family) were suitably impressed. The best part was, I apparently didn't push the eyeballs in far enough and so when I tried to fix that after cooking, meatloaf juice gooshed out from under the onions and looked DISGUSTING. LOL! Also, everyone loved the blood sauce! We had both spicy and regular BBQ sauce, so I mixed ketchup/spicy sauce/regular sauce in a 3:1:2 ratio, added a dash of worchestershire, and shook well in the squirt  bottle.

It was an awesome Halloween hit!  I did broil it at the last few minutes just to get the bacon crispy.

I put Swiss cheese in the brain cavity. I meant to put Gouda in and under the nasal orifice, and cheddar in and under the mouth. Broiled at the end to crisp up bacon. I also used garlic cloves for the teeth. No one, not even me, ate any of the garlic. The rest was a huge hit.

This was awesome, and everybody loved the zombie look!  I backed off on the salt a bit, and added one tablespoon of brown sugar to the mix.  Definitely will do this one again next year.
