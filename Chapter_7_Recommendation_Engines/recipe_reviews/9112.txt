I've made this cranberry sauce for the past 5-7 or 8 years now (think it came from Bon Appetit magazine).  It's the best sauce around!  I've tried a number of others from Epicurious.com, and this is the one I keep coming back to.

After reading the other reviews I got creative with the vinegar.  I used 1/4 cup balsamic (a really nice aged one that's fairly thick and sweet) and then 1/8 cup each of raspberry vinegar and pomegranate vinegar.  I omitted the orange as I don't care for it in cranberry sauce.  I made it just now as a dry run before Thursday and this stuff is simply divine.  I would give it more stars if I could and it is going to be our cranberry sauce from now on.  Many thanks to Christine!

This was a simple, quick recipe and the results were delicious.  I was a little concerned about the vinegar.  I didn't want it to taste like vinegar and it certainly can overwhelm a dish sometimes.  I also discovered that I didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar.  I used 1/4 of a cup since it wasn't the right kind and I didn't have a completely full bag of cranberries.  I left out the orange zest since I don't like orange flavor in anything.  The cinnamon stick was perfect!  It made our Jan. 29th Fakesgiving a hit.

This recipe is a super twist on regular cranberry sauce! I was a bit skeptical about it; the raspberry vinegar gave the sauce an odd smell as it cooked. But after the first bite I was convinced: this is my go-to recipe from now on!

Wonderful!  I'm always looking for a good cranberry sauce recipe.  I doubled the recipe (was cooking for a crowd), but probably shouldn't have doubled the raspberry vinegar.  It ended up tasting a little too strongly of vinegar, but was still very good.  I will definitely make it again!

This is great, and so easy!! I added some freshly grated ginger and left out the cinnamon stick (because I didn't have any) and it's delicious!

I can not image why anyone would not give this 5 stars -it is the best cranberry sauce that I have made!  I did have to use balsamic instead of the raspberry, but it was just amazingly good

I LOVED the flavor of this, but I was a bit disappointed that it didn't gel better. It was very soupy.

Picky eaters probably wouln't care for this, but I am NOT a picky eater!  Neither are my husband and 7 year old!  We really enjoyed the gourmet flavor.  I served this warm to pour over our Christmas Honey Baked Ham.  It was exquisite!

I found this exact recipe in a Bon Appetit magazine many years ago.  It is now the "go to" recipe for my whole family.  Excellent!

My mom has always used a family recipe for cranberry sauce every Thanksgiving. So when I found myself with a turkey roast in the middle of March, it didn't feel right to use her recipe. This is the recipe I tried instead. 
It was delicious! I made a couple of changes - I added some mint, used 1 tsb of cinnamon instead of the stick, used half raspberry and half pomegranate vinegar, and left out the orange zest because I didn't have any. I hate to say it, but this is better than the cranberry sauce I grew up on! I will definitely make it again!

This was easy to make, and wowed the guests at Thanskgiving dinner.  Most of them were used to gelatinous cranberry "sauce" from a can, so this was a refreshing change for them.  Even the kids, who usually avoid cranberry sauce like the plague, ate this one up.  Not too tart, not too sweet.  Just right.

It was good but maybe a little too "vinegary" for my tastes.  I think I am more of a cranberry chutney person.

A little too much vinegar, but the flavor was outstanding! I used blueberry infused balsamic.

We made a couple of different cranberry sauces for Thanksgiving and this (along with the classic) was the favorite. I'll be making it next time we have turkey. A great different cranberry sauce.

I made one tiny change, ie I  used half water and half orange juice to make a total of the mount required, simply because I like the stronger orange flavor. It was a nice change from the basic Ocean Spray package recipe I have used in the past.My guests seemed to like it very much and I have had requests to make it again. I certainly will!

I used red wine vinegar, but that is all my husband could taste in this dish... the vinegar. And the berries were just very bitter.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have regular raspberry vinegar so I substituted raspberry balsamic and reduced the amount to 1/3 of a cup. So good with just the right amount of tang!

Loved it.  Served twice this holiday season.  First time only the Cranberry sauce lovers liked it.  The second everyone willing to try it like it.  I had several requests for the recipe.
