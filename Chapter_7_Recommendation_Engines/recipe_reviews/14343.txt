Great pasta salad!  I omitted the argula.  My husband didn't care for the sundried tomatoes since they were the consistency of prunes he said, but I enjoyed the dish overall, esp. since I enjoy Mediterranean-style dishes. This is a keeper!

This is a fantastic salad, so pleasing. Instead of farfale, I used Orzo - I found it to soak up the flavor and be pleasing to the tongue. The vegetables taste so good, and the sun-dried tomatoes make it authentic. A brilliant addition to any bar-b-que this summer.

This is a great recipe.  I added a little more balsamic vinegar (about an extra tbsp), and some toasted pine nuts.  I omitted the arugala as well.  I made this for a cookout and everyone raved about it.  I definitely will be making this again!

I fixed this on Christmas Day for a family get together, but I couldn't find fresh basil leaves nor the arugula.  So I substituded the arugula and basil leaves with fresh mixed baby lettuce greens.  The finished product didn't look very good, but wow was it tasty!  My whole family were falling over each other for seconds.  And now my wife and kids are asking me to prepare it again for our New Years get together.  It's it hit!  Thank you so much for this great recipe.  I'm substituting the arugula and fresh basil leaves today with fresh spinich leaves which I believe will be tasty.  Will follow up comment if that doesn't work out.

I tried this for a potluck last weekend and people kept going back for seconds. I did not add any arugala and made a few minor changes such as 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 T. fresh lemon juice, 1 t. ground oregano. Thank for a successful pot luck. I will make this again.

Brought this to a party as a barbecue sidedish and everyone said they loved it. For my own personal taste, next time I will reduce the amount of pasta, so the ratio of vegetables to pasta is more like 50/50.

This is a keeper.  I did however make a few changes.  I am not a huge fan of arugula so I substituted baby spinach.  I added extra basil because I love it.  I only had the oil packed sundried tomatoes so I used them and just omitted using the reserved liquid and I didn't miss it at all.  I love this salad and I think it's even better cold the next day.

I've made this salad twice so far and everybody loves it!  I put in extra tomatoes and I love it warm or cold.  I mixed in some leftover salmon I had the day after a dinner party and it was  excellant!

REALLY enjoyed this!  I used spinach instead of arugula (because I couldn't find arugula!) and we totally enjoyed it.  I doubled the dressing and kept half of it on the side.
This is the first recipe involving eggplant that I've ever liked, and I've made it a few times now for ourselves, and I look forward to sharing it with friends.

Great recipe. 4 stars because I made a few changes. First, I used less pasta because I like about a 50/50 ratio. Also used a little more vinigar and feta. Some sort of nut would have been good, and next time I'll add mushrooms. Also, next time I wont rost the veggies so long, after letting the salad sit in my fridge, they got a little soggy. And if your serving cold, wait to put the greens in until right before you serve it. You don't want them to get wilted.

This was yummy. I couldn't find argula, so I used spinach instead. I tasted it before serving and it needed more flavour, so I added a couple extra splashes of the balsamic vinegar - I'd say I used at least 1/4 cup total. Turned out to be a great vegetarian main dish.

Man, I couldn't pass this recipe up after I read all the raving reviews!  I love it, too!  I altered the ingredient list somewhat to reflect my own tastes/budget, substituting spinach for the arugula, green pepper for yellow, etc...  I thought 4 tbsp of olive oil was a little much - next time I'll only use 3.  And even tho I only used about 1.5 tbsp of minced garlic, the taste overpowered the veggies - next time I'll use less.  But the basic ingredients are fantastic, and the combination is much better than some I've come up with on my own.  Thanks!

I really love this recipe.  It's delicous!! I have made it many times for a sidedish for BBQ's or just  for the maindish with some garlic bread and a glass of (red) vino.  I leave out the  arugula leaves, when I make a big bowl for me and my fiancé for lunches during the week the leaves get soggy and welted.

This is very tasty and healthy.  My one comment would be that the color isn't particularly appetizing even with all the veggies, so serve it on a colorful platter.

This is a lovely salad... and one made heartier by the use of eggplant.  Roasting the veggies as directed, followed by, say, 2 minutes under the broiler, gives them a wonderful, roasted flavor.  Oh, and use the most legit feta you can find.  It's worth it.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

I loved this salad! I would have given it 5 stars except for I tweaked a few things to my taste. Eggplant was hard to find fresh for me so instead I used zucchini. I also added mushrooms to the roasted veggies, and decided I'd like to roast the garlic with it. I used a tri-color bowtie pasta and used only half of the 12 oz. bag and lots of spinach so the ratio was evened up. After mixing the pasta, spinach, and roasted veggies together I added fresh tomatoes (in place of the sundried) and fresh black olives too. 1/4 cup of balsamic and only 2 tablespoons of olive oil. 6 tablespoons seemed a little too oily for me. Topped with tomato basil feta. Delish! And so colorful! Roomies liked it too!

Not a fan of this. Seemed dry and the dressing was bland. Didn't like the cooked veggies. Would prefer fresh veggies because they became mushy in the salad.

I've made this salad twice and am making it again tomorrow for our Memorial Day picnic with family and friends! We don't care for the taste of arugula so I substituted with baby spinach. And the second time I made this, we used a store bought dressing since I was out of balsamic vinegar and was just as delicious! Thank you for this family favorite recipe!!

I made this yesterday, and my family loved it! I didn't have squash, but it was still great. The bitterness of the arugula was balanced out perfectly by the sweetness of the sun-dried tomatoes, the basil, and the feta cheese. Everyone had seconds.

What I love about this recipe is that it's so versatile, such a great base recipe to tweak with.  You can put in whatever veggies you want and vary amounts and it will still be good.  I added olives and mushrooms, omitted the red bell pepper, subbed cherry tomatoes for the sundried, and parmesan for the feta. I almost felt it was ever so slightly lacking in some respect but I can't quite put my finger on it.  I think I would add more eggplant next time because that was the best part, and less bell pepper.  I'll definitely make it again and play around with it.  I served it hot and it was a great healthy meal, with fabulous leftovers.  It's wonderful to make a whole bunch of for dinner and eat throughout the week for lunch.

Delicious!  My husband and I loved this dish, it was excellent and very easy to make. I didn't have arugula so I used spinach and it was great. Very very tasty.  Will be a regular dish in our home.

This recipe is a hit at my house and with coworkers.  I used basil from the squeezable container and a little more balsamic vinegrette.

Absolutely fantastic! A myriad of colors and flavors! I served it with Flank Steak Pinwheels and a green salad including black olives, grape tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion with Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing. What a meal!

This was fantastic! Pretty easy to do, and it was good hot and cold. We also used spinach due to a lack of arugula at the store. Only thing is, next time we'll use more tomatoes!

I love this dish! I substituted zucchini for the eggplant and used sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, and 2T dried basil. It was great warm or cold. It made an easy lunch to take to work the next few days.

Didn't care for the dried tomatoes in this recipe. I don't know what I did wrong but this didn't come out like I expected. It tasted greasy, If I make again I will use fresh tomatoes, drained and cut back on oil.

We all loved this healthy fresh tasting salad.  The only changes I made was the addition of red onion, I sweated the eggplant for 30 mins with salt and I used whole grain pasta.  Everything else I followed to a T and the flavors were amazing...!!  Keeper.

I can't believe I never rated this receipe! Well, I have been making it for a few years and I always get requested to make this dish and give out the receipe too. I add more veggies than stated including a few zuchini. I roast until the edges are browned. I add extra balsamic vinegar and you can really use any kind of tube pasta you like. Toss all the ingredients and then I add cubed feta cheese. Next time I will try adding some roasted red onion! This receipe is excellent and makes a large portion. Leftovers make for a wonderful lunch.

Absolutely delicious!! I added extra feta cheese, because I love that stuff!! I don't think the sun dried tomatoes are really needed...but I had some, so I used them....Everything blended so well together...I will be making this again :) Thanks for a great recipe!

I just wasn't impressed.  It did inspire me to try some new combos--I kept thinking things like, "parmesan, not feta.  Add some mushrooms, roast the garlic, lots more greens, olives!"  But it just screamed out for so many changes.  I didn't find a cohesive taste, the veggies were soggy the next day, and the feta just seemed terribly misplaced.

A yummy salad!  We liked it warm better than chilled and I recommend it that way.  I used all red peppers because they were on sale and the yellow and orange ones were outrageously expensive.

My husband and I both loved this salad, which we ate as a meatless main dish.  We did add a lot more arugula than the recipe called for, and likewise with the balsamic vinegar (1/4 cup).  I also added toasted walnuts for a little crunch.  I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil because that's what I had, and I used some of that oil in the salad instead of the last 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  I'm thinking this summer we'll roast the vegetables on the grill so we don't heat up the kitchen so much.  My husband says 5 stars for sure! UPDATE:  Made this tonight with toasted pine nuts. spinach instead of arugula, and toasted quinoa instead of pasta.  I should have dialed back the oil from the tomatoes, but otherwise, this is still a recipe we love as a meatless main dish.  The quinoa adds to the protein.  I prefer it to pasta.

This is one of the best from scratch pasta salads I've ever made!  I didn't use eggplant, squash, or arugula, but sub'd lots of oven baked green, yellow, and orange peppers. I didn't see any other complaints about it, but I thought there was WAYYYY too much garlic in this recipe.  I also used an extra tablespoon of EVOO and had to add even more the next day as it had dried out quite a bit. Overall a great recipe.

Great, standard pasta salad - I boiled orzo with boullion for extra flavor and didnt need the feta as it was flavorful enough.  Good summer barbeque side salad.

I didn't use all of the oil...seemed a bit much for me.  I only used 1 tbsp to roast the veggies in and 3 tbsp for the pasta.  I used fresh tomatoes instewad of sun-dried and it was AWESOME!!!!  So much flavor!

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it purposefully to serve it cold the next day and it turned out great.  The basil and spinach (which I used instead of the arugula) wilted a little, but it still tasted great.  I added a little more tomatoes and didn't use the full amount of oil (I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil).  I also used orange bell peppers instead of yellow for some more color.  This recipe went over well at a picnic and I plan to use it again and again!

Delicious.  Roasted the veggies on the BBQ so as not to heat up the kitchen.  Instead of mincing the garlic I threw it in the blender with the liquid from the tomatoes and the balsamic vinegar.  When it was blended I slowly added the olive oil with the blender running.

Fabulous. I needed to bake the vegetables longer to brown and somewhat carmelize them. I doubled the feta (personal preference); used dried basil as there was none in the 3 stores I visited. My family loves this.

This was the first recipe that I made from this site. Modified it a little to satisfy my "meat & potatoes" husband. I omitted the arugula & added grilled chicken strips. I also topped the pasta with a few black olives for presentation. Very good!

Wow! This tastes like something from a really upscale deli. It's fabulous. I hardly changed a thing, other than skipping the arugula. It does require some degree of work, but is very much worth it.

I lived on this for three days...it is amazing!  I substituted spinach for arugula (although I don't care for either).  It was really good. I had it first warm and it was awesome. Then I divided it into tupperware and ate it cold for lunch the next several days.  It's a really good, filling travel food - I took a 2 1/2 hour road trip and was picking at it the entire time.  Not really a fingerfood, but I made it such.  Loved it and will definitely make it again.

This is 5 star warm, but only about 3 after being refrigerated, so I'll have to make less at a time and eat it fresh.  I substituted spinach leaves for arugula and roasted cherry tomatoes for sun-dried (but I'm sure sun-dried would be even better).  I also used about 1/2 the EVOO called for.  Fantastic!

This is now my favorite salad! I used only one red bell pepper and used zucchini instead of squash. I didn't use as much sun-dried tomatoes as it called for and added fresh tomatoes to it. I used spinach instead of arugula and about half the amount of pasta. It is a great salad to be creative with and use up those veggies. It was best warm but good cold too.

This was one of the most diverse flavored salads I've tried. The tastes just complimented each other so well. It was delicious...I had two servings myself!! :-)

Roasting the veggies is very important for this dish.  We added some sliced red onion as well.  Thumbs up!

I used moistened sun-dried tomatoes because they're fat free and I didn't have to boil them. I also halved the garlic and found it garlicy enough. I even forgot the yellow squash and it was still a delicious dinner!

Excellent recipe.  I subbed spinach for the arugula, used oil-packed sundried tomatoes (drained) because that's what I happened to have on hand,  a little less oil than it called for and 1 T garlic (minced from a jar).  Loved it and will make it again.

excellent. I like it the best served warm. IT was ok cold but I think the flavors blend better when it is warm. I subsituted grated asiago for the feta and it tasted great.

This recipe, as written, has been a family favorite for several years and deserves 5 stars. I normally don't like to see reviews where someone has made a major change and then reviewed it. I do like to see ways a recipe has been improved. This may not be an improvement, but an adjustment for anyone wanting to cut the calorie count to 230 calories per serving. Prepare the recipe as directed, omitting the pasta and serve over a large amount of steamed (3 min.) zuccini "zoodles."

Wonderful combination of flavors! Made the recipe as written, subbing spinach for arugula. Keeps well for a few days. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have any arugula so I left it out and I used whole wheat orzo (what I had in the cabinet.  It was delicious and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch all week.  So, so yummy!

I tried this recipe for the first time and would definitely make this again.  Myself & my family really enjoyed it!  All of the flavors married together taste wonderful!  I did deviate from the original recipes though and used some of the helpful tips from other readers reviews.  After roasting the large summer squash, 3 cloves of garlic and 6 small red/orange peppers (roasted peppers whole to remove the waxy skin afterwards).  I didn't have eggplant on hand. After roasting was complete, I broiled only the squash for about 10 minutes, turning every few minutes, to crisp it up some. I added cut up black olives to the salad & only had sun dried tomatoes in oil.  Mixed everything w/ the pasta except the greens (used fresh spinach) and put in frig for a couple of hours.  Mixed in greens & a bit more feta before serving.  Very good!!

Very tasty.  I left out the eggplant (just because I don't care for it), added the garlic to the veggies before I roasted them, and used tricolor pasta.  I also added 1/2 red onion to the roasted veggies. Will definitely make again.
