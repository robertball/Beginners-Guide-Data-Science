I used a mixture of bananas, strawberries, red grapes, and cantalope. I also simmered the sugar, orange and lemon juice with 8 leaves of peppermint from our garden (instead of the extract), and then poured the hot mixture over the fruit and put in the frig. My taste-tester (resident 4 year old!) said he liked the yogurt fruit salad we made last week a little better. Thanks for the post!

Used the same fruit as the recipe states except I omitted the honeydew and added blueberries and apple, I used fresh mint and served as part of a Sunday brunch and family really liked it.  Thank you for the recipe!

I aboslutely LOVED this easy recipe. Of course, as usual, I didn't have everything on hand that they used, so I just put in the fruit I had (watermelon, strawberries, raspberries, and apples) and then I decided to use dried mint instead of the peppermint extract. I totally still wanted to drink it! Very tasty!! Definitely making it again.
