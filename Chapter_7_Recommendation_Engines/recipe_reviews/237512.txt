Well, Mike Harvey, since I only had sweet pickle relish but all the other ingredients, I decided that I would make this for our turkey sandwiches today.  I have to tell you that this is a wonderful condiment for any sandwich!  I didn't even let it sit for the recommended three hours!  This will be good with just about anything that you'd use mayonnaise for!  You can play around with the amounts of the ingredients--I'm thinking in particular of the horseradish (love that stuff)!  I will be buying the dill pickle relish so I'll be ready for when I cook up a corned beef that sits in my freezer right now.  My hubby thinks I'm a star for serving this for our lunch today!  Thanks ever so much!

Yes of course, on Reubens, but this is an excellent salad dressing too.  No mustard seed on hand, I substituted with about the same amount of ground mustard. If I were this recipe's submitter I'd be tooting my horn, for sure!

Love me some Reuben's but have always disliked Thousand Island dressing due to the sweet relish. I whipped this up while my corned beef was slow cooking and you talk about an awesome Reuben! Hats off to you Mike Harvey. This sauce would be good on many different sandwiches and one I will use often.

Mike Harvey - this recipe is FANTASTIC!  A Reuben is my favorite sandwich, and I couldn't wait to fix a corned beef to have this sandwich spread.  The actual sauce recipe is delicious, but.....when you read the Cook's Note at the bottom, and follow those instructions on how to use the sauce to make a Reuben, the sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD - AWESOME!!  The hard boiled eggs really add a nice richness to the dressing.  Our sandwiches were so filling that I only served fresh sliced tomatoes and fresh peaches/blueberries with them.  I don't think I will ever make another Reuben without this recipe.  Thanks for taking the time to submit this recipe, Mike.  A winner in this house!! :o)

EXCELLENT!  I followed the recipe exactly but allowed a heavy hand when it came to the horseradish.  I couldn't wait to try this so I used it on a ham and swiss cheese sandwich.  My Rueben's are going to be so much better now that I have your magic sauce!   Thanks Mike!!

I don't often write reviews but I made this recipe tonight and I can't stop thinking about it.  If I could give it 20 stars I would.  I told my hubby that I will never buy thousand island dressing.  Thank you Mike.

If you don't have dill pickles or dill pickle relish but you happen to have some Spanish pimento stuffed olives, chop those up to use in the dressing.  The briny olives work just as well, or better in Thousand Island dressing. 
RE: Reuben sandwich...When I heat the sauerkraut I caramelize some onions first then stir in the drained kraut and heat it until it's fairly dry; I like to save some brine so I can mix a little of it back in depending on how dry it appears...

This is a terrific dressing! I am not familiar with "dill pickle relish" so I chopped up some dill pickles and tossed them in. I cannot say I made a Reuben sandwich because all I did was put warm corned beef on rye with onions and spread both sides of the bread with Mike Harvey's wonderful dressing. Thanks so much, it is scrumptious!!

Wonderful dressing for a salad or a Reuben sandwich!  I used garlic powder in place of granulated garlic.  You could leave out the hard-cooked eggs if you are out or short on time.

This is my 2nd time this week making this delicious TI dressing.  I love grew up in San Francisco and am a big fan of Crab Louie salads. This dressing goes perfect with this famous salad.  I add the hard boiled eggs on top of the salad, but I am sure they are delicious chopped and added to the recipe.  This  goes in 5 star recipes.

I've made this twice as written with the exception of eggs (don't like) and garlic powder instead of granulated since that's all I have.  Oh my word!!  SOOO good.  I use this on a reuben casserole--it kicks it up a few notches.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Thank you so much for this recipe. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Totally fantastic. Followed recipe exactly. I used this as an accompaniment to the reuben soup recipe, just a dollop as if you would add sour cream or creme fraiche. It actually made the soup, PERFECT. Hubs was beside himself. This was also amazing on turkey/bacon sandwich’s. I also added some in with cream cheese and it turned into an amazing pretzel dip.  ENJOY, MAKE THIS NOW! Cheers.

Excellent with my corned beef for sandwiches. I followed the cook's note and must say I had a wonderful Reuben!  I omitted the egg for dietary reasons and substituted the horseradish for spicy brown mustard (didn't have horseradish on hand). Perfect dressing for a myriad of sandwiches. Even my husband, who does not care for Thousand Island Dressing or Reubens tasted this dressing and liked it! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this. I didn't have dill or sweet pickle relish so I used a tablespoon of capers and a teaspoon of dill weed instead. Yum.

A great way to make 1000 Island Dressing interesting.
Just a tad more horseradish for me so there's a little more kick.  Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

I made this sauce to put on Reuben sandwiches and it did not disappoint.  We liked it much better than thousand island dressing. It is a good all around spread/sauce for numerous foods.  I did tweak it just a little bit. Added more of the dill relish and I did not add the eggs. The eggs just did not appeal to my husband and I. I definitely will make this again.

I never cared for 1,000 Isle dressing with sweet pickle relish so was very happy to run across this recipe.  I didn't have chili powder so substituted the catsup with chili sauce and ground up fresh deli spears in place of the dill relish.....turned out great!  I'll be using this on a lot of sandwiches besides Reubens.

love it!!! I substituted the relish with finely chopped dill pickle and added a few dashes of Worcester sauce. This was perfect on my chef salad.
