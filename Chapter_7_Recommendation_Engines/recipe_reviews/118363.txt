This was great!  The flavours went together perfectly.  To cut back on time, I cooked the tenderloin steaks on my GeorgeForeman grill for about 3 minutes, then under the broiler for 5 minutes.  The crumb-paste topping was a little crispy and golden on top, but still creamy on the inside.  My steaks were so juicy and perfectly medium-rare.  This is a great way of having the horseradish flavour without all the heat.  It was excellent, delicious, fast and easy.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was so good.  I have alot of Moose meat, so I used a Moose Tenderloin.  I added garlic to the steak along with the pepper.  I also didn't have regular horseradish so I used the Kraft Creamy Horseradish Sauce instead of Mayo and Horseradish.  I was delishious.  I think maybe next time I will use Ritz Crackers instead of Saltine Crackers.  Other than that this is a top notch recipe....Thanks

The flavors blended well together. I did add about a tsp of dijon mustard to the mayo mixture. 
The beef was done to perfection and crackers added a nice crunch.
I would season the beef with more pepper next time prior to the first broil.
