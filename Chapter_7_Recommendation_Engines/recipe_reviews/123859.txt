Simple to make and tasty.  I did not have nutmeg on hand so just used sugar & cinnamon but they still came out delicious.  Make sure to keep an eye on them when they are frying since they brown quickly.

Very Good! I've made these before but only used cinnamon and sugar.  The nutmeg makes them taste even better.

This was a great idea! We always have tortillas in our house and always need to use them up. I did add a few more teaspoons of cinnamon to the sugar. Great snack and absolutely delicious!

Mmmm...these were so easy and tasty!  Such a nice light treat (if you don't count the fact that they are fried and coated in sugar...lol).  Will definitely make again, they were a hit with kids AND adults.

Huge hit at our super bowl party.  We made them for the kids but I am pretty sure they were eaten mostly by the adults.  Thanks!
