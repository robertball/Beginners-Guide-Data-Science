Such a refreshing light dressing. I served it over a simple salad with romaine, broccoli, onion, and bell pepper. This dressing would be wonderful over a salad with some chopped cooked chicken breast.

I added garlic to the recipe and tossed it over asparagus. Definitely a keeper.

The flavor of the dressing is excellent, however the consistency is a bit runnier than I prefer in a dressing.  I might try adding about a 1/4 cup of greek yogurt to try to thicken it a bit.

This made a huge amount and unfortunately I wasn't crazy about it. I like more flavor in a dressing so I might try adding some garlic and its a little thinner then I like

I had tofu, brown rice, sugar snap peas, carrots, and green onions, and since it was a hot day, I decided to turn them into a salad instead of fried rice.  I looked for a dressing that would tie it together, and found this one.  I used 1/4 of the recipe for four servings of the salad, and added a teaspoon of sugar.  It turned out delicious.

Based on other reviews I scaled back the number of servings to 8. This still made a lot. I froze about half. I like the flavor but next time I will cut back on the oil. I felt it was too greasy. I will make this again with modifications.

Came out great! I substituted 1/4 cup of San-J soy sauce for the salt and used rice vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar.
