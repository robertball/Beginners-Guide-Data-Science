The flavor of this recipe is greatly improved by cooking the rice noodles separately. Boil them until just tender, rinse in cool water to get the excess starch off and to stop the cooking. Add them to the soup broth last and bring the broth back to temp and serve. I also put in a few dashes of Maggi seasoning or a TBs of powdered AuJus mix to give the chicken stock some added flavor dimension. The shrimp broth is a nice flavor rounder also.

I made this for our weekly movie & dinner night. It went over well. I increased the servings to 8 and this and another dish fed 6 adults with some leftover. A little short on the broth at the end. I misread a bottle in my cupboard before I went shopping & so didn't have any hot pepper sauce. I substituted Vietnamese chili garlic sauce. It worked fine. Knorr makes shrimp bullion cubes, I found them at a local Asian grocery.

I used Rice fettuccine noodles because I could not find suggested noodles when I shopped for ingredients.

Cook the noodles separate and rinse with cold water so they don’t get over cooked. I? used egg noodles instead of rice per personal preference. Serve with the usual add-ins, i.e. cilantro, mint, bean sprouts, and of course extra sriracha :) Yummy!

I also made the bean thread noodle separate and instead of shrimp stock I used coconut milk. I added red curry paste to the stock instead of pepper sauce. I like to set all the garnishes out so you can individually add what you like.

Even my very picky eater liked this! I used vegetarian broth and made my own shrimp stock.  I couldn't find the kind of noodles suggested, so I made Pad Thai rice noodles separately and added them to the bowls of steaming soup.

Made this recipe using vegetable broth, a dash each of oyster sauce and soy sauce.  I used fresh spinach and fresh chow mien noodles.  Yummy!
