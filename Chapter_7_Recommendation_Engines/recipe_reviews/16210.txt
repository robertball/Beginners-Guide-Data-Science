Wonderful!  Just a little tweaking and it came out great!  I found that a 9x13 pan was a little too big, maybe a 9x9 would do better?  Also, I added a full cup of pineapple along with some cinnamon.  Not too sweet, not too tangy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow, was this good (and easy)!  To save time, I peeled and cubed the sweet potatoes, boiled them for 8 minutes, then drained.  I also added 1 cup pineapple instead of 1/2 cup.  I, too, used a 9x9" baking dish, as others suggested (perfect size!).  My recipe was ready after 30 minutes of baking.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I was slightly hesitant about this wondering how the pairing of pineapple and sweet potato would taste, but thought it turned out excellent!  I was tired of seeing recipes for sweet potato casseroles that really packed the calories with sugar, syrup, marshmallows, etc.  Sweet potatoes are naturally sweet and I wanted something that would bring out that flavor while staying healthy since this is one of the best veggies for you!  This recipe did it for me.  I can't wait to make for my family on Thanksgiving!  This could even pass as a dessert!

I always try a new sweet potato recipe every Thanksgiving until...my husband no longer lets me make any other recipe but this one!  It's light not-so-sweet flavor is the perfect compliment to Thanksgiving dinner!

At our place everyone just takes a tiny spoonful of sweet potatoes (but we can't pass them up just the same!), so I don't want to spend too much time and energy on them.  I used a 40oz can of sweet potatoes which seemed more like 2 potatoes worth, and cut the other ingredients accordingly.  I'd probably do that again because it was so quick and easy to mash them and mix this up.  I'd use a little less sugar next time, since the pineapple adds some sweetness.  I think it needs a little something on top for presentation sake, too - maybe cut the sugar in the potatoes and just add a crumb topping.  Will try these again.

This is excellent. I followed the ingredient list exactly, except that I added about an extra half cup crushed pineapple to use up what I had. I agree with other users about the pan size - the listed size is too big unless you double the recipe (which I did!) Let me add that there is a simpler way to make this. I am pretty lazy about prep and cleanup, so I decided to just bake the sweet potatoes on a foil lined cookie sheet in the oven until very soft. Cut them in half and spoon out the insides. Why peel, boil, chop?

This is a good dish. I was expecting a little more flavor, though, but it is better the second day.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a topping of ½ cup brown sugar, ½ cup flour, 1/3 cup melted margarine, ¾ cup chopped pecans, and pineapple rings.  Without the topping, I think it would have been less than exciting. For the main dish, I used 5 sweet potatoes, 1c crushed pineapple, 1/4c brown sugar and 3 tbsp margarine.  I was afraid of making the dish too sweet, but I probably should have increased the brown sugar to go with the extra potatoes and pineapple.

Very easy & yummy.  I microwaved potatoes and scraped flesh out. 5 stars when topping is added as suggested: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup melted butter and 3/4 cup pecans. Mix, top and bake.

I use a little more pineapple in this recipe and caramelize it in the butter, then dissolve the brown sugar in the butter before blending with the mashed sweet potatoes.  Needs less baking time too..has a much deeper, richer pineapple flavor.

Don't save this dish for Thanksgiving, it is great all year round, but especially all during fall and early winter.  
My family loves this dish, including my 4 year old daughter and my very picky husband.  
I recommend baking the potatoes first, instead of boiling.  baking brings out the natural sugars in the potato, and then you can cut the brown sugar back a bit if you like.  Oh, I also add more pineapple, about 3/4 cup, and a pinch of cinnamon or even pumpkin pie spice if it's for a holiday meal.  Yummy any way you make it!!

Made this for Easter.  I only used two sweet potatoes, but they were huge, probably more than three regular sweet potatoes.  I also used the entire can, 8 oz. (1 cup) of crushed pineapple and thought it was good.  Nice sweetness but not overly sweet.

I cut my sweet potatoes into bite size pieces, boiled until nearly tender, drained them, and layered them in a 9x9 pan.  I mixed together one cup of pineapple and the 1/4 cup of brown sugar and poured it over the potatoes.  I put little dabs of butter on top, but not nearly 3 tablespoons.  YUMMY!!!

This recipe is wonderful. The light taste of the pineapple allows the sweet potato flavor to be revealed. If you're looking for something other than the cloying sugar taste of caramel or marshmallow for your sweet potatoes, this recipe is for you.

It is good, a little on the bland side.  I'm thinking a topping of some kind or some cinnamon would make it a phenomena side dish.

This is a great recipe! I cheated and used canned sweet potatoes to skip a few steps and it turned out wonderful! I did add a little cinnamon but left out the butter to keep the fat content down. I also took it a step farther and added a strudel topping of oats, brown sugar, flour and a tablespoon of butter. My husband loved it!

This was easy to make and my family did eat it, but personally I think the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar sauce and marshmallows on top is way way better.  So if you like that a lot, you might be a little disappointed with this.  I thought this needed a little more of something, not sure what.

Just finished Thanksgiving dinner, and the family flipped for this! Thanks for a great recipe! I boiled the potatoes after peeling and chunking, then drained. I didn't have pineapple tidbits so I chopped up half a can of rings and mixed it in with the chunks. Left it in the fridge over night and made the topping suggested in earlier review, and also added the last 5 pineapple rings for a pretty topping. Since we had mashed potatoes it was nice to have the sweet potatoes in chunks. I highly suggest you try it!

This went over very well in my house. I did make a few alterations however. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, omitted the sugar and added some pineapple juice from concentrate, and i used a 9x9 baking dish. I was afraid the pineapple flavor would be too over powering but it turned out better than I could have hoped for. 

I paired this with the Hawaiian Fish with Pineapple found on this website and my family ate it all up. And the leftovers were just as good.

These were a hit at Thanksgiving.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a smaller pan.  Also, maybe I had small sweet potatoes, but I ended up using 5 instead of 3.   Microwaved them instead of boiling.  Also, closer to one cup of pineapple.  Sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Yummy!

This was fantastic! I agree that it needs some sort of topping to look really finished (I used flour, brown sugar and margarine), but I'll have to be quick to get a share of the leftovers tomorrow.

Excelent!! I really wanted to make something different for my first thanksgiving as a mom with a familyof my own. I topped the sweet potatos with praline topping and it was great. With the left overs my mom made a "pumpkin bread" but subsituted the pumpkin for the sweet potatos and it was amazing. Try it. You'll love it ;)

This was surprisingly good. I was looking for a recipe that was free of eggs, nuts, wheat, msg, etc... b/c of anaphylactic allergies and this was the ticket. I was skeptical at first but it was better than expected. I also added a little cinamon to it. I will make again next Thanksgiving. Thanks

This was wonderful. I took the advise of others and increased the amount of pineapple... however, I think I may keep it at a half cup next time.  Also I think that a splash of spiced rum may be good idea!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Very yummy, got some good reviews but some preferred traditional sweet potato casserole over this.  Definitely recommend adding the crunchy topping and pineapple rings suggested by another reviewer to add to taste and appearance.

Delish indeed! I get compliments every time I serve this and it is a staple at our holiday gatherings. The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is that it needs a topping in my opinion. I use whatever casserole dish(s) fit the finished product since sweet potatoes vary so greatly in size. The ingredient portions are perfect for smaller - medium sweet potatoes but for larger ones, I'd suggest increasing the pineapple, brown sugar and butter a bit.  For holidays, we make one dish with the pecan, brown sugar, flour, butter topping suggested by other reviewers and top another with marshmallows for the younger crowd.  I also heat the pineapple, brown sugar and butter in a skillet before mixing with the sweet potatoes but my husband makes it as indicated in the recipe.  Either way, we love it!

I was really impressed with this recipe. I subbed the butter for a dairy-free buttery spread due to allergies in this house. This was a simple, yet a sweet, satisfying casserole which is a nice change from the heavy syrup-y sweet versions.

While this tasted good, it took too long to prepare and the directions need to be changed a little.  I used two large and one medium sized sweet potato for this, and it was no where near large enough for a 9x13 pan!  It also only needed to go in the oven for about 30 minutes.  I got 6 very small portions out of this.

This recipe came out absolutely delicious. It was easy to make. I made it ahead of time and put it in the fridge and then the microwave when I was ready to eat. The only change I made was that I added cinnamon. The sweet potatoes took a long time to boil till soft as they were rather large. Next time I might try cooking them in the microwave. I left the potatoes chunky and made no effort to squish them. Excellent recipe.

Nice, easy recipe that tastes great. I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling and added pineapple chunks after 30 minutes. This gave the recipe the same flavours, but with a chunky texture to the casserole.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I did not put all the brown sugar in because I felt it was sweet enough. It was a big hit!  People had seconds.

Excellent & very easy peasy. Crushed pineapple was delicious & the creamy sweet potato such a great combo. I also used fresh pineapple & homemade vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!!!??
