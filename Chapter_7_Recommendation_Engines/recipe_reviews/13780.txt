I put in the ingredients exactly and it looks like chocolate pie and tastes only of molasses. 

I would avoid this recipe unless you are feeding someone who loves molasses.

This recipe was a delicious variation of the traditional pumpkin pie. It's still delightfully traditional tasting, but the molasses gives it a darker taste that is not too sweet. It fluffed up nice for me in the oven, then sank to a typical pie size.

Only one person liked this.
I love molasses, but the molasses is way too overpowering in this dessert!
