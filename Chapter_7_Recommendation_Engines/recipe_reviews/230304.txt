I was confused before realizing the author probably meant HONEY rather than "Mix cherries, cashews, and ONION into the quinoa mixture" (though I could be wrong); I did try it with honey, not onion, and felt it was an easy, tasty alternative to other hot cereal breakfast dishes.

I really liked this!  Would definitely make it often.

My changes:  
almond milk instead of regular milk
Toasted almond slices (just quickly done in a pan as the quinoa cooked)
No vanilla
Brown sugar, about 1 1/2 Tbs.
Dried cranberries. I threw them in near the end of the cooking time to soften.

Very easy and tasty.   I added Craisins and chopped pecans and a little agave to sweeten.  Did not have creme fraiche on hand so mixed a cup of heavy cream and a tbs. of buttermilk a little vanilla and whipped it.

Just made this recipe for the first time! It is really good! I love that I just stumbled upon another, more healthy, protein-rich breakfast :) I am a breastfeeding mom, so I did not sweeten it with honey -- I used brown sugar, so it was basically identical to how I would make oatmeal (cinnamon and brown sugar!). I actually didn't add any fruit or nuts this time, because I didn't have any on hand, but I know they will be a great addition!! Thanks for the awesome breakfast recipe!!

Loved it! I used blueberries and dried cranberries and decided to crush up the cashews before mixing them in to help them blend better. This is definitely now one of my favorite breakfasts.

It was okay.  I was hoping it would be creamier.  It basically was quinoa with a cinnamon taste.  Make sure to watch the pot carefully!  Because you are using milk it will boil over before you know it.  Wow!  That made a hell of a mess!  So I started over, thinking if I put it in my rice maker it would not boil over... but it still boiled over a little bit.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 because of my screw ups.  I would like to try it a third time, but with Quinoa over $5/lb., It might be a while before that happens.

Excellent! Made the first batch and hubby ate all of it so make a quadruple batch so I can eat it for breakfast this week! First time used cherries and walnuts. Second time with cherries, raisins and pecans. I like that it's healthy and has very little added sugar.  You could probably skip the honey, but I'd never skip the cinnamon.

Only reason I give it four stars is because of personal preference. Try substituting some of the fruit in the recipe for apples. Love it for it's health benefits

Loved this! We made a lot of substitutions because we just used what we had on hand. Cooking the quinoa we did by the recipe except we had 2% milk instead of skim. The add-ins we used were cashews, honey, chopped dried apricot, banana, and little heavy whipping cream. Definitely plan to make this or something similar again. Oh and be sure you keep an eye on the cooking quinoa! Mine boiled over, but thankfully I was close so it wasn't too bad.
