Yes very nice and very easy. I was in the mood to keep on cooking after dinner time so I wanted to try this..Very good and very easy. thus the 4 star instead of 5. I found the whole wheat cheese ravioli at the local club store but didn't and never use fresh basil I only use basil spice in a jar. It's just 2 of us but this recipe was awsome. Please send more!! Please!!!
