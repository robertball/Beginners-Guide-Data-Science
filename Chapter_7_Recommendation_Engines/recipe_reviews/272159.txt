Not really keto at 11 carbs for a serving (1/18th of a recipe) . Unless you forgo the fruit topping, I guess. Tastes great, though, and easy to make.

I made this for my Book Club friends because there are so many who are counting carbs, gluten free, vegetarian and on keto diets. Everyone loved this dessert and some asked for the recipe. I broke up the bars and put them in a dessert dish and then added the fruit on top....very pretty! I used a small square cake pan to bake them.

I've made this several times and sometimes I used almonds instead of pecans and after the first two times switched to monk fruit instead of stevia due to stevias strong aftertaste. This recipe has become my family's keto dessert so far.

This is definitely going to be a favorite. Even though I made the mistake of making it the day before so it was soggy on the bottom everybody LOVED it! It still tasted delicious.

I was so looking forward to making this an ended up eating it an hour after coming out of the oven. It didn’t taste what I was hoping it would taste like. I recommend eating it cold. It taste better than warm. The crust was just ok. Wish there was a better way to make the crust taste better.

We LOVED these!! I don’t have much experience baking, but the instructions were easy. I will definitely make this again. I baked them in a cupcake pan since I didn’t have a brownie pan. I baked it for about 30 min. It stuck to the pan a little and the base crumbled a bit, but they were still delicious. I’ll have to do something different next time if I use a cupcake pan [not sure what, so if someone has a tip please share :) ]

I didn't have pecans, so I substituted walnuts.  The bottom was a little softer than I wanted but they were still tasty.  I recommend that that they be eaten within 3  days or frozen.

Followed the directions exactly and mine was brown on the top and edges but completely soggy on the bottom. I'm an experienced baker.

I have been on. KETO plan for 6 weeks and this is the BEST thing I have baked so far. 
I was wondering about storage after they are baked?

Fabulous! I don’t have the brownie pan and didn’t really want to use a springform pan so are used a regular Pyrex baking dish. Awesome dessert!
