This is delicious. At first I thought there was too much cinammon, but after it baked and was all bubbly and the apple and cranberry juices mixed with the cinammon, it was wonderful!The topping was perfect--I was out of nuts, so omitted them--and it was still good. I wouldn't change a thing. By the way, the recipe doesn't specify whether or not to chop up the cranberries, don't---they would almost disappear if you did---they sort of "explode" as they bake, and make wonderful juice--and still contribute to the texture of the dish. Delicious!!!!

Great!  As per other reviewers, I made extra crisp for the top (maybe an extra half recipe) and I probably could have made it as per the recipe.  FYI - I used 4 apples, as many people weren't sure how many apples was 2 lbs.

I made this for a Christmas dinner. It won many compliments, however it really was at its finest when it was cold. Delicious! I should've served it cold instead of reheating it before serving. I changed the amount of crisp, quadrupled it actually! Gotta love the crisp! I even baked it in a 9x13 dish since wanted more crisp than filling and, honestly, was out of dishes. This turned out to be a bit of a wrong turn. My insanity resulted in the filling just being a thin little layer at the bottom. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will bake it in a 9x9 or similar dish. Will I quadruple the crisp again? Heck yeah! I might even add more cranberries. They were great and just so few! Oh, and I threw in a handful of orange craisins, the kind you buy in a bag in the raisin area of the grocery store for a little bit of orange zesty juiciness. This recipe is a dream with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe. I'm hungry for some right now, but all leftovers were gone by the next day.

What a hit! I used three large Granny Smith apples and twice the amount of cranberries. Another reviewer said that she thought that the recipe called for too much cinnamon...but once she baked it she realized it was perfect. I agree, as I was adding the cinnamon it seemed like a lot...but in the baking it adds a terrific flavor! I also doubled the amount of the topping which was perfect. One thing that I may do next time is add more quick oats...to make the topping crunchier! A+ This one is a winner!!

Delicious! I split up the mixture among four ramekins and baked at 375ยบ for about 25 minutes. The taste and texture were both phenomenal.

This was heavenly!  I loved the rich, tangy sauce that formed underneath, and the cranberries made it so pretty.  Many reviewers have suggested making more of the topping, but I disagree; the fruit is the main event here, and I thought the proportions were just right.

The basis of this recipe is great however I modified a few things just as a matter of convenience.  I used two cans of canned apples and one bag of cranberries (same area you would find raisins in at grocery store). instead of fresh.  Due to the sugar already in the canned apples I omitted the white sugar from the recipe.  I also used sliced almonds instead of pecans.  This was a wonderful quick dessert that everyone loved.  I served with cool whip.  Would absolutely make again.

Loved this! But I had to bake it in a larger dish. When I tried to fit it in a pan of the specified size, the apple mixture wouldn't fit.

Delicious!  A beautiful blend of sweet and tangy.  I was a little short of two pounds on my apples so I added some extra cranberries, though I didn't feel I needed to worry about the extra tartness since I was using sweet red apples instead of Granny Smiths.  Next time I will double the topping because it's sooo good! :)

I made this for company one night and they told me it was the best crisp they've ever had!
The fresh cranberries made this recipe. I cut the cinnamon down by half to 1 1/2 tsp and that was plenty. I only had a handful of sliced almonds so I threw them in the topping instead of pecans. Will definitely make again... also made it with spartan apples and it was still good.

Very good but a little too tart! I halved the amount of cinnamon because I thought it was a little too much, just a preference. I would definitely reduce the amount of cranberries next time!

This is a great basic recipe, but there was way too much nutmeg in it. That was the dominate flavor in this recipe. Next time, I'll only use 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg.

I brought it to a party and it was a hit.  Everyone liked it and upon my solicitation, had comments for tweaking the recipe based on their personal liking for cranberries.  The recipe is forgiving regarding amounts.  Followed directions but inadvertently added a few extra apples (I used Jonagold).  I also chopped up a portion of the cranberries and left the rest whole.  The chopped cranberries "disappeared" into the apples.  The whole cranberries were more beautiful - but tart for those unfamiliar with cranberries in desserts.  Next time I will leave more of the cranberries whole.  By the way, even if I followed the recipe exactly, I think the crisp calls for a larger baking dish than 8x8.  The recipe is a keeper.

This was a fantastic treat during a wisconsin winter blizzard. I doubled the entire recipe and baked in a 9x11 1/2 pan. I used 1/2 granny smith apples and 1/2 fuji. I also used craisins instead of fresh cranberries. I used the full amount of cinnamon and didn't regret it. While still warm I drizzled some caramel over the topping. (Didn't regret that AT ALL! LOL) Great warm or cold.

Wow, this was great.  I doubled the filling (generous with the apples), and tripled the topping, then used a 9x13 pan.  I am not a big fan of nutmeg, so I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice (might also try dried ginger next time).  Also, I used half brown sugar in the filling.  This is a keeper, soon to be a holiday favorite in our home!

Loved this. I don't think I'll ever make apple crisp without cranberries again! I usually double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan, and have it with ice cream.

Wasn't my favorite, but it's good.  I think the recipe needs alittle tweaking -- The topping was on the dry side and the cinnamon was a little heavy.  Next time, I'll add pats of butter on top before baking.  I'll also cut the cinnamon back to 2 tsps instead of 3.

The cranberries were a nice addition to our Thanksgiving dessert.  I actually liked the tartness of the cranberries.  I often find apple crisp too sweet.  I would definitely make it again.

Amazing recipe and super easy!  I cut down the cinnamon and nutmeg just a little bit and add a bit more pecans to the crumble for an extra crunch. My whole family loves it and beg me make it all the time.

Absolutely the best!!!!
I used 4 large granny smiths, which is comparable to 2 lbs
I used dried cranberries, as I wasn't sure if recipe was for fresh or not.
this was a very very very good and if you want to make a dessert to please, this is it.
I made no changes to this recipe except i did double the topping mixture as other reviewers suggested, and it was perfect!!!

This was really delicious!  I had to use a 9x13 pan to hold all of the apples.  Because of the larger surface area I doubled the crumb topping.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

While there aren't very many cranberries in this recipe, they give the sauce a pretty rosy color.  I followed the recipe as written, but really feel this has too much cinnamon, and it needs a larger pan (a 9" square would be about right).  We needed to serve this with whipped cream to tone down the cinnamon a little.

Perfect fall crisp.  Loved the tart cranberry addition with the apples.  Definitely a favorite.

A-ma-zing, I loved this.  I made it for Thanksgiving (tomorrow) but when I tried it tonight I HAD to have a bowl.  I did mess up and put the brown sugar into the fruit part, but that just made it better.  I also tripled the topping and I'm glad I did. I used craisins, too, instead of regular cranberries.

Delicious and easy!  I doubled the cranberries and added a little extra topping.  Made without nuts due to allergies, and it was divine with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks so much!!

This recipe was easy to make  and since most of my family cannot have gluten, I replaced the 1/3cp of oatmeal with 1/3 cup of Gluten-free baking mix. The dish was delicious!

Okay, so I ended up reading this recipe wrong. I didn't realize that the topping was supposed to go on last (on top) i thought it said to mix everything together.....which i did. And then i realized the crumb topping went on top. So i had the topping mixed in, then made another batch of crisp to go on top. Turned out AMAZING! I will definitely make this again!! Everyone loved it! And it turned out very well with the topping mixed in and on top!

OMG!!! This is the best recipe ever! I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled the amount of topping and baked it in a 9 X 13 pan! This is a huge hit in our house!!! Oh, and I used Cortland apples instead of the Granny Smith and threw in an extra handful of cranberries. Delicious!

This was wonderfully refreshing and yummy. I served it hot with vanilla ice cream and everyone enjoyed it greatly. Thanks, Christina! I did use walnuts instead of pecans and increased the amount to 3/4 c, and the cranberries to 1 c, but that was just because of our personal preferences. I didn't use quick-cooking oats, but just regular ones and moistended them a bit by mixing on a few occasions while baking in the last 10 minuts and it was yummy. Next time I may even use more oats, but again that is just because of my experimental nature and personal taste.  Thank you for a keeper recipe!

This is one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made and has become a part of my permanent family cookbook.  Since it was summer when I made this, I was unable to find cranberries fresh or frozen.  So, instead I made it as an entirely apple crisp.  It was fabulous.  Would be good served warm with a scoop of ice cream!  Going to roll this out for company on Thanksgiving and add the cranberries.  Don't read any further...you are guaranteed to love it!

I have made this several times and always receive rave comments.  I use an apple peeler so the slices are thin.  I bake it at 40 minutes - I once baked it for 50 minutes and the apples were mushy/overdone.
Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Delicious! Won  me so many compliments :) I used this as an addition to Thanksgiving pies this year by just sticking it in a graham cracker crust instead of a 9x9" dish. Omitted pecans, made about 1 1/2 times the topping which was plenty. Used 4 apples(2 lbs) and 1 1/2 C cranberries. Also seasoned w/1 t mace, 1 t cinnamon, & 2 t fresh allspice = amazing! I think next time I'll be using 3 apples & 2 C cranberries. My host topped it with fresh whipped cream and it was perfect.

I like the combination of apples and cranberries.  I increased the cranberries to a full cup and increased the topping by fifty percent.  I had to use a larger pan because it did not fit in my eight inch square pan.  I received several compliments on the dessert.  Good stuff!

I read the reviews first and added more cranberries. I enjoyed it very much.  If you want a tart crisp this is definitely that.  If you want a sweeter crisp I would recommend using a sweeter apple and use the recipe's amount of cranberries.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and the combination of tart and sweetness was really nice.

This was great!  I subbed huckleberries (local tart blueberry type berries) for the cranberries and it all turned out delicious.  the topping was yummy - the pecans really added to it. I did drizzle a couple tsps melted butter over the top before baking to help avoid any dry crust problems. I would also say to allow time for extra baking depending on the type of apple you use and how soft you like them. Just cover loosely with foil and bake until the apples are done to your liking. I'll definitely do this again!

I make this often and EVERYONE loves it. My brother in law will not eat "dessert" of any kind EVER and he loved this - to the point that there were no planned leftovers! Since cranberries have a fairly short season, I keep some in the freezer to make this in "off" times of the year.  Loved the idea another had of making individual ones - will try that next!

This was a delicious way to use the plentiful fall apples.  I used walnuts and macintosh apples because that was what I had on hand.  It smelled soooo good cooking in the oven.  Very good seved with Vanilla ice cream.  Thanks Christina!

Used half white and half brown sugar, a bit more cranberries than called for, some cut in half and the rest whole, plus doubled the topping.  Also doubled the entire recipe and made this in 10" x 13" pan, and it turned out phenomenally.

I made this with some tart apples, I used less sugar for fruit and topping.  Used agave and stevia to cut down on sugar.  Did not use pecans or regular flour because of food allergies.  Instead I ground gluten free oats to make oat flour.  Next time I will use only 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also leave the apple peels on....we like it that way and it saves time on making it too.  It was delicious!

I  enjoyed this crisp, the filling was delicious. I did use a mixture of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries because I could not find cranberries :(   However, the crisp I feel like I wanted it more crispy, something was missing but I am not sure what it was.

For the crispiest topping you have to add a little water; 1-2 tablespoons. This was a good recipe I doubled the topping, cranberries and used a 9x13 pan. Next time I would use a sweeter apple, the Granny Smith with the cranberries were too tart. The addition of vanilla ice cream really helped the tartness!

PERFECT--if you like cranberries.  Not to sweet.   It took longer to peel and slice apples than anything else--quite easy to make. It did not last too long-it was good!!

This is fabulous! I used more cranberries, and less cinnamon and sugar. Also doubled the topping. I used melted butter in the topping and it turned out great.

This is amazing! Few minor chanegs as others suggested: increased cranberries to 1 cup and doubled the topping, it was perfect and smelled so good as it was baking, I also used mac's & cortlands. Thanks for posting!

I upped the amount of oats and added ground cloves to the topping.  I also added fresh orange juice and rind to the filling.  I am a big fan of the cranberry orange combination.  Delicious.

This is absolutely amazing.  I've made this at least 5 times now.  The recipe as it is wonderful, but I've changed some things.  I upped the cranberries to one cup, and cut the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also only used 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I made it with McIntosh apples, not granny smith, and I also have made it with and without pecans.  It's wonderful both ways.  This is a must make, especially around Christmas.

Yummy!  I doubled the recipe (went heavy on the cranberries) and baked in a 9x13 pan.  Per other comments, I used 2t per batch/4t for doubled batch.  Delicious!  This is my new favorite crisp!

The cranberries add such a nice tartness to the typical apple crisp. The topping is perfect: crispy & sweet, with a hint of chewiness. Presentation is not all that pretty because the berries stained the apples a reddish color... but with all this flavor, who would care!?. I doubt I will make apple crisp with just apples, after trying this!  Great idea Patton0626!

This was delicious.  I used Gala apples instead of Granny Smith since I don't like Granny Smith apples, and used up the frozen cranberries that were left over from Christmas.  I'll definitely be making this again :)

I like that it's not too sweet but some of the flour on top was not cooked through at the end so I had to add a tiny bit more butter and put it back in the oven for a few minutes.

This was just okay, but I still give it 4 stars because it may have been because I was lacking some of the ingredients. I used cranberry sauce and left out the pecans.

This was excellent!  I made it pretty much just as the recipe called for, though I might have added in a little extra cranberries and oats.  I think there was a perfect amount of crisp.  This is so easy to make and was a big hit with all the dinner guests we served it to.  I will definitely make this many times in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe makes the house smell wonderful for hours after baking, not to mention the fact that it TASTES wonderful as well! I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and tripled the topping. (I baked this in a 9x13" pan.)This was originally served warm with vanilla ice cream, but I enjoyed it even more the day after, all by itself. Delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

We've been making this recipe for over 20 years for Thanksgiving and it is without a doubt one of our favorites. It would not be Thanksgiving without this sweet, tart hot dish! We've had to start making a double batch to make sure that some would be left over.

This was a great recipe.  The cranberries added a tartness that made it perfect.  The only thing I found I didn't like was the amount of apples.  Too many apples, too little topping, but I like the topping, so will cut back on the apples next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good!  I made it for thanksgiving, but instead of whole cranberries, I used jellied cranberries (homemade), a little more liquidy, but calmed the tartness without killing it.  Great recipe!

This was amazing!!! I had gala apples not Granny Smith but I used a full cup of cranberries. I actually was craving rhubarb crisp but it's not exactly rhubarb season here in Alberta. I made this for dessert after easter dinner and wow. I will definitely make this again! I made no changes to the recipe as others did, (other than the different type of apple) and the spices and flavours were perfectly balanced, I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you for sharing.

This was great!  I believe in using the original recipe first run, but was forced to make two changes on the topping that  did work due to ingredients on hand.  I had regular oats on hand and not quick cooking ones.  I used 1/2 pecans and 1/2 sliced almonds.   Both were perfectly fine as a substitute.  I followed everything else as written and believe a little less cinnamon would be more preferred by me.  It was great with vanilla ice-cream and a wonderful tart treat!  This recipe is a keeper and will make again.

Way too much cinnamon for my family.  However it was gone in 12 hours.  I doubled the topping. I am making it again with 1/2 the cinnamon it calls for.  May be 5 stars later.

This turned out fabulously! Giving 4 stars because I put in more cranberries than were called for and I think it needed them. I made a double recipe and put in about 2 1/2 cups of cranberries; it wasn't too tart at all and it made the cranberries more than just an accent.

This is the best recipe! I made 2 batches of it last Thanksgiving, and I hardly got any. Everything is perfect about this: tartness, sweetness, a little crunchy, very soft inside. It's best when warm!

I prepared the recipe as is.  It's okay.  There is too much cinnamon in the fruit portion.  It overpowers the taste of the fruit.  The crisp is very good.

I halved the recipe and cooked it in a glass loaf pan.  I omitted the pecans and added a few extra cranberries. I will definitely make it again-- the fruit is tangy and delicious, and the topping is perfect.  Next time I might omit the white sugar and replace half or all of the Granny Smiths with Golden Delicious to increase the natural sweetness.

Delicious! I left out the pecans in the crumble topping and used oil instead of the butter. I made doubled the fruit and made 5x the topping (reduced the oil/butter).

So yummy! Love that it's different than your basic apple crisp with the cranberries for tartness and beautiful color. I  "1 1/2x'd" the recipe, using 6 apples (3 red/3 green) and sliced them as well as cut the sliced pieces to "fit" better onto a big spoonful of a bite ; ) - also combined the topping mix, sprinkled that on top then poured melted butter over it, rather than cutting the butter (that never works for me - always end up with dry patches.) Such a great fall dessert with vanilla ice cream and a cold glass of milk!

I really liked this crisp.  Super easy, I did double the crisp part, since that is my favorite part.  I will make this again but, I will add more cranberries, they tasted so good, but that amount was too little for me.  I will be making this for Thanksgiving this year!!!

This was real good and I served it with vanilla ice cream. All I could smell from the oven was the nutmeg, so I thought I put too much. NO, it was delicious. And my husband loved it and that is what counts to me!

This was fantastic. The only thing i changed was i used dried cranberries because my local store did not have fresh and i had my heart set on making it today. And i also added more nuts. I think with fresh cranberries this would be 10 stars.YUMMO

Great recipe! I used two cans of Comstock Limited Edition Apple Cranberry pie filling. I had last minute guests and needed a quick fix for what I had on hand. I followed the directions for the crumble and added a dash of cinnamon on top. Next time I think I will add a bit more brown sugar (a couple TBL's) just to sweeten the top slightly. I used walnuts because I didn't have any pecans and it was still great. I think I will try it with the fresh fruit next time. Thanks for saving the day!

I prefer this recipe to others because of the fresh cranberries and lack of cornstarch. Highly recommend, especially served with fresh whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream. Adding a splash of rum on adult servings is also a nice touch.

This was a great recipe. I loved the crisp flavor and crunch with the sweet yet tart flavor of the apples and cranberries. I doubled the crisp recipe and almost doubled the cranberry and apple measurements (didn't have quite enough to fully double) and it was enough for my family and to share with others at work. I also used Honeycrisp apples instead of Granny mith because I prefer more sweet than tart and they were what I had on hand. Will make again, thanks for sharing!

I just pulled it out of the oven and tried some.  SOOO YUMMY!!  I think I probably doubled the recipe because I didn't know how many apples a pound would be.  I know for a fact that I tripled the crisp.  Silly me, I forgot to add the pecans to the topping...but it was still excellent!  Will definitely make again and again!

This is delicious, don't change a thing!  Cinnamon was perfect, filling to topping ratio was perfect, and mine was plenty juicy after the cranberries burst during baking!  The sweet/tart combination is great.  Plop a little fat free Cool Whip on top and you're in heaven!

My husband claims he does not like cooked apples.
He loved this dessert!  Said he did not realize he was eating apples until I told him.  We loved the tartness of the cranberries - and they are tart.  Very easy to make - don't worry if measurements of apples and cranberries aren't exact - it still comes out very good.

I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.

My husband, mother-in-law and I loved this recipe. I made it pretty much as described except for using a non-dairy butter and spraying the baking dish with cooking spray instead of using butter. Served with vanilla ice cream. Absolutely delicious!

I amended this recipe a bit, per a few other reviews. I doubled the cranberries, (added the perfect amount of tartness) but still used 4 large Granny Smith apples. I doubled the crisp topping and, added about about two table spoons extra butter. I made this as one of our Thanksgiving desserts. It turned out amazing!!! It was the first to be devoured. My husband, and teenage boys ate it all the same day!  ?(^?^)?

Really good! Reviews say it has too much cinnamon, but i think it's delicious! 4 stars because, as most recipes are, it needs slight changes because it's not completely perfect. I do think it's great for holidays with a bunch of people. I'm only 12 years old and I was able to make this and have everyone adore it! I think that's an accomplishment. Thanks to the creator for such a wonderful recipe.

Excellent, but note that I did make a few changes mostly based on what I had on hand. I used a combination of honeycrisp and Jonathan apples and walnuts instead of pecans.  Because I love cranberries I doubled (at least!) the number of cranberries and so increased the sugar inside the crisp by about a tablespoon or so. I was out of nutmeg and didnโt miss it, but Iโm guessing it would be great with it.

Hubby gave this dessert 5 stars!  It is great as it stands or it is easy to modify depending on what ingredients you have on hand.  I made a 9x13 pan full, increasing the recipe accordingly.  Since I only had 5 large Granny Smith's, I added a can of unsweetened apple pie filling.   Then realizing I was out of pecans, I substituted sliced almonds.  It was delicious warm with ice cream!  It is hard to mess this recipe up.  Great fruit combination!

I made this as is, and it is excellent! I found it a tad sweet, so next time I may cut back on the white sugar.

I used Haralson  Apples(crisp & tart) that being the only change I made. Next time however,  I will cut back the cinnamon as I thought it was a bit too much. Otherwise, my very picky self and family loved it.

The cranberry apple crisp was a hit at Thanksgiving. I had left my recipe at home so I found this one to use.  I remembered from my recipe to put pats of butter on top vs mixing with topping. That works well. I think the other way would be too dry.

It was literally ok. A soggier crisp than I'm used to. After reading the reviews I kept all the same but increased the cranberries to 1 cup. Not too tart. Ate it cool. Will try the leftover hot. Maybe a day later it's better.

This is terrific!  I utilized the recipe exactly, and only added a splash of King Arthur boiled cider in the mixture.  I also sprinkled the pecans on top of the topping, instead of mixing them in, so they were toasty and tasty.  Thanks for an easy and great recipe!

I tried this with a mixture of apples and pears instead of cranberries, since it's not cranberry season right now. I also omitted the nutmeg. This was delicious! It has became a regular when having friends over for coffee.

I've made this several times for family/friends gatherings and it turns out terrific every single time and always gets tons of compliments. I love it because it is SO easy to make. I too make extra topping and if I accidentally make too much, I just throw it in a freezer bag to use on the next one or on another dessert some other time. The only thing I change with this recipe is the serving size! Perfect "as is" in my opinion =)

but used a 9-inch round pan. Served warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Bliss!

Followed the recipe exactly and I was completely underwhelmed by this recipe (as was the rest of the family). It just didn't turn out for some reason. It was watery and unappetizing. No one even ate the leftovers. Will not make this again.

This was delicious. I made a double batch in a 9 by 13 glass dish. The apples and the cranberries with the cinnamon and nutmeg all mixed together and gooey under that nice crisp crust... AMAZING!! It was definitely a big hit. I also made a regular batch using 1/2 cup raisins instead of cranberries. Equally as good for those who do not care for cranberries.

Everything worked out as described, following recipe as written. I will modify it in just one way next time and that is to reduce the cinnamon. I use saigon cinnamon it was just too spicy and not as pleasant texture wise if it had less. I could probably use just half the amount and it would be plenty strong.

Made this at Thanksgiving and it was good, not great. Keep in mind that the cranberries make it pretty tart so this is not a sweet dessert. I created more of the topping as others suggested but it didn't seem to bake completely. Was still good with whip cream on top but not a favorite.

I LOVE this.  I was hesitant that the combination of granny smith and cranberries would be too tart, but the cinnamon and sugar balanced it out perfectly.  I doubled the crisp topping.  I made this for a Christmas Eve party at my aunt's house, and my husband dug into it while it was sitting on his lap in the car.

I LOVE apple crisp, but wanted to try something a little bit different. What could be more holiday-ish than adding cranberries? This filled the bill, but wasn't better than straight apples.

Just ok. I'm not a sugary kind of dessert fan but I think it needed a little more regular sugar. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and that did add a little more sweetness to it.

Came out great! I wanted to do this recipe for this year's Christmas holiday ('08) but didn't have the time to do it. I made this for a new years deal and it came out well. I used a bit more cranberries and sugar than the recipe calls for but it was a hit.

Everyone liked this except for me. It tasted like mulled cran-apple juice with too much spice -- the topping needed more nuts/crunch and just didn't carmelize like I thought it should -- and the overall texture was too "dusty," as though the spices didn't dissolve or where too dry. On the positive side, it was easy to make with a crank apple spiral peeler tool.

I loved the crust; thus, made more of that instead!

Had to cut down on the aomunt of cinammon to 1 tsp. I added all 3 tsp of cinnammon and it seemed overpowering so I actually washed it off the apples and only added 1 tsp instead. It was yummy served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 28x18x4 cm pan and it turned out well. I liked how the cranberries gave an extra flavor and color to the crisp.

This recipe is wonderful!  After having a craving for something with cranberries, I happened upon this delightful rendition of a fall favorite.  I doubled the recipe to include a whole bag of cranberries.  It was a smash hit with my in-laws and definately a keeper in my collection!
