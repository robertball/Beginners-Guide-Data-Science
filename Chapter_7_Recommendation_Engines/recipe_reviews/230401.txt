My family raved about this salad.  I made the dressing a day ahead so all the ingredients could "marinate" overnight.  I was rushed so skipped using the food processor.  I used one shallot instead of the onion and used my garlic press instead of chopping the shallot,  dried cranberries instead of cherries and just thoroughly whisked all the ingredients together.  Super fast and so delicious!  Thank you for sharing this top-notch recipe.

Simple, pretty and easy! I served with crab quiche and my family couldn't stop raving about the entire meal. Perfect for holiday dinners when a regular salad just won't do.

One of the best salads. Need to cut the salad ingredients in half if you are serving as a side dish. Do not skimp on the salad dressing. 
I substituted with raspberry vinaigrette and craisins as another reviewer suggested. 
Many compliments - I am from the Northwest.

Excellent!  Don't feel guilty for making something so easy.  This is a world class salad and a great show at the dinner table.  We made it for Thanksgiving.  I used Gerard's Champagne dressing.  It was light and perfectly matched so all the flavors were shining.  Dried cherries are expensive!  In this case, I think they are important to the salad.

Not sure why this is called Christmas salad, there's no reason not to make this all year round. This was SO GOOD! Made exactly as directed over mixed baby romaine, I will be making this recipe over and over again. Both hubby and I raved on this. Try it!
