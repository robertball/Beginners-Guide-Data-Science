This was REALLY good! It only makes about 1/2 cup of sauce, but I brushed it on a family pack of chicken legs and refrigerated them for about 3 hours.  I then grilled them for our dinner.  The texture was good, like barbeque sauce, rather than a marinade, so it stuck to the meat.  The next time I make this, which will be soon, I will double or triple the recipe, but NOT use quite as much black pepper. I changed two things out of necessity, I used light olive oil, and 1/2 t. ground ginger instead of fresh ginger root.

Great recipe. I marinated pork tenderloin for 4 hours and then put them on the grill. My husband agrees that it is a keeper. I used Madras chili powder for a bit of heat.

Awesome.  Didn't have any wine, so I ignored that and used the rest.  So good.  Doubled the recipe, and it was perfect.

I was pretty skeptical about this one b/c it seems to have a lot going on, but I had some pork chops and wanted to do something low carb, so I decided to give this a try.  I didn't have any corn syrup, so I just added a tiny bit of agave nectar, but kept the recipe the same other than that.  I let marinate on my boneless chops for probably 3+ hrs, and we both loved them.  Will try again on chicken.

This is a rather thick marinade. I used it on chicken and then my husband cooked it on the grill, or over-cooked rather and the flavor was kind of burnt off. What I did taste of it was very good. I would recommend not using this marinade if you are going to cook your meat on the grill or else you can double it to make enough to use for basting as it cooks which I probably should of done.

I spotted this recipe on the Buzz yesterday and decided to give it a try.  I made the full recipe for just two skinless boneless chicken breast halves.  I marinated the chicken in half and reserved the other half for basting.  The amounts of the wine, peanut butter and corn syrup were so negligible, I was somewhat skeptical about the outcome.  But it worked!  We really enjoyed this and I would make it again!  Thank you Adam Banfield!

I have used this recipe several times.  It's a favorite in my house!  I have followed it exactly as well as made adjustments if I didn't have certain ingredients.  If I don't have white wine, I used chicken broth.  If I don't have wine or chicken broth I just skipped that ingredient.  I have used fresh garlic and onions at times too.  We have used it on chicken and pork chops.  It's really great on both!  When I have been short on time and the meat has only marinated for less than an hour, it turns out fine.  Of course, the longer I've marinated it, the better it is!  Definitely a keeper.

What a terrific marinade!  I loved the thai-inspired flavors in this.  Nice and thick, it coated my boneless pork chops beautifully after a 12 hour marinade.  I made exactly as written with a small exception, I used honey in place of the corn syrup.  Hubs grilled these to perfection, so moist and flavorful.  Great recipe, and a definite do-over.

I did not add the p-nut butter and it was great. I served 3 other people and they all loved it. It made the meat so tender and my husband grilled it.

A bold flavored marinade with a peppery kick, especially useful for low-n-slow grilled chicken thighs (later used in peanut noodles).  As prepared, the marinade could have used a bit more acid for my taste, so I just squeeze in some lime juice.  Thanks - Adam- for the recipe.

I found this marinade to be bland without much taste even after I marinated the chicken for 24 hours! One friend tried it and liked it, but this friend doesn't even like black pepper so it still didn't say much aboout this recipe!

Fantastic sauce!  We used this on boneless center cut pork chops, which we then grilled.  It was so flavorful.  I didn't have worcestershire sauce, so I replaced it with fusion sauce (an asian mariande that smells of black licorice).  Perfect!

we loved it--- if you are not a black pepper fan - cut the black pepper in half--- i had a pound and a half of chicken tenders- cut in half-- so big chunks-- i let them swim i a ziploc with the marinade a couple of hours-- dumped it all in a huge skillet-- cooked on medium-high -when the chicken was just done -about 10 minutes-i sat it aside on a saucer-- added about a cup of water and reduced by half-- dumped in a bag of frozen asian broccoli blend &  a can of drained each- baby corn and sliced water chestnuts- and a handful of frozen green peas-- when veggies were cooked-about 10 minutes- added the chicken back in- added a mixture of 1/2 cup water- 1 TBLS cornstarch- 2 TBLS teriyaki sauce-(not really needed)- i wanted to make sure i had sauce for the white rice that was the bed for this dish-- so cooking and serving  about a half an hour-- great weeknite meal-- cannot wait to try this on pork- thanks for a great recipe:-)

This was awesome! I made the recipe exactly as written. I used half of it to marinade 2 pork loin chops and used the other half as stir fry sauce on Chinese noodles with veggies. We all loved it. the pork chops were so juicy and flavourful. This is going to be a regular in our house!

Very good flavor, but the recipe isn't written as a marinade. I had 5 thin chicken breasts and I doubled the recipe. It barely covered them. So you must either double or triple the recipe. This marinade is very sweet.

The best marinade I've ever made. I had no barbecue sauce so I used heinz 57; I used brown sugar Karo corn syrup, only used 1/2 t black pepper and 1/2 t chili powder (due to sensitive stomachs in my family). I marinated chicken strips to use in Chicken Katsu (on this site), and they were delicious. Next time I will use regular breasts and grill them. The marinade itself smells addictive--the peanut butter gives such a nice texture--and the flavor is just right--not too strong, not too sweet. Great recipe Adam.

A Winner! I keep forgetting to rate this. I tripled this recipe and marinated a big, sliced, pork loin in this overnight. Served this with rice and veggies. Thanks for a neat marinade. We can't wait to try this on chicken!

Very tasty!  I didn't have white wine nor corn syrup, so I substituted red wine and honey, respectively.  Little effort for great taste!

I made a few changes: used vindaloo curry paste and bone in chicken drumsticks. Loved the flavours. Rich and yummy. Next time I’ll use curry powder. Will absolutely make again.

This marinade is a family favorite! With so many ingredients it takes some time to put together, so I multiply it and keep some in the fridge in a mason jar.  It keeps for at least several weeks.  One reviewer said they subbed honey for the corn syrup, which I will try this time. It is very peppery, but we love it!

With all the different flavors and the good reviews, I was hoping this was going to be great but it was just ok. I'm not sure if it was the corn syrup or what, but even though I had the grill on low it got pretty burnt. I let it marinate a full 24- hours and the ginger flavor overwhelmed the other flavors. I don't think I'll make it again.

Marinated a pork tenderloin for about an hour. I didn't have any  chili powder so I used a dash cayenne pepper and a squirt of sriracha. Nice little kick without being over powering.

This recipe was fantastic! We made it for my husband's whole family, and they loved it. It does have just a little heat. Thank you!

A lot of ingredients that usually aren't together.  As I was making this I was wondering how it all would come together.  I tried it, it was ok, won't make again.  I tried it on chicken.
