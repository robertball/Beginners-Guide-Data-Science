This is a great recipe!  My family loved it!  Better than store-bought "Eatmore".  I used a Pampered Chef Stoneware bar pan.  Sprayed a little bit of canola oil on the pan, and it worked great.  Nothing stuck on the pan and it cut easily.  The only thing I did differently was use crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy.

Very good, just warm them a little before eating or else they are quite hard.

These are very similar to the no bake cookie recipes on here.  These were not too sweet and very easy to prepare.  Thankx for sharing.

Not so great. Sorry, but I have to agree with another rating on here that states that these taste kind of bland. I didn't follow the recipe to a T because I had no peanuts.. so I just increased my oatmeal by 1/2cup and put in 3/4 c. of coconut... I don't think that should have made any difference in how they tasted... but I'm still going with bland. I will stick with no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies next time, made with cocoa instead of chips. Also... I would definately not boil this for 5 minutes like it says.. I was at a minute when it started scorching, even though I was stirring constantly. I added a tablespoon of butter to get it to stop scorching but pulled it off after only boiling a minute and a half.. and that was at less than medium heat. Will not make these again.

My husband and I love this recipe. It is a bit chewy, but we're into that. The first time I made them I used the exact recipe. The 2nd time, I cut the corn syrup down to 1/2 cup and the chocolate chips down to 1 cup. Everything else stayed the same. This made them more oaty and hopefully a little more healthy! : )

its a good recipe, very easy and tasty.  But I personally thought it was a little too sweet, then again i didnt have any corn syrup and substituted it with honey.  The honey over-powered the taste of the peanut butter, next time i think I'll use more peanut butter and less corn syrup/honey

I was not too impressed.  They did not have too much flavor in my opinion, but I like that it uses peanuts and oats (pantry items I keep handy).  I am going to eat them, don't get me wrong, but I probably won't make them again.  I also was not able to cut them.  It was like trying to saw a rubber door mat!  They aren't hard, but chewy like the name says, so I tore off pieces instead.

These aren't anything like candy.  They taste more like a chocolate granola bar.  I would not make these again, there are other granola bar type recipes I like much better.
