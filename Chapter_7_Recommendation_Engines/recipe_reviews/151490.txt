Maybe this isnt a fair review cuz I changed a lot.  This was a last minute recipe I decided to make.  I didnt have a graham crust so I used a regular crust, and I have homemade jam, so I used that, and I didnt have cool whip, so I used real whipped whipping cream (no sugar added). These changes should have made the pie LESS sweet....but it wasn't I still found it EXTREMELY sweet.  I've had a lot of compliments on it though, others enjoyed it!

This recipe is great. I used a 12 oz tub of whipped topping whip instead of 16 oz and it was perfect.

I tried this pie last night!  O M G!!  First off I used regular refrigerated pie crusts since that is what I had on hand.  I also had about a pound of fresh strawberries, which I chopped with my chopper.  But, and this is the real killer... this recipe just screamed at me to add cream cheese.  So I Did!!  I added an 8 ounce brick of softened cream cheese to the condensed milk and blended them with a hand mixer.  I also used my own homemade strawberry jam.  Whatever you decide to use in yours this recipe is awesome, and so easy.  Make the night before and you are good to go.  I think it would be amazing with blueberries and jam, too.
