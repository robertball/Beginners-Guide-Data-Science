Simple recipe to make and easy to tweak as I added green peppers and mushrooms as well. However, I cooked the pork too long on low (9hrs) since I left it while I was at work and it became shredded pork. Also, I was surprised at how much liquid remained after cooking for 8 hours on low. I didn't add both cans of chicken stock and I wouldn't recommend to either. I ended up shredding the pork and then cutting up the cooked vegetables into smaller pieces and made a pork stew. Add a little bit more seasoning (garlic salt, steak seasoning) and worchester sauce when I reheat it and it was delicious.

I'm very pleased with this recipe. It is good old meat-and-potatoes fare made simple and delicious. I prepared everything the night before, and marinated the pork overnight. To use ingredients I had on hand, I substituted 1 tsp each of dried thyme and cilantro instead of the fresh, and 1 tbsp of fresh marjoram instead of the dried. I used a 1.5 lb bag of mini potatoes, no cutting required. Four hours later, the meat was perfectly cooked and moist, and the potatoes were nice and tender, not mushy. The roast looked very appealing thanks to the searing. While it was cooking, I took four Mackintosh apples I had in the fridge and cooked them down into a quick apple sauce and served it with the pork. Delicious! I would definitely use this recipe again for a small pork roast. Thanks for the recipe.

I made no changes in the recipe. The meat was tender and well seasoned. I will make this dish again.

I added the marinade to the chicken broth and it came out pretty good. I used the liquid to make gravy which came out nice.  My family enjoyed it.

A nice easy recipe that will surely be a go-to for us since we generally have all of these ingredients home. We liked the spice combination (left out lime juice because hubby isn't a fan). No chicken stock home so we used beef stock instead and came out fine. Nothing better than a flavorful and simple crock pot recipe!

We loved it.  It is just the two of us so we had more than one meal.  Hubby says it’s a keeper.

A very easy recipe and and a useful one for summer when the slow cooker doesn’t heat the kitchen up!
I did marinade the pork for longer than called for - 2 days in all and it was fine. 
I liked the flavor and the added veggies were a nice touch. 
Would make again.

I followed the recipe and my family didn't care for it. I felt it lacked flavor and was dry.

Very blah but tender. I ended up seasoning with garlic powder, pepper and seasoned salt. Much better.

Made it exactly as written.  I used red potatoes and I am glad I did as at four hours the dinner was done - the meat was overcooked, the potatoes were overdone and not enough carrots.  If I make it again, I will add one or two carrots, again use red potatoes as they seem to keep their texture longer than other types, and cook on medium for six hours.

I used miss Dash for seasoning and didn't marinate with wine.  Was very good.
