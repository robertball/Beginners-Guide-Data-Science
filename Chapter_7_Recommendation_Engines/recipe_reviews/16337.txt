Great recipe!  Make sure to add the broth slowly to get the texture you like.  I only used 2 1/2 cans, because we like it a little more firm.  Also, I added a can of cream of chicken soup, it gave it a creamier consistency. (And I "kicked up" the garlic by doubling it, and added a hint of thyme, oregano, and sage.)  Excellent!!

Incredible Flavors! I used fresh Portabellos and dried Shitakes and Porcini mushrooms (soaked them in warm water before cooking). I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I cooked the mushroom/vegetable mixture the night before and refrigerated it. Then an hour before dinner I reheated the mushroom mixture and then continued the recipe. I used bread stuffing with the seasonings already mixed in. I only used about 2 cans of broth. Absolutely the best stuffing we have ever had!

Made this recipe for thanksgiving and it was a huge mistake.  After spending the money to buy all those mushrooms because I love mushroom only to dump the whole thing in the trash.  The recipe ask for too much broth only if I knew I would have reduce it.  The end result did not look like stuffing and didn't put it out for us to eat because it was too upsetting.  The taste was there but it was just too soggy.

This was a hit!  I wanted to try a new stuffing for Christmas and we love mushrooms.  My husband added some cooked chicken and dry cornbread with already seasoned bread stuffing.  Turned out great!!  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious. The only changes I made was to use vegetable broth for my vegetarian guest and I did use all the broth stated in the recipe, but I also used a 16oz bag of stuffing instead of the 12oz called for. It was the first thing gone from the table!

This was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving table! I only used two cans of Campbell's chicken broth, and I added a few extra Shiitake and Crimini mushrooms. Absolutely wonderful!!

This was awesome!  I read the reviews and reduced the chicken broth and added 2 tsp of sage. I had 3 helpings.

I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and stuffing so obviously this was a perfect dish.  I did use less broth as suggested by others.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I had only a 1/2 cup leftover.  Wish I had more to enjoy the next day with Turkey Leftovers.

I really liked this stuffing. The stuffing mix I ended up using was the cornbread style and it worked very well. In addition to portabella mushrooms, I had some extra black trumpet mushrooms and chanterelles on hand so I tossed those in as well. I can't wait to make a leftover sandwich with this!

I wanted to try a new stuffing this holiday season and decided to try this recipe. I am glad I did. All of the guests raved about the stuffing. It will become a family tradition at our house!

This is a fairly straightforward recipe that doesn't involve too many ingredients, which I liked. I love all the mushrooms! I agree with other reviewers though: only use 2 cans of broth (I actually used a whole boxed broth - 32 ounces). Very good.

Good stuffing, a little salty and a little heavy on the mushrooms.  Next time I might tone it down a bit.
