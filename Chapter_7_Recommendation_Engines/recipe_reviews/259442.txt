While waiting on the peppers, I decided to grill my corn so that it would have a nice char on it but that was the only change I made. If you have time, I recommend doing this. It adds a whole other dimension of flavor. I really liked the creme fraiche this one called for instead of the typical mayo like you see in others. This is good and is one I would make again.
