I made it as described.  It's probably the best almond flour pizza crust I've had.  They're kind of like a pastry crust but this one holds together very well.  My husband will like this as he loves a crispy crust; I'm still in search of the impossible doughy GF crust.

I used garlic salt and Italian seasoning in the pizza dough.  Then while it was cooking I  cut up mushrooms, red and yellow small peppers, a few olives and a few sliced tomatoes cut into pieces.  After the pizza was done, I took it out and added my cut up veggies, threw back in over for like 10-15 minutes and it was perfect!
