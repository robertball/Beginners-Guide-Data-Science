If you make this exactly as it is in the recipe it will be very spicy!  I used a t. of chili powder, a t. of red pepper flakes, and no green chili peppers, and it was still pretty spicy.  (I guess that would depend on how hot your salsa is too.)  This recipe was SOOOO good though, it's nice that you can just change it to your liking if it is too spicy!  Next time I will do what I did this time, but just leave out the red pepper flakes and I think that will do it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this chili.  It has a nice smoky flavor thanks to the barbeque sauce and the chipotles. (I didn't have chipotle barbeques sauce so I used regular bbq and a tablespoon of chopped chopotle peppers.)  I entered it into Weight Watchers to check the points...only 4 points per serving!  It's very filling and well worth the many ingredients!

This is amazing. Couldn't even wait for it to cook an hour! Used Jack Daniels Spicy Original BBQ sauce, MILD salsa, and fresh cilantro. Did not use red pepper flakes, green chiles or corn and only 1/2 c green pepper and it was just the way we like it - a little hot and spicy but not too. Will use again and again.

What a terrific low-fat, low-cal recipe!  This is really good stuff, and yes, it does have a firey finish.  I made in the slow cooker by browning the turkey, garlic, onion, and peppers, and then just placed everything in the slow cooker for about 10 hours.  I tasted after about 5 hours, a tad on the sweet side for me, so I added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and an extra pinch of salt.  This smelled so good cooking!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe, Kate.  The only thing missing were the extra calories!

Fantastic recipe!! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy barbecue sauce and threw in some chipotle tobasco sauce. Omitted the green pepper (didn't have any) and used a whole red pepper. Halved the red pepper & chili powder to a tsp. each and achieved just the right spiciness for my liking. Omitted the cilantro (I hate it) and added some fresh chopped parsley instead. Will definitely be making again, thanks!

Excellent!! I used a crockpot and let it simmer for a few hours. I didn't have cumin and it was still wonderful; also eased up on the red pepper since I don't like a lot of heat.

Very GOOD chili.  I used all green pepper and it was still very colorful.  I think the bbq sauce is a key ingredient and I used Sweet Baby Rays--Hioney chipotle.  Yum!  As others have said it is VERY spicy and if you don't like sour cream in your chili you may want to decrease the red pepper flakes.

Absolutely wonderful!  It is important to use less spice though if you don't like it too hot.  I didn't change hardly anything and it turned out perfectly for me and my husband.

We have made this recipe several times with many variations based on what's in the fridge and it is fabulous each time.  We serve it on pasta or a baked potato with a little shredded cheese on top.

This is the best chili I have ever made, and I have tried lots! It is always a big hit.  I follow the recipe fairly closely, except I tone down anything that makes it hotter (i.e. I use original BBQ sauce).  It it never fails!!

This is the first recipe I have rated- and it is really very good. I'm not a chili lover- but I really enjoyed this. Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and followed the recipe very closely. Co-workers loved it. Froze some in small containers- freezes well- to use over nachos and rice. Excellent.

This was amazing and SO beautiful with the different peppers and the corn.  The recipe as written would be very spicy, but I decreased some of the spices and it was great!

5 stars with some changes to the recipe. This is an excellent base for a different spin on turkey chili!
Instead of a can of corn, I used kidney beans, as my spouse doesn't like canned corn and the texture of the beans were great. 
Instead of 1 cup of bbq sauce, a 1/2 cup was used and I ofcourse made sure it had no high-fructose corn syrup in it as this ingredient is not waistline-friendly. 
Didn't have any cilantro in any form on hand, and also out of ground cumin, nor the green chilies. I can't eat black beans so those were omitted. Also used celery salt and salt
With all these substitutions and changes, this was a 5 star chili! My husband raved and the baby raved!!! TY!

I absolutely loved this recipe! So simple to make and such a great meal for a cold night. As other said, it was pretty spicy. I don't like too much heat so I cut the crushed red pepper and chilies in half, and it was still too spicy for me! Next time I might cut the red pepper out all together. Also I might try cutting the BBQ sauce in half next time to reduce the sodium, and try getting reduced sodium beans. The BBQ sauce adds great flavor but I'm not sure a whole cup is necessary.  It is low calorie but very high in salt! I think I might even try adding other vegetable like zuccini and spinach.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was absolutely incredible. Don't be fooled when you first put everything in your crockpot (which is what I used). It looks way too thick, and since I like more brothy chili, I was concerned. After a few hours of simmering and stirring, it turned out incredible. It was even better the longer it was in the fridge. Will definitely make again when the temperature drops!

Very flavorful but too barbeque-y for my taste for a chili. Next time will make with less to no BBQ sauce. Thanks!

I didn't have some key ingredients to make our usual chili, so I tried this one. I put it in the crockpot and the only thing I did differently was omit the chili flakes because many reviews stated it was too spicy. I didn't think it was spicy at all, so I ended up adding in the chili flakes after tasting it. I thought it was pretty bland and also too sweet! My husband will eat it because he will eat almost anything, but I won't be making this again.**I changed my rating from a 2 to a 1. My husband heated up a bowl when he got home and eventhough I said he will eat almost anything, he couldn't even eat the bowl he made. He thought it was way too sweet and I ended up dumping the rest!

This is the best chili I have ever had and my friends agree as well.  I've made it 7 times now and keep getting requests.  A few tips:  Add a few stalks of chopped up celery during the first step and use Jack Daniels "Master Blend" BBQ.  Instead of sour cream, I use plain yogurt.  SO YUMMY!!!

This is an amazing recipe.  This is flavorful, full of vegetables, and the spice level is perfect.  Be sure to simmer for a long while otherwise it is too runny.

This dish was easy to make and delicious. I substituted 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp mustard, and 1/2 tsp honey in place of the BBQ sauce. A nice harry and tasty meal!

Loved this recipe!!! So very delicious! Minor changes I made due to what I had on hand...didn't have cilantro, used an extra can of great northern beans, as well as black beans and used "open pit" bbq. Followed recipe otherwise for a delicious, crock pot chili that my Husband and I absoloutely loved!!!

I made this for my family exactly as is but topped with low fat sour cream and scallions and me and my husband and four children loved it. Great Recipe our new go to for chili night.

Bonus: It's alot healthier than traditionally prepared chili and in our opinion tastier :)

Delicious! Instead of chipotle BBQ sauce, I used Jack Daniel's Original No.7 sauce and tossed in some chopped chipotle peppers. I also used a whole red pepper, a whole green pepper, and half of an onion. Although it was a bit spicy, I will definitely make this again!

Ground turkey is by far more flavourful then ground beef. However, dried coriander does not come close to freshly chopped coriander and added towards the end, which really intensifies the flavour. Like another reviewer mentioned, if you don't have Chipole barbecue sauce you can always subsitute a few chopped Chipoles. This is a great recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site. A great hearty meal that is perfect for a cold night. I followed the directions exactly and the chili comes out nice and spicy, just the way I like it. I served the chili over a baked potato and added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese. My family couldn't get enough.

This chili is SO delicious!! It was not that spicy to me; Then again, for me, the spicier the better. I even added hot sauce to it. I put 3/4 cup of BBQ sauce instead of 1 whole cup because people were saying it was a little sweet. Also, I added garbanzo beans which went perfectly with this recipe. Other than that I did everything exactly the same. I will be making this again and again in the future. My boyfriend loved it, too.

I absolutely love this recipe! I make it for my husband and I all the time, and he's a picky eater. He can't get enough. The only thing I do differently is add hot NM green chile instead of canned green chiles, but I've made it both ways and it was fantastic.

Left out the tablespoon of chilli powder.  Would have made it too hot.  Didn't have any green chillies, so used some pickled jalapenos.  Perfect and delicious.  Definitely a keeper.  Served in bowls with garlic bread.  YUM!!!

I forgot the red bells, but don't think that matters much. This recipe is too BBQ sauce-y for my liking, and is simultaneously too sweet and has too much heat for a full meal. Definitely add/keep the sour cream to cut the heat. And did I miss the corn in the directions? No worries; I just added them in with the beans, etc. I also prefer something more along the lines of traditional chili, and this isn't it. Glad I made it, but highly unlikely I'll be making this again.

This chili was very tasty and very easy to make.  I didn't have chipotle bbq sause on hand so I used regular bbq and I had a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce so I cut a couple of those up and tossed them in, I also didn't have a red bell pepper but I don't think I missed having it in there.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

It was a cool day Monday morning and I wanted to find a good soup for dinner that I could put in the crockpot.  When low and behold in lisa’s morning post …..”What’s for dinner?” Saveur suggested this chili.  I had everything except the ground turkey, but I did have ground venison.  I mixed this up in the morning and plugged in the crockpot before leaving for school.  The smell coming from the house at the end of the day was wonderful and I knew my family was going to love it …….and they did.  I normally do not eat venison, but with all the other flavors goin’ on in the chili, it killed that venison taste for me.  I really liked the chipotle barbeque sauce in this recipe.  I served this with ‘Basil, Roasted Peppers and Monterey Jack Cornbread’ another great AR recipe.

We loved this recipe. I wanted something different for dinner and this was it! I did not include the BBQ sauce (started with a tablespoon but didnt like the sweetness) so instead added 1/2cup water and fresh cilantro as well. Let it cook down for a little over an hour and served it over rice. I also made fried plantains on the side! Yummy!

This recipe is so good and easy.  I didn't include corn but other than that the only other modification I made was using a different barbecue sauce- Sweet Baby Ray's.  I think 3/4 cup would be sufficient for next time.  It wasn't too spicy, either.  Delicious!

Too spicy, too sweet for everybody.  I did not agree.  I really loved it. Perhaps I picked a sweet salsa r BBQ sauce. I would make it again for sure.  Change the salsa and BBQ sauce just a bit.

I made this recipe last night, and it was delicious!  It was a little bit sweet (with the BBQ sauce) but had a surprising kick of spice after the first few bites!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle BBQ sauce (it was the only kind I could find, and I like that brand).  I made the recipe exactly as listed, and wouldn't make any changes! I will make this many times to come.

I thought this was pretty good and with the modifications I made to the recipe I probably would only give it 4 stars. I assume if I would have had the chipotle bbq sauce I would have liked it better, hence the 5 star rating.  Also did not have the bell peppers on hand and that probably would have made it better as well.  I used regular bbq sauce and added chipotle chili powder.  The bbq sauce I used was too sweet for my taste.  I added an extra can of tomatoes since I had an extra person to feed at the last minute.  Because of that I served the chili over spaghetti noodles to make it go further.  I was afraid we wouldn't have enough for my big family (big eaters).  However, because I served it over pasta we had enough to have two more rounds of leftovers.  I will probably make this again, but I would want to use the right bbq sauce and add the bell peppers.  Fam couldn't believe it was ground turkey.  Planning to slide that in on them more and more for our health's sake.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn’t have salsa on hand so I used an extra can of dice tomatoes and some extra water. My husband doesn’t like things too spicy so I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1-tsp. It was still pretty spicy. Great recipe that I will be making often.

I was a bit hesitant to make this given I don’t typically use ingredients like BBQ sauce in chili, but both myself and my family really loved this. The balance of spicy was great. Definitely will be making again.

I have made this Chili multiple times and each time I  adjust the heat to whomever I will be eating with. I  always use all fresh vegetables never can except for the beans. I  use chipotle BBQ the first time, but have not use it since. My family loves it when I  make it. This Chili also goes great with a fresh salad. I knew it was great when my Hrandson told his Mom that she should try this it's great.

I made this chili for a work chili contest and won first prize against some fierce competition!  Not only did it rate first in the taste area but also on presentation as it has a colorful look.  I made it again at home and put less chili powder and crushed red peppers as it was a little spicy for me -- but very good!   Normally after I eat chili I feel too full and sluggish but not with this chili -- flavorful, filling and light.

I loved it and shared this with my sister. She said it was awesome.  No changes . I made it in my instant pot! So no need to simmer for 3 hours!  :)

This was excellent! The only change I made was I didn't have Chipotle BBQ Sauce. I used a half a can of tomato sauce, and a added some Gates BBQ sauce (Gates is the only BBQ sauce allowed in our house). Once all the ingredients were added, it didn't have much flavor to it. But, after simmering for a little over an hour, the flavors really came together.

All kinds of yummy. A little spicy for the kiddos, but it was free for them. I frankensteined it a little with another recipe. I added a large can of tomato paste (wife likes thick chili) and a packet of hot cocoa mix plus a squirt of Hershey's syrup. The adults pretty much fought for leftovers.

Really filling and delicious. I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand (it's about to snow here and I wasn't feeling a trip to the store) and it was still great. I used cooked leftover turkey that I diced up, one green bell pepper (no red on hand), and thick and spicy BBQ sauce with some chipotle pepper added in. I was a bit skeptical when I added the ingredients as it was REALLY thick, but it cooked down nicely to what I consider to be a perfect chili consistency. I served mine with avocado, sour cream, cheese and crackers. That definitely made it a lot less healthy, but I wanted that comfort food on a cold night and at least it was better calorie wise than regular chili. Awesome recipe and this is going into the rotation for sure. Thank you OP for a great, versatile recipe!

My new favorite chili recipe! Flavorful and healthy - a combination that's often hard to achieve.  I cut WAY back on the chili powder (1 teaspoon instead of 1/4 cup) and my  wife still found it a bit too spicy for her taste. Added more beans and some sour cream to turn down the heat. That did the trick. It was a homerun. I will definitely be making this again.

I agree that this is too sweet.  I didn't add some of the ingredients to make it spicier as the barbeque sauce made it hot enough.  However, I believe it is the barbeque sauce that is also making it so sweet.  I'd probably put 1/4 of it in next time.  I liked the fresh salsa in there though,  I would prefer to add more salsa instead of all the barbeque sauce.

Loved the flavor but a bit too spicy for me. The chipotle flavor gives this a nice twist. Will cut back on the red pepper flakes  next time.

Delicious!  Although I am not too sure how this is waistline friendly since one cup of barbecue sauce is so high in sugar and calories, even when it's divided into portions.  But anyway - this was amazing.  I doubled the amount of beans (I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of red kidney beans) as I like a thicker chili.  I also added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I left out the cilantro (not a fan).  My boyfriend and I both loved it!

It a family favorite now. Though I usually omit the red pepper flakes and use left over turkey instead of ground. It's one of those I go back to again and again for turkey left overs!

I used shredded leftover turkey (from Thanksgiving) instead of ground turkey.   I simmered the turkey and BBQ sauce separately for 30-45 minutes before adding in it.  Otherwise followed the directions as written.

I  love this recipe but it was a bit spicy for the rest of the family.  Next time I'll probably cut back on the chili powder, etc.

Sorry ... Way too sweet!!!   - 1 CUP of BBQ sauce is a lot and really overwhelms the flavor of what would be decent otherwise.  And although I like spicy ... I backed off the 1 T each of Chili powder AND Red Pepper flakes to half of that.  I ended up dumping in second can of tomatoes in but it was still too sweet.  Might have helped had it been noted what variety BBQ sauce was used.  I would make it again but dramatically cut the BBQ or instead add that smokey/chipotle flavor another way.

I love the concept of this chili, but didn't follow it completely.  I omitted the bell peppers and corn,  and in place of Chipotle bbq sauce, I used orginal Head Country sauce and added about 4 whole chopped chopped Chipotle peppers. I love spicy chili so I used 2 7oz cans of green chilies and a cup of habanero salsa. I also added a can of pinto beans along with the black beans. The flavor is unique, but wonderful. A great combination of smokey and spicy. I will be adding this to my recipe file.

It was incredibly delicious!! I could only find honey chipotle BBQ sauce so it made it a little sweeter but was nicely balanced with the chilies and pepper - I went a little less on those and it was spicy enough for me. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Phew, this was really HOT! I even cut back some of the heat using only 2 pinches of red pepper flakes, a mild bbq sauce, and left out the green chilis! I liked how thick it was and all the pretty colors. I did reduce the salt some and added about a cup of water due to the lack of liquid. I just couldnt get past the odd tart bite and heat. I would re-consider the amount of lime juice and acidity of bbq sauce used. I have a heat lover, in the house, so hopefully the rest will be eaten.

My daughter and I made this chili for the second time in two weeks. This chili has amazing flavors. I love the chipotle barbecue sauce! We did not add the corn and we used chopped fresh tomatoes and thought it a little too spicy the first time so left out the red pepper flakes. Still had plenty of kick! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is very good. HOWEVER the chipotle bbq sauce gives it a tangy/sweet flavor like you would expect in a Brunswick Stew. If you dont like the sweet factor in your chili (My husband does not) I made the other half useing Herdez (or other Hispanic brand) Chipotle Salsa Mild.. gives you all the smokey flvor but no sweet! :) Thanks...

LOVE this recipe!  But yes, as others have said, it is extremely spicy.  I only use about 1/4 can of chillies, MILD salsa, and just a pinch of red pepper flakes and chilli powder.  I also use half a can of black beans and half a can of red kidney beans.  I usually make a double recipe in the crock pot and then freeze some.  My family loves it.

This was a yummy chili!  The only changes I made were not using chipotle BBQ sauce, I thought it would be too spicy, and I didn't add cilantro as my family doesn't like it.  I made it in the morning and put it in a crock pot to simmer all day.  I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce, LaVictoria mild salsa, and instead of using plain diced tomatoes I used S&W diced tomatoes with chilies.  If you follow the directions exactly it would be pretty spicy.  I used half the amount of red pepper flakes and the chili still had a pretty good kick.  I think the next time I'm going to try it without the lime juice.  It's just a small amount but it gives it a slightly tart taste.

This was fantastic! Based on other reviews, I did slightly reduce the spice and sweetness. I used mild salsa and 2/3 of a cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  The flavor was fantastic and the spice was perfect for me.  In the future, I will cut the hot spices in half as the family enjoyed the flavor, but not the heat.

I really loved this, but next time I'm going to change a few things. A whole cup of BBQ sauce was a bit much...the flavor overwhelmed everything else. Of course I only simmered for an hour, not 3. I would also next time use mild sauce instead of medium just because I'm kind of a lightweight when it comes to spicy. Since you use a whole cup of that too, it made things about too spicy.

This recipe is sweet because of the barbecue sauce.  Check the label for the corn syrup.  Sugar is addictive and in almost everything that is prepared for you, not to mention all those icky preservatives.  Instead you could add chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to get the heat and smokiness. Found in probably most grocery stores in the Mexican food section.

This chili was flavorful and easy to make.  I cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 of a tablespoon instead of the tablespoon that was called for and I'd say it was "medium hot".  I also used Sweet Baby Ray Honey BBQ sauce and added a half teaspoon of chipotle chili powder since I didn't have chipotle BBQ sauce, and omitted the cilantro since I didn't have that as well.  I simmered it covered for two and a half hours and it was just the right consistency for me.  Not soupy at all but nice and thick.  I also made the recipe from this site for Golden Sweet Cornbread to go with it and it was very good tool.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this recipe for the past year or so and it always comes out different but great. When I have any veggies in my fridge that are about to go bad I'll just make this chili and add them to the recipe. I've been doing the South Beach diet on and off for the past 6 months and this recipe is great because you can make it with basically no carbs. I rarely use the lemon juice that the recipe calls for and it still tastes great to me.

This was really yummy! I loved it. I made a few small changes. I used only 1 tsp crushed red pepper and 1 tsp chili powder. Also, I used a little bit more salt, and used some garlic salt. Also, I took Saveur631's advice and added 2 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar. It offset some of the sweetness of the BBQ. Also, I cooked this in a crock pot. Really good. Though, next time I think I might try half cup BBQ sauce instead of the full cup. Will definitely be making this over again! Thank you (:

This is by far the best chili I have ever eaten or made! I can't say enough wonderful things about it. After reading the reviews I understood it was a hotter chili so I used a mild salsa, a sweet and spicy barbecue, and edited back the red pepper flakes. The end result was a medium heat chili that is to die for!

A super duper nice change to regular chilli! I don't really like kidney beans but love black beans so this is perfect. I used just regular hot peppers as I didn't have canned chillies but it was super good. We love spicy so it was perfect and the sour cream sure changes the flavor. Definately will make again!

I was looking for a flavorful healthy chili, and that is exactly what this recipe delivers.  I have already made this recipe twice.  The first time I wanted it real spicy so instead of using the bell peppers I used 2 poblano chiles and 1 cerrano chile.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle BBQ Sauce and used a medium salsa.  It absolutely knocked my socks off!!!  Yummy!!!  NOTE: If you want to make it really spicy, definitely let the flavors marry for the whole hour.   I also used Italian seasoned ground turkey both times.  The 2nd time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, but since I didn't have any sour cream... I used a healthy dollop of ricotta cheese, which added a real nice creamy texture.  SUPER YUMMY!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I loved this recipe.  I like to add celery and mushrooms and use a little less bbq sauce but either way it's a keeper.  The sour cream is a must.

This was a great recipe and the flavors really came together very well. I didn't think it was too spicy at all but I think spice is one of those things that depending on your taste everyone will rate differently. My husband also liked it very much and went for seconds.   I only made a few changes but that was to adjust it to my own taste. I added 2 cloves of garlic, added 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes (thought that 14.5 wasn't enough), I used 1/4 cup chipotle salsa (very hot stuff) since I didn't have the barbeque sauce and I also used kidney beans since I didn't have any black beans.

I loved this chili, so hearty and good. It is definitely on the sweeter side but is very good. Just let those who are expecting spicy chili that it's not before you serve it. I'll be making this again very soon. Thank you!

Wow!!! I was expecting something bland and, well, diet tasting.  Boy was this great!  I read the other reviews and didn't want mine too spicy so I omitted the chopped green chilies and the red pepper flakes.  I used a tablespoon of fresh copped paste cilantro b/c the store didn't have fresh (it was wonderful).  Like another reviewer said, I couldn't wait an hour and kept dipping in as it was simmering!  Going in my favorites list for sure!!! Thanks!

It tastes good, and like other reviewers have mentioned, it is very spicy. I am having a hard time understanding the five stars, though. I found this chili to be overwhelmingly BBQ flavored. It def. is unlike chili and more like a turkey-veggie mix with BBQ smothered over the top. I am pretty disappointed, and probably won't make it again.

Really good, really easy. I didn't have chipotle bbq so I took some mesquite and added some ground chipotle. Also used fresh chopped cilantro instead of dried. May mince a habanero for extra kick next time.

Yummy - make sure that you like the bbq sauce's taste, because that's a huge part of the flavor.  Very spicy, serve with sour cream and a lot of water! :)
