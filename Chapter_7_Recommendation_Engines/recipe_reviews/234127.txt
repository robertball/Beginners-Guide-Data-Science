Wow, this was so easy and tasted amazing! I left out the sage, as I didn't have any. I served it with toasted sesame seeds. The brie gives it a really unique flavor. Everybody loved it.

I made this soup tonight for dinner. It was super simple to prepare and tasted lovely. The only thing I modified was I left out the cream to save on calories and I use coconut oil instead of canola oil. I will definitely make this one again.
