I adjusted this recipe to use 6 pounds of shrimp for a crowd.  I bought cooked, peeled small salad shrimp and they were just the right size.  Since I was feeding a crowd of Mexican's for my husband's birthday I really wanted this to turn out perfect.  Everyone loved it, I got great reviews.  The horseradish was my "secret ingredient", but I didn't use as much as the recipe called for.  I served this coktel de camaron in pretty see through glasses with tostadas and saltines.  Also, don't add the avocado until serving time, slice it up and lay it on top.

Wonderful!  I substituted ketchup and tomato clam juice for SPICY V8 juice and straight clam juice.  I also added a TON of finely chopped fresh celery and double the avacato (adding it right at serving time)so we could use crackers for dipping. This was such a huge hit that my wife took the leftovers to her staff meeting the next day and now I have to send it weekly to her staff meeting. Thank you for the fantastic recipe.

I think Ms. Zeigler nailed this recipe. I've had this dish in Mexico and all over Texas and this recipe is right on with one exception, it needs a finely minced jalapeno (to taste). I also add mroe avocado, but that's not the way you usually get it in the restaurants.

This was really good...although I did make a few additions.  I added cucumber and a whole lot more clamato juice.  I also added a splash of tequila for flavor.  Turned out great.

The flavor was good but like others, I felt it was too soupy. I used Bill's Seasoned Ketchup (from this site) & decreased the hot sauce accordingly. 
I have had this before at a restaurant & think I'll play around w/ it some & see if I can't get it closer to what I was expecting. Next time,I think I'll add just a bit of tequila ( I know that was in the one I had @ the rsetaurant) & maybe decrease the clamato (the clam juice in it adds lots of flavor so I won't omit it entirely) & add a bit of tomato paste to thicken things up some. Might be nice w/ some diced tomatoes too.

Eat this for breakfast on Sunday mornings, it is the BEST cure for a hangover!! I omit the avocado because I don't care for it and also the horseradish because it is not part of Mexican cuisine; although I imagine it is quite good for those who like horseradish. Serve it with a spoon in those tall parfait glasses for ice cream because it is meant to be eaten like a soup and not a dip.

Excellent Party appetizer.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I served this to my husband and some guests who were completely skeptical.  They all came back begging for seconds.  Looks great served in large Margarita glasses with fresh shrimp (not the marinated ones) hanging off the rim.

This was absolutely awesome! I love shrimp and mexican, and had this cold shrimp avacado soup at an "authentic" mexican resteraunt a while back and have wanted to try to make something similar. This was very close if not better. I used large 16 shrimp per pound black tiger shrimp and it was well worth the $! Serve chilled over tortilla chips, saltines or alone. Thank you for my new favorite recipe!

Really good.  My husband and I have enjoyed this recipe several times already this summer since it makes such a tasty, chilled treat.  I used spicy V8 juice, too, and  added a diced tomato and cucumber. Thanks for this recipe!!

What a refreshing summer light meal. I doubled the recipe except for the shrimp. I cooked my shrimp in a stock pot and used the broth from that instead of clam juice, along with regular V-8...no Clam juice cocktail at my grocery store. Since this was going to be our dinner for the night I wanted it to be a bit more like a Gazpacho, so I added a seeded minced cucumber, tomato and jalape√±o. I especially liked the cucumber flavor added. I let it marinate in the refrigerator for about five hours and then added the avocado when I served it. We had saltine crackers along with it. This was so great tasting, I loved the horseradish flavor. Thanks Sarah for the recipe and this one is a keeper in our household.

As written, this recipe is good. I personally have a problem usually with canned juices and all the unnatural ingredients that go into them. Also preparing horseradish can produce such different degrees of "heat" that I can't see how this can be the same each time without specifying which prepared horseradish. I made it exactly as written twice - the second time to be certain I hadn't mucked up the first time. I then made it a few more times trying different combinations and not using canned or prepared stuff like ketchup. It was a bit better to MY taste with natural products but I never managed to get a "Wow" taste. Maybe when I have a few more hours to experiment, I will try this again, but so far my 3 hours of trials have not substantially improved it.

Amazing!  I made this for my New Year's Eve supper...the whole supper, not my appy!  My only real change was to use chopped green onions rather than minced red ones.  I didn't have red, and my other onions on hand are crazy strong, so I went for the green ones.   Since it was only me tonight, I have leftovers for tomorrow and I couldn't be happier about that!

This is a FABULOUS hot weather meal!  I halved the recipe. Used spicy V8 juice and used more than was called for.  I used one pound of shrimp - added more cilantro, garlic onion, lime juice and hot pepper sauce than called for.  I also added finely chopped peeled cucumbers which really add to the refreshing texture of this dish.  I put in one avocado when I made it (and let it sit overnight) and then added  another one when serving.  Served it with a lime wedge, cilantro sprig and tortilla chips and fresh cantaloupe.

Had this for dinner last night, and as other reviewers stated, the cucumbers ARE A MUST. It was fantastic. Only draw back is that the wife does not like cilantro and I think it is a flavor must. Guess I will have to make it two different batches from now on.

Try adding just a little bit of orange soda. This is what I was told by a waitress at a Mexican restaurant was in this dish. Excellent!

Loooove this recipe! We slice jalepeno peppers in rings (so that those who can't handle the spice can take them out). We also use a spicy bloody mary mix,  tequila, and corona! Great summer treat...the longer it sits, the better it gets:) Not that it ever lasts that long!

I read all the comments, and many used frozen shrimp, so I too decided to go that route.  Let just say, that I wish I hadn‚Äôt!  The overall taste was not bad, and the flavors/ingredients did blend well, but it still seem like something was missing.  The only thing extra I did was adding some finely chopped cucumber and tomato, and I did add the avocado at the time of serving (everything else as written).  I will not make again as is, but with some tweaking, sure.  For starters, freshly prepared & cooled shrimp is a definite must for this recipe!  Trust me, it was difficult getting past that chewy ‚Äúfrozen shrimp‚Äù texture!  Cutting the onions back a little, adding cucumber and tomato, and for that ingredient that I thought was missing, maybe just a tad bit of actual bottled cocktail sauce or even just some more ketchup?  I will say that the presentation is really nice.  I use sundae parfait glasses, layering the avocado/shrimp, and then topping with fresh avocado, lime, and cilantro.  Severed with crackers too (another definitely must do!).

This recipe is a solid 5!!!! If you want to make it a 10, Skip the hot sauce and the horseradish and add Celery, Jalapenos and Serrano peppers minced fine and this recipe gets a 10!!!. Also use Heinz ketchup it adds a lot of flavor to it.

This is an excellent recipe!  I also add some chopped cucumber.  If everything is chopped well enough it also makes an excellent summertime chilled soup.  Mahalo!

Fabulous! I've been looking for this recipe for a long time!  My additions were finely chopped jalepeno, celery and cukecumber (seeds removed). I also added hot sauce.  I actually put all of the "broth" ingredients in a 2 qt pitcher with a good seal and gave it a few shakes to blend. Then I dropped in the shrimp and shook gently to coat them and put it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors bloom. I only had to chop the advocado and a bit more cilantro to top at serving time. For those who think it's too "soupy"... that's the way it's supposed to be! Go to your local Mexican restaurant and order it to check. You can actually serve it as a cold shrimp soup if you chop the shrimp a bit. My "novio" is from the Mexican state of Coahuila and he said it was just like home!

That's it! This is what I have been looking for! This is one of my favorite things to eat when I can find it. I am so glad to now be able to make it at home. I used the Cholula hot sauce and regular V-8 because I had it at home already. Will try the tomato and clam juice next time. I think the Chili sauce that someone mentioned would make it a little sweeter, which I wouldnt mind so much. I have had it that way before. Thank you for posting your recipe. Im a happy girl now.

Good. I would have preferred it spicier. It may have been the horseradish I used, but the sauce turned out a weird pink color that didn't look very appetizing. Didn't add the avocado until ready to serve. Also, I used medium shrimp. If I make again, I'll use the larger shrimp.

It was delicious just how my mom makes it. I did add 1 tbs of tomatoe paste, and more ketchup (1/3 cup), I omitted the horseradish since i don't remember my mom adding that. I boiled my shrimp with lemon zest, 3 bay leafs, salt and jalapenos. I also left the shrimp cocktail in the fridge overnight.

Wow - this recipe is delicious and a healthy appetizer for lots of guests!  My dad makes a wonderful traditional shrimp cocktail..and I have done a lot of traveling through Latin America - so this recipe was a perfect combination of traditions!  You can serve with tortilla chips or crackers.  I definitely recommend fresh shrimp over frozen shrimp.

Try buying raw shrimp, boiling it and using the leftover juices for the broth!

This was a great recipe -- just like the shrimp cocktails we had in Cabo San Lucas. Great with chips!

This is an awesome recipe!  I always use large boiled shrimp (chopped in half) & lots of red & green onion & avocado. I omit the horseradish though.  The key is to use a whole cup of chopped cilantro to make it taste authentic.  I usually add lump crabmeat as well.  There are NEVER any leftovers!

I have been making a similiar recipe for several years now..I add cucumber (2 lg peeled and chopped) and tomatoes (2-3 chopped).I also add a pinch of cayenne and don't take it too easy on the hot pepper sauce or salt. the avocados (2)I add before serving. Thanks sahoney for the horseradish addition!
It was what I was looking for!

I made this recipe with tiger prawns and for the hot pepper sauce I used Valentina, which can be found in the Mexican section in most grocery stores in California.  I forgot to buy red onions so I ended up using the yellow onions and it came out very good!  I fried tortillas to serve with the shrimp cocktail.

I love shrimp cocktail but I do mine a little different sometimes. I blend jalape√±os with fresh lime juice, cilantro, fresh garlic, and half a cucumber, with some Clamato juice in a blender. It gives it the spicy kick I like. I chop some cucumbers, red onion, avocado, and celery add it to the shrimp then add the blend I made add some salt and a little pepper for taste. I serve and garnish with some sliced avocado with some peppermint leaves on top of it in a bowl. Every one loves it and always asking me to make it for them =)

Very easy and yummy!  I used 1 cup V8 and 1/4 clam juice because I didn't have Clamato.  (My husband also bought minced clams because he wasn't sure what to get.  I wonder what I'll do with those.)  Anyway, I'm packing this for lunches.  Yummy!

Just made this for a Memorial Day weekend party and this was the hit of the party.. I had read many of the reviews and followed some of the recommendations for minor changes.  I doubled the avocado, added a finely minced, seeded, hot house cucumber, and maybe a tad more lime juice than in the original. But really, the heart of this recipe is BOMB! The sauce ingredients are spot on.  We will make this again and again,  Thank You!

Really good, I also subbed the ketchup for spicy V8, could have used even more spice.  This was even better the next day so making it the night before would work really well.

I have made this many, many times and it is delicious. And it makes a generous amount so I usually half it. The recipe is great as-is, but sometimes I add in diced tomatoes, black beans or corn. Very refreshing in the summertime!

THIS WAS GREAT! I didn't have any tomato juice or clam juice so I just used a plain seafood stock. I used a can of southwestern ro-tel  that  I  blended  up  finely  in the blender and I did not have any horseradish but it was still a GREAT dish! !!!

OMG- So good.  I was looking for something to make with shrimp for supper one hot day and this was suggested.  I didn't have all the ingredients a the time but it stayed on my mind until I finally made it a couple of days ago!  So delish made exactly as stated and everyone LOVED it.  In fact I am making it again today.  Refreshing light and great for hot weather.

This is pretty close to authentic.  I'd omit the horseradish & ketchup.  It's usually served in a large goblet or parfait glass, the bottom of the glass filled about 1/3 up with fresh pico de gallo, then shrimp & avocado.  It's also usually served with more fresh key lime wedges, saltine crackers(not tortilla chips!), and a bottle of hot sauce.  The sauce is not supposed to be thick like a cocktail sauce--it should be like Clamato.  You can vary this using raw oysters, octopus, or a combo of all three.

This is great....almost like being in Puerto Vallarta.  I also added chopped cucumbers to make it more authentic.  If you've ever tried a shrimp cocktail in Mexico you'll note they are all very soupy.  They serve it in a fishbowl type glass with saltine crackers. This one comes pretty close to the real deal.  Thanks!!!!

This was excellent. The horseradish was a nice change from the red ketchup mixture thats usually used. I added more hot sauce and left the onions kinda chunky. Also, I added the avacado right before serving so they wouldn't be mushy. Serves up nicely in a sundae glass with saltines and/or tostadas, and cut limes on the side. Definitly a keeper thanks for the recipe!

Just as a mention, this is traditionally a soup in & out of Mexico (& Spain), which is why many have commented it is very "soupy" in texture.  I really like this recipe, in fact have been using another (A/R site) almost exactly the same (except no avocados).  In a pinch, I've used "Mrs. T's Bloody Mary Mix" which I drink by the gallon, so it's always in my pantry.  I serve it in Margarita glasses, with a soup tureen on table for those who want more!  Since I don't care for salad shrimp (too fishy, even when rinsed), I use larger uncooked shrimp, then peel, devein, remove tail & steam lightly.  (Why ANYONE leaves the tails on in any dish is my personal bug, cause I hate to have to have to put my fingers in my dinner  !!!).  I then slice into one or two pieces.  But, that's just me, because this dish is one I use only when I entertain, since shrimp are high in cholesterol, & somewhat beyond my regular budget.  BTW, the very 
tail is the tastiest part of the shrimp.  My DH (late) taught me to pinch JUST below the tail and pull.  It takes a little 
(muy poco) practice, but I never fail any more, so it will work for you too, I hope.  HTH!!!      Blessings!

I didn't want mine to be soupy so I used a 6 oz. can tomato paste and a bottle of clam juice. I also added a few sliced green onions and 2 chopped jalape√±os. Perfect consistency and flavor. I will make this again and again.

This makes an awesome hot Summer night supper when you serve it with a salad and some toasty garlic bread. I do not add the ketchup or horseradish, but use chili sauce which has both in it. It is also a fantastic recipe for suprise guests you might want to treat. I like to serve tamales and a bit of hot Bengal chutney along with it when I want something heartier.

Surprisingly delicious.   I really didn't know what to expect with this one but it turned out great.  I forgot to add the avocado at the end- oh well... it was wonderful.. Definitely great on a cracker!  Will make again and again.

Magnificent! 
The flavors and taste of this exquisite Mexican dish will take your breath away!
I grew up eating Mexican food all my life and my mother would make this a few times a year. It was a delicacy. This here recipe is almost an exact replica of my mom's with a few minor adjustments. 
I left out the horseradish and hot sauce, it is flavorful enough without these additions. Also, since we are a small family, I only used 1 lb. of shrimp and 1 cup of Clamato juice. Kept everything else the same although I was very genourous with the cilantro because we love that stuff!  
Refridgerated for about 4 hours and frosted some pretty glasses in the freezer for a few hours. Served it up with saltines and sliced limes. It was gone in no time at all!
Divine!

Perfect!!!  Just like Mexico. I have had the same with shrimp, crab, and octopus. Typical Mexican is to serve with tortilla chips and limes.

LOVED this - cut the recipe in half and it served three for dinner.  Added a little more clamato juice and the entire avocado.  Big hit - this will become a regular at our house!

Very good recipe. I added cucumber and diced tomato, but left out the horseradish, as it is not widely used in authentic mexican cooking. Try this recipe both ways and see for yourself. Great job Ms. Zeigler!

I have made this a number of times as written and it is very good.  This last time I made it I substituted cocktail sauce for the ketchup and skipped the hot pepper sauce.  It was even better!!

We had mexican food for my son's birthday (his most favorite!) and I decided to make this for a crowd.  I made about 1 3/4-2 lbs. of shrimp and I had a good amount left over.  I added a bit more lime juice and used all V8 b/c my food store did not have clamato and I was pressed for time.  I thought that the cilantro really made it tasty.  I also liked the "kick" of the horseradish.  A great little twist on an old time classic.  Delish!

This was excellent! I did have to tone it down a bit with more ketchup but only beacuse my store only carried the extra hot horeseradish. I added more cilantro due to personal preference but this was outstanding on the traditional saltine crackers. Thank you so much for this recipe and I already have "orders" to make 4 more batches for friends.

I made this dish for a Mexican theme dinner party last night.  everyone really enjoyed it but I think it needed a little more of a kick, but that was my fault because I had some guests who do not like spicy food so I decreased the hot sauce to 1/2 teaspoon.  My changes were: added some green pepper, added 1/2 cuke, chopped celery and a Roma tomato.  I think next time I will try the Spicy V8 juice to see if it has a little more flavor.

I'm mexican and let me tell you this is an excellent recipe, but you definately need to add 1 cucumber and 1 lg.tomato, and 3c. of clamato instead of 1(personal preference)Also horseradish is not part of mexican cuisine but it adds a wonderfull flavor to the dish, I served this individually with saltine crackers, lime slices and hot sauce on the side. Thx. Sara!

I have made this with tomato-clam juice mix, with V-8 spicy hot, and with a vegetable juice cocktail similar to V-8. They've all been "Gimme some more" good. What a recipe!  Just be certain to let them marinate - the longer the better - adds so much to the taste.  Thank you very much, Sarah.  You wouldn't be the Sarah with the moose stew recipe --- would you ? Am editing this 14 Jan 2009.  I tried  this using a VERY spicy Bloody Mary mix. WoW! WoW!  Listen to me :  WARNING - This recipe is addictive !!!

This is a good recipe to start. If you want to make it like the Mexican resturants: leave out horseradish, ketsup and hot sauce, use white or yellow onion instead of red, and add cucumber and salt. I made it this way for a party and everyone loved it, it was gone so fast and people were in the kitchen asking if there was any more left.

This recipe is awesome, everyone loves it. You need to make it the day before so the flavors can blend. I used salad sized shrimp or bay shrimp, and served with restraunt tortilla chips (not the bagged stuff, that's ).  I think the key is to just adjust the flavors to what you like, meaning more onion if you like it, ect. I add more clamato & definitely more hot sauce. Things like that will make all the difference in how you like this recipe!

I really liked this recipe although I added more red onion, cilatro, added tomatoes, green onions.  I will adjust the amount of garlic and horseradish next time to about 1/2 of what the recipe calls for or less, too harsh for my taste.  Added a bit more salt too.  Excellent taste otherwise reminded me of my favaorite Mexican joint in L.A.

Hubby and I loved this!  It's similar to a Mexican restaurant dish we get that we both really like.  I cut it in half for just the two of us and cut back on the horseradish just a bit even though we both like things spicy.  I'm glad I did; next time I would cut the horseradish in half and add more hot sauce instead.  That seems more authentic.  I'll also add cucumber and double the avocado.  The flavor of this was so good!  I served it with tortilla chips as suggested and that was a nice complement.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fabulous.  I didn't change a thing, and after tasting it, I don't want to change a thing!  Perfect as an item on an appetizer buffet, or frankly, I could just call it dinner!

Excellent.  Don't expect the usual heavy thick sauce.  The recipe is perfect as is but allows for additions such as chopped red pepper, diced tomatos, and diced cucumber.  The horseradish may not be traditional but it sure tastes good.  I purchased raw shrimp and boiled as opposed to precooked frozen.  Had about a cup left over which stored beautifully for the nex day.  I was surprised that the lime juice didn't affect the texture of the  shrimp.  I am guessing this could be made a day ahead.  Thanks for a mighty fine recipe, Ms. Sarah!

Mexican Shrimp cocktail was always what I ordered on family nights out in Mexico (we lived just across the border in El Paso), so this qualifies as comfort food for me. Sampling this in many cities as a working professional traveling throughout the US always left me disappointed; most were too sickeningly sweet. So I decided to try and make it at home, not expecting great results. This was the first recipe I tried, and am amazed at how similar it is to my  favorite childhood treat. I did leave out the avocado and added more lime and cilantro to suit my tastes. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I'm made this recipe many time, but I have modified it a bit.  I add more ketchup (to thicken) and and use a Tomato and shrimp juice cocktail.  I combine the cocktail juice, ketchup, horseradish, hot pepper sauce, onion and garlic ahead of time to let the flavors blend together.  A few hours before serving, I add the remining ingredients along diced serano chilies and chopped cucumber.  I top it off with chopped Avocado just before serving  This makes a great hearty appertizer for a party.  I serve mine a large bowl or trifle dish.  Everytime I serve this dish, i always get asked for the recipe.

Made this for a neighborhood cookout.  To keep it cold serve it in a double bowl.  The smaller bowl with the shrimp setting on a bed of ice in the larger bowl.  This kept it cold and cold is key for this dish.  Other things; don't skimp or substitute the fresh ingredients. Also give it time to marinate before you serve it.  2-3 hours  in the frig  is not a suggestion, but an ingredient. Since I was serving to a crowd I cut back on the heat a little and the horseradish.  Sneak up on the heat with fresh peppers.  Don't dump them in all at once. Horseradish and fresh peppers are ingredients that can vary in strength so adjust them as needed. It went fast and there were multiple requests for the recipe.  This is great at a cookout on a hot day.  Be sure to have bowls and spoons set out and a ladle in the pot so people know that it is a soup and not a marinade for the shrimp.

If you use frozen shrimp, don't let it sit overnight, the texture gets weird.

Added chopped tomato, seedless cucumber and celery. Used sriracha (rooster) sauce instead of horseradish and V8+clamato. SOOOO GOOD!!!!

Incredible recipe!! I made the recipe exactly as shown and it was a huge hit for my mexican dinner party ... everyone wanted to drink the left over sauce. I think next time I'll make some sort of corn bread to serve with it to soak up some of the delicious sauce. I would also experiment with adding some vodka too!

I followed the recipe exactly when I made this for my New Year's Eve party.  It was wonderful when I first threw it together (I couldn't resist a taste!). But after marinating in the frig for 3 hours as directed, I'm not sure what happened because the flavor changed. I'm afraid nobody at the party, including myself, cared for it very much.

I am originally from Texas and couldn't find anyone that could make this authentic recipe in the Hampton Roads area.  I am so glad this turned out just like they make it in my favorite restaurant in Central Texas.  Its so light and delicious... I highly recommend this recipe:)

This is a great recipe for potlucks and gatherings.  I do add more avocado and I also add two stalks of celery chopped, a half of a peeled, seeded & diced cucumber, and some chopped tomato.  One time I used one seeded and chopped jalapeno.  It was really good, but a little spicy.   I generally use sriracha (Rooster Sauce) and NO horseradish to spice it up.  Too many people don't care for horseradish so I decided that I'd omit it for potlucks.  I serve it with chips like a salsa.  Crowd pleaser for sure and it can easily be tinkered with depending on what you like.  I like it with about 4 avocados myself.  Shrimp and avocado are so great together and the other veggies add volume and crunch but don't change the flavor.  This makes quite a decent size bowl.

very good but if you are making for a large crowd skip the cilantro. some people (OK, ME) can't stand the stuff... if you want a laugh, google: "I hate cilantro"..... it really does taste like soap! think 10% of the population.

Good Recipe. There are many varations of Mexican Shrimp Cocktail. As for not being Mexican there is no standard when it comes to this recipe. In fact, I don't know how south of the border one reviewer has been, but I had this same recipe in Acapolco and no one complained. I guess you better add a chili pepper to it and have a shot of Silver Patron!!

Got rave reviews from party guests.    A super easy recipe to throw together.  I made the night before my party....used small precooked shrimp from the seafood counter and like others I used spicy V-8 instead of clamto juice, ommited the horseradish and added some diced cucmber.  Added the fresh avacado right before serving.  YUMMY!

This dish was excellent! I didn't use as much shrimp like the recipe asked for because I was making it for just two people, and changed it just a little bit. I will make this dish over and over again! Excellent flavors!

This was great, I made it for my tailgate. You might want to spice it up with a little jalapeno and maybe a cucumber for something extra.

Added 2 diced seeded tomatoes and 1 cucumber. Also took the advice of others and added the avocado before serving. I also added more cilantro because I really like it. This was so good-perfect on a hot and humid day-it was so nice to toss it all together and never have to turn on the oven!

Very good.  I don't know that the horseradish is very traditional, and it seemed weird so I left it out.  Made that way, I thought this recipe was right on.  **DON'T add the avocado until just before serving or it turns your whole cocktail a really UGLY sludge color!

I made this as directed. Then tasted it and it needed a few adjustments for our tastes. I added more garlic,a fresh chopped jalepeno and more avacado.

Skipped the clamato and ketchup, in favor of spicy V8. Found that the horseradish, was a little much, so added more spicy V8 and lime  A restaurant in our neighborhood makes this kind of shrimp cocktail and, with the above adjustments, the recipe actually comes pretty close!

This is pretty much the same recipe I had sitting on the beach in Rosarito.  It's supposed to be soupy.  That's the way they serve shrimp cocktail in mexico.

Good job pinning it down.  My only changes were for convenience and diet.

I'm on the South Beach diet.  I omitted the ketchup and used frozen bagged shrimp.  I put it in a food storage container , put that in the cooler and brought it to the beach.

This is an awesome summer snack!

This is a family favorite that my Dad always makes for us.  This recipe has all the ingredients he uses so now I don't have to call him up everytime I make it. My only suggestion is to use Tapatio for the hot sauce (I am the only Mexican in the world who does NOT 
like Tapatio but for this recipe I highly recommend it) - slowly add it to your own spice level.

Can you say authentic Tex-Mex? This is the real stuff. This is my husband's review since I don't eat shrimp. Our teen loved it too but he asked for more spice. My husband said I outdid myself on this one! Thanks my family loved this.

Excellent! I omitted the horseradish and used the spicy ketchup in addition to tabasco sauce. Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't add the avocado until I was ready to serve the cocktail. Also, to avoid a "soupy" cocktail, I reduced the tomato and clam juice to about 2/3 what the recipe called for. I love shrimp cocktail, and this was no exception!!

I hate to be in the minority but I thought this was bland.  I bought hot horseradish, added extra cilantro, and still neither my husband nor I thought it had any flavor.  I ended up adding extra spicy cocktail sauce and that helped make it worth the expensive ingredients.  I don't usually like spicy food, so I wasn't trying to get heat, just flavor which for me was lacking.  Maybe it was the brands I used, but I probably won't make it again based on the cost and the outcome.  Thanks for the recipe though-now I feel a little better about paying for it when I go out.

instead of tomato and clam juice and ketchup, I use Louisiana Brand Cocktail sauce and campbell tomato juice. I tried all different kinds of cocktail sauce, Louisiana Brand taste the best. It's heaven. All my friends love it. I also add a few dash of Worcestershire sauce for a little more flavor.

I actually didn't get to try this one for myself because it was gone before I could get a shrimp! Everone loved this dish. Many said it tasted like ceviche. I had to omit the cilantro because my market was out. Everything else stayed the same, except I included a sprinkling of cumin (I love cumin!). A great Superbowl dish.

Made it step by step and didn't come out like I thought it would have. I shouldn't have added the horseradish. It gave it a weird flavor. Had to add a lot more clam juice to cover the taste of it.

Thank you!  I used this as the basis and modified (I like the term "i frankensteined it") to my taste.  I added a whole cucumber (cubed), 4 jalapenos (diced), an extra tablespoon of lime juice, an extra tablespoon of Tabasco (I didn't have horseradish), 1 cup diced tomato, and 6 stalks of celery (diced- a little more than a cup).  Of course, my Clamato had been all used up at the last party, so I had to resort to Spicy V8 (which was awesome!!), and a tad bit more ketchup. After I Frankensteined my creation ... IT WAS AWESOME!!

Excellent! Amazing!!! Don't be afraid of the horseradish! It's great in this recipe. I used Tapatio hot sauce, because everytime I have eaten Mexican shrimp cocktail at restaurants it was accompanied by Tapatio. I also used only 1 lb of shrimp, which I marinated in lemon/lime juice for two hours before adding to the mixture. Like other reviewers I added:
1 cucumber (seeded) (a must add to this recipe!)
2 roma tomatoes (seeded)
Note- several reviewers gave this recipe a low rating because they said it was too soupy. But true Mexican shrimp cocktail is a "cold soup" reminiscent of a shrimp ceviche. This recipe is truly worth 5 stars!!

Sorry, this wasn't what we were looking for.  The horseradish did not taste good in it at all for us.  My husband shuddered and we had to rinse off all the sauce and start over. :(

Incredible!!! Just as good if not better than the ones served here on the border at some of the best Mexican restaurants.  I did add cucumber and extra clamato because we like them with a lot of juice. I can't wait to make this for our next big party.

I have been making a recipe similar to this, but I add Pico de Gio.  We like it more chunky and not so soupy.  The horseradish is a must!  I will have to try it with the tequila. Yummy Yummy!!!

i love this recipe traditional cocktail sauce is too thick and very sweet, tastes like canned tomato sauce. But this is magnificent.  I used spicy v8 juice and added fresh jalapenos and added cucumbers..perfect for summer.

Excellent recipe. I add a diced cucumber, a couple of stalks of celery and some extra hot sauce. I also cook my shrimp in mexican beer the night before, drain and chill in the fridge overnight. Great for a HOT summer night.

This recipe is excellent. My husband was so impressed and happy he almost ate the whole darn thing in one setting lol. I followed the directions and then I continued adding more horseradish, lemon juice, onion and cilantro  for stronger taste, to my liking. I will definitely continue on making this. Especially in the hot summer months. :)

I loved this cocktail,my husband who hates cilantro ate his without it in. He did not like it. I think it had to do with the cilantro  not being in it.

This was very yummy! Added tomato and cucumber as suggested by other reviewers. Also wanted to use spicy v8 instead of tomato/clam but couldn't find it for some reason, so used plain v8 instead and it still tasted great. We will definitely be having this alot from now on!

This is very close to a "ceviche" where raw seafood such as shrimp is used and marinated in a lime-based concoction.  The acids "cook" the fish after only a few hours marinade.  It's delicious, but this looks very good - with a Texas twist.  What a fun dish and I've saved it for an upcoming picnic that I'm attending this summer.  Thanks for sharing Sarah!

I made this for my book club party and it was delicious!  Instead of Clamato, I added about 2/3 can of spicy V8 juice.  I also omitted the avocado.  I chopped the large shrimp into thirds and placed the cocktail into endive leaves.  It was the best shrimp cocktail I've had!

It was sensational, except we substituted V8 Spicy hot juice instead of tomato clam... the hot V8 was just enough, worth a try!!  We have used V8 spicy for chili and other things, and really really good in this recipe!!!

THE BEST hangover cure in the world. I fell in love with Mexican seafood cocktails years ago while living in San Diego. It's perfectly fine to add octopus, abalone, crab claw meat, whatever you want really. I also add diced cucumber to mine and omit the horseradish. Thanks a million Sarah, this is awesome!!!

This is my new #1 recipe for summer. It is so good. I made some adjustments to adapt the recipe to my personal tastes (mainly less clamato, more ketchup, more cilantro) and I served it over a bed of shredded lettuce since that is what I am accustomed to. I used a good amount of Cholula for the hot sauce and I thought it worked very well. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Sarah!

This is a great recipe and tastes better than most I have had in popular restaurants.  I used plain tomato juice instead of the type with clam juice.  I also added chopped cucumber and chopped tomatoes.

This is EXACTLY the recipe I was searching for.  I had something similar at a restaurant and wanted to make it ever since.  I used Clamato and cut the amount down to 1 cup but kept all other measurements the same.  Don't skimp on the horseradish.  I thought it might end up too spicy so I was conservative but ended up adding the full amount.  It gives it a great taste and just the right amount of kick.  I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and then mixed in the avocado just before serving.  I omitted the Tobasco but had the bottle out for people to add to their taste.  It's really cute to serve these at a party in little plastic champagne glasses (the round type).

I made this recipe for a work function and it was a huge hit! I just used 1 lb. of shrimp but kept the other ingredients the same.  I comes very close to the Shrimp Cocktail that is served at a local Mexican Seafood restaurant.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe that would duplicate the coctele de camarones I had in Patzcuaro, and this looked to be the closest of any I found on the Web, although I'm not sure those in Patz use horseradish. While the sauce in Patz tended to be clearer, the flavor was very close. And if it is not an exact duplicate, it is delicious. I served it to friends who wanted an authentic Mexican meal, and they loved it too. My husband and I had leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was even better.

I've made this twice including for a recipe group use to Gourmet.  Everyone thought it was excellent.  It is more of a soup than a cocktail.  Served with scoops as a dip on a hot day and it was devoured by all.  I like things sweet so I added more catsup to mine.

This was okay, it didn't have as much flavour as I like and it was too "soupy".  I will make it again, but with more spices and seasonings and I will probably use tomato sauce to thicken it instead of the cocktail juice.  Also, it needs at least double the avocado - it added a unique and very good different flavour!

Really really good.  Actually, it reminded me of etoufee sauce such as they hafe in New Orleans.  I served it in individual shot glasses with a few shrimp and some sauce in each. Also, I added some tomato paste to thicken it up and pureed it in the food processor which gave it a more blended flavor.

This was excellent but too much horseradish for us. I had to add more juices to tone it down. After that it was great.

Loved it, made some last night with fresh from the coast shrimp. Had to clean it before cooking, but hey it was well worth the wait. It is so much better if you fix the night before & eat the next day. Wow.  I did not add the hot sauce, I used jalapenos in place of hot sauce. V8 clamato & tomato juice worked for me. This definitely  will be a regular fix for me. Thanks!!

I made this recipe for a party and more specifically for our pescatarian friend who would be joining us. She loved it and everyone else at the party enjoyed it too. I made minor adjustments I added cucumber to freshen it up a bit and did not add the horseradish. It was a hit the first time around so the next time I doubled the recipe for more people to enjoy. It is now a party staple at our house. A really great recipe!

People Raved about it!  I added 3 Roma  tomatoes diced, two extra avocadoes two generous squeezes of Siracha, and a Tsp of pepper.  I accidentally bought a Horseradish Aioli , instead of just straight horseradish, which I found a little sweet, so I  used a horseradish mustard that I happened to have, mixed with the horseradish aioli.  With the help of the Siracha, and the pepper, it helped to tone down the sweetness that the aioli brought.  I served it with chips, and it was a big hit.  I will definitely be making it again!

Have made this a few times now, it‚Äôs become a family favorite and is a huge hit at every get together. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I prepared the Avacados/cucumbers/jalape√±os and set the aside for people to add it  themselves so that the avocados don‚Äôt get mushy.

I add diced celery, crab, scallops and use spicy clamato.  A bit of tequila is a nice addition for the grown ups.  Usually. I just have the bottle on the counter and let people add what they may. The horseradish can also be added as one likes.  This has been a family favorite for years!

I did not like this at all. I bought nice, very large shrimp and  ruined them with this awful sauce. I will revert to my classic seafood sauce enhanced by a bit of lemon zest and juice with salt and pepper. It never fails to please!

My husband is from Mexico and for the nine years we have been together, he has asked me to make "Shrimp Cocktail" for him. I have seen pictures of what it was, but never knew how to make it. All the recipes I have looked through did not come close to what he wanted. I just found this recipe and it was very similar to what my husband wanted. He said the only thing to change was leave out the horseradish sauce. He is also not a garlic fan so instead of minced garlic, I put in 2 teaspoons of garlic powder. I just got done making the recipe and my husband taste-tested it. He almost fell to the ground because of how good it was. He told me not to lose this recipe...lol. I wanted to thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!

This was really good!  A few notes - don't add the avocado until the very end.  I left out the claim juice and I used spicy V8

My husband and I loved this!! I added a small tomato and a small piece of hot pepper and put everything except the shrimp and avocado in my blender. I hit pulse a couple of times and left it a bit chunky. Then, I put the shrimp and diced avocado in the bowls and poured some of the sauce over it and let it set to meld the flavors. It was so good and my husband used corn chips to dip in the remaining sauce in his bowl. I had about 3/4 cup left of the sauce. I used it the next day over grilled chicken breast. Very good. I plan to make the base again and use it in a chicken and rice casserole.

Very good recipe.  I used Pico de Gallo in place of chopping up all the ingredients.  Did not use avocado as I am not a fan of avocado.  Added more chopped Jalapeno peppers (really like spicy).  I really enjoy the Mexican Shrimp cocktail @ our local authentic mexican restaurant and this was very similar, if not better.
I found that depending on the taste you are looking for you can add or delete ingredients.

This was so good.  I ended up adding a small cucumber and putting the avocado in right before I served it.  I fried up some corn tortillas and we ate it with that.  If you buy cooked shrimp, this dish would be super easy!

I have fixed the twice already - 5 days apart - because it was so good.  I always made sure I didn't take it all to the parties...because I wanted to finish it at home myself.  Yum yum.  I used mediums shrimp, so it can also be used as gazpacho (sp?) when I cut them in half or in thirds.

Everyone asks for the recipe ..... no way!

Thank you Sarah.

Terrific!  Followed recipe exactly & it was great...even so, after taste-testing, I decided to add one finely minced jalapeno, an extra avocado, & about 1/3 of an English cucumber (chopped).  Refreshing!  Served with saltines to enjoy the "juice" as an appetizer to our main entree, Taqueria Style Tacos - Carne Asada, by STANICKS. Thank you, Sarah!  I've been looking for a recipe similar to the appetizer served at our local Mexican restaurant!

YUM! I have made this twice in the last two weeks and am craving more! I pretty much followed the recipe although I didn't really "measure" the ingredients, just added to my taste like I generally do with these types of recipes.  The only change was instead of adding ketchup I added cocktail sauce.  It turned out great! A suggestion by a friend from Mexico would be to add a small finely chopped jalapeno...might try that next time.  Ate it with tortilla chips and saltines. Thanks for the recipe! I've found my new "party" dish for get-togethers!

This is just delicious! Great looking too, served in parfait glasses. I added cucumber, too, that I'd thinly sliced & salted the night before, to draw out the extra water. (Rinse and dry before using.)Also cooked the clamato briefly with a couple scant tsp. cornstarch so the juice wouldn't be quite so splashy. Fabulous.

Great change from regular salsa.  My husband and I make this for just about every party we have at our house.  We do eliminate the ketchup and the horseradish, we buy spicy V8 for some extra kick, and we add a can of tomato paste to thicken it up so it's not so much like a cold soup.  Overall, we love it and everyone we make it for loves it!

This is a fantastic lunch or appetizer.  And low calorie to boot!  It is soupy - it's supposed to be.  We do add diced cucumber on occasion, or more avocado. For party appetizer, serve in a martini glass. Very impressive and everyone loves it. Even better the next day IF you have any leftover. Thx for a great recipe.

I made these for a dinner party and everyone raved. I used large shrimp and cut them in thirds then added one whole to the rim of the serving dish.  I served them in small side dishes.

This recipe is good, but I, personally, don't like cold shrimp, so I steam cooked my shrimp, then added it right before serving. We also substituted V8, instead of the tomato and clam juice, and we omitted the horseradish. We also substituted the hot sauce with 1 large jalepeno pepper, chopped, and used 2 avocados and 2 tomatoes, diced.

This was good, but not what I was expecting.  It was much more runny than I had hoped.  But I liked the taste of it.
I am not sure I would make this again.

Fab first course!  Use this in combination with another recipe and found what I think is perfect. Add a chopped jalepeno, 2 peeled & seeded chopped cucumbers, another avocado, more cilantro, put lime juice directly into the mix, omit the horseradish. Very tasty! Just made it for ringing in 2008 tomorrow.

This was great.  I added chopped guacamole to mine.  My boyfriend said it was so good and he thought it was better than what he had in a restaurant.  I also added additional hot sauce to spice it up some.

We loved this.  Pretty close to what a favorite restaurant makes.  I cut out the horseradish and added jalapenos.  I also added tomato paste to thicken it up, lemon rind and Zataranis liquid shrimp boil for a kick.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful! I changed the recipe a bit, as I couldn't find the clamato juice. I chopped fresh tomatoes as well, which gave it more of a salsa consistency. Everyone loved this at my Christmas party & I will be making it again for Christmas Eve! Thanks for sharing!

Used spicy V-8 and added a red jalapeno.  I also put extra everything in it.  This recipe is so delicious.  After it sits for a few hours, the flavor is incredible.

This recipe was great, even though I forgot to add the avocado. I also had to substitute V-8 for the clam juice cocktail since I didn't have any clam juice. I am planning to make this again for another party this weekend!

I remember having this in the little fishing village of San Felipe in Baja, California Norte, Mexico in the early 1960's. It took me right back to the beach! I will definitely make it again.

Ended up adding more ketchup, a whole bunch of cilantro,  a little diced cucumber instead of avocado, and a little extra hot sauce. Think next time I might add a jalapeno for a little more kick. This definitely satisfied my craving. So tasty.

Big hit with the family.  Just a heads up if you are putting these on a grill, look out for the bacon grease hitting those flames.

This recipe is the closest I have found to what we enjoy at our favorite rmexican restaurant, I do add a cup or two of orange juice. It tastes so fresh and is not a "heavy" meal but will definitely fill you up! We serve it in a large margarita glass with mayonnaise and saltines as well as tortilla chips on our deck when weather permits.

Don't change anything unless you just want it spicier!  Great recipe, first batch went quickly so I made a double and ate off of it for a week!  Improves in the 'fridge as the flavors blend!
Excellent!

I love love love this dish!!  So easy.  I've made it numerous times and people always really like it.  One thing I changed and went back to, is the Clamato juice.  I used regular V-8 and it wasn't the same, I went back to the Clamato.  Just gives a fresher flavor somehow.

Amazing. I make it with one 12 oz. package of shrimp, and the full broth recipe to get a good amount of the soup, like gazpacho.  It is so delicious!

Looked for a recipe that mimics what I had in hometown Mexican resturant. This is the one!
I followed the directions and then added one package of frozen octopus (4). Prepared the octopus by boil cooking with seasons, drain, cut up in bite size pieces & toss on grill mat for about 5 mins. Comes out tender. Then stir octopus into cocktail.

If I made it again I would break the tails off of the shrimp for easier eating. My daughter did not this so.

Loved it!!! 

Since we were in a rush for a last minute COLD dinner on a 94 degree day, used Jumbo Shrimp, Beaver Cocktail/Horseradish sauce, lots of fresh lime, fresh lemon, cilantro and salt.   

My husband LOVED it and wants a repeat ASAP

Chilled it in the freezer for about 15 mins and about 45 mins in the fridge!  

Delish!

I left out the horseradish and the garlic. Instead of using red onion I used white onion.  It was just as delicious!

Thank you for taking me to my happy place! This was perfect for what I was looking for! I made it exactly as written with the exception of omitting the Tabasco and using one pound of shrimp. I will definitely be making this again!

I made it today and it was delicious! One step I added was to boil the shrimp shells (the shrimp meat removed) with Old Bay Seasoning until there was about  4 tablespoons of liquid left which I added to the final product. There is a lot of flavor in those shells which, in turn, gave such a good flavor to the cocktail. 

This recipe is really good and easy.

Actually I should probably give this 5 stars.  Recipe is excellent!  Needed more cilantro and garlic.  My problem was I made this for Christmas Eve and because I knew how hectic the day was going to be, I made it on the 23rd.  Shrimp were very water logged and soggy.  I had to do some last minute doctoring as most of the spices were lacking when I took it out of the fridge.  I was able to bring it back somewhat but the shrimp just weren't nice and firm.  Used expensive large shrimp.  Very disappointed.  Going to make again on same day.  Again, rating is lower because of my mistake but I wanted to warn everyone so you don't make the same mistake.

This recipe is fantastic! I was looking for seafood appetizers for Christmas for my family, and stumbled upon this gem. While on its own it is a great recipe, I was looking for a more authentic latin flavor, instead of crushed garlic I thinly sliced four garlic cloves (garlic keeps its flavorful juice better and looks more elegant in thin slices), and used regular tomato juice simmered with fajita seasoning and bay leaves, and chilled before pouring over the shrimp, cilantro leaves, diced onion and garlic. I decided against ketchup and horseradish, instead adding just a dash of cocktail sauce, and quartering a handful of cherry tomatoes in, about seven or eight, and then stirred in a bit of chili powder, cumin, sea salt, cracked pepper, basil, and oregano. To finish, I replaced lime juice with the juice of one actual lime and scraped pulp, along with the zest of the lime along with very delicately sliced avocado. Chilled overnight the flavors meld perfectly.

Just found this today and decided to make it for my dad this 4th of July weekend. 
It was super easy to make and it was a hit!
Absolutely tasty.
My brothers came over and everyone loved it and right away they asked for the recipe.

The very best shrimp cocktail. I don't even like shrimp unless it's in the form of this recipe. It's a HIT at any family party. I always add about a half to a whole cucumber, chopped, to this recipe

I made this twice already, and am starting another batch today!  I tried this dish at a street vendor in Bucarias and fell in love.  I did add the chunks of avacado like the vendor did as it gets served..  gives it that extra pop in taste and texture.

I LOVE this recipe. I cooked the shrimp on the stove with a ton of garlic and butter and put in more avacados then suggested and it turned out fantastic! I licked the bowl. That's how good it was. Thanks for the recipe.

I used Mr T's hot Bloody Mary mix for the clam-tomato juice and marinated all together overnight.  I served it in medium sized plastic cups with medium shrimp hanging on sides and celery stick standing along with a plastic spoon.  Everyone ate all of it like a gazspacho and request it all the time.

This recipe is good as is; however; I added seedless cucumbers, Pico de galo, and used 100 medium shrimp, and 1 pound of Lobster & Crab bites. Instead of using canned juices, I substituted using Motts Tomato Juice Cocktail and St. Elmo's Cocktail Sauce, giving the recipe a bit more kick and wow. While this was not my first time making this, I can admit that this recipe will has become a staple in my meal plan when serving seafood appetizers.

I really enjoyed this recipe, i didn't have any(vegan) but my boyfriend who grew up with mexican food really likes it.  He did add more ketchup and lime but over all I'm happy with the results.
Another thing I did was i bought the shrimp fresh, they didn't have heads but the process of getting them ready to cook was VERY TEDIOUS... i'm not sure if i recommend it to people ha but well worth it :)

My husband is not big on new 'recipes', but told me I can keep making this one!  I added a lot of the ingredients I saw in the reviews - tequila, celery, diced tomatoes, jalapeno & habanero peppers.  I made it extra hot, just like I knew he'd like it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't follow it exactly but used it as a quick guide. Added a few jalape√±os and diced tomatoes to give it more texture and also didn't put as much onions as the recipe calls for. Turned out great.

My husband LOVES shrimp cocktail, so I tried this one because of the ratings. Clamato is very popular here, so that's what I used.  The flavor of the sauce wasn't right & the color was not what we're served at restaurants here. I added more ketchup, then a little more. I added a little sugar. I kept tweeking it until it tasted good. The color was still not right & something was missing.

This was my first time making shrimp cocktail and I followed this recipe to the letter... well almost. I mixed in about a half bottle of a popular Mexican beer. Definitely one of the best dishes I've ever made.

I made it to the recipe the first time and it was good, but I thought it was just a touch bland.  I substituted a thick salsa for the ketchup the second time and it was amazing.  Tasted a lot like the shrimp cocktail we used to get in Puerto Penasco.  Big hit at both the parties I took it to.

I used a bit less horseradish but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Use a quality frozen cooked shrimp and you won't notice it was not freshly prepared.  It was pretty mild and just about everyone added additional hot sauce. This is one of those recipes that you either love or hate I think.  The likers in my family outweighed the haters but we'll keep looking for other recipes.

Loved it.  I made it exactly as written.  I ate it as a soup practically as I thought the nearby chips & crackers detracted from it's awesomeness.  I made it for a 2013 Super Bowl party.  I'll for sure make it again for Super Bowl 2014.

A party hit! I made a batch of this for a party over the weekend, and all of it was gone faster than anything else served. It IS a bit soupy and thin, so I added a little extra ketchup.

made this for a dinner with friends and my girlfriend's husband said I need to bring this every time I visit, everyone loved it!  I used pretty large shrimp, so I diced them up to make it more like a salsa and did add a finely minced jalapeno, we ate it with chips.  I think the jalapeno gave it a nice little fresh kick.  Great recipe!

This is fabulous!!!  I didn't need to add hotsauce, just used extra horseradish to get heat I wanted.  I also added raw oysters to mine.  My dad added vodka to his!  Very very good!

I love this recipe. It's my favorite dish to eat. Only thing I do different to spice it up is add Chelada like the kind that's used to make micheladas. I use red radish as a side sometimes as well.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It is beautiful in appearance and makes a great party dish.  Next time I will add a bit more hot sauce and horseradish, but that is a personal preference.

The taste of the horseradish is very overpowering, but other than that, I LOVED this recipe! Next time I prepare it, I will either omit it or use half of the recommended amount. I also added a lot more hot sauce, but that's just MY personal preference... Thanks for this great idea! :D

Great recipe, family was fighting over the last bits.  Only changes made was added some small bay scallops and a Jalapeno.  I used medium shrimp and they were a little too big for tortilla chips.  Would use salad shrimp for the perfect size.

I thought this recipe was amazing!   I made it for my family and they loved it! I did make a few minor adjustments. Instead of the red onion I added green onions and for the garlic instead of crushed I added minced garlic. I also doubled the hot pepper sauce (Tapatio), and also doubled the avocados and served this on tostada shells.

We enjoyed the dish and will definitely make it again.  Flavor was really good.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I added a bit more hot sauce.  

I plan to try and make a version that has fresh tomatoes in it and eliminate or reduce the clamato juice.

I'm crazy about this. I prefer less ketchup, and I would add diced tomatoes and chopped cucumber if I had them on hand.  Also, I like to make about twice as much of the liquid.

This is almost the same recipe I came up with but I also add chopped cucumber and celery. I also like to add bay shrimp and crab with the larger shrimp. It also is the basic start of my bloody marys. The clam juice really makes it.

I made this for our Fourth of July party and it was gone in minutes!! The horseradish gives it just enough depth of flavor with a little heat. Definitely will make this again.

I had this over the weekend....a nice treat on a hot day. Crowd loved it, a huge success. Prefer tomato juice only vice the clam juice combo.

It was good but I think it had just a bit too much garlic.  I added a more ketchup too.

I made this with regular tomato juice, and added more horseradish and hot sauce. Good stuff. Thanks!

Great recipe.  I added more Cilantro, 1/2 cup. Left out the horseradish. Added more Louisiana Hot Sauce.

I used salad shrimp and omitted horserdish.  This was exactly what I was looking for, thanks for sharing!

This is good but not great.  I've made it a couple times and we like it but not nearly as well as those at the Mexican restaurants in the area.

This was excellent. I did add more avocado and also chopped up the shrimp beacuse I brought it with tortilla chips as a dip for a party. The clamato gives it a yummy, unique flavor. yummmm
