I always make my baked beans from SCRATCH and my family loves them. I made this recipe and they were, in my opinion way better than the ones that take me an hour make. I will be trying these on my family this weekend.

Wasn't able to get to full pressure because Burn warning came on. Will try again and put 1 cup of water in the instant pot bowl and then put ingredients in a separate bowl on the steam rack.
