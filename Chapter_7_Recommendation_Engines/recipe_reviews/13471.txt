Thank you!  I couldn't find any at the store, so was happy to be able to just make some myself!

Followed the recipe except that I cut back on the salt by 1 tablespoon.  My sister was over for lunch when we tried it for the first time.  She raved about how good the chicken was.  What my husband did was put some of this seasoning in a small bowl and added olive oil to it.  Then he brushed some on the chicken before he grilled it.  Thanks for this great recipe, and I will definely use it again.

I had to make this because I had no poultry seasoning and it was WAY too cold to go outside with a newborn.  I had to substitute oregano and basil for the marjoram and rosemary for the same reasons. I can't wait to make this with the correct ingredients.  My hands smelled GREAT after mixing it.    I reduced the servings down to what I needed.

I made one small adjustment--I cut the salt back by half. Absolutely perfect!

I only had rubbed sage and it was plenty potent without adding crushed sage on top of it. Otherwise it was pretty tasty!

This is a great seasoning mixture.  I make a large batch and store it in tupperware.  I primarily use it on chicken as a marinade along with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and tamari (gluten free soy).  Thank you!

I cut out the 1 cup of rubbed sage completely (left in the ground sage), replaced the rubbed sage with garlic powder, celery seed & some ground mace, and scaled back the salt by 1/2 a tablespoon.   I also ran it thru a spice mill a few times & turned out perfect.
