The texture on these scones was good; soft and a little chewy. Next time I think i will use Baking powder instead of the cream of tartar which has a taste that I don't care for.

My family loves this recipe, but I make a full-fat version by cutting in 4 T. butter instead of the applesauce. When my husband takes these to work, I get a lot of requests for the recipe.

This recipe was a waste of ingredients.  
horrible scones even worse cookies.
Like rubber balls with hard crunchy outsides.
Nice flavor but horrid texture.

Quick and delicious. I didn't have cream of tartar, so I substituted 2 tsp of baking powder and eliminated the baking soda. I would also use a little less than a cup of chocolate chips next time, as it felt like there were too many for the amount of dough.

I just made a 1/2 batch because I wasn't sure how they would go over.  My husband just said they were amazing & he wished I'd made more.  They were not rubbery at all - they came out brown and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I cooked for only 13 minutes. Be sure to only use the top rack so the bottoms won't burn.

very yummy, a bit of a mixture between cookies and scones, and the dough is scrummy to eat as well

For a no-butter recipe, these were great!  I added a scant tsp of almond extract, which gave them a slightly sweet flavor and made the house smell great. I also baked them for only 10-11 minutes, as someone suggested and they turned out well.  They were good enough and easy enough that I actually made a second batch the next day so that I'd have some in the freezer.  Thanks GODGIFU for this recipe!

Cut back temp to 350 they cook better and a little over half a cup of chocolate chips is plenty, any more is too much....

I was invited to a tea part bridal shower nd needed to ring scones. I have never made them before and luckily this recipe had all the inredients that were in my pantry. I don't think they were rubbery at all as some of the other comments suggested. The only changes I made are that i sprinkled sugar to the top before baking and I only baked for 13 minutes. I made one batch for 15 minutes and they burned on the bottom. The second batch, I baked for 13 minutes and they turned out great! Very easy and tastey.

First off - this recipe is amazingly easy - I had them in the oven in under 10 minutes start to finish.  I personally thought it needed a little something that's why I gave it 4/5, maybe a little raw sugar on top or a little vanilla in the mix.  I think this base could work with raspberries or blueberries just as easily and might be perfect with the sweetness of the fruit.  My husband LOVED them and wanted a second - he likes things that are not too sweet so scones are perfect for him.

When I made this I did what others recommended, I swapped out the cream of tarter and baking soda with 2t of baking powder and swapped out the applesauce with 4T of butter.  My second time around I put in blueberries instead of chocolate chips, the chocolate chips were too sweet for my tastes.  My second time around it was very delicious.  My 16 month old daughter couldn't get enough of either recipes.

I followed the directions exactly except I added a 1/2 teaspoon on vanilla extract as mentioned by a different reviewer. They came out kind of a weird consistency, not like any scone I've ever had. Kind of chewy. I liked that they didn't use butter or oil, but they also tasted like they don't have butter or oil. I probably wouldn't make these again.

These came out not having the texture of a scone at all. My daughter calls them "rubber cookies". They do have a nice flavor though and were quick and easy to make. I will make them again for the kids.

I took things from everyone’s reviews. I LOVE THIS SCONE!! I will make them over and over!
I used baking powder, instead of cream of tartar. I used 4 T of salted butter instead of applesauce. I used half and half instead of milk, and I put in a cup of raisins! I didn’t overwork it. Someone suggested to put it in the top of the oven, I did and they brown just right in the time suggested. I can’t wait to make these after school with my granddaughter! 
(I recently made oatmeal scones from another site, they overcooked , I threw them out! I’m so happy to find this recipe!)

Fast and easy. They taste best a few hours out of the oven; after that the texture changes and they become more "doughy."

I followed this recipe exactly as it is and it was so good that the second time I doubled the recipe. I will make this again and again,  they have a great texture and are not overly sweet. An additional bonus is the ease of this recipe.

Fantastic scones.   Based on reviews, I used 2 teasp of baking soda, and 3 TBSP of butter cut in instead of cream of tartar, soda, and applesauce.    Made these for a bake sale, very popular!  I also needed a bit more milk for the dough, humidity related, I'm sure.   For those of you complaining about texture, DON'T overwork your dough.   Mix it and leave it!

I used about 2/3 c mini chocolate chips which was perfect. The chocolate makes it very rich tasting but not overly so. Very easy recipe

Delicious when made exactly by recipe. When I made them again, had to vary some ingredients and they weren't as good. Will stick to recipe next time.

The dough wasn't holding together, so I added a little more water. Per other reviewer's recommendations, I only left them in the over for 11 minutes, which was enough for the tops to start browning. They came out a tad rubbery.

My kids liked these scones. There are super easy to make and very quick.  I did substitute baking powder for the cream of tartar, because I didn't have any, same for butter replacing applesauce. 
The flavor is very simple; however that is often what kids prefer!
I will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

My kids and I love these, and per the comments I do add cinnamon and it is really nice that way. Today I subbed 2 tsp apple cider vinegar for the cream of tartar, and tried baking them on a pizza stone. I think it was even better than usual!

I made this recipe as is- no alterations. They were not good. When I was mixing the ingredients, the batter was rubbery. I knew that didn't bode well, but I continued.  The baked finished product was kind of rubbery (no surprise). I bake my own bread, make my own tortillas, so I have a feel for this kind of thing, and this just isn't good. Maybe if you were on a very strict no-fat diet, this would be ok, but otherwise, no.

I made these scones for a tea party and many enjoyed them, thanks for the recipe.
I baked them according to the recipe but they turned out to be a little on the tough side. I would suggest to use self-rising flour to make them a little more puffed up the way scones are supposed to be. Thanks again and hope this review was helpful

I've never made scones before but I was quite impressed with how these turned out! However I would use less chocolate hips as the ratio of dough to chocolate was low!

I would normally rate these 1 star because I baked these to the original recipe to the letter and the texture was bad/rubbery, but I added back a star because I saw all the comments suggesting changes that I didn't make.

It was an okay recipe for a scone. I would classify this more as a biscuit in terms of texture. I made this one night and waited until they had cooled completely before putting them in a container. The next day I had one out of the container at room temp and it lost the crunchy outside and instead the whole thing was chewy. Not sure if I'd make this again and if I did I would definitely make changes like adding oil instead of all applesauce to make it less chewy.

It tasted good, but the batter was very sticky and the final product was almost like a chewy bread.

I read the reviews and decided to just try it as this was the only recipe I could find that I had all the ingredients for.. I should have just substituted something for one of the other recipes. I dont mean to be rude, but honestly, the only thing good about this recipe is the chocolate chips.

felt they were dry, but had a good taste.    Just needed more coffee to wash them down.     Easy to make and they were eaten at both a tea party and at work.

I love this reduced-fat recipe! It's just what I was looking for. I have also made this recipe with almonds instead of chocolate chips. Just add 1/2 Cup sliced almonds and a teaspoon of almond extract in place of the chocolate chips. Delicious!

Not that good. They are very bland, dry and hard. There is not much taste. I don't recommend this recipe.

These were very good.  I made a few changes, I used oil instead of applesauce and I topped them with a small amount of brown sugar and cinnamon. After all that, they were a little too sweet for breakfast, but very tasty.

These scones were light and delicious!  I made some for teenagers and they ate them all up.  They left no scone unturned :)
