Excellent Marinade. I used 1/4 cup of honey to make it sweeter, and it came out very close to the teriyaki marinades that excellent steak restaurants use.

Especially good on salmon, and we did try it on tofu. It was excellant for both.

This marinade was so good! I used mine for chicken and it turned out great. It was sort of a last minute decision so the wings only marinated for about 2 1/2 hours but they still turned out super delicious. I followed the recipe as is but I used 3 cups of soy sauce instead of 5 and used some pineapple juice to compensate for it. Will be using this recipe again in the future for sure.

Even using a low sodium soy sauce, the marinade was very, very salty.  I ran out of honey and had to use sugar and pineapple juice, still very salty. Don't think I'll try this recipe again, but if I do, will significantly reduce the soy sauce.
