I was so hopeful for this recipe.  I suppose if I had analyzed it more - I would have asked myself if pasta sauce sounded good over broccoli and cauliflower.  The directions were great and I followed them to the letter.  OK...so all I can think was flavor was not there. I am usually the one that everyone considers the "great cook" but this one was not a winner for me.  Perhaps - if I see other people LOVE it - I will analyze why I did not and give it another try.  I hope to see more dutch oven things - because THAT  (cooking outside) part was fun!

Dutch Oven Lasagna is one of my all-time favorite things to cook. I think this recipe isn't perfect but it gives you the idea. I make up a proper Bechemel sauce with butter, flour and milk and then add ricotta cheese. So cheesy! I've never been a fun of broccoli and cauliflower in a lasagna, so I use bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and any other veg that looks good. Also you can add meat if you are so inclined. I only put in on the coals for about 30 -45 min. Letting a lasagna stand is key so don't rush it.

while the dutch oven cooking method is always good (and i do it a lot in backyard firepit) it's touchy when combining certain veggies that get mushy and tasteless after high heat and a pasta that needs the firm texture...i would suggest to replace  broccoli and cauliflower and zucchini with more firm veg like portabella, chard/collard, spinach and carrot. ground meats are excellent too
