I used Montreal steak seasoning for the grill seasoning, and added the oil into the marinade. I replaced half of the balsamic vinegar with mirin (rice wine vinegar.) This was delicious!!

I had two pounds of skirt steak. I took one pound and followed the instructions to the letter, and what I got was a VERY TOUGH dry piece of skirt steak.  If you like your beef well done and like a hockey puck, follow the instructions for this recipe. 

I cooked the second pound only through step two, turning the meat over halfway through the 5-minute cooking time. This turned out VERY JUICY,  Medium Rare and VERY TENDER.

Easy with great flavor! I only had 4 hrs to marinade this and I was a little concerned given the vinegars but it still turned out juicy and tasty. I used adobo seasoning and a hamburger grill seasoning I had to replace the steak seasoning since I had none. I also followed the first reviewers advice and did one T of balsamic and one T of rice vinegar. After uncovering and flipping over I only let it cook another minute or two. Another 15 min like instructions said would have overdone mine. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Delish!!
