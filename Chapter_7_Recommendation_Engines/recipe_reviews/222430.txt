Um, YUM!!! I did not have salami, I used turkey pepperoni instead (I know, I know.....pepperoni is NOT salami but hey, you go with what you have on hand, right?). I also doubled the italian seasoning, doubled the amount of mayonnaise/italian dressing and the mayonnaise I used was reduced fat. This salad was off the HOOK. I think the only thing we were missing in this salad was chopped fresh roma tomatoes but really, even then we were too busy stuffing our faces with it to care. To say we loved it--HUGE understatement.

We LOVED this! I did need to use more Italian dressing than called for, a little less Italian seasoning (personal preference) and used tri-colored wheels instead of rotini (per my little guy), but those were my only changes. All of the ingredients went together very well, and I liked the addition of the mayo in this. I will be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have made a similar pasta salad for years but never added the peppers and artichoke hearts. It was very good.  Did add 4T of McCormick Salad Supreme and a little bit of French dressing.  But it is 5 star as written!

We LOVED this recipe! I only changed a few things. Greek dressing instead of Italian and Kalamata Olives instead of black. So good! I prefer it warm, but cold is good too!

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for a family gathering, and it was a hit!  Everyone complimented me on the pasta salad.  I am actually planning on making it again tonight so my husband and I can have it for our lunches.  It was a little time consuming but totally worth it!  I also used Greek dressing, as someone else suggested.  I also used grated romano instead of shredded parmesan (accidentally did this; didn't notice it said shredded).  I did not measure it; I just put in what felt right.  I also added some pepperoni. You will need more dressing.  I made it as directed then made another batch of the dressing on the side and added it right before serving it. DELICIOUS!!!

I made this pasta salad as written (with the exception of I had to quadruple the dressing)for a work luncheon.  The pasta salad was gone within 30 minutes with rave reviews from all and several requests for the recipe.  Anyone that works in an office full of women will appreciate the fact that there was no one who didn't like this pasta salad.  LOL

I'd really suggest dialing back the mayo by about half. Much better after I made the reduction. As a topping, where its flavor can better stand on its own, the Parmesan is better than as part of the mix. I use only the deeper colored, better quality, dry salami, which adds nice flavor bursts without coming to the fore. After the first time, I refrigerated in groups to preserve flavors and what crunch there is ... I felt this to be a significant improvement to the final presentation as this is not a single flavor but a medley. Pepperoncini are simply too intense. I use banana pepper on the side and none but the fire eaters see it as an improvement. IMHO, this salad works best as an assembly of equals, none dominating, none reticent. Overall, I've never had one I preferred and this is now my 'go to' when I've the time to prep ingredients. Only problem is I had to stop at five stars. 
TWEAKS (of course, right?): 
(1) While more expensive, cubes of goat cheese (NOT Feta) in place of / preferably in addition to, the Mozzarella are *sublime;* (2) Added 1/2 cup diced scallion (a.k.a. green onion); (3) Substituted 2 tsp freshly minced garlic for the powder, added directly to dressing (OK, I'm a garlic lover, I admit it); (4) *Spanish* stuffed olives in an *Italian* salad ?! Sacrilege! Besides their only proper use is in a traditional martini ... used 8 oz black olives; (5) Dropped the artichoke hearts after first edition ... didn't miss ... flavor too subtle for this mix.

Great salad! I forgot to get the roasted red peppers when I went shopping for the ingredients, and didn't add the green olives, as no one in my family except for me likes them, and I still LOVED this salad! I used regular rotini not tri-color. I did find that the pasta had soaked up all the dressing after letting it chill overnight making it dry, so I mixed up a bit more & added. Other then that it was perfect! Next time I will be sure to add the roasted red peppers!

Very good pasta salad. I used pepperoni instead of salami and left out the green olives (family preference), but everything was very tasty. I might omit the pepperoni/salami and add chicken next time and serve as a main dish instead of a side.

This recipe is a favorite!  I do always double the dressing amounts and because the pasta soaks some of it up after you put it together.  And it works with light mayo and Italian dressing as well.

This was a HOME RUN with my family!  I doubled this recipe & mixed everything without meat, then split off 1/3 for the vegetarians in the family; then added the meat to the rest. I used Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix and did not double it.  Also I used 1/2 pepperoni & 1/2 salami and I used garlic jalapeno stuffed green olives I bought at Costco and it gave this recipe a nice kick.  Substituted shredded Mozzarella cheese for cubed and Wacky Mac for rotelle. This did not last long at our house so I was glad I doubled recipe!

I like 99% of the recipes on here, but every once in a while there is one that doesn't click. I made this (to the tee according to the recipe) for a dinner reception for a large group of children...over 50 people. The kids (and parents) took one or two bites and didn't eat any more. I felt bad, but like I said, some recipes just don't work.

This is the best pasta salad I've ever had. I'm not very good at specific or critical reviews, but this was seriously the. best. I'm a huge pasta salad lover and this was just phenomenal. All of the vegetables and seasoning gave it a great spicy flavor. Just, seriously. Best pasta salad ever. Ever.

I made this pasta salad for a bbq and barely anyone ate it. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted really bad! Frankly, I was pretty embarrassed. I will not be making this pasta salad again.

I made this for an open house attended by > 60 people.  This salad was a huge hit "as is".  I used the small diced pepperoni pieces in place of the salami the second time I made it - both are good.  I am always looking for creative and tasty variations on standard picnic fare.  This is a winner!

Made this without changes and it was good- but not as good as it could be if you doubled the mix-in amounts.  The flavors of the olives, red peppers, artichokes, and pepperoncinis- while great additions- kind of get lost in the mix.  Also, I made this the night before and so much of the dressing had been absorbed by the noodles the next day- next time I'll double the dressing and reserve half of it to stir in right before serving.  All in all a good recipe worth repeating!

This is my new favorite pasta salad. The ONLY thing I did differently was use drained sun-dried tomatoes instead of roasted red pepper.  This make a ton of food & everyone loved it. Thank you for the recipe!

The recipe calls for "tri-color rotini", which is not what's shown in the picture and it certainly adds to the flavor and presentation.  The colors are from vegetables in the pasta....   This is a good pasta salad.  It needs to marinate overnight before serving, and the parmesan should be shredded, not grated, like green can...  I will make it again using the same ingredients, but tweeking the quantities of each to match our family's personal preference, but ALL the ingredients addded to the wonderful flavor.  EVEN THE PEPPERONCINI!  Don't tweek and rate your own concoction people!!  Newman's Own Salad Dressing was PERFECT for this recipe.

YUMMY!!!  I omitted a few items and used fresh basil in place of the italian seasoning and doubled the sauce. But this is one that I will be making again.  Very yummy.

I liked it, but it wasn't anything spectacular.  I won't make it again.

this was very tasty.. i used what i had on hand.. didn't have the roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts or the green olives.. i sauteed some white onion and orange bell pepper.. used one cup of slice kalamata olives.. omitted the extra seasonings (italian seasoning, garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper) and also the parm.. i doubled the italian dressing and mayo.. did add the pepperoncinis and doubled the salami.. didn't have the patience to throw it in the fridge for 2 hours.. still tasted super yummy.. ty so much for the recipe

Very tasty, much better than I thought it would be.  Doesn't matter what pasta you use I reckon.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. A local restaurant makes a salad similar to this and I have been on a mission to find the recipe since! This is even better than the restaurant version, but like most suggested, it does require double the amount of mayo/Italian dressing mix at least, or more if you want a creamier salad. I didn't have any roasted red peppers so I used some sun dried tomatoes instead. No complaints!

This an amazing pasta salad. We call it antipasto pasta salad. The only thing I would change about it was that it was a bit too salty. Next time I'd take out the seasoning salt and I'll probably cut down on the amount of olives. But other than that it was soooo delicious. It is not going to last long in our house!

I really enjoyed all the tangy ingredients in this salad, and it stayed tasty for quite a while. I did freshen it up with bottled Greek salad dressing each time I ate a serving.

This recipe is amazing!  The only thing that is tedious is how long it takes to cut up all of the ingredients (takes way longer than 30 minutes even with my Vidalia Chopper)!  I used Newman's Own Tuscan Italian Dressing for a change.  If you have no Italian dressing on hand, I have made it with ranch salad dressing poured over the top.  Highly recommend!

Delicious! Time consuming but worth it! I left out the onion because my husband hates them, but otherwise followed the recipe exact. SO good! I would try with pepperoni or chicken too!

Very, very good salad! I'm going to add marinated mushrooms next time as I like that marinated artichoke hearts taste (marinated mushrooms have the same taste). Otherwise, it was a hit and I'm def making it again! Thanks for posting
