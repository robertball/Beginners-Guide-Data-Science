This was great, but to me a true muffuletta needs olives, so I added 1/2c chopped green olives.

RENAME THIS RECIPE   tasty , easy, but really not fair calling it muffaletta to those that have not experienced muffaletta. Muffaletta is about the olive salad mingling with the meats and cheeses. Play fair Pillsbury.
