5 Stars from me!  These are wonderful.  My brother was thinking about cutting down his grapefruit tree, but these cookies will change his mind.  I upped the flour to 2 cups and they turned out perfect.  By the way, I also graduated high school in 1975, and lemon tea cookies were big then, but these are great.  Thanks.

These were delicious! I had to bake them at 325 because my oven runs hotter than normal, but great recipe!

Really good and easy, cake-like cookies.  I used a red grapefruit and doubled the zest and added a touch more juice because it's so mild.  They came out perfectly.  Delicious!  I'm going to try them with Lemon for Mother's Day.  :0)

The glaze makes these taste great!  I made them with lemon juice instead, and they tasted like lemonade sponges.  But they are a soft, cakey cookie, not really my 'cup-o-tea'

Really good taste.  Used 2 cups of flour as other reviewers suggested.  Used approximately 3/4 T grapefruit juice in cookies.  Mixed grapefruit zest into sugar and let sit a bit before mixing sugar with butter in cookies.  Used powdered sugar, grapefruit juice, and grapefruit zest in glaze.  Easy and excellent.

Wanted to try something with grapefruit but this recipe didn't work out.  I used 2 cups of flour but the dough was still too soft for cookies so I added some chopped nuts and thought I would try making bars.  The pan was too small so it turned out like cake.  Right out of the oven it was okay (the glaze I threw out after mixing it and tasting it)but the next morning the "cake" was heavy and dried out.

These cookies have a lovely texture and are very light and fluffy. Although they have a nice flavor, I would recommend the 1/3 cup of juice in the glaze as opposed to the 1/4 cup in the recipe, for those who enjoy a stronger grapefruit flavor. We also used powdered sugar instead of granulated. Other than that, I think that these are delightful and I look forward to making them again.

These taste good. I don't like the texture of the icing, in the future, I'll use powdered sugar instead of white.

Really good! I mixed some powdered sugar with the granulated sugar to make the glaze a little thicker.

I made these cookies for a Downton Abbey tea party, and my friends went crazy for them! I added more grapefruit zest than called for.
