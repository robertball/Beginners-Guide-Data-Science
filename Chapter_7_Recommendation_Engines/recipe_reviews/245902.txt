Pretty darned tasty.  I had bacon grease saved in the refrigerator, so that worked out well.  The scones were very tender, in fact almost too much so because they sort of crumbled when eating them.  I did change the way the scones were assembled.  I patted the dough into a rough rectangle and rolled it out, sprinkled the bacon pieces over the dough and folded it in thirds, like a letter.  I chilled it, then cut into 8 pieces.

I prepared the recipe mainly as is minus the egg wash. Now, I must say that the recipe is not bad. It is a good base and the outcome regarding the texture is excellent. The only problem with this recipe is that your bacon may not  yield the necessary amount of lard. I used unsalted butter to make up for the rest of the grease I needed. With that said, this recipe is not bad. I would probably add salt to the dough to boost the savory aspect of the recipe. I used a bit of butter to replace the egg wash and it came out nicely golden. For practical and speed reasons, I also shaped the dough like a rectangle and filled the center with bacon then folded it like a letter. My personal tip is to use cold milk, chilled grease or butter, and finally manipulate the dough the least you can. Also, make sure your bacon is not too lean. They are melt in your mouth kind of scone, so be watchful of how golden do you want them to be while baking.
