I left out the honey (not a fan) and it was still nice and sweet.  I used it on popovers and it was so good!

I made this for a breakfast gathering of some friends.  It was delicious on warm bread.  The flavor ad texture was perfect.  I will definitely make it again!

It was a rich and fluffy spread that my grandparents loved. They said it was just a bit sweet but I think if I use it on a blander bread it will be okay. Wonderful, wonderful recipe!
