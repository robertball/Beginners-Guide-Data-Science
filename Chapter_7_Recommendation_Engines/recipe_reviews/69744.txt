This recipe was great. Although I used a 2lb roast I stuck with the recipe. I added more garlic to the recipe about 2tbls more (garlic crazy). Very tender. Entire family loved it. My 5 year old daughter (who does'nt eat much) could not get enough. This is a keeper. Add some cornstarch to the drippings for an excellent gravy.

I put the pork loin in the crock pot on low for 5-6 hours and get the same results as the baking bag.  The loin comes out tender, moist, and perfect.  Pour the juices into a small sauce pan and bring to a boil.  Mix 1 Tbsp cornstarch and 1 Tbsp cold water.  Wisk slowly into boiling juices until thick and serve over the pork loin.

Wow, phenomenal.  It made the tenderest, juiciest, most flavourful pork loin I've ever had.  I can't speak to the rosemary issue, though, as I had none so I omitted it.  I added extra garlic because I am a garlic fiend!  If you don't make a gravy out of the drippings you are losing out.  I will definitely make this again.

My sister-in-law just made this recipe and my family has decided that it's a keeper since it's easy and delicious.  The loin turns out very moist and the drippings make a great sauce.  When I make it, I think I will add a little orange zest to bring out a little more of the orange flavor.

Very moist and tender. Everyone loved it. The orange soy sauce wasn't very sweet so I added some apricot preserves. Really gave it a nice flavor. I thickened the sauce and added some pepper and garlic poweder and used it for gravy.

This was really tasty. I didn't have OJ so I used 1/2c. water and 4T. orange marmalade.  I didn't have a baking bag so I put foil over it for 1hr. then removed and baked uncovered and basted it for another hour. Poured the sauce directly over sliced meat and over steamed carrots.  I liked this recipe b/c it used items that I already had in the house.

I have been making this same recipe for years except I use pork tenderloin and no onion.  I marinate the tenderloins for approx 6 to 8 hours, remove from marinade and place tenderloins in baking pan, covered with foil. Let it come to room temp and then bake for about 20 to 25 mins. I heat the reserved marinade to use as gravy.

Overall this is a pretty good dish. I liked it although I think next time I would use about 1/2 of the soy and even considered using teriyaki. The roast was delicious, very tender and moist. I will make this again.

The rosemary in this seems kind of out of place with the orange/soy mixture.  It ended up overpowering any sweetness that the orange contributed.  Could be good with some tweaking, but only so-so as is.

Turned out very moist and tender, but was to much rosemary, if we try it again, either use less or do away with that ingrediant totally.

This is a very yummy recipe! I leave out the olive oil and rosemary. It makes a great crock pot recipe -just add 1/2 cup water! That's usually how I fix it. I have also used it as a marinade for pork chops and chicken and it's really good on that too.

Wow! The pork was so juicy and tender thanks to the oven bag, and it was so flavorful! Everyone, including my five kids, told me this was a keeper. It's almost impossible to find something that everyone likes, but this is it!

Sans rosemary, didn't have oj so I used marmelade. delish! Cut the soy with some Mirin too if you want to lower the sodium content. Oh and I like to double the sauce (cook on the stovetop) to splash on a side of sticky rice. "ono!"

I'm only rating this to counter-act the 1-star review that sdmjones gave this, WITHOUT EVEN TRYING IT, because "oh my gosh this might be good , but it is 110 degrees here in missouri, my oven will not be turned on".

We eat low carbohydrate so I used ther zest from two oranges instead of the OJ, and added 1/4 c water. We like garlic so we increased it to 1 Tbsp.  The Pork was very moist and delicious!!

This was delicious but i did make some changes. I added 4 tablespoons of garlic (we love garlic) and also put quartered potatoes, green beans, and carrots in the casserole dish i baked it in. I recommend turning the pork loin as it cooks instead of basting it. This recipe made an incredibly tender pork And i will definitely make this again! Im thinking of using a pomegranate vinegar instead of the soy sauce next time...

I cut the soy sauce down a little, used half the amount of rosemary and added a little orange zest to the marinade.... I didn't bake it in an oven bag, made a foil packet and cooked it in there for about 1 1/2 hours and then removed the top for the last 45 it took to cook.
...To make the gravy I put the drippings in a pot and boiled, mixed 1/4 cup of orange juice and 1/4 cup water with 3 tablespoons cornstarch and brought it to a boil till it thickened... This was actually really good! Totally moist and tasty! Thanks for the recipe JSHAFFER!

Absolutely the most tender, juiciest, delicious pork loin ever. I used a 3 lb. loin followed the sauce recipe except used dried basil instead of rosemary and topped the loin with Panko bread crumbs. No bag so I made a foil boat in a pan to hold the loin.

I read several reviews before I made the recipe and incorporated a few things: cooked in a roasting pan, as opposed to the baking bag; added extra onions; added orange zest; and tried to make a gravy/sauce from the drippings.  I cooked the loin in the baking pan because I have had a lot of success with it in the past, and this was no exception.  I definitely think that the orange flavor was prominent with the zest there and the onions were great.  I did not like, however, the gravy.  Just weird with the citrusy tones. I would make it again, but it wasn't anything too special.

The pork lion was very tender & tasted good but don't expect a lot of "orange" taste. I even added some orange extract & it just wasn't orangy enough for me.

For me the recipe had too much soy taste and not enough orange. I'm going to try it again but I'm going to substitute OJ concentrate instead of just OJ and see if it gives me a better flavor.

I made this for a family get together and it was a huge hit with everyone there.  I did use fresh rosemary instead of dried and the next time I make it, I will add more onion.  The flavor was so good that there was not enough onion to go around.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

As a former professional chef I am always looking for new recipes to try, and this one sounded good. I made a few small changes to the original recipe such as: I omitted the rosemary and added fresh parsley, I also added extra OJ and white wine and toasted sesame oil, and added extra garlic, I then marinated it in this liquid for 6 hrs then roasted it off. It turned out GREAT!! I will be making this again!!

flavorful.  And it makes alot.  Plenty of leftovers after our group of 4 adults and two kids had dinner.  Used foil instead of a bag, and omitted rosemary.  Wanted to make a gravy, buy alot of the drippings evaporated before I could.  Very tender.  Served with rice, corn on the cob and green salad.  thanks!

very good recipe. Would add a bit more garlic next time and maybe season the pork before pouring the sauce over top. I used thick boneless pork chops. Served with rice and broccoli.

So good!  I did follow several reviewers advice and doubled the OJ, cut the soy in half and used fresh rosemary.  Thickened with arrowroot to make a full on gravy and it was just wonderful.  Meat just fell apart and the gravy was scrumptious.  Thanks!

I really loved the recipe, i followed the ingredients exactly, rosemary included except that i didnt have a loin roast, so i used pork shoulder roast. it came out kinda flaky like barbecue. my favorite part were the red onions which seemed to really go well with the flavor of the soy sauce and added the most delicious flavor when mixed with the flaky meat. it wasnt as orangey as i expected though. i used tinfoil since i lost the ties for the oven bag, didnt prevent the juices from retaining any. i gave 4 stars since i didnt get the full hit of orange flavor.

I followed some of the suggestions from previous reviews. I eliminated the rosemary and took the left over juice, added corn starch and made a gravy. It was great.  Cooked a 2lb roast for 1.5 hrs. Perhaps a little long, but still good.  I think I'll make a 2.5lb roast next time but still cook it for the 1.5 hrs.  This recipe was sent to me by my dad and now I've joined the site.

Yummy! I do use lite soy sauce (always) and usually skip the rosemary, opting for more onions and garlic. I've made it both in the oven and the slow cooker, excellent both ways.
With all due respect to the reviewer who said to leave the raw tenderloin sit out covered until it came to room temperature before cooking it - please DO NOT do this. You are allowing potentially harmful bacteria to grow on the meat this way, and it's a pretty good way to possibly make some of the folks who eat it quite sick. Just keep the tenderloin refrigerated until you are ready to place in the oven and keep you and your family safe and healthy.

I didn't get much orange flavor out of this, but the overall flavor of the pork was nice.  I might add more juice next time, but that's my own personal preference.  The pork cooked very well and looked very nice when it came out of the oven.

Not bad but not quite as flavorful as I hoped. I didn't bother with the baking bag, just marinated the pork loin for 8 hours, then basted it like crazy. I might try it again but add some teriyaki sauce or something. Thanks anyway!

This recipe was okay, but had way too much rosemary, and could have used more orange juice I thought.  I don't think I'll make it again.  I will say this, It was very, very tender.

I made this in the crock pot ,after that I pan seared it in a dutch oven to gather some of the fat and then transferred the juice to the dutch oven and boiled to reduce the liquid to a thick and flavorful sauce by adding half of a teaspoon of flour.
This sauce made the pork so wonderful.

I used a roasting pan with a lid instead of a bag and it turned out really moist.  I put salt and pepper directly on the roast then poured the olive oil directly on top of the roast and rubbed into the meat. I poured the liquid mixture over the roast and then cooked for the 2.5 hours. I think I could have done 2 hours and been fine.

I cooked 4 and half pound loin for 1 1/2 hours.  Temperature 160.  Very moist .Be careful because it cooked faster than recipe stated.  I put zest of two oranges and substituted coconut oil, and coconut amino for soy.  Placed loin on bed of sliced sweet onions and orange bell pepper. Add salt and pepper to taste

My husband really liked this recipe! Said it definitely was a keeper! (I don't eat meat!) I only gave it a 4 star as I wasn't able to use her exact ingredients. Like another reviewer posted, I too didn't have any OJ on hand so I had to tweak it a bit. I used 1/2 C of lite soy sauce, 4 big T of Orange Marmalade and 2 T of dehydrated onion. I also cut the oil in half as I really didn't think it was even necessary. I was worried about using the Rosemary so used barely 1 tsp. I mixed it together, put meat in a foil pouch (didn't have a bag) poured sauce over meat, sealed it and cooked for 1 hour 45 minutes at 350 and let sit for 15 minutes. It was very tender and easy to cut. It was so easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I used reduced sodium soy sauce to cut back on the sodium, and my wife and I tore it up. I can't wait for the leftovers. As others have said, you can't really taste the orange, but who cares because it tastes so great.  I didn't make gravy from the sauce (just to cut back on sodium again), but I could only imagine how delicious that would be!

made this last night and my 3 daughters LOVED it and to find something they all like is quite rare. I altered it a little bit - I put a rosemary ginger rub on it, then wrapped it up in plastic wrap overnight. I was going to cook it in the oven but we went swimming so I put it in the slow cooker instead but still put it in the oven bag with a little bit of water in the slow cooker and cooked on high for about 5 hours. It came out so tender, my daughters ate about 1/2 of the pork loin and probably could've finished off more if it was given to them.

Thanks again. Second recipe I tried and second success. This is very empowering since I am just learning to cook. I substituted sweet basil for rosemary, which I didn't have, and cooked three pork loin chops for six hours in a a crock pot on low setting.

Absolutely perfect! This is definitely a keeper. I used my mandolin to slice the onion very thin and dried minced garlic, so it was oven ready in about five minutes. I served it with salt potatoes and fresh-from-the-garden sweet corn  and finished dinner off with a quick no-bake lemon pie. It took less than 20 minutes to cook the whole meal. Guess I'll go reward myself with a cold pork sandwich. Yum! Yum!

This was so good and so tender!  I followed advice from others and used half the Rosemary (I love Rosemary but others find it a little much). I didn't have an oven bag so I cooked a 4.5 lb. roast in a large roast pan at 350 for 2 hrs.  Had no red onions so used regular onions and it still turned out great!

I agree with many of the reviews, I will cut back on the rosemary, and increase the orange & soy, otherwise very tender and delicious! Making again for dinner tonight!

It was juicy, but a little too soy saucy for me. I would use 1/2 to 1/4 of the soy sauce required. Just my tastes

My husband and I loved this recipe!  The leftovers are even great because they've been sitting in the juices all night!  I added orange zest while cooking, and then garnished with zest and orange rounds.  Delish!

Came out perfect, only had yellow onions, other than that followed the recipe ingredient wise. I cooked mine in a crockpot on low for 6 hours. Absolutely delicious. Made some pork fried cauliflower with some leftovers, yummy!!!!

Meat turned out tender and juicy. I omitted the olive oil, rosemary, and onion.  After roast was done, I thickened the liquid with cornstarch, added brown sugar, and served it with rice. It was a hit with my family. I will definitely make it again.

This was amazing! I did a double batch with 2 pork loins in the crock pot. Went by the recipe. I also added carrots and potatoes towards the end. I took the meat out when done and roasted in a 400 degree oven until perfectly browned. Added corn starch to thicken the gravy. Delicious! I'll be making this again! Thank You for a wonderful recipe!

Loved the recipe! I added a 1/4 packet of orange crystal light to enhance the orange flavor but not the calories, and substituted the 1/3 cup soy sauce for 1/3 cup coconut aminos (to lower sodium). 
I also tried it in a pressure cooker, for 40 mins (super fast!)
It was delicious!! Maybe next time I will ditch the 1/4 cup olive oil for just a teaspoon.

Delish. I used orange marmalade mixed with a little water instead of OJ. Served with mashed yams and steamed broccoli. Great Sunday dinner for the family.

My husband said, "You've outdone yourself, Evelyn!"  The pork was terrific but the sauce was what really did make it exceptional.   I didn't have real oranges so I used the frozen concentrate...used fresh Rosemary,  much more garlic, and no onions.  I'd make double or triple since this was just enough sauce for the two of us.  I thickened it with cornstarch.  I was (pleasantly) surprised that I didn't taste too much soy sauce.

This was excellent!  I didn't have any soy sauce so I used Diane's Teriyaki instead and I added extra garlic because we like it.  The only thing I would do different next time is to let the sauce mixture sit overnight so the garlic would infuse a bit better.  Then add the roast in the morning to marinade for a bit before cooking.  But if you don't have the time - it's still a great recipe to throw together and cook up.  Will definitely make this one again.

This was terrific! It was very flavorful, tender and moist without falling apart like pork does in the crockpot. By cooking the entire 5 pound loin, we had leftovers for another night.

We ate this tonight and loved it. I made it in the bag, cut the garlic down to one clove, added a little bit more soy sauce and also added about a quarter cup of Apricot/Peach preserves. Cooked it at 350 for 2.30 hours. Checked the thermometer at that time and it was at 180. I should have checked it at 2 hours, next time I'll know better. It was so tender and delicious, we'll be having this again soon. Thank you for a great recipe that my husband loved.

This is my favorite citrus pork tenderloin recipe. My only adjustment being that I use a 2 pound loin so it would bake faster. I also use an oven bag which lends to the tenderness of the meat.

Loved it.  I used a pork tenderloin instead, didn't use the rosemary based on some of the other reviews and cooked in slow cooker for 4 hours on low.  Loved the flavor and the tenderness.  My family loved it too.  This will definitely become a regular but probably cook for less time.

Cooked in a deep dish with foil covering very tightly.  I didn't have a baking bag.  It was very good, not great.  I'm not as crazy about the texture of pork cooked this way, prefer roasted.

I didn't have any cooking bags so I marinated a small pork loin in the sauce, baked it in the oven with the sauce in a pan, and then thickened the sauce to serve with the pork.  I added honey to the sauce as it was cooking to cut the strong taste of the soy sauce.  I'd use less soy sauce next time.

Dry! I roasted it at 325 degrees for two hours. Wish I had checked the temperature at about an hour and a half.  Flavor is excellent, read reviews and used a fraction of the soy sauce, added a healthy dose of grated orange rind in addition to the orange juice. I will make it again, but watch the temperature.  For flavor, with the suggested adjustments, it is definitely a keeper.

This was a good dish, and it was easy to make. The bag is a great idea, pork was super tender and moist. The sauce was way too salty for me but the kids liked it. It's my pickiest eater's new favorite dish!

Sorry but we didn't like it at all. Tasted like soy sauce with a very very slight orange flavor. But basically just like soy sauce in pork. I hate to review negatively but I'm being honest as to how we felt. Followed recipe.

This was a hit for our family. I had 5 thick cut pork loin chops and I combined them with the ingredients in a bag to marinade for several hours. Then I baked, uncovered at 350 degrees for 1.25 hrs. After they were fully cooked, I made a gravy from the drippings. I took a TBS of butter and 2TBS of flour and cooked over medium heat, once fully combined and a little golden, I whisked in the drippings, along with a TBS of marmalade. I used my immersion blender to blend the gravy smooth (because of the rosemary and onions). I served with steamed rice and steamed broccoli.  I think next time, I'll cut back on the soy sauce and increase the OJ.

Excellent, well balanced marinade. I made a small batch for pan fried pork loin chops, marinating them for an hour beforehand.

OMG, I loved this recipe. I made it exactly as it says and it's lovely. I made rice and broccoli as some review suggested but next time I'll make roast potatoes and veggies instead. I also made the gravy with the juices from the oven and some cornstarch and it's delicious! Thank you for the recipe! :)

This recipe turned out excellent.  I eliminated the rosemary but would not hesitate to add it in next time.  I cooked it in my electric pressure cooker after marinating it for about 20 minutes in the sauce.  It turned out super tender and delicious. I added some cornstarch to the drippings to make a gravy.  I would have added some orange marmalade to the recipe if I had some or even some orange zest.  I'll make it again for sure.

This was SO GOOD!!  I used a very large pork loin so I kept a meat thermometer in it just to insure I didn't over cook it, pulled it out at about 150 degrees and it was perfect!  The sauce reduced down on it's own and the onions were delicious.  A perfect dinner served with steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes!

Not my favorite.  The sauce was very salty and I even halved the soy sauce.   And the pork really didn't absorb the flavor very well.  All in all not something I'd make again.

I've made this recipe at least 10x over the last 18 months.  This recipe is excellent and I can't get myself to try any other pork loin recipe.  The only thing I do differently is double the orange juice.  Oh, and I heavily coat the pork loin using 1/2 cup of flour and pour any leftover flour in the bag.  This helps to thicken that delicious sauce/gravy.  Even the pickiest eaters rave over this.  And it freezes and reheats well.  I can't say enough about how good this dish is!  Thank you!

Used fresh orange juice. Also marinated overnight but lacked in flavor. Would have liked more orange flavor. Needed orange zest.

Easy and delicious! The pork loin was moist even without the juices drizzled over it. I followed the recipe as written and don't think I'd change a thing. The marinade added a subtle flavor and didn't overpower the flavor of the pork. I put the left-over pork in a ziplock bag with the marinade so it can soak up the flavor for yummy leftovers!

As written, this recipe is a complete failure.  I could not taste any OJ at all despite cutting some OJ into the soy sauce since others complained about the overwhelming soy sauce taste.  I couldn't even taste that zingy soy sauce taste, it was just an overly salty amount of liquid. If I do try again, I will try using marmalade instead of OJ, and will use less soy sauce.  I will give partial credit I guess since it was tender, but then again every pork roast recipe I have made has been tender.

This was phenomenal! I tasted the marinade first, it just tasted like oil and soy sauce, so I wasn't expecting the results I got. I used a real orange because I was out of orange juice, this never happens:-) I cut the ingredients in half because I only had a little less than two pounds of pork loin chops. I cooked it in a crockpot because I didn't have a bag. It cooked for two hours on high, but I had to take it out and try a faster cooking option because it was 6pm already. I first tried the stove, but I had too many pieces and not enough time. So I put them in a glass pan in the oven on high broil for seven minutes and that finished them for me. The aroma reminded me of a dish that I had eaten before as a kid, it was so familiar. The porkloins were very tender and yummy! Thank you for sharing/creating this recipe!!!

I've made this receipe for the third time today.  I do add more orange juice than it calls for and today I didn't have a red onion so used regular cooking onion.  Hope that it is not overpowering.  We love this receipe--it's great for guests and quick.

Made this for my family with ingredients I had available. I braised it in the oven, covered for about an hour and a half to 2 hours at 350F. Served over beautiful brown rice and there was not a piece left! Thanks so much for what is now a family favorite, but also something lovely enough for guests!

Excellent recipe!  I made as specified, maybe a little extra garlic, and a yellow instead of red onion, with a 3.15 # loin.  I should have pulled it out of the oven earlier, two hours was a bit long.  I don't have oven bags, used my roasting pan and covered the top with foil.  I reduced the sauce after all was done and used as a gravy on the meat and white rice.  I'll be making this again for sure.  Next time I'll use a crock pot, I'll use more garlic, and I will probably increase the amounts of all ingredients so I have more sauce at the end to use as gravy.  My boyfriend and I both really liked it.  The meat would make an EXCELLENT sandwich.

This was quite good and the meat was nice and tender and juicy. Couldn't detect too much flavor from the orange and soy, however.  May should marinate the roast in the liquids overnight or longer.
Update;  did try marinating the meat for 2 days, but still couldn't taste the soy or orange flavors.

So much more amazing than I had expected. I didn't have a baking bag, but the flavors were still there. The orange and soy complimented each other perfectly, I will definitely make this again!

Tried this recipie exactly as the recipie called for. Was not impressed at all. Seems there needs to be an adjustment of soy and orange juice ammounts. Maybe some brown sugar and a touch of cornstarch added the last hour or so to thicken the sauce would have made a better finished product.

This was absolutely delish! I shy away from any meat recipes that might taste sweet, but this did not. I made a double batch of it for out of town relatives and it was gone in no time! They loved it!

I left out the rosemary and onion, sliced the pork loin into thick chops and cooked it in a skillet with the juice mixture.  I turned out great, even my picky eater loved it.

I have to say, this delivered as promised.  It was the moistest pork loin I have ever fixed.  I did throw a dallop of orange marmalade in and left out the onions.  The pan juices were wonderful to drizzle over the sliced pork.

I thought the soy sauce overpowered the other flavors. If I make this again, I'll use half the soy sauce.

This was easy and delicious. I forgot to put the rosemary in, but it was still good. Use a meat thermometer to avoid overcooking.

I made this tonight for my family to rave reviews...there was nothing left!  I left out the rosemary and doubled to the garlic, and the effect was a very juicy, very flavorful meal.
