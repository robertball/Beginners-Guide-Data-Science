10.14.19  These taste just like the green beans I grew up on, and occasionally, corn would be added, as well.  Homestyle, tasty comfort food, super simple to make, and always good!  Checked for doneness at 20 minutes, and they were done.  I did add some freshly-ground black pepper, and the only change I’d make would be to reduce the amount of salt.  One thing’s for sure, Grandma Mac knows how to cook green beans!

Made as written but with non-peppered bacon so I added some pepper because of that. These were SO good! I only simmered for 30 minutes and they were perfect texture to me. I ll just reduce the sugar a bit next time.
