Delicious!  The first time I prepared this recipe I followed the directions exactly and found the chicken to be a little tougher that I like.  The next time, I browned the chicken in the oil after sauteing the onions, then placed everything in my ceramic crock pot dish and baked it for an hour in the oven uncovered - then put the crock pot dish in its holder, covered it and cooked it on med for another hour. Perfect!

This is an excellent recipe. After reading the other reviews re the seasoning, I doubled the paprika, ginger and added a teaspoon Thyme. I had whole (not pitted) green olives and shaved about 20 of them. I figured they would flavor it more due to the cut up pieces, so I did not add salt. As it reduced, it was flavored perfectly and it didn't need any.  The rest of the recipe I followed normally and accompanied it with sticky white rice. I expected a new unique experience with the olive flavor and I wasn't disappointed. My wife and I loved it and I couldn't eat enough of it. My teenager turned her nose up at it, but I chalk that up to her not liking green olives. I will make this again and again.  This recipe is very different, but in a great way...we personally loved it. Thank you!

Very good flavor.  This has become a standard in my repertoire of chicken dishes.  Easy to make too.

This was a nice recipe but lacked a little "something." I added saffron and threw in some dry wild mushrooms that I reconstituted the in boiling water with the saffron. Needs an herbal touch, perhaps some thyme and rosemay.  I would make it again but with a touch more seasoning.

It is an excellent recipe, but that is a LOT of olives.  I used a 10 oz bottle of green Spanish olives for a 5 lb chicken and it was still too much. Since my chicken was double the size, I doubled the water and that was too much.  I salvaged the dish by using the remaining liquid (after the chicken finished stewing) to cook up couscous.

The olives were a bit strong in this dish- even for my husband who loves them.

I was eager to try a new chicken recipe but admit I was pretty wary of this one. In the end, it was great! I used most of the ingredients as part of a marinade and then threw it all into a pan to cook together. After reading earlier comments, I figured I should go light one the olives so I didn't even use an entire 10 ounce bottle. They turned out to be great accents.  It was nice to make something new! The chicken is perfect with rice.

My husband ate as much as he could, my son wouldn't touch it. My daughter picked the potatoes out. I thought it was salty, I liked the ginger/lemon flavor. I think if I were to make again I would rinse off the olives and use chicken stock instead of olivs brine/water. But hubby said never again?

I added butter and fresh cilantro.  It was just ok, I won't be making this again.
