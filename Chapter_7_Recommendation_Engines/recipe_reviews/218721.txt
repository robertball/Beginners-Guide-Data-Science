Very yummy! I cut this recipe in half and made muffins out of it. I had one issue and that was when the recipe was halved, it called for two and a half mashed ripe bananas. I decided to even it up by using three bananas and adding another quarter cup of flour. I made no other changes. I got 12 muffins out of this recipe. 350* for 20 minutes and we were ready to go. Great banana bread with the right measurements of everything needed to make it perfectly.......banana bread-y.

Really nice banana bread and a change to my recipe I've been using for 40 years.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because of the topping.  I found there was way too much of it and was not really necessary at all on such a tasty loaf.

Very rich, dense, and moist.  A little sweet/rich for my taste and the banana is kind of hidden by the abundance of butter, vanilla, and brown sugar.  I did split into two loaves as I was concerned about overflow in just one.  Also halved the topping and that was more than enough for two loaves, let alone one.

Really good and moist, I did 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 of yogurt to make it more moist. And I cut the crumble topping in half for 2 loaves, it was plenty..

Suuuper yummy! I did add more cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, and clove thigh as I like spicy breads. There is definitely plenty of banana flavor in this recipe which most recipes completely lack in. I made muffins, the recipe came out to a perfect 24. Baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. Will definitely be making again!!

Makes a large single loaf that I found difficult to get fully cooked without getting the outside over cooked. Next time I would split in two smaller loaf pans.  I cut the topping in half  based on prior reviews, and not really necessary, just an extra sweetness.. Also, cardamom is wonderful in place of the cinnamon.
