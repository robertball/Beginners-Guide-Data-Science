This is a great starter recipe. I made just as directed, but ended up tweaking with it a bit. I sauted diced yellow & red bell pepper first w/ olive oil, then 1/2 a red onion (not a fan of shallots), then 3 cloves finely minced garlic. I used regluar white sliced mushrooms (that is what I had on hand) and double the amount of sage. I used 1/2 cup cream as directed, but found that it wouldn't cook down. I added a bit of chicken stock (1 turn of the pan) & let simmer. Then added 1 tbl of flour to thicken. Topped with green onions. Turned out to be fantastic!!!! This sauce is very versatile. It would go well with chicken or pork.
This is a great recipe. THANK YOU! I am going to put this in my monthly rotation of recipes.

This was great and easy...BUT...unfortunately I follow the advice of another review and added half the sage. That was a mistake...it needed all the sage to enhance the flavour, whether in the sauce or sprinkled on top as garnish...Ok...to be fair, I did add parmesan :) and that was good advice...I would make again.

This was easy & very tasty. I had trouble finding oyster mushrooms & substituted portabellas-made the sauce very dark & rich. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream to reduce the fat. It was a wonderful way to use my fresh sage & I'd serve it to company!

This was so easy to make! I only used half the sage it called for and it was plenty!  I also added parmesan cheese into the mushroom/cream mixture to make it more creamy - it gave it much more flavor. I also used regular mushrooms as they're much cheaper.  I'll definitely make this again!

This turned out to be an excellent mushroom, cream sauce. I used a little less sage, added bacon bits and added a pinch of italian herb mix. It was wonderful

I made this as a side dish to some chicken a few nights ago and the end result was good.  I doubled the amount of shallot used and I used table cream instead of heavy cream and everything turned out just fine.  I might make this dish again, but if I do, I will not use oyster mushrooms.  They are very expensive and IMHO cremini's or even white mushrooms would be just as tasty.  Also, I will increase the amount of fresh sage used as we found the flavour to be a little too subtle.

I made this sauce based on the instructions of the most read review - zannah17. The only change I made was to make a roux with 1/2 Tbsp butter and 1/2 Tbsp of flour ON TOP OF the saut√©ed veggies. Then, I used a 1/4th of a bouillon cube instead of the broth because I didn't have the latter. The sauce was really thick because of the roux, so I added a bit of pasta water (like the Italians do!) to make the sauce a little bit thinner. I also made fresh regular spaghetti instead of making fettuccine. Fresh pasta makes this dish even better!

A perfectly servicable recipe, but a little lacking in flavor and interest. I'd be tempted to add some white wine to the sauce if I made it again.

This was nice, but a little bland unless you got a bite of shallot or garlic.  I used half and half on the advice of another reviewer.  I would try it again using the heavy cream so see if that made it a little richer.

This is pretty good. I chose to reduce some white wine while I sauteed the garlic, onion (didn't have shallots), and fresh mushrooms. I used half/half  instead of cream and added Gorgonzola cheese. I served it over chicken ravioli, it was delicious.

The only changes I made to this (other than doubling it!) was use farfalle pasta, grated in a bit of nutmeg and used two 6-oz bags of baby spinach... delicious!  It went together very easily and quickly after all the chopping was done.  Hubby wanted to help and he ended up doing just about everything (*I* did the chopping, of course-- he always wants to do the fun part!).  I'm really looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

adding a touch of nutmeg picks this up immensely, and for the lactose intolerant and vegans, soy milk or almond milk makes it even better.

For two but I still needed to added more heavy cream (total 3/4).  I also lowered the heat to low when I added the cream.  I added more garlic because I love garlic.    Used "regular" mushrooms but next time I'll try a variety to jazz it up.    Powder sage worked great but I'll try fresh to see the difference.    I took the recommendation to add some fresh parmesean at the very end just before I was ready to serve.   Good move.  I'll definately use again.    Also used fresh fettuccine.  That also added to the taste.

used enochi mushrooms as well as oyster and substituted fresh basil for sage.  Along with the extra virgin oil, some unsalted buter sauteed the finely minced yellow onion I used --- no shallots on hand!!!  1/2 cup white wine instead of the cream ... reduced the sauce and then just enough heavy cream to make ingredients "sauce" for topping pasta.  Thanks for the start-off

Thank you for a flavorful, but not spicy side dish. My children do not like things with a kick, but I desire depth of flavor. I did double the sauce to noodle ratio because we like more sauce.

This was just ok in my opinion.  I added a bunch of delicious things (white wine, parmesan, pepper, chili flakes) and it was still just kind of blah.  I'm sure it would have been better with fresh sage instead of the dried spice I had on hand, but I still will not be trying this one again- just not enough oomph for the rare cream sauce I make in the rotation.

My husband liked it, but he is not particular.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't all I thought it should have been.

Fantastic! I've made this many times for my roommate and boyfriend- both ADORE it. I use baby bellos and I puree the whole thing at the end with an immersion blender (since I'm not a huge fan of the consistency of mushrooms, but i love the flavor). Very tasty- like a stroganoff sauce.

I thought this was a good pasta dish, but probably not one of my favorites.  Then again, I didn't strictly follow the recipe's directions.  Didn't have spinach pasta, so added fresh spinach to the sauce and cooked until wilted.  Didn't have heavy cream, so used a mixture of plain yogurt and white wine to thin to the consistency of cream.  And white mushrooms instead of oyster mushrooms.  I did use quite a bit of parmesan cheese both as a topper and into the sauce and I thought that was a really good addition.

Very Yummy, I used poultry seasoning, as I didn't have just sage. Turned out very yummy.

I love this recipie.  I've never had oyster mushrooms before, but they are really good.  I don't know if this recipie would be as good with another type of mushroom.  I didn't have fresh sage so I used a little marjoram and a little rosemary.

This is one of the best fettucine recipes that I have tried for myself! I left out the sage as I'm not really keen on it, but the dish turned out wonderfully - lucky for me because I made the fettucine for company who were coming over for dinner.  Deliciously creamy but not too overwhelming.  I also used fresh spinach and stirred it in with the mushrooms as the sauce was finishing off.  Amazing and simple recipe!

This pasta turned out to be amazing! The only changes I made were to double the heavy cream, add about half a cup of grated parmesan cheese, and add in half a cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes. Definitely a keeper!

Flavor is divine!   I did add a couple of dashes of Italian seasoning and used half and half because that's what I had on hand.  Great recipe and easy to make!  Will double the recipe next time.

Quick and easy to make and healthy. This recipe is awesome! The only bad thing about it is the heavy whipping cream. I used organic but like someone said above you can use fat free half and half instead for less fat and calories. Great recipe. Simple yet flavorful. Thanks for sharing with us.

Really liked this recipe. I used onion instead of shallot (it's all I had). Thickened the sauce with a teeny bit of flour and threw in 1tbsp of lemon juice. Also garnished with green onion. This turned out really well and my notoriously picky husband dubbed this recipe a "keeper".

Loved this recipe! I did add shredded parmesan cheese on top.
