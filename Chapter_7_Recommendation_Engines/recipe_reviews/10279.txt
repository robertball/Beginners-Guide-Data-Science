Okay, there was some work involved, but the end result was delicious and really dressed up the cookie tray.  I used this recipe with the assembly instructions from another recipe on this site (Neapolitan Cookies submittee by Missy) and it took some time, but they were NOT difficult to assemble and definitely worth the time! I've copied Missy's assembly instructions below and applied them to the Spumoni recipe. It looks more complicated than it is...give it a try!

Line a 9x5 inch loaf pan with waxed paper, (I used a glass pan so I could see if the layers were even) and spread chocolate dough evenly in the bottom of the pan. Spread the pistachio dough evenly over the chocolate layer, and top with cherry dough layer. Cover layered dough with waxed paper, and place in the refrigerator until firm, about 4 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Turn out chilled dough by inverting pan; peel off waxed paper. With sharp knife, cut dough lengthwise in half. (I trimmed the outer edges so the cookier corners would be nicely squared) Slice each half of dough crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Place slices on cookie sheet one inch apart. Bake 8 minutes minutes in the preheated oven, until puffed, but not browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

I've been making these for a few years, they have become a tradition. It's absolutely essential that you use the best ingredients, including real butter or these will taste like . I opt for the "au natural" look and omit the food coloring, they look fine. I also use marshino cherries (drain the juice off) with no problems other than the dough being a little sticky. Chilling it will solve that problem.

A cute colorful cookie.  Taste wise was ok.  Not a cookie I would crave.

I make these every year for my Christmas cookie trays and they are a hit! I use some chocolate extract in addition to the melted chocolate for a more intense flavor. I also use a little pistachio extract (when I have it) in with the pistachio layer too. I use a measuring cup to ensure equal parts. After baking/cooling, I dip one end into melted chocolate and everyone goes crazy! This is a fun recipe with beautiful results. :)

Put dough layers in 9x5 loaf pan to chill. I omit the red food coloring and use drained, chopped marashino cherries. My husband's favorite. Do not knead as much as called for or cookies will be too hard.

These were nice colorful cookies. Texture wise is okay but taste wise is rather bland. However, I dressed up the squares by lining them up and then drizzle white and dark chocolate and they not only look even better but also taste better.

These cookies are absolutely gorgeous and well worth the time. They are a twinkling bright spot on my cookie trays! (I use paste food colors for vivid red and green.) This year I'm thinking about substituting cherry chips for the candied cherries.

Pretty and easy, but, unfortunately, tasteless.

These were great!  Even though they turned out to look more like "Spumoni Rectangles", they still tasted lovely and made the cookie tray look fancy.

This is a very pretty and tasty cookie; however, extremely challenging to assemble!  These hold up well even after a few days and none of them went to waste!
