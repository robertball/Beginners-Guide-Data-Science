Delicious! I have to admit, as I was making this I kept thinking that I was gonna have to add garlic, but I wanted to try this as is first, and guess what...It didn't need it! This is super flavorful and I loved the sweet/tart of the pomegranate seeds. This would look great on a Christmas appetizer buffet w/ the red and green. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've tried several guacamole recipes and this one is great!  We loved the sweet taste that the pomegranate seeds added to the dip.  We didn't have the chile pepper on hand and forgot the S&P, but didn't miss them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's going in my 'repeater' collection!

Very tasty, very healthy (for a dip!) especially the next day after all the flavours have combined.

I made this to serve at a bridal shower this past weekend.  Everyone loved it and I was most pleased with how festive it looked with all the Mexican themed offerings.  The pomegranate seeds added a pop of color to the guacamole and such a sweet and fresh and vibrant taste.  Will definitely make this again.

We enjoyed this twist on our usual guacamole.  The crunch and the sweetness of the pomegranate arils provided a nice change.  Good with tortilla chips.
