This recipe is delicious as WRITTEN!  Great for a large family gathering.  To the reviewers criticizing this recipe questioning  "why make this recipe instead of lasagne" and "this is a copy of a BHG recipe from 30 years ago shame!" Please don't leave negative comments and ratings about the recipe when you haven't make it-- also your malicious  comments are TOTALLY out of line.  Go make some sugar cookies and put a smile on your face!

I made this last week and it made a TON of food. I gave a nice portion to a neighbor, and the other we ate every other night for a week. I used ricotta  cheese, and I make my own sauce using Papa John's Pizza Sauce recipe, which is sweet, spicy, and perfect for baking. To Answer Angelina, the reason this is so much better in some ways than lasagna is that the pasta is delicate (I used Angel Hair) and it absorbs every delicious drop of sauce. It is simple to prepare, too, and with another dollop of sauce over it, tastes better the next day. To each her own, and buono appetito!

I did use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Family preference. I did also added cooked ground beef  as suggested. Finished off with a salad and italian bread. Fabulous. Thanks for an easy way to put a spin on an old favorite.

I made this following recipe and ALL 3 kids loved it!!  That rarely happens!  I added a lb of gr. chuck but otherwise followed exactly.  I thought to myself while making, surely this cant have much flavor...but it did.  It was great.  Definitely will be making again.  If it can make every person in a family of 5 happy....it's a keeper in my book :)

I've made this for years, using ricotta instead of cottage cheese!! I, sometimes add a little meat and make more than the 12 oz. though, because everyone wants seconds!! You can never have too much!! To the person who commented about "who doesn't cook lasagna noodles", I don't, and never have....just add extra homemade sauce!!

I started making this recipe over 30 years ago -- a family favorite! I lost the recipe about 10 years ago and tried to recreate it recently.  So grateful to see it here!  This was the original recipe I clipped from Southern Living but over the years I changed it just a little adding ground meat to the sauce and exchanged the cottage cheese for ricotta. I also brush the edges of the pasta "crust" with olive oil just before baking to make it golden & crisp.

I made this in jumbo muffin pans & my kids LOVED it! I put meatballs on top that were lightly browned during the cook time. It wasn't very saucy, but it came out perfect-I'll Definitely be making this recipe again! TY!!

This was a hit with all in the family, which is a  rarity.  I would have given 5 stars but the recipe as written was pretty bland. When I make it again I'll add some  sauteed onion, garlic, basil and/or oregano to give it some life.

This is a delicious dish.  I did double the mozzarella cheese.  Next time I will try with Ricotta.  Served with BBQ Italian Sausage and a salad.  Perfect

At one time, this was a recipe I used for left over spaghetti. Now, I make spaghetti and meat sauce specifically to make spaghetti casserole as I think I prefer it over regular spaghetti. There are SO many ways in which to vary this recipe.

An outstanding recipe! I made a lower calorie version using a combination of zucchini "noodles" and regular pasta (not sure if all zucchini would've just gone flat upon cooking--plan on trying this next time), used egg beaters in place of the eggs, no-fat cottage cheese and my own homemade spaghettis sauce with meat. Even my picky 18 year old liked it, the rest of my family LOVED it!! I don't think I'll ever go back to lasagna again!!

It is not up to us to question why someone created a recipe.  I, for one don't understand eggplant.  However, I am not about to criticize someone because they created a recipe with it.  This is a good jumping off point recipe.

My teenage daughter, husband and I loved this dish.  It was nice and firm and a quick simple replacement for the long preparation of lasagne.  A five star in my opinion!

Very good. I'd make again. Made 6 servings. 
Changes: put pepperoni slices (and possibly black olives) over the Mozzerella cheese layer (which we added more than called for) then coat pepperoni with shredded cheddar cheese layer. Also can poke the spaghetti sauce through the noodles to disperse it throughout.

I made this with leftovers after having a double batch spaghetti dinner the night before.  I had also cooked extra spaghetti noodles al dente, so it was just a matter of assembling and baking it, resulting in a new and different dinner with almost no extra work. I put it in a deep dish pie pan to bake and sliced it into wedges. 
(The spaghetti sauce had ground beef, hot Italian sausage, onions, mushrooms, celery, green pepper and about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese in addition to the tomato sauce.)

I’ve also been making this for years.  I always substitute the cottage cheese with ricotta, and along with the ground beef I add hot Italian sausage that has been browned with onions and garlic. My family prefers the hot over the mild but I have used both and it’s just as good! I tweak the jar sauce a bit so it tastes homemade without having to cook it for hours. ( a couple of cans of tomato sauce, some beef stock, fresh basil, etc. usually does the trick).  Also, I have found that after I melt the butter, letting it cool a few minutes before I add the Parmesan cheese and beaten eggs, in that order, avoids the “scrambled egg” effect.  It makes a delicious coating for the noodles that makes this recipe a hit. I’ve become famous in my family for it. You will too!

Made as directed except I added ground beef. I think it would be fine using just two eggs and you need twice the cottage cheese than what's called for.

Simple recipe, incorporated the eggs and Parmesan into my baked spaghetti recipe because mine always tended to dry out and clump a bit.

my mom made this same recipe throughout my childhood, and I've always loved it! I use waaaayyyy more mozzarella and add a lb of ground beef, but the base recipe is a winner for sure.

Very easy to make and would serve an army. When I don it again I am going to add pepperoni or Italian sausage and perhaps some onion. It it's worth making again

Made this exactly as the recipe calls for for a friend after they had a baby. Wasn't sure about trying a new recipe for something like that, but we loved it so much, it's in our regular rotation for dinner!

Super easy to make and tastes great. I used ricotta and added ground turkey for extra protein. My husband isn't a big fan of spaghetti,  but liked this. The kids loved it too. I added extra sauce to the leftovers, as it was a bit dry.

I made a similar recipe before and found the spaghetti to be a bit bland.  I made this "lasagna style" with 2 layers and it turned out real tasty.  I probably used more than 28 oz of sauce because I had some in the fridge that I'd made a couple days before.  I'm sure I'll be making this again.

I had to reduce the quantities of each ingredient in order to use up the amount of leftover spaghetti that I found in the refrigerator and still stay true to the recipe. I must have gotten it right because the result was an outstanding  dish according to my wife. This recipe is a keeper!

Yummy is the first word that comes to mind. After reading how much this made from others I reduced the recipe in half since there is only 2 of us. (8oz speg)  I didn't want to waste or eat this for the rest of my life if ya know what I mean. The only other change I made was with the cottage cheese. It was just one of those things in my mind that made me shake my head at the thought of cooked cottage cheese. So to be fair I did put cottage cheese on half. Hubby liked it but I think my brain was still saying no way and I couldnt get up the nerve to try it. So I loved my half w/o cottage cheese just as much as Hubby liked his with it. One note of caution. Let the spaghettii cool a little before ading egg mixture or you will have scambled eggs

I made recipe according to directions with exception of using cottage cheese, I used ricotta instead based on other reviews. I also added about 3/4lb of lean ground beef.  My kids loved it! And they are a really hard crowd to please! My daughter had her friend over the day after I made it and they heated some up for lunch and her friend loved it too and asked how to make it so she could tell her mom. I think it is better heated up the second day. Only thing I wasn't pleased with is that the sauce didn't really get down into the pasta during cooking,  am wondering if that is because I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese or because of eggs mixed in with pasta madei it now fluffy on that level and sauce couldn't absorb.. So if you really want to taste the sauce I exommend hearing some up to spoon over it.  Overall this is a really good receipe, easy to make and like I said, great to heat up on second day - tastes even better then! I am going to continue to experiment with it and plan to make it often - my kids love pasta dishes!

When mixing the eggs, butter & parmesan cheese to the cooked spaghetti i got scrambled eggs.  I'm just a dad that tried to fix dinner and didn't know this would happen.  BUT... it was still very tasty.

This was a very good dish. My daughter loved it and she’s picky. It had the right amount of sauce and cheese ratio that she prefers. I on the other hand thought it could have used more sauce and less egg to not have it bind together so much. That could have been the type of noodle I used, bow tie,, because I didn’t have enough spaghetti noodles. I also added Italian seasonings and garlic, onion powder per our taste. Very easy to prepare and all staple ingredients that people have on hand. Def will make again. So yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so much better than lasagna because it not dry.  I added a half pound of ground beef and it was really good.  I'm thinking italian sausage or even kielbasa would be amazing in this recipe.  Maybe next time.

The only change I made was to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Other than the fact that I believe it could have used some additional salt, it was a very good recipe. I took it to a potluck luncheon and everyone was very complimentary. I will make this again.

Like a previous reviewer stated, the sauce stays on top regardless of my attempt to puncture the spread so that the sauce dips or spills into the noodles....In addition to that, it really lacked flavor despite my addition of salt, pepper and oregano.

I would strongly suggest altering the recipe to your liking with regard to seasoning and layering.

This is a super easy and convenient recipe for a family or casual dinner with friends.  Not wildly exciting but very tasty and satisfying.  Substituted ricotta and used vegetarian crumbles sauteed in onion, garlic and red pepper to kind of perk up the sauce (which i almost doubled).   Will make again - maybe with spinach or some kind of green for variety.

Outstanding recipe. Quick and easy to make. I always made a meat recipe with my own home made sauce in the past but lost the recipe. Nice to have a meatless option. No changes to the recipe. I don’t like it when people review and say I added this and that. If you do that then write your own recipe!  This was awesome as written. Will definitely make again.  Thanks!!!!

This is an easy dish to do, I mixed the recorta cheese with mozzarella cheese to give it elasticity , recorta cheese is quite neutral and need a kick, and mixed Romano with mozzarella cheese for topping to add test and color, it was great, try it!!

This recipe was great!  It made a lot of food, so the next time I'm invited to a potluck. I will be taking this.  I used ricotta cheese because I don't care for cottage cheese and I used more mozzarella cheese than the recipe calls for.  I also  seasoned some ground beef and added onion to my dish.

This was great! However I always replace butter with coconut oil. This time my husband bought the virgin kind of coconut oil which tastes like coconut. So it tasted like coconut which was kinda gross. But I think with the regular kind and adding sour cream this would be awesome.

Big hit with everyone in the family except one picky eater.  Wasn't a big fan of the egg bottom.  Will try 2 eggs next time!

Only changes were that I added a pound of browned ground beef, chopped onions, and minced garlic.  Then placed it on top of the spaghetti noodle layer.

It tasted great but it gave everyone in the house really bad gas. Because of that reason only, we won't be having it again. It's not an error on my part nor were any of the ingredients spoiled.

We call this Baked Spaghetti and this is our preferred  way to make spaghetti.  I do not use any eggs and I'm generous with all the cheeses and do not measure.  Always have gr chuck or smoke sausage in it and do use some shredded cheddar along with the other cheeses.  I also add a couple of teas of sugar to any prepared spaghetti sauce to cut down on the acidic taste of the tomatoes.    Even without eggs, I am able to cut this for serving and freeze the leftovers in foil.  I then plop the foil packet into an oven pan , add a little sauce and cheese to the thawed spaghetti, and re-bake for about 30 minutes for a great leftover meal at a later date.

My family enjoyed this but did think it needed some type of additional spice (I.E. garlic, onion, Italian seasoning etc.) We also want to add ground beef or sausage to it.  It was a great starting point but just needs a little more to make it truly flavorful.

Perfect use of ingredients that I had on hand! I added a pound of sweet Italian sausage sautéed with garlic and 2 small cans of sliced mushrooms. This meat mixture was my first layer in a slightly larger casserole dish. Great flavors! My new base recipe for this classic dish!

Made this recipe essentially as written the first time (except I added ground chicken) and found it was delicious - but too bland.Since then, I've added crushed garlic, Italian seasoning, parsley and diced mushrooms to the chicken, and found the flavour much improved! This has become a family favourite. A great make-ahead alternative to traditional spaghetti.

I've made this 3 times and it makes a lot of casserole, but we love it.  It's a great casserole to take to those in need of a meal.  In fact it's my new go to meal for that purpose.

This was disappointingly bland. And that's after I followed reviewer's advice and added garlic powder and onion powder to the noddles, and basil, parsley, and oregano to the cottage cheese. We did all eat it, but I won't be making this again.

This is a delicious way to use up leftovers 
The addition of eggs, butter, cheese make the pasta into a custard like first layer.  I used leftovers.  I used a 11x8 casserole dish, cut the number of eggs to 3, and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

We love lasagna and spaghetti and so I thought this would be a winner. Instead, we found the spaghetti became too dense when  heated horizontally and the sauce stayed mostly on top. We kept adding sauce as we ate it but overall were disappointed.

This is a lot like the casserole I make with leftovers. I had never really thought of making a scratch version. It leaves the door open to all kinds of innovations. The next time I try it I want to add some Italian sausage and some more Parmesan to the mix.

Great dish. Easy to prepare.  It is now a staple recipe in  our house.  I have started doubling the recipe so the kids can take it to school throughout the week.

Made as written and it was perfect. I love cottage cheese and the sauce on top was just the right amount.  Even used spinach pasta since that's what I had on hand. Delicious and easy.

Great  recipe to start with! I added ground beef browned with chopped garlic, onion and some seasonings. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Tasted awesome! Next time I make it I will add more cheese but I only had the amount of cheese the original recipe called for in my fridge at the time.  Very good template! Fill it in to you and your family's likes and dislikes!

This is a good recipe as is, although I strongly recommend using ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I used cottage cheese the first time around and a) the texture was completely off and b) it made the dish runny. You can certainly tweak this recipe to suit your own tastes, such as adding meat, onions, spices, etc.

This recipe wasn't what I call a "Do-Over." I used Ricotta cheese instead of Cottage, it's an Italian thing. I get the same result just adding these ingredients on my plate at the table.  There was no "baked" difference at all.

First, I made this with added ground turkey. It was delicious! Otherwise no changes. I don't measure dry pasta so that was a guesss as well as the mozzarella. But I'm certain I'll make this again.

I was looking for a recipe to recapture a food memory from childhood, and this seemed to come closest.  With this in mind, I made one significant change:  instead of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, I used equal amounts of cheddar and Colby-Jack cheese.  It smelled heavenly, and my family loved it.  And it was a bullseye as far as my memory of baked  spaghetti from long ago is concerned!! This will be a regular in our dinner line up....maybe with some sauteed sweet pepper added in next time, experimentally.

I added Italian sausage and my boyfriend and I thought it was terrific! The only problem I  had was that I  should have let the spaghetti cool more before adding it to the egg mixture otherwise it cooks the egg in clumps and I  had to stir it in quickly! I  will make it again!

This recipe is easy and tastes great!! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese (personal preference) and mixed into the spaghetti, along with 1tbsp of minced garlic, added one lb of ground chuck to the spaghetti sauce, and used whole wheat pasta. Amazing!

I really loved it. It was very easy to make, which I love! Next time, I would add more spaghetti sauce. It seemed to be dry the next day.I wouldn't use Prego Sauce (original sauce), instead I would use something more like the picture. Visually, the redder the sauce it looks better. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing. I made it with a meat sauce instead of just spaghetti sauce and my husband and picky eaters ate half the pan. I also never had cottage cheese so I never added it but it still turned out great. This one is going down in the recipe book forever.

My family, picky grandson included, loves this casserole. They want to eat at Mimi's house whenever it is on the menu! I add cooked meat to the sauce, substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese, and make no other changes.

I made this recipe using ground beef in my spaghetti sauce, as suggested, and some garlic powder.  It was a huge amount of food! Very tasty and my picky husband loved it. I froze probably half of it in single servings, and that came in very handy for us.  I also used cottage cheese, but next time I would probably use ricotta as others suggested. As another reviewer wrote, a nice twist on a standard meal. Thanks!

Yummy!  Great for large gatherings. I made my own spaghetti sauce ( sauce recipe made from best lasagna recipe ) and I also tempered the eggs before adding them to the warm noodles. Will make again. Much easier to make than lasagna.

This is good and fairly easy to put together.  I did add 1 pound of hamburger to the sauce.  This makes a huge casserole.  Next time I will cut this in half.

I've made this twice now. The first time I used cottage cheese, the 2nd time ricotta.  I didn't like the ricotta as well as the cottage cheese so when I make it again I will use cottage cheese. And I also added ground beef. We think it tastes the same as lasagna and much easier.

I made this a couple weeks ago for my family of three and it didn't last past the second day with my 19 year old son around. The only change I made was to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. It was a big hit, easy to prepare, and I will most definitely be making it again.

My family did enjoy this. I did add a pound of ground beef to it. It really makes it a hardier meal this way. I also added some seasoning to the spaghetti/egg/cheese mixture. The cottage cheese actually worked well. I will try ricotta next time to see how that differs.

This is awesome......with a couple of changes.  I used 1# ground beef, about 12 mushrooms & an onion.  I saute'd the mushrooms, also the onions + 1tsp minced garlic, & added S&P + the jar of sauce.  turned out 2 lg. dishes....one 9x13 & one 8x8.... really good!

We loved this dish. It is comfort food at its best. I did make some changes, not because the recipe was flawed but just out of personal preference. I did add ground beef which made it very filling, a very hearty dish. It called for a jar of spaghetti sauce but I made my own with onions, celery & mushrooms. I also added extra mozzarella cheese (you can't have too much of a good thing! )
 My only complaint would be that the spaghetti layer was bland so next time I would add a little more seasoning to that portion, otherwise it is a stunning recipe and I will make it again & again.

This is the best spaghetti casserole recipe I have had the pleasure of making and consuming. I had been using a couple of recipes and my whole family agreed this one was the best. I made a double batch to have plenty for lunches and another dinner. I followed the recipe exactly but added two pounds of ground beef. Mmm!!

It was a lot of food and super easy but in the end it just tasted like spaghetti-o's.  I'm sure I could chose a fancier sauce and add some meat to give it some flavor/texture but that would be a different recipe.

The ingredients are basically a combo of lasagna and spaghetti, so what could be bad. I can't answer it except that my family of boys and men wouldn't even go back for seconds. I'll have to take this off my favorites.

This was delicious! Ended up inviting another family of five over and it was perfect.   So easy. No one likes cottage cheese, I didn't tell them it was cottage cheese at first. No complaints!!! Yea!!!

This recipe is fantastic just as is!  My family doesn't really care for spaghetti but they gobbled this up and my 5 yr old asked if we could please have leftovers.  I used half hamburger and half Italian sausage because that's what was handy and it was delicious!

I made this according to the recipe. It did not have enough flavor for me. Next time I would salt and garlic to the cottage cheese mixture. Perhaps some jalapeno to spice it up.

My family loved this!! Thankfully it makes a lot!!   It's easy and quick to make so it's perfect for a week night! The only thing I changed was I used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Great dish and I will be making this again!! Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe!!

This was fantastic; only changes were to use Ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and fresh basil.  Oh, and an extra egg.  Both my children asked for seconds (VERY rare) and my husband said it took all the discipline he had not to.  :-)  Thanks for the nice and easy recipe!

Not a review, I haven't made it  yet but want to. I don't like ricotta, or fetta cheeses, and have never cared for cottage cheese any other way than cold. Can you suggest a cheese replacement for the cottage cheese?

I just want to say that this is something you can also do with plain leftover pasa in sauce...just adjust amounts of remaining ingredients.

This is a family favorite, but I make it  a day or 2 after a spaghetti dinner night. This is great as a way to use up any leftover spaghetti and meat sauce ( that is why I make extra for the initial meal)  and it is just a different spin   and everyone enjoys the cheese (cottage, parmesan and mozzarella)!

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a very watery pasta dish.  More like soup than casserole. Yuck.
