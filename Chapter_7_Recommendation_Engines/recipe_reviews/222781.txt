I've been making these for years. I use either left over beef gravy, or a can of beef or mushroom gravy. Regular salt and pepper, no MSG, or Worcestershire sauce (but I will try that, sounds good) and two slice's of Swiss cheese per burger, sometimes some sauteed onions in the mushroom gravy, bring lots of napkins, and maybe a fork and knife :) Yum!

After searching ALL the recipes for a Mushroom Swiss Burger, this recipe is closest to what you're probably looking for.  I do recommend using fresh sliced white mushrooms instead of canned...Also, NO MSG needed!! But most important to kick it up a notch is to add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of A-1 Steak Sauce to the mushroom mixture. This is a very rich & savory mushroom sauce!  You won't be disappointed!!

Ok. This is close, oh so close but not quite there. The first thing I noticed is the color of the mushroom sauce. It's off, more golden due to the can soup. After reading other reviews, I believe next time I will add brown gravy to the ingredients, halving the amount of golden mushroom soup, making up the original amount with the gravy. I also added a little garlic powder. Closer yet. With that being said, I found this to be the most satisfying burger. Definitely will continue to make & fiddle with the ingredients until it is, in my opinion, exactly a Hardee Mushroom Swiss.

Yum, these were good! I have no idea what fast food restaurant this is from though. I did think that the hamburger seasonings made them have the same flavor of what I remember the fast food hamburgers tasting. I used 90% lean beef, but added a tsp of vegetable oil to the pan so they would fry up. The medium heat suggested worked well, I cooked them on 6 on my burner. They were done in the 10 minutes suggested. I couldn't find processed swiss, so I went with a thin sliced lite swiss I found at the store. The sauce doesn't taste great on it's own, but it works fine on the burger. I doubled the burger, seasonings, and buns because I thought it was a lot of sauce and there was still some leftover. ty

I made a few changes. I used ground chuck instead of ground beef, because it was on sale. I used fresh mushrooms and natural swiss instead of the jarred mushrooms and processed swiss, just because I like them better. I omitted the MSG because I never make anything else that calls for it and didn't want to buy it just for this. I agree with the reviewer who said the mushroom sauce doesn't taste very good on it's own, but tastes good with the burger. I thought the seasoning (minus MSG) and cook time on the burger was spot on. Very juicy, with a good flavor. Will make again, but will probably try and find a way to jazz up or replace the mushroom soup, so it tastes a bit better on it's own.

It really is flavorful and it makes a dry hamburger a lot juicier and something special. I used a plain old hamburger, cooked it and topped it with the sauce. 
                  Thanks

Don't hate me cuz really though I changed it just a bit it was just a recipe misunderstanding. I cooked up the burger and then added everything to it so it was this luscious scoopable goodness. I put it on whole wheat toast with some provolone cheese and wow, is this stuff good!!! Oh and I skipped the MSG-don't have any and it doesn't seem like a good idea.
