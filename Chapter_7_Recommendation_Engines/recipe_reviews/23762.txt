I've made this cake a few times and found other similar recipes. I loved it as is, but I've found it a bit better with the following changes:  I use a butter-recipe yellow cake mix and add a teaspoon of coconut extract to the dough.  After baking, I used ONLY the cream of coconut (not the sweetened condensed milk), then topped with whipped topping and coconut.  I served this for Father's Day this year and my family could not believe how good it was.  I think the cake texture is better without the condensed milk.

This turned out wonderfully, both as a pan/sheet cake and as a layer cake. I'm in agreement with what seems to be a growing consensus here that the sweetened condensed milk is best omitted, and I also used a butter recipe yellow cake mix and made my own whipped cream. I tried it as written first, and while tasty and fantastic in its ease of preparation and foundation for other versions, in my opinion, the cool whip really imparts that "instant" or packaged taste and detracts from what otherwise tastes like it is made from scratch and must have been a lot of work (not!). I added 1 tsp. of coconut extract to the cake batter. For the whipped cream I added powdered sugar and vanilla to taste while whipping -- not too sweet with all the sweetened coconut. I used a skewer to make the holes, and made lots of them, being careful not to go all the way to the bottom of the pan, resulting in a very moist cake but not at all soggy on the bottom. I took some time to work the coconut creme into the holes, spreading thoroughly and using the skewer again to insert into the holes and help the creme to go in. I used room temperature Coco Lopez coconut creme, and poured it on while the cake was still hot, after resting 5-10 minutes on a rack. I covered with foil and refrigerated overnight, and made the topping the next day. The result is phenomenal and a huge hit with everyone who tries it. As others have said, even those lukewarm on coconut rave about it. In a word: Score!

I make this cake all the time.  It is not necessary to allow the cake to cool before pouring the cream of coconut/condensed milk mixture onto the cake.  I tend to make the cake in the evening and stick it in the fridge.  In the morning, I just mix up the whipped topping and coconut (and I add 1/2 cup chopped pecans) and spread it on in the morning.  I, too, am now expected to bring his cake to work whenever we have a carry in.  You won't be disappointed!  One last thing -- DON'T use a cake mix with pudding in it or you'll end up with coconut glop.

I found coconut cream at an Asian Grocery store.
There is a difference between coconut cream and cream of coconut.  Coconut cream is like coconut milk but contains alot less water and is also unsweetened.  Cream of coconut is basically coconut cream that has been processed and sweetened for use in desserts and drinks.  If you use coconut cream for this recipe then you will need to use sweetened condensed milk.

I have been searching for a moist coconut cake for a long time, and I think this is it! Some I have tried are much more involved and don't turn out half as tasty as this..the cream of coconut is located in the drink mixer isle of the grocery store, coco lopez is the one I have had the best luck with. Chilling this cake well is key to the success of the recipe..

This is a perfect coconut cake recipe - easy & incredibly tasty.  The only basic changes I made were to use a fork instead of a straw to poke the holes, pour the cream/cond milk mixture while the cake is still hot and I made fresh whipped cream.  I didn't have to use all 10 oz of the flaked coconut either.  The key to this cake is to refrigerate it overnight so the cake has a chance to set and the milk mixture really soaks in.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a really yummy cake. I did use half of the whipped cream called for and about 3 ounces less of the coconut. The next time I make it, I will probably use about 2/3 of the cream of coconut and milk mixture because it was almost a bit too much. I think you could reserve the remaining 1/3 cup of it for drizzling for a nice presentation. Overall though, this was a really good, quick and easy dessert to make that was eaten FAST.

This was a wonderful cake! Another almost identical recipe recommended putting the sauce over the cake while it was still warm, and that is how I did it. The bottom of the cake ended up almost soggy, but very good. Maybe waiting until the cake cooled would have been better. Definitely wait until it's cool to put the cool whip on top!! I made it as a thank-you for a friend, and she said she ate the whole thing in two days!! It was very good and very easy.

This cake is so simple and soooo good!! I used the end of a wooden spoon to poke the holes in the cake and only used about 3/4 of the liquid.  I didn't use all the coconut the recipe called for either...just enough to cover the top well.  It is really a yummy cake.

I made this as a layer cake for my mom's birthday. I made it two days early and let it set in the fridge without the frosting then frosted it on her birthday. I was worried I would have too much cake but there were no leftovers.  My family loved it and has requested for our next two family get togethers.

This recipe is the absolute BEST coconut cake ever! I tried it at Easter and everyone loved it so much that they request it all the time. People at work request it frequently. It's so easy! Poking the holes and pouring the mixture evenly into the holes takes a little time, but it's fun
for the kids. I love this cake! Thanks so much, Julia.

I could not find coconut cream anywhere. It would have been helpful to know that it's a cocktail mixer. I substituted 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 teas. coconut extract. I used about half the sweetened condensed milk, and about 4 ounces of coconut milk. It seemed too thin so I added a few tablespoons of instant vanilla pudding mix. The result was fantastic! Surprising light, moist and creamy. It was super yum. I forgot to add that I substituted coconut milk for water in the prepared cake mix. Anyway, apparently this recipe is extremely forgiving and comes out five-star even if you don't have the right ingredients. :)

This is probably the best cake I've ever had! I made as a layer cake (sons birthday) and used real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. I sweetened the whipped cream with powdered sugar and added coconut extract instead of vanilla. The cake itself I made as written and wouldn't change a thing. I'd give 10 stars if I could.

This was incredible! I did add a little coconut extract to the cake batter, baked in 2 9-inch cake pans, and spread the cream of coconut over it while it was still hot. I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions not to add the sweetened condensed milk. I am so glad I followed their advice! It was perfect just with the cream of coconut! For the frosting, I used Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting from this site and garnished with toasted coconut and chopped dark chocolate covered almonds on top. Everyone loved this! My three year old son asked if I would make this for his birthday next year!

I was given this recipe about 20 yrs. ago and lost it so I was thrilled to have found it listed here on All Recipes.  This is not a cake for sugar or coconut wimps.  The flavor is powerful and is one of the best cakes I have ever eaten.  I think it is better if made and left to sit overnight in frig. before serving.  Thanks for giving me back this recipe!

I start with Duncan Hines Coconut cake mix.  Cream of coconut is the key.  I find it in the wine/drink section of the grocery store.  It's what some bars use to make pina coladas.  A chopstick or BBQ skewer makes just the right size hole and you don't lose any of the cake.  For variations I add chopped pecans and/or crushed pineapple before smoothing on the coconut and whipped topping.

I substituted coconut milk for cream of coconut because I couldn't find the cream at the grocery store and I made my own whipped cream.  That said, while my friends thought the cake was good (not great) I could taste the sweetened condensed milk in the background and it just felt too artificial for my preference.  I'll try another recipe.

This was the best cake I have ever made. The first time I made it with everything they say. The second time I used a yellow cake and I left out the sweetened condensed milk because the cake was just too sweet the first time. I also didn't used Cool Whip because I don't like it very much and would rather have real whipped cream. I used the recipe for sturdy whipped cream from this site its sorta like a cream cheese frosting and whipped cream but it's perfect for this cake. I also put toasted coconut and not toasted on top. Such a good cake. This works alright for cupcakes too but the bottom gets sticky I just put a teaspoon at a time and spred it on top

I have been making this recipe for years and my fiance swears it's his favorite cake (he doesn't usually like cake!).  However, I use butter recipe yellow cake mix instead of the white cake mix and thawed frozen coconut instead of flaked.  It's wonderful!!!

Honestly, have taken this dessert to a few different gatherings, even people who said "ehhhh, coconut is not my fave but ill try it " have said that this is one of the best cakes ever. Definitely, however, spoil your friends with the extra calories and work and use real whipped cream, maybe sweetened with a scratch of vanilla sugar. Wayyyyyyy better than plastic-y whipped topping.

This is a really great and easy recipe but you don't need the condensed milk, and when you pour the liquids into the cake be sure the cake is still hot and in the cake pan and let it sit in the fridge over nite, all the liquid will be completely absorbed.

I make a coconut cake for my daughter's birthday  every year and have been in search of the perfect recipe.  This is it!  Everyone loved it. I did use the butter cake mix, added a tsp of coconut extract to the cake batter and omitted the sweetened condensed milk as recommended. Also for the topping I made a 4.6 oz package of NON-INSTANT vanilla pudding using only 1 cup of milk.  After allowing it to cool I mixed it with an 8 oz container of whipped topping. Amazing!!!

Downright decadent!  It was so deliciously moist; I couldn't believe it when I went back a couple hours later for another piece and it was even better!  The longer the cake sets, the more the milk mixture soaks in.  My new favorite cake recipe - can't wait to take it to our next family gathering!

I have made this twice, and everyone loved it. It is not as good, though not nearly as much work, as a traditional coconut cake, but, oh boy, will it do in a pinch! If you are thinking of trying this for the first time--well, it tastes just like a Pepperidge Farm coconut cake that you get from the freezer section of your supermarket.

Absolutely FABULOUS!   I read some comments and followed suggestions of others (such as not poking the  straw all the way to the bottom).  I used this recipe for a baby shower and doubled the recipe (made a 4 tier cake)...it was gorgeous!  I received lots of compliments.

I agree with most reviewers who suggest NOT using the condensed milk. It is plenty sweet without & TOO sweet with. Overall it was a definite hit! Thanks.

Instead of a box mix, I made my own cake with a Paula Dean basic recipe.  I used whole wheat white flour instead of the traditional white.  This helped absorb the liquid. I didn't have whip topping, so I mixed up a thin layer of powdered sugar icing.  I topped it with shreaded coconut...and chocolate chips.  HUGE HIT!

Made this for my parent's 65th anniversary party as an alternative to the store bought decorated cake which we also served.  Made it as the recipe directed and it turned out great!  I was stunned with how many compliments it received and it was far preferred to the fancier cake.  We sliced it in the kitchen out of the 9x13 pan and put the slices on a raised crystal platter and they stood well on their own and were very moist.  I was very surprised at how good it tasted with just a coolwhip and coconut topping but it blended beautifully with the coconut cream and condensed milk already poured on the cake.  I noticed that the first holes I made in the cake went all the way to the bottom of the pan and those were wetter on the bottom of the cake (but not bad).  The rest of the holes, I didn't push all the way to the bottom and the cake wasn't as wet on the bottom in those areas.   I will definitely make this again!

I have been making this recipe for 5 years, since I printed it from allrecipes.com.  There is nothing to say that could improve this cake.  I brought it into work today for a birthday, and as usual it was a major hit, and I was asked for the recipe by several people.  I usually make a yellow cake, in a sheet pan, and sometimes use a large container of whipped topping and a large bag of coconut.  You don't need to do that, but I work with a lot of coconut lovers.  They think I am amazing and they have no idea of how easy this was.  I almost hate to tell them, lol.

This is a very easy cake to make, and the outcome is excellent.  I was reluctant to use the entire amount of the liquid on it since it was starting to puddle in the corners, and it was still nice and moist.  I used only an 8 oz. container of Cool Whip because I wanted the dominant flavor to be coconut, not Cool Whip, and I thought that was plenty.  Eight people loved it, and most had a second piece.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.

This was very good!!! I liked the holes in the cake because it made it very moist! Although i made a few changes:

-Used chocolate cake instead of vanilla, i dont like vanilla
-Didnt have cream of coconut so i mixed a tiny bit of coconut milk with it

I recomend this! its so good!

This cake is easy to make and very tasty.  Lots of people asking for seconds! I only used half of the coconut flakes on top, I think that it would be too overpowering otherwise.  I suggest to make the cake a day or two ahead to allow the ev milk/coconut cream mixture to absorb completely into the cake before frosting it. We had a Luau for our 30th anniversary and the cake was a big hit. Did taste taste the recipe on my husband and co-workers first, and they all loved it.

This cake was delicious and a big hit and the party I was at.  I cut out the sweetened condensed milk to make it a little less rich, and it was almost perfect

While the flavours of this cake were superb, I was disappointed in that the liquid settled straight to the bottom.  I was hoping they would permeate the cake with coconutty gooeyness.  For this to happen, I think I'd probably need a lighter, sponge-like cake, or thinner liquid mixture (using coconut milk rather than coconut cream for example).

Still, everyone enjoyed it.  The perfect foil for this cake was one of Jamie Oliver's recipes:  thinly sliced fresh pineapple, topped with mint sugar (ie. mint and sugar pounded together with mortar and pestle).

I just made this for two different family Easter gatherings, and it was a hit.  I followed other reviewers' advice and didn't poke the holes all the way down.  Also, I couldn't find cream of coconut OR coconut cream in the can, so I used creamed coconut found in the grocery aisle where Thai food is sold.  It is unsweetened, pure creamed coconut in a brick shape.  I put almost the whole brick in a measuring cup and added warm water a little at a time, constantly mixing with a spoon until it was the creamy consistency in the video.  I did add the condensed milk, and was hesitant given all the reviewers who said it  was too sweet, but it was delicious!  You don't need to add all the liquid if you don't want to; it will still be yummy!  Will definitely make this again; thanks for all the helpful advice!

My husband loved this and so did 3 out of 4 of my young children.  I thought it was pretty good.  I could not find Cream of Coconut so I used Coconut Milk( I think it was, but not sure.  I just know it wasn't cream).  So, I think if I had found and used cream- it may have been much better.  I'll give it 4 stars because my husband loved it and I didn't follow the "cream" part.

I made this yesterday for my husband for father's day.   I made the cake the night before refrigerated it and topped with whipped topping and toasted coconut the next day. The cake came out good I just thought it was very sweet.  I usually love sweet things so it's unusual for me to think this!  Next time I make it I think I will try it with out the condensed milk to see if it tastes more like coconut and  little less sweet.  The toasted coconut on top was so good!

Great recipe. I baked this for my mom's birthday.  She is a huge coconut and chocolate fan. So I used devil's food cake mix.  When it was cooled and frosted I shaved chocolate on top.  It looked beautiful and tasted even better. Thanks.

I use a french vanilla cake and add a few drops of coconut flavoring.  Also, I do not use the condensed milk.  I usually use food coloring in the coconut - just for some fun - and today I added some fresh blueberries to the top.
My dad says this is the moistest, most delicious coconut cake he's ever had.  Making it again today for Father's Day!

This is a delicious cake, but I don't think it was as fantastic as other reviewers found it. Cool, moist and flavorful. We enjoyed it, and I will make it again but there are other cake recipes I like better.

This is an awesome cake.  Everybody loved it. I don't even like cake that much and I couldn't stop eating it! It reminds me of tres leches cake, very sweet.

 I used a round springform cheesecake pan to make it. There was way too much of the liquid mixture for the top ( I used Coco Lopez from the mixer aisle) so I froze the leftover and will use it for the next cake.  16 oz of cool whip was WAY too much.  You can easily use half that.  Also, I toasted part of the coconut and it was real pretty, very contrasty and professional looking.

Today I'm going to make it again to bring to a party but I'm going to make it a pina colada cake!  I'm gonna use pineapple cake mix and mix some rum with the liquid mixture for the top. Thanks for this great, easy and quick recipe! :)

Very yummy and very moist... it's a sugar explosion. I made a few changes. I made my own whipped cream instead of using Cool Whip. I used a cup and a half of tiny chocolate  chips in the cake mix and shaved chocolate and almonds in addition to coconut on frosting. I also transferred the cake off the cookie sheet after the inverting process once the sweetened milk and coconut mixture had sunk into cake. i chilled it over night then frosted. Its a pretty cake especially if you make it in two layers. It's kind of flat other wise.

Delicious!  Family loved it and will make again for sure.  I also made as a layer cake.  I took advice from another reviewer and poked holes with a fork.  I thought that the coconut cream/condensed milk mixture was way too much, I only used about 1/4 of it and it was fine.  Toasting the coconut added amazing flavor also.  This recipe was so good that I think next time I will whip my own cream for it!  Excellent!

I made this for work and everybody loved it. I only used about 1 cup of mixture on each 9"cake I made. I frosted it with a coconut frosting recipe from this site - so I could more easily decorate the cake.

This cake was very easy to make. I used the yellow cake mix and a skewer to make the holes. I toasted my coconut and added pecans to the top. I didn't use all the coconut it called for. I thought it had a very coconutty taste. I was a little skeptical when drowning it in the 2 milks. I thought it was just going to be a soggy mess. I let it sit overnight in the fridge and all melded together nicely. I took it to my son's teacher appreciation luncheon and everybody seem to love it. There was nothing to bring home. It is very sweet. For the cost and the ease of assembly, I will definately make again for another function or my family.

Made this for my grandma's birthday today. She absolutely loved it, and she's a coconut cake expert! Was also the best one I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly,and it was super easy. Baked in a 9x13 inch glass pan. When looking for the cream of coconut at Walmart, I found it in the alcohol section near the drink mixes (like for a pina colada).

The recipe is good as is, but I have been making it for years with the following changes. I make my own cake, just a simple 1234 cake, then I use about 3/4 of the can of coconut, omit the condensed milk. I make it in an oval casserole dish that has a little depth. Finally, I make my own whip cream. There is never any left when I take it somewhere. Kids and adults love it. You use a spoon to serve rather than a k knife. Again, it is fine without any changes, but this makes it homemade. If you want to use a box use the no pudding butter cake recie.

Just wanted to say this cake was a special treat for me and very delicious.  Also instead of a straw I used the large end of a chop stick to make the holes in the cake.  Didn't have any straws!  Thank You for sharing this recipe.  Chefwannabe

Yummy! I used a devils food caked mix. I did use both the cream of coconut (in the mixed 
drink aisle) and the sweetened condensed milk, but I didn't end up using all of the mixture, maybe 1/3 of it. Also, made my own whipped cream and toasted the coconut. Next time, I plan on drizzling melted chocolate over the toasted coconut and adding some slivered almonds on top. Should taste just like an almond joy that way!

I liked this recipe, for the most part.  I used a yellow cake mix and made two eight inch rounds.  I also omitted the milk, which was good because this cake was a bit too far on the sweet side for me, and I have a real sweet tooth.   The cream of coconut was almost the consistency of Crisco with the oils from it separated to the top.  I had to take it out of the can and warm it in the microwave for a bit to get it to a liquid form.  I made the cakes late in the morning and poured the cream over them and let the cakes sit in the fridge for about eight hours before I frosted it with the coolwhip.  I toasted the coconut, and the presentation was beautiful.  I did find that the leftovers the next day were a little soggy, so its best eaten the same day.  The yellow cake seem to enhance the sweetness of the cream of coconut. If I made it again, I would use a chocolate cake mix, in hopes that the chocolate would offset that sweetness a little.

I found this to be an easy cake to make. as your end result is worth while waitting for. I made two, as I new one wouldn't make it all the way through to the end of the process, I gave it three days  to sponge up all the creamy goodness, my family loved this one and I will definetly be makeing this one again . I have a few thourghts on adding a little extra next time I'll let you know how it turns out.

Wonderful cake! I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions, I added 1 tsp of coconut extract to the cake batter and I toasted the coconut in a 325 degree oven for twenty minutes. I will definately be making this one again and again.

This cake was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except  I toasted half of the coconut on top.  The consistency was perfectly creamy. I poked the holes in it right out of the oven then refrigerated for about 2 hours before adding the topping.

We loved this cake.  I will definitely make again, probably trying some of the variations others mentioned (pineapple, nuts, etc).  I seemed to avoid the gooey bottom some reviewers experienced.  I used chopstick and poked LOTS of holes all over it.  I also really worked with the cream to keep it filling the holes and not just filling in down the sides of the cake. I think this helped to keep the moistness inside the cake rather than collecting at the bottom to make a soggy mess.

This cake is to die for! I only use an 8 pz. can of cream of coconut, heat it with the can of condensed milk and pour it on the cake right out of the oven, after poking holes in it, of course. I do let it sit for 5 minutes before putting the holes in it. I use a meat fork. I also toast the coconut before putting it on top of the cake. Be sure to make this the night before, chill in the fridge and add the whipped topping and toasted coconut the next day. Everyone raves about this cake!

My MIL introduced me to this recipe about 30 years ago, and it's been a family favorite ever since.  It's heavenly!  The only change I started making a few years ago is to only use 1/2 the coconut/milk mixture on top of the cake.  I freeze the other 1/2 of the mixture for another cake.  The cake still comes out beautifully and is absolutely delicious, but I think has a better texture, and isn't quite as high in calories this way.  Love it!

I think this is the best cake in the world! The only thing I did different was making a seven minute frosting and of course loads of coconut. I also put a teaspoon of coconut extract in the cake and also the frosting. Five stars.

I recently made this cake for my husband.This cake reminds me of a pound cake with its sugary glaze. You should let the cake cool before adding the cream of coconut which is basically a pinacoloda drink mix. I didn't add the condensed milk per other reviews (the cream of coconut is very sweet).I chose to make 2 round cakes, but I would recommend a sheet cake because it is easier to pour the cream of coconut onto the cake in the pan and let it sit and absorb overnight. I would also recommend per other reviews of adding 1 tsp of coconut extract to cake mix.  I used Duncan Hines white cake mix because I believe the texture for this recipe is more forgiving for a pound cake recipe. This is a very easy recipe to follow. I am choosing to make the sturdy whip cream frosting to give this cake a more authentic look.

Very very good. I did as a few others I used a yellow cake mix and omitted the sweetened cond. milk. Also made my own whipped cream using a pint of heavy cream 1. cup sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. SOOOO Good! I had to make two My first one was for work and then the 2nd was for the family. Very easy to make Will make again.

This cake was awesome!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and only used the cream of coconut versus combining with the sweetened condensed milk, and it was amazingly moist and delicious.  I also used a very light cream cheese frosting instead of whipped cream, and everyone really liked that as well.  So delicious!

This cake was delicious!! I made it for St Patty's day and made the frosting green! It was a hit! Very easy to make. The most difficult part was finding cream of coconut which I ended up finding in the drink mixer section at my local grocery store. Will make again! Thanks!

Cake is my obsession! I love, love, love it! I'm a sucker for easy and delicious recipes and this is definitely one of them. I've made this cake a few times and will make it hundreds more. Everyone loves it and can't believe how simple it is. The only thing I changed is the cake mix. I prefer yellow cake so I use that. When I get some coconut extract I'll be adding a dash to my cake mix and when I get some extra time on my hands I'll try making the homemade whipped cream. Thanks so much for posting this! :)

PURE AWESOMENESS. Note be careful pouring the stuff over the top. I accidentally had it flow all over. Recommend putting the cake in a bowl or something.

My husband made this cake for me last week. It is excellent! He did forget to buy the sweetened condensed milk, so he made it without and it was still delicious! He also made his own whipped cream instead of cool whip and toasted some of the coconut for the topping. Great recipe-- thanks for sharing!!

I made this as a birthday cake and added sprinkles to the top. I made 2 round cakes and layered them. Poked holes in both and filled in the holes and drizzled with the condensed milk and cream of coconut. Added coconut to the middle. Topped with cool whip, coconut, and sprinkles.

So yummy! I made this cake for my brother's birthday because coconut is his favorite, and it was a huge hit! Everyone in the family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except for drizzling some melted semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 1/3 cup) on top of the cake before adding the whipped topping and coconut. My brothers loves Mounds candy cars (chocolate and coconut), so I thought the chocolate would be a nice touch. I used the end of a wooden spoon to poke holes in the cake, and I didn't wait for the cake to cool before doing so.

This was our dessert for Easter dinner and everyone loved it, even my son-in-law who doesn't normally eat sweets.  It was very moist, flavorful.  Next time I will cut the amount of cream of coconut (just a tad).

This cake received raves reviews from everyone at Thanksgiving...it was very easy to make, although a bit difficult finding the cream of coconut. It was definitely worth the search, though! I only used half the can of sweetened condensed milk with the whole can of cream of coconut and the cake flavor came out just right...moist, but not over-powering. I used the straw to poke holes and toasted the coconut....an entire bag is not necessary, but I kept the remaining toasted coconut in a container and used it later. This is a keeper!!

Love this recipe. I didn't use all the cream of coconut and milk, but did mix some of what was left in with the cool whip just for a little more flavor. It was really good! Easiest cocnut cake I ever made.

I made this cake twice - once as written - and once with only the cream of coconut. My family preferred the omission of the sweetened condensed milk. Thus the 4 stars instead of five. Otherwise, a delicious recipe.

Have made this many times and always a winner!  Tastes better the 2nd day. Also, sometimes when I don't need a whole sheet cake, I'll make the cake in 2 round 8-9" pans. I'll freeze one cake for use another time and use the other for this recipe. I use a wooden spoon to poke holes and halve the other ingredients (using 7oz coconut milk, 7oz condensed milk, 8oz Cool Whip, 5oz coconut). I'll cover the cake and put in fridge overnight. Next day before serving, I'll frost with Cool Whip and sprinkle w/flaked coconut. Also tried the suggestion to place a few pineapple wedges upright on cake. Excellent idea!

Yummmmmmmmmo!! I made this for a BBQ we were having and me and my friend could have just drank the milk..lol  It is wonderful and really sweet.. If you add pineapple to the top of the cake it becomes a pina coloda cake.  Which is just as good. thanks m

This was a quick and easy cake to prepare, and tasted delicious!  I could not find cream of coconut, so I just poured condensed milk on the top, after I poked the holes with the handle of a wooden spoon.  I used approx. 12 oz. of Cool Whip, and then covered and refrigerated overnight.  Super!

I did not have a straw so I used a fork to poke the holes.  I think a straw would definitely work better and let more of the milk mixture soak down into the cake.  Otherwise, the cake was delicious!

Moist, delicious, and it really does get better after being in fridge overnight.  Even great on the 3rd day.  I made many, many small holes atop with a large serving fork. Pour the coconut liquid atop slowly and carefully, trying hard not to let it run over the edges.  It needs no whipped cream atop!  Instead I made a very light glaze (powdered sugar, tiny bit of milk, and few drops of coconut flavoring,) and put a very thin covering of this on top, after the 12 hr refrigeration.  Then divided the 9x13 cake in half and topped each half, while glaze was still damp, with coconut:  used toasted sweet coconut on 1/2 and used regular sweetened white coconut on the other.  I served it in narrow slices, two of one topping and one of the other, lined up together on a dessert plate, kind of like a slice of Napolitano ice-cream.

I made this and enjoyed it. It was easy to make. My daughter helped make it and that thrilled her. It is a bit too much mixture to pour over, but the cake absorbs it overnight. As I cut the cake, I rubbed some of the "goo" out of the pan onto the cake so it would stay fresh. So, having a little too much "goo" is a good thing. I will definatly make this again! Although, I may add some pecans and use a different cake pan.

Wow!  Easiest recipe EVER!  I made this for my son's preschool Easter party and the kids went nuts over it!  I listened to other reviewers and didn't use the condensed milk, but followed all other directions.  It was perfect!  I added the cream of coconut while the cake was still hot and then refrigerated it overnight.  Will definitely make again.

I am always looking for easy recipes. This is a wonderful cake but soooo sweet. I did make some changes. First of all i left out the condensed milk due to the can i had being 5 yrs old. I added 2 mashed bananas and a small can of crushed pineapple. I used an 8 oz container of cool whip. It was really good. Will make it again and again. Thanks!

This is a super simple cake. I made in a 9x13 inch sheet pan. It was quick and easy to make and tasted just like a macaroon. The look of the cake even in the pan was a beautiful presentation. I used untoasted and toasted coconut for the topping.

VERY easy to make!! I did omit the sweetened condensed milk because the cream of coconut was sweet enough by itself.  I used a skewer to poke the holes and a clean medicine syringe (like for kids) to inject the creak of coconut into all the holes. This made it SO much easier! I made it for my Mothers birthday and after the cake was cut all was quiet in the room and all you heard was mmmm mmmm mmm LOL. I don't like coconut so I didn't try it but everyone else said it was GREAT!

I had the worst craving for coconut cake and found this recipe. My kids can't have any artificial flavors, colors or preservatives so this took some modification. I used a family recipe for the white cake and baked that. I skipped the sweetened condensed at the advice of many reviewers. I used a condensed coconut cream and added a bit of heavy cream to it and poured that over the punctured cakes. I also cut each of the 2 cakes onto 2 to end up with a 4 layer cake. Make a cream cheese, whipped cream frosting and put that in between each layer. The top and sides I frosted and put the flaked coconut as well as toased crushed pecans all around. My kids are pretty picky but were in love with this. Husband isnt a huge coconut fan but even he had to admit it was stellar. It did hold better and have a better texture after being chilled overnight so I would recommend making it a day early. Definately a favourite!

Excellent recipe.  I used about 2/3 of the cream of coconut mixture which was more than enough.  The cake comes out incredibly moist unlike any other coconut cake recipe I've tried.  I'm going to try this out again using Malibu coconut flavored rum instead of cream of coconut.

Made this for someone who LOVES coconut, made a few tweaks, used coconut milk instead of the water for the cake and only used the coconut cream to pour over the cake, no condensed milk didn't need it. while the cake was still wet on top, scattered the coconut (did toast the coconut), no whipped cream or icing. made it feel lighter and not sickly sweet, very refreshing!!!

I made this cake for my man's birthday, and it was amazingly good!  I'm pretty sure I practically inhaled it myself, eating it for breakfast the next day, then again for lunch!  Oh, and he loved it, too!  LOL.  A fantastic box recipe!  Thank you!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe, receiving rave reviews from everyone who ate it. I found the sizes of ingredients off on this recipe.  I only used 8 oz of whipped topping.  I was making 2 cakes at the same time, bought a 14 oz package of coconut flakes and divided it between the 2 cakes.  Each cake had plenty of coconut on it.

As I was preparing for Christmas I asked DH if he wanted one of the cakes I was making - Pound cake.  He says Coconut Cake.  I look at a few and this was the most simpliest to make.  He enjoyed it (and so did I).  For the holes, I took a few straws, cut them in half then stuck them in the cake.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks!

This cake is awesome!  I made two..took one to work this week and it was gone before the day was out.  The docs who don't eat cake much ate it and went nuts.  One of the wives called me this morning, on Christmas eve wanting it so she could make it...and she doesnt eat cake much and she loved it.  Very easy to make and makes you look like a very good baker!

I MADE THIS FOR MY BOSSES BIRTHDAY OFFICE PARTY AND WAS A HIT! THE ONLY THING IS THAT I COULD NOT FIND CREAM OF COCONUT:( BUT I PURCHASED COCONUT MILK INSTEAD. WHICH TASTED GREAT.
AND USED YELLOW CAKE MIX INSTEAD OF WHITE.
ALSO POKED HOLES IN THE CAKE WITH A STRAW WHICH WAS A GREAT SUGGESTION,  SO THE SWEETENED MILK WOULD ABSORB MORE!!!!

Ultra-fantastic.  This cake only lasts a few days around my house.  I first made it for my fiance's birthday and he gave it the highest compliment possible - he declared it to be better than his grandmonther's recipe!  Later I took it to a party as just a one-layer cake (I made two layer but was selfish and saved one for myself) and it got more rave reviews.  Great recipe!

I was really looking forward to this cake(I love coconut). But all I could really taste was the boxed cake mix, which I try never to use. I also couldn't get even half the milk mixture to go into the cake, so needlessly to say it wasn't all that coconutty!
I would however use a homemade white cake recipe and add coconut flavouring to it as well.

This is exactly like a cake a Brazilian friend of mine makes.  Except she makes it with chocolate cake.  So good!  Lemon cake is awesome too!  Thanks for sharing!  Fresh coconut kicks the cake up a notch - give it a try if you can get your hands on some freshly grated coconut!

Oh my gosh...this was so good! Just had to make one change. Since we don't have coconut milk here in the boondocks, I substituted with coconut pudding & followed the recipe as usual. Also topped the cake off with fresh sliced strawberries. It was pretty, very light and tasteful. Great for our Valentines Day desert. The family loved it. Thanks!

My family has been making this cake as our specialty. It is SO easy to make and it never lasts long. It's been requested for birthdays and even people who hate coconut seem to like this cake. For those that do not like the texture of coconut, you can leave the flakes off of it, or only put them on half of the cake. We have discovered that using a coconut cake mix and cutting out the condensed milk will cut back on the sweetness if it is just too much.
Try this recipe at least once, you won't be disappointed and this just may become your family's specialty!

This recipe is REALLY good and REALLY easy!  I'd give it a 4 1/2 stars if I could...  (I hesitate to give this recipe 5 stars since the cake comes from a box.)  I used only about 3/4 of the coconut/milk mixture and made my own whipped cream.  I, too, used coconut milk instead of the coconut cream like some of the other reviewers.  Next time I will try putting chocolate shavings instead of the coconut shavings since my husband doesn't like dry coconut.  Can't wait!  YUM!!!!!!!!

I just made this into a bundt cake and MMM it was good. I used coconut milk (I couldn't find cream of coconut) and also for the frosting I used coconut milk instead of regular milk. The cake is so soft. I think next time I will make a bundt cake with vanilla pudding or cream filling and I bet it will be great! I'm going to try this recipe for cream filling: http://dessert.allrecipes.com/az/WhippdCrmFilling.asp
Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this cake. My sister in law makes it for family functions and I was lucky enough to find the recipe here. While still warm I poked lots of holes with a fork and poured the whole milk mixture over. I only used an 8oz tub of cool whip. It is great moist and better the next day:)Makes more than 12 servings. Thanks Julia!!

Very tasty!  I poked 12 holes in the cake w/ a wooden spoon, and only poured about 1/2 of the coconut mixture over the cake.  Turned out great, and it wasn't soggy at all.

My sister-in-law turned me onto this cake however on hers she omits all the coconut products and serves with fresh, in-season fruits.  I am eager to try this with the coconut as that is one of my favorites, too.

I bought the cream of coconut in a squeeze bottle and just used very little of it, skipped the sweetened condensed milk and only used one of the small cool whips. It was very good. I know it's annoying to change a recipe and rate it but my memory is terrible for this is more for me ;-).

Maybe I was expecting too much from this recipe after all the rave reviews but I found it very ordinary and it was an expensive cake to make. I made my own whipped topping and added pecan pieces and chocolate shavings to the coconut on the topping.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was that the cake needs to be kept chilled and I don't have that kind of room in my fridge at the holidays. If someone requested it I would make it again but otherwise this is going off my list.

The cake was delicious but even though I did not poke the holes all the way to the bottom of the cake, the bottom of the cake was very soggy.  I will make it again but only use one third to one half of the coconut milk/ sweetened condensed milk.  By the way, I never found cream of coconut but sweetened coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk was perfect.

This is a very good cake.  I did not have cream of coconut, but Google assured me adding coconut extract to condensed milk would suffice so that's what I did.  I used one can of condensed milk plus a tsp of extract and it was definitely plenty to make the cake very moist.  I think another can of milk would have made it downright soggy.

A SUPER BOWL PARTY TOUCHDOWN!
Prepared as written, but omitted the condensed milk.  To avoid the mess of having to cut the cake & the use of forks at a party, I decided to cut the cake into 2x2 pieces and placed them in foil cupcake liners purchased at Walmart.  These liners were key because they were heavier than the normal papers and since the cake was so moist, the pieces held up nicely in the liners.  I'm forwarding a photo of it's presentation. Very moist, tasty & didn't last long. Recipe is a KEEPER.

I did use some of the other reviewers suggestions....yellow butter cake mix, no sweetened condensed milk and the sturdy whipped cream frosting from this site.  Major yummy and super moist!

Need to add coconut extract or coconut flakes into the batter. Otherwise it was a hit at our Christmas potluck. Will make again!

This was very, very good. I made it as a layer cake  and didn't make many changes except using a different cake mix and adding some chopped pecans to the cake mix as well as in between the layers. I had some of the coconut and about a quarter of  the coconut/ condensed milk left over after pretty thoroughly drenching the cakes. I heated it up on the stove a little bit before pouring it on the cake since the cream of coconut came out of the can a little thick. Next time i think I'll cut the condensed milk by a quarter to make the coconut flavor stronger. This is definitely going to be a regular family dessert.

This has to be the best cake under the sun. If you really want more coconut flavor, use coconut oil instead of veggie oil. It makes the batter a little thick but the results are amazing. I also use a yellow cake, add coconut extract to the batter, and make my own fresh whipped cream to ice it. I cover the whole thing in coconut and toast a little for the top. Serve with fresh strawberries and you’ll be everyone’s favorite baker.

I recently made this recipe for a family Easter Gathering. It was a very well-received desert by all and I would definitely make this recipe again. The nice light texture of the whipped topping frosting makes it a very cool summer dessert.

I made it with just the cream of coconut and a yellow cake mix. It was good if you like sweet. I served it with pistachio ice cream also.

This is the ultimate coconut cake for true coconut lovers. I asked my dad what kind of cake he wanted for his birthday and he said, 'Anything with coconut'. This cake was IT.
Some small changes. Used store-bought butter white cake in 2, 9" pans. When the cake was cooled about 10 minutes I poked holes and poured in a full can of Coco Lopez cream of coconut (in drink aisle) split between the two halves. I omitted the condensed sweetened milk, thank you all recipes contributors for that tip! Refrigerated covered overnight. Then next day I toasted 3/4 of a bag of sweetened coconut and set aside. I used the 'sturdy whipped cream icing' recipe made with fresh whipped cream, sugar, and vanilla extract found on allrecipes.com since the cake would be sitting out for the party. Into the icing I mixed the 1/4 of non-toasted coconut. The rest I covered the whole cake with ( I did not use the whole amount of toasted coconut). On top of the cake I used salted, crushed macadamia nuts (a salty counterpoint to all the sweetness) and drizzled the whole cake with caramel and chocolate. I should have taken a picture, it was beautiful.  Even those who did not like coconut loved this cake and some even said it was the best cake they ever had. How about that! Will definitely make again.

Hands down the yummiest cake I've ever made. My family and friends are dying for me to make this again. Followed the recommendation to leave the condensed milk out, poked chop stick size holes in each layer of my cake (only 2/3 deep), put my coconut extract in my frosting (whipped cream everyone recommended) because I forgot to add it to cake, added the cream of coconut to cake while still kind of warm and refrigerated overnight so it could really soak in and man oh man it still blew everyone away....... If you want to be the hit at your social event, make this, you'll be the "IT" person.

Good & simple however very heavy & too sweet for my taste. Changes I will make on round two: use suggestions on making cake less soggy on bottom, use 12 oz of cream of coconut, wait until cake cools before applying condensed milk and cream of coconut mix, use 8 Oz of cocunut flake,s toasted &  make my own whip cream with minimum sugar.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.

This is a tasty and easy cake! Two combos that will encourage me to make it again.
I do think that adding coconut flavoring to the cake mix would make it even better. I whipped heavy cream, then added vanilla and sugar instead of the whipped topping. My husband liked his without the toasted coconut, so I served it with the coconut as a garnish for those who wanted to add it.

I made this cake for my wife's bday. I changed a couple of things.  #1, I made my own whipped cream frosting and added coconut extract to it. #2, I added coconut extract to the cake batter. #3, I eliminated the condensed milk, and glad I did. #4, I shaved Dove's Dark Chocolate on each layer for an added depth of flavor! Delicious!

I thought it was way too sweet. I omitted the condensed milk and used cream of coconut only. I also replaced the packaged whipped topping with homemade whip cream. It was still too sweet. I  won't try to make it again.

This is the BEST coconut cake I've ever made! Easy too.
I made it just to make it not for any occasion. My husband ate most of it in about 3 days. I think I got two (2) pieces out of it, lol.
I recommend this great recipe. Easy & GOOD!

I've made this and it's very good. My mother in law, God rest her soul, made a cake very similar except that she used a yellow cake mix and only used and 8oz can of sweetened condensed milk and an 8 oz can of coco lopez. She added a can of drained crushed pineapple to the milk and lopez. She stabbed the cake while still warm and poured all on top so that it would soak in good. When cool she covered in cool whip and sprinkled generously with coconut.

I have made this cake twice and both times it was amazing. Family said it was the best coconut cake they have tasted.  I used all ingredients and used a straw to poke holes in the cake.  Cream of coconut is hard to find but now I know where to go. They usually have it over in the section with the mixed drinks and such.  Great recipe thanks again

I love this cake. Made it several times. I could not find cream of coconut the second time but I used coconut milk. I did not pour all of the mixture on the cake. I used about a little more than half. So good

I used 1/2 of the condensed milk and whipped my own cream with whipping cream that I flavored with sugar and coconut extract. I also layered the cake (used 2 boxes of cake mix) and filled it with the coconut flavored whipping cream. The cake turned real good. Everyone loved it.

It was delicious but a little runnier then I'd like. It has to either sit in fridge overnight or try using just the cream of coconut and omit the sweetened condensed milk. But it was absolutely what I was looking for!

When I first looked at this recipe i thought "oh this should be good" and when I I made it it was incredible! I didn't have the cream of coconut on hand so I just used coconut milk instead. It turned out really good! My whole family really enjoyed it and said I should make this all the time! Thank you so much Julia! Great recipe!

Super yummy!  My mom had been making a banana cake for years that everyone loved and thought could never be topped.  This cake dethroned it as #1.  I was afraid to make it into a layer cake, as I didn't know if it would hold together, but I think it would be ok, so next time I will layer it. Thanks for sharing this
recipe!

Update: I layered it and it fell apart. Boo. Still an awesome cake

M I made this for a friend's birthday. Didn't have cream of coconut so I substituted it with a can of coconut milk. The syrup was delicious and only used half of it for a 9x13 sheet of yellow cake. For the frosting I combined vanilla pudding with the whipped frosting and topped it with toasted coconut flakes. Let the cake sit I the fridge overnight. It was so good that my husband (who doesn't like deserts) asked me to make it every week.

Like so many other reviewers, I omitted the sweetened condensed milk, used a golden butter cake mix and added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the batter.  This was great, will definitely be going on my "keeper" list!

This cake was awesome.  I also left out the sweetened condensed milk because I used cream of coconut (reduced fat) as some reviewers mentioned and used a yellow cake mix.  I thought I would be in trouble since my cake mix had pudding in it and some reviewers said not to use the kind with pudding, but it turned out delicious.  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting recipe and used both regular and toasted coconut on top.  So yummy!

I have made this cake several times. Everyone loves it! I like is best with freshly made (lightly sweetened) whipped cream. I do think the cake is best made the night before to allow the coconut cream to soak in. Take it out of the refrigerator a little while before you want to eat it to take the chill off, then add the whipped cream and coconut flakes right before serving.

I also leave out the sweetened condensed milk as I am lactose-intolerant.  No one can tell the difference.  My mom is the cook in the family, but she requested I make this for Easter.  
PS: Coco Real is easier to use than the canned cream of coconut.  And a nut pick is as good as a straw for poking the holes.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! He doesn't have a sweet tooth but when he took a bite he said it was the best cake he's ever eaten and that it was a keeper! I couldn't find cream of coconut so I just mixed the sweetened condensed milk with coconut milk and used that. It turned out great!! And the sweetness was perfect! I think if I added the cream of coconut, it would've been way too sweet. Thank you for the recipe!

Super yummy and moist! A huge favorite at my house and for family gatherings! I do agree though that if you use Cream of coconut, leave out the condensed milk. If you use coconut cream, then you need to add the condensed milk for sweetness. I don't use Cool Whip, can't really stand the taste or texture. I either make real whipped cream to put on top or I make a fluffy white frosting. Either way, it gets smothered in coconut! YUM!!!

This cake was awesome - but with all the "sugar" I used toasted fresh coconut(bought the coconut, cracked it and grated that and toasted 1/2 of it and mixed that with the fresh coconut -everyone raved about it.

First one I made - the cake mix must have been bad, didn't raise much, but was good.  Redid it and turned out perfect.  Made 12 cakes/bars for an anniversary party and my hubby preferred this one.  So easy.

Made this for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best dessert he had ever eaten!   I followed directions exactly but used a butter cake mix instead of white.  Also I toasted the coconut which gave it a nice texture and looked beautiful on the cake.  This is definitely a KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing
this great recipe with us Julia.  I know I will be making this
one often!

I, too, thought there was too much coconut cream and milk making the cake soggy.  Since I can't stand the plastic taste of cool whip, I use whipped cream.  A few chopped toasted pecans and perfection is achieved.  The reserved coconut cream can be drizzled for presentation effect.

Amazing taste and super easy to make.  However, don't make this cake unless you have a lot of people to serve it to.  It goes a long, long way.  Everyone loves it.  Even my husband, who hates coconut, said it was pretty good.

MADE THIS CAKE SEVERAL DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS AND EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS DELICIOUS AND BEGGED ME FOR THE RECIPE.I WAS EXCITED FOR ONCE MY AUNTS AND FAMILY WERE ASKING ME FOR A RECIPE INSTEAD OF ME ASKING THEM..........THE ONLY THING I DO DIFFERENT WITH THIS RECIPE IS LET IT CHILL OVER NIGHT AND SERVE IT THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE I FIND IT'S ALOT FIRMER AND NOT AS MESSY IF YOU'RE GONNA SERVE IT TO CHILDREN TOO!

My husband LOVES coconut, so he absolutely loved this cake. One of my guests thought it was way too sweet, & I could see where he was coming from, but if you like coconut & you like things sweet, you will love this recipe.
