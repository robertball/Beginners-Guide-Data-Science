ok, I come from a family of very picky biscuit lovers. I looked all summer for a soft big biscuit and have FOUND IT ! I don't see why people have had problems with these. They are great and i make them all the time. I do substitute butter or margarine for the shortning, better flavor. For those who didn't get the desired results -- Try these tips: 1.Don't overmix the dough once you add the milk and only pat together (no real "kneading" or they will be tough). 2.only add the amount of milk you need, some days i have to use it all and then others i have a little left in the cup. 3. make sure the shortning or butter is cold 4.can brush with melted butter before and/or after baking for added softness and flavor and 5. can place closer together if yours still aren't soft 
Hope these help and thank you so much JP !!

Very good!  I make them with half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, and I use butter instead of shortening (I like to avoid trans fats).  This is the biscuit recipe I added to my permanent file.
**If you're new to biscuits, remember - any time you make biscuits (or scones or anything else that uses baking powder or soda to rise) you want to gently mix the dough JUST until the ingredients are all mixed-- don't maul it or knead it.  The more you handle your dough the more the gluten develops and the tougher your biscuits (or pie crust, etc.) will be. :)

Excellent recipe !
Being a single guy -no shortening or milk in the fridge, I used butter and a cup of beer.
Go ahead and laugh, but they came out great.

These biscuits had a great texture, rose beautifully and were so easy to make.  The only drawback was that they were bland and definitely had a slight baking powder taste. I made them a second time and substituted cultured buttermilk powder (4 TBS Saco brand) + 1 c. water in place of the milk; dropped the baking powder back to 2 tsp; and added 1/2 tsp baking soda.  Oh my goodness....perfection....so flavorful and soft and fluffy!  Absolutely the best I've ever made or eaten -- and I'm a southern girl who knows what a really great biscuit should be! :)  JP, your recipe is a winner -- thank you so much!  With the minor changes I mentioned, this will forever be my one and only biscuit recipe!  If anyone else wants to try the changes, you can use liquid buttermilk instead of the powder if you'd like, but the powder always seems to give me better results.

Mandy14 - The instructions say to knead 14-14 TIMES, NOT 14-15 minutes! The object is to handle the dough as little as possible.

These are exceptionally good. Very similar to my mom's "baking powder biscuits", but these are moister then hers. I made the "creamed chicken over biscuits" recipe from this site to go with these. My 16 month old son loved it, he said mmmmm and clapped his hands. I cut out 6, and didn't get "Grand Biscuit" size as stated. I also only needed to use 3/4 c. milk instead of 1 c.. My mom says that the barometer affects how your biscuits turn out, (works the same with anything with yeast, such as bread) so, if it's raining or very humid, they won't rise as well. If it's hot and dry, they should rise beautifully. So I kind of go by that when I am adding the liquid and flour (amounts). After you've made enough biscuits, you can tell how their going to turn out by how the (uncooked) dough looks and feels. I was thinking about the post that said they turned out dry on the outside and moist inside, if they seem very hard, then I would think possibly, they were cooked at too high a temp. and/or were left in too long. Because my oven is very hot, I always turn it down by 25 degrees, and never assume that the time stated is going to be "perfect" for my oven, so I checked these after 10 minutes, and then watched them 2 to 3 minutes after. Anyway, you should enjioy these.

Simple and tasty!
One tip though...don't knead the dough! Kneading this mixing with produce a tough textured biscuit. 
Mix it just till it holds together...pat into a 1 1/2 inch thick circle...then cut out.

This is a good basic biscuit recipe minus the sugar - adding sugar makes a biscuit a scone.  I've been making biscuits every AM for 30+ years and I've found that it's really the techniques that make a good biscuit.  Here's are my tried and true tips - 1)COLD, COLD, COLD ingredients and HOT, HOT, HOT oven (450 or 500) 2) After adding the milk, stir just until it mostly comes together.  DO NOT KNEAD!  Just turn the dough out and pat it into the thickness you desire.  Overworking makes a very tough biscuit 3) Use a sharp biscuit cutter and don't twist it as you cut.  This seals the edges and doesn't allow the biscuits to rise as much. Try to avoid using an improvised cutter as the edges may not be sharp enough. 4) I bake mine in a cast iron skillet with lots of melted butter.  I throw a couple of TBL of butter in the skillet and place in the oven while it's pre-heating just until melted (not browned).  I then place the biscuit top side done in the butter and flip it so the whole thing is covered. 5) Place biscuits so they're touching for high risers that are not browned on the sides, or slightly apart for less of a rise but browned sides.  12 min at 450 will yield a very tender, moist biscuit with the perfect little crunch on top and bottom.  Yummmm.

Thanks to J.P., I can finally make biscuits after 10 years of trying different recipes and mixes.  I would suggest for those people who want more flavor to use buttermilk instead of reg. milk.  I also used additional baking powder (about 1&1/2 tablespoons).  I also suggest baking them on the top rack of the oven if you are like me and your biscuits always brown on the bottoms and not the tops.  They really do rise more if you prepare the dough several hours ahead and refrigerate until time to make them.  I mixed up the dough the night before I planned to have them for breakfast.  They turned out almost identical to the biscuits at the ever popular fried chicken restaurant.  Fantastic, only I have to watch out or I will gain a ton of weight.  I could eat them for three meals a day plus snacks!  :o)

Easy, easy, easy so if you think you can't make biscuits these are for you! They look like you spent hours.  Like others, I used butter or butter flavored shortening and 3/4 cup of milk. My husband had the nerve to ask where I bought these!  Oh well, I guess I'll have to teach him how to make these......(they're that easy).

I made these to go under the sausage gravy I planned to make for my kids' dinner. (They get to pick dinner on Sunday nights when Dad is not home.)

Pretty cut and dry. Really similar to Grandma's Baking Powder Biscuits. I also used half all purpose and half whole wheat and ended up using the whole cup of milk. Mine did make five big biscuits and one medium sized one I shaped with my hand. (I used the top of my husband's 
beer glass, which worked perfectly.) I
cooked mine for about 12 minutes. They
turned out well, although I think I overhandled my dough.

Not bad. Suited my needs. Thanks, J.P.!

Absolutely wonderful! I added the milk gradually, as called for, & did not need the whole cup as the dough came together (tossed with fork) before that. I also did not knead, but simply patted gently to form a flat round. The less handling, the better, for great biscuits. After cutting, I let them rest for about an hour. They baked up huge, golden brown on the outside and soft & fluffy on the inside. A definate keeper & tasted great reheated this morning with butter & jam.

These biscuits are phenomenal!  I wanted to share some secrets to make them a bit easier.  I used butter instead of shortening but instead of cutting it into the flour, I freeze it then grate it with a cheese grater, then just stir it into the flour mixture.  The butter breaks up into the flour into the perfect size pieces.  Couldn't be easier!

Made this with some changes, following others sugestions and making my owns. 1. Add all dry ingredients to food processor and pulse to mix.  2. Add COLD salted butter and pulse until it resembles small peas. 3. Add buttermilk (watch the amount, maybe you will need less than 1 cup.) 4. Because I used the food processor I roll the dough and made a large tube, the diameter like a glass of juice, wrap with plastic papper and refrigerated for 2 hours.  This gave the dough time to rest, gluten will "calm down", and avoid any hard or dry result.  When I took the dough out it was hard, thank you refrigeration time, so I was able to cut 1 inch circles with the knife. So easy and avoid rolling! Because I used salted butter, I did not add salt.  The butter gave a terrific flavor and the buttermilk (made with whole milk and lemon) made the "melt in your mouth" biscuits.  I also brush the biscuits before baking, nice touch.  Hope this would help those trying to make it simple and still gets wow results.

We love these so much that I make them in bulk and freeze them.  I bake the frozen ones at 350 for 25 min.  I use butter (gives them a crispy outside) and double or triple the sugar.  I also DO NOT knead them.  If you use too much milk, let the dough sit and it will soak up the milk.  When I go to cut them I pat them into a long narrow strip, just wide enough for my cutter.  Then there is little to no waste because if you try to re-roll the dough, those biscuits will be a little bit more tough than the first ones.  Yum!

Sorry, but "I followed this to a T except I changed the leavening and the fat and the liquid and the amount of liquid and the baking time and the baking temperature" - seriously? And then you rate the recipe poorly? These are great, just as written.

These were good!! They were moister than most biscuits I've made. I didn't have to add even close to a full cup of milk, more like 1/2 - 2/3. I used butter flavor shortening, and did it all in the food processor, what a time saver that was!  I only put in 2.5 tsp. of baking powder, I was worried about getting that bp taste if I used a full tablespoon. For those whose biscuits didn't rise, make sure when cutting them to cut straight down, and do NOT twist! Twisting the cutter/glass/etc. seals the edges so they won't rise as much.

I followed the recipe to the letter and these came out beautifully.  My wife and I loved them so much that I made a second, double batch and froze the biscuits on a cookie sheet for two hours instead of baking immediately.  After that I just popped them into a freezer bag.  Now I just take out as many as I need and bake at 400c for 23 minutes.  The come out perfectly.

A great basic biscuit recipe. Added tip for high-rising biscuits -- don't twist the biscuit cutter -- press down only, then lift. A twisting motion seals the sides of the biscuits more, preventing maximum rise. Only use a glass as a last resort -- a sharp edged cutter makes for better rise, as well.

I randomly craved biscuits and found this recipe. I'm only thirteen so I've never made biscuits from scratch but these are to die for! Super easy and all the ingrediants are things that you have in your kitchen. If you want a biscuit like one you would eat with gravy, this is the one.

Fabulous! Just the right amount of salt and sugar, wonderful dough to work with and they rose up beautifully. Didn't change a thing. Served with soup and topped with butter, honey and raspberry jam.

In Australia we call these SCONES and they are an old fashioned, economical, quick, favourite morning or afternoon tea. We tear them in half horizontally (or cut) and top each half with strawberry or raspberry jam & whipped cream. (I think the U.S. calls jam 'jelly'?) We serve them warm (and they freeze well for later use). The butter/shortening must be rubbed gently into the dry ingredients with your fingertips (or cut in with a knife) until it resembles 'airy' FINE breadcrumbs. Once the breadcrumb consistency is achieved, make a well in the centre and add all the milk at once...and the final mixture should be a LITTLE sticky not dry. We add sultanas or chopped dates for fruit scones, just serving warm with butter. Flour your hands and lightly but thoroughly knead the mixture on a floured surface. If the breadcrumb consistency isn't achieved, you risk ending up with a heavy, less palatable treat. Handle the mixture as little as possible, and don't roll it - gently flatten with your fingertips to about an inch high and use a floured, sharp circular cutter (or cut into wedges). It takes only 10 mins to prepare! Don't overbake...put into a hot oven for about 12-13 mins (after brushing with a little milk) and they're ready when the sides are slightly firm. Wrap them in a tea-towel to finish them off with a little steaming. You can also put them 1/2 inch apart on the tray so that they expand and join up - break them apart when cooked and they'll be fluffy on the outside too...

This should be 10 stars and counting!  OMG, these biscuits are the best!  I did cut the baking powder down to 2 teaspoons and added 1/2 tsp. of baking soda.  Only needed 3/4 cup milk.  I took half the dough, put it into another bowl with fresh cut chives, parsley and some finely shredded cheddar cheese, mixed it and patted it out for herb biscuits.  The other half was made according to the recipe.  The best biscuits on earth!  Both halves came out light, fluffy and so flavorful.  Thank you for a fantastic biscuit recipe.  My other biscuit recipes have been tossed.

These are best made with butter and buttermilk (3/4C is fine) on a baking stone.  I have kept them overnight in the refrigerator and they are before baking and they turn out great.  Best biscuits I've ever made-only ones I'll ever make!!!

Ok..so I have had every person I know try at one time or another to teach me how to fix biscuits.  All have failed miserably, as has every "fool-proof" recipe. I am a good cook in other areas...just not biscuits.

I have not given up though, and was looking at the reviews for these biscuits. After reading a couple (especially the beer guy) I figure this recipe is worth one more completly incompetent attempt. 

WRONG!!!! - I got BISCUITS!!!  Not birdfood (too crumbly) or sports equipment (the ever popular hockey pucks) I got real, honest-to-god BISCUITS!!!

Of course they were not as fluffy as everyone says...but I have a feeling that next time - after I have replaced the 2 year old baking powder that I just noticed the date on - they will be fabulous!  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband and I are happily awaiting a morning meal of BISCUITS and gravy!!

No matter how completely incompetent you are at making biscuits - FINALLY - this is the recipe that will work!!!

This is an excellent basic biscuit recipe.  It's perfect for my taste, as the sugar and milk balances the baking powder flavor so it doesn't taste as dominant as it does in savory or buttermilk biscuits.  Those two ingredients can be changed to suit your taste.  If you do use buttermilk, add a 1/4tsp of baking soda to the dry ingredients.  The handling of the dough and the kneading seems to be the difference between flaky tender or tough biscuits.  Gently fold the dry and wet ingredients together in the bowl until all are moistend fairly evenly.  (I reserve about 3 tbsp of the flour called for in the recipe and add 2 tbsps additional flour to use for turning out the dough on the counter for shaping)  I gently press out the dough to 1/2 inch thick, then fold opposite sides over the center, like a business letter.  Turn it, press it gently out again and fold it one more time.  Then press it out to 1 inch thick and cut it with a 2 1/2inch cutter, straight down through the dough..don't twist while cutting, only twist it when it hits the cutting surface to release the dough from the counter.  Lift the cutter up and push the dough onto your baking sheet.  Place each piece 1/4inch apart for soft sided biscuits or spread them out for crisp sides.  Either way, they will be flakey and well risen, and tender.  That's my method for flakey tender biscuits and I'm sticking to it!  02/18-My family has gone crazy for these biscuits, I make them almost every night!  You nailed it, JP..Thanks!

I have tried many biscuit recipes for Thanksgiving, even a Martha Stewart one! This one is the best, just the way I like biscuits. Can't wait to use it this year. Here is a helpful hint, since a few people had trouble with the recipe may I suggest two important tips? One - make sure your shortening is totally cut in. Second - add the milk SLOWLY.  Only use as much as you need. I ended up using about 3/4 of a cup.  Delicious, thanks JP!

These biscuits were fantastic!  I was extremely impressed with every aspect...the flavour, the texture, how tall they baked, and not to forget...the simplicity!  The dough is quite wet, however using a sharp cutter makes everything effortless.  I prefer smaller biscuits, therefore a 2 1/2" cutter was perfect.  Thank you for this recipe, it has fast become the family favorite.

i took the advice of one of the reviewers and used buttermilk, 2 tsps of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp of baking soda. end result: TO DIE FOR! i have never been a biscuit fanatic, but when i took one bite of these, i knew i was hooked! i had some pretty awesome cookies in the house and i still decided to have a biscuit, with nothing on it, for dessert. that's how good they are. try this or live to regret it.

This recie is great!!!  My biscuits turned out great,  and to  those if you wo are complaining, get a cat scan!1  I'm only 16 and ican make these biscuits turn out great and I've never cooked a thing in my life.  Heck, the only thing I ever made in my life is a bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal.  Oh yeah, try refridgerating the dough overnight before you make them, they'll turn out a whole lot better.  And to the other teenagers reading this, It brought mygrade in my Food and Nutrition class from a C to an A!!!  the fist thing I cooked all year!

This is a good basic biscuit recipe.

My suggestions: if you use butter, scrape it in using the large size of your food grater.  Frozen butter works best.  To make outstanding biscuits, use lard for the fat, preferably leaf lard.  (My household would scream bloody murder if I used it.  Wimps.).  Also, roll your dough out to half the depth, put butter (grated or pats) on one side, fold it over, then cut.   Cut the left-over dough into strips, roll in cinnamon and sugar, and bake.  These are called the dog bones and are fed to the younguns to keep them quiet until dinner.  And why under cooking level on this site isn't there the choice of "tired"?

These biscuits are very good. Here are a few things I learned about baking biscuits: keep the ingredients as cold as possible, touch the bread as little as possible, add just enough liquid to hold together, do not mix until it is completely smooth, roll the dough a little too thick rather than too thin, and place the biscuits barely touching on the pan.  These are things people that make biscuits would know.  I learned by trial and error.

These biscuits tasted OK, but they were very dense and doughy.  (Is that a word?)  The search for a great biscuit recipe continues.

Yahoo! Thank you John!  For anyone who is "biscuit challenged" this is the recipe.  I gave up trying to make biscuits years ago but after seeing this recipe, decided to give it another try as my husband loves them.  Lo and behold, Eureka, voila, etc. etc.......gorgeous, light, fluffy BIG biscuits.  After reading all the reviews, and (a must) reading the article on this site for "Baking Powder Biscuits," I cut the dry ingredients and shortening together in the food processor, as suggested by one reviewer, and then turned that into a bowl and then added the milk.  I then let the dough rest in the refrig for a few hours.  When patting out the dough, (this is important) make sure it's no less than 1" thick.  To cut the biscuits, I found that an empty 16 oz. can with a diameter of 3" was perfect for cutting.  Cut straight down and pull straight up, don't twist or turn.  This helps to achieve the height.  I baked them in my great toaster oven as its temp is spot on.  I've made these three times in the last three weeks and the results were perfect every time.  Hope this helps some others who've had problems in the past.

Awesome!! Reminds me of the biscuits that my mom made for us growing up! Didn't change a thing! Fantastic!!  As for the person who reviewed this and gave this recipe a poor review after changing everything in the recipe, get a clue!! I hate reading any reviews on this site that people change most of the ingredients and then trash the recipe.  Guess what?  If you change all of the ingredients, then it's not J.P's Big Daddy Biscuits, it's your biscuits!!  Anyway, good job J.P., they're fabulous!!

WOW.... GOODBYE Bisquick!  So easy to make and so good!  This is the perfect example of why I love this website.  These are the best biscuits I have ever had.  Not greasy and buttery like Hardees and not dry and bland like Bisquick.  Try them.  I am glad I did.  Thanks J.P.!

PERFECT basic biscuit.  I've done them with shortening, and with butter and both are good.  20 minutes from biscuits in brain to biscuits in MOUTH--- not much longer than using store-bought dough and HIGHLY SUPERIOR!  I could tell they were "right" when I pulled them out of the oven the first time, and they were layered and had formed a natural "split" to pry open and slather with butter and jelly.  They make AMAZING bacon egg and cheese breakfast biscuits (think fast-food-style, but GOOD).  Total keeper!  NOTE:  They don't keep that well past a few hours imo, so only make what you plan to eat right away.

I gave these biscuits five stars because the taste was great, super soft and a wonderful crumb.  Here is a biscuit trick a professional taught me: DO NOT TWIST THE BISCUIT CUTTER AS YOU CUT!  Just go straight down and back up.  If you twist it seals the edges and they won't rise, or will rise lopsidedly.

Great flavor.  After following all directions to a T except using all but 1/3 of the milk called for, and not kneading them as the recipe calls for, they still did not rise when baked.  I let them sit for a while before baking as well.  Wonder what happened?  Will try again though, as the flavor is superb.

I have used this recipe so many times that I no longer need to look at it while I am making them. I too use butter instead of shortening, and they turn out fantastic every time. They are great for a breakfast sandwich. I serve them with extra old cheddar cheese, a fried egg, and bacon on the biscuit. Yummmmmmmmmm
JP, you rock! Thanks for the recipe, and for years of fabulous biscuits. By the way, if you want, you can add different herbs to the dough, or some grated cheese, green onion, or what ever you decide that you like. If I could have rated these a 10 I would have done so without hesitation. Thanks again.

For some reason I just cannot make biscuits. They never ever rise for me no matter what I do or don't do. These were no different. I barely knead the dough so it's not an issue of handling the dough too much. Biscuits never turn out for me, or maybe this is the way they're supposed to be? Homemade biscuits don't rise? Maybe I'm expecting them to look like the store bought frozen ones

I used this recipe to make the "blankets" for my pigs in blankets and everyone who had them said they were incredible. I am very pleased with the outcome and will continue to use this recipe when making pigs in blankets.

Excellent biscuits, but like other reviewers, I added the milk slowly and found I only needed about 3/4 cup or a little more.  Otherwise, they were absolutely perfect, just the kind I remembered.  And EASY too!!  Thanks John!

For those of you worried that shortening is bad for, transfats and all,use Spectrum brand, no trans fats. I need to use it in recipes for my toddler granddaughter b/c she's allergic to several foods, including dairy.  It's a good thing.  SHortening gives a nice flaky product, so you can use shortening without the fear.

Awesome biscuit recipe! I only make a couple of small adjustments when I make these. First of all, I measure out all my ingredients (combine the dry, cube the butter, measure milk) and then I put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes while I'm cleaning up and preheating the oven. Chilled ingredients make it harder for the butter to melt into the dough, giving you multi-layered, flakier biscuits. I only use about 2/3 of the milk - just use enough so that your dough comes together when gently formed with your hands. One last thing, you should never knead a biscuit dough. Handle it as little as possible to insure flakiness, very similar to a pie crust method. I cut them 2 1/2" in diameter and brush with butter before and after I bake - delicious!

Absolutely the best. We've made them large, we've made them small, we've let the dough rise a bit and we've stuck them in the oven right away. Every time they come out perfect. Our staple around here now. Thanks for the great recipe. (One note, 1 cup of milk I've found it is too much. 1/2 to 3/4 is enough.)

The BEST! I made the dough at night and baked in the morning - they rose (lots) better after they sat a while before baking.  No more package biscuits for my family!  These are easy and delicious.

I've not had much experience with baking so it took about four batches before I got these biscuits just right.  It was worth the effort!  I use buttermilk, give the cut biscuits a good drizzle of unsalted butter and let them rest for about 15 minutes before popping them in the oven.  I've also added cheddar cheese and garlic to the dough with fantastic results.  These are easy and delicious!

I've had scones in the UK and these 'biscuits' are nothing like true scones.  Biscuits should be light and fluffy (which these are), while true scones have a much denser quality.  Nice to finally find a recipe that produces the biscuits my grandma made!

Based on other reviewers, I did use only 3/4 tsp of salt.  I whisked the dry ingredients together.  Then cut in my shortening with a pastry cutter.  I made a well in the middle of the mixture and poured my milk in and then pulled the flour into the center of the well, mixing *just* until the flour was incorporated, but I could still see dry flour.  

Then I turned it out onto a lightly floured board and kneaded about 4-5 times.  It's important not to mess with the dough too much or they'll turn into hockey pucks.  I patted it out to 1" and cut with a 2-1/2" cutter.  Push straight down with the cutter.  If you twist it, it will compress the edges and effect how high the biscuit rises.

I did make a couple changes to this only because of an intollerance to white flour. I use a whole wheat flour and Stevia in place of sugar. Excellent recipe. I've even made a cinnamon raisin version with this recipe. Any way its made is great and my family loves them.

Hate it when people review when they haven't used the recipe but this is just a tip....I make several different biscuit recipes and a trick is to shake your baking powder before measuring and always measure "heaping" instead of the normal leveling off! This is an old trick. Also the reviewers who indicated you should handle sparingly are correct as over handling will toughen any biscuit/pastry dough. When my children were small and my mother wanted to know what to bake them for an upcoming visit it was ALWAYS her teabisuits. Good luck....can be mixed up quickly to dress up any meal.

Just baked them. I had been looking for a long time to a recipe of English scones and discovered that these biscuits are pretty close to them. I could not stop me from eating two already and they are awesome and so easy to make. It's better if they are thick as they crack better on the sides for An authentic look. And best of all, while eating them read Deborah Smith's book Crossroads cafe where the biscuit is one of the "main characters" and there you really are on another planet, very yummy planet ! Thanks for this awesome recipe. kind regards from sunny Spain

These are the BEST biscuits I have ever made. We make these quite offten. For biscuits and gravy, jam, apple butter ect.  I used butter insted of shorting.  Also use frozen butter and mix in food processor.  Place butter cut up as best as you can in processor add flour baking powder and salt.  Pulsate for a few seconds at a time until butter is pea size.  Dump mixture in to large bowl add milk and mix proceed with instructions quickly so butter dose not begin to melt.  Make sure you bake them on a pan that has sides (like a jelly roll pan) so all the butter will not run off and make a mess at the bottom of the oven.  SO good.

First time making them & came out great!

I used my hand mixer w/dough hooks to mix everything until all the flour-ie buttery mix was mixed. DON'T DUMP ALL THE MILK IN! Dump maybe half at the beginning, that way you don't have to worry about them being heavy or too wet.  I read the reviewer's advices as to get a good biscuit. I didn't even knead them 15-20 times, I did it for 10 & they came out heavy but light & fluffy on the inside.

Big piece of advice is that if you DO use margarine (like I did) cut the salt to 1/4 or 1/2 tsp. That was my only problem, they came out salty. I'll keep this recipe close to my heart & update to see if the amount of saltyness can be fixed with more added sugar. John Pickett YOUR BISCUITS ARE AWESOME!

Great dough to work with. I used all the milk called for which ended up being a bit to much. I had to knead in a little flour to compensate. I replaced the shortening with butter. After I got the dough to the right consistency it was a breeze. I used a juice glass to cut out the biscuits. After eleven minutes they were perfect. Smelled wonderful and looked great. Fabulous recipe.

I usually don't like to make biscuits because they don't turn out well. . .but these are worth it!!!  They turned out very fluffy and yummy and my kids actually ate them!!!  That's saying a lot because they are EXTREMELY picky eaters.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These biscuits are absolutely terrific!!  They are the BEST biscuits I've tasted, and it's definitely worth the effort of doing just a bit more than opening a Pillsbury can.  :-)  They came out GREAT on my first try.

Yum! Really enjoyed these biscuits, prepared just as written. Next time I will let them sit so they rise a little more.

These are even easier if you add an extra 1/4-1/2 C milk and then just drop them by heaping TBSP onto a baking sheet!  No kneading, patting, rolling or cutting needed!

Oh my goodness these are so good! I made this last night and I was so very pleased with the results. They came out beautiful and big just like the name :)

I followed the recipe just as is without any changes and they were so easy to make! I do not think I even have to edit it because it is perfect! And this is also the first time I ever made biscuits! I am so very pleased with the results, thank you so very much for sharing this recipe

These were allright. I guess I'm just a sucker for Pillsbury's Grand's biscuits. :) It's a shame I am... those are prolly loaded with salt (and the reason why I like them so much lolz). J.P.'s biscuits were a tad bland for my liking. On the flipside, I had no trouble whatsoever with rising, tenderness or moistness (and I even re-rolled my dough several times which is supposedly a no no). Not only were these a cinch to prepare, I was able to get 9 (2.5 in.) biscuits out of my dough! Thanks to SELEA's suggestion, I cut prep time in half by using my food processor (AWESOME idea!). NOTE: You will likely not need all of the milk called for. I only used 3/4 c. NOTE #2: Refrigerate your shortening and cut it into cubes rather than adding it all at once to your flour mixture. There are a lot of good tips on here. If you follow J.P.'s directions and adhere to the sage advice of others, you'll not be disappointed! Thanks for sharing, John! :-)

Since I found this a couple years ago, it has become the only biscuit recipe I use. I have made it many, many times exactly as written as well as my own variations. The only thing I always do is use butter instead of shortening. Today, I increased the butter to 1/2 cup and decreased the milk to 3/4 cup and used the other measurements as written in the original recipe. They were definitely the best. I will always make them this way from now on.

Thanks for this recipe. I have been incapable of making a decent biscuit until now. I add 2 cups cheddar cheese, a splash of milk, 4T poultry seasoning and garlic salt to these-AMAZING!

Best biscuits I've ever made! They came out huge and so soft I thought they would melt in my mouth. A few tips: use butter for better flavor. Don't knead, instead just fold the dough over around 10 times so you get some nice flour layers inside. Bake in a glass pan close together so they stay really soft and don't get dark. And make sure to get just the right consistency when adding milk, if it gets too sticky then dash flour in as you mix to get it right. The dough was incredibly soft but still firm, thanks J.P.

This recipe was great!  My friends and I have a small obsession with Bob Evan's biscuits, and we are always craving them, so I, being the baker in our group, went to look for a recipe that would beat those at Bob's...and it worked!  My mom said they remind her of the biscuits her grandma used to make!  Also very easy to make. :)

My family really enjoys these biscuits!  I tried using a tablespoon of honey in place of the white sugar, just mixing it with the milk and continuing with the recipe.  I find it also helps to grease the pan before placing the biscuits in to bake.  A really great recipe!!!

These were superb! Just like my grandma used to make.
Just some remarks:
1 - Add only as much milk as you need, so go slowly. Once it looks like dough and sticks, stop.
2 - I use margarine. Cold is ideal, it cuts in better.
3 - I added extra sugar because I like mine a little sweet, and sometimes I add a tsp of vanilla extra or cumin or lavender flowers or something to bring out some flavours... try adding garlic and brushing with butter and parm before baking.
4 - Do not knead, just stir until combined, pat, and cookie-cutter.
5 - If not using a convection oven, bake one rack higher than the middle so the bottoms don't burn, or put an empty cookie sheet on the bottom rack to disperse the heat.
6 - Better if the dough the left to percolate a big.
7 - Do yourself a favour and double the recipe from the get-go!

Yes, these are right up there with the best. I followed the recipe exactly using the whole cup of milk. I didn't knead them, but I did pat dough into about 1/2 inch thickness and lightly rolled (a time or two) to get smoother tops. May have to push sides of dough back to get the 1/2 thickness if needed.  I cut with a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter and placed close together. Around the 13 minute baking mark, I spooned some melted real butter over tops and broiled until just golden. Caution to new cooks doing this step; they can burn on you fast. Please keep a very close watch.  Lastly, buttered inside with a little of the melted butter. Adding the butter like this makes the color improve and more flavorful.  I'm going to experiment later on with some flavor combinations with them. These biscuits hold up well to make a good sausage sandwich. Thank-you for the recipe!

The best biscuits I've ever made--usually get hockey pucks.  These were so fluffy for dinner and the next day warmed up butter and jelly, just as good!  I did make some alterations based on other reviews--used butter, buttermilk (this day I needed about 3/4 cup only) 2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda.       I also made them early in the day, cut them and put on cookie sheet, covered with saran wrap a few hours until dinner.  Can't wait to make extra and freeze as someone said they did.   Oh, also used food processor---YUM!!!!!!!

This was the first time I've ever made biscuits.  I rated this a five star recipe because anyone could make them; it was extremely easy and inexpensive to make.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for sharing this one... I'll make sure to save it to my favorites.  BTW - I used mine to make Strawberry Shortcake.  I would recommend that everyone try this at least once as it was very tasty :).

These were a lot like Grands. I served them with butter and peach preserves, and they complemented our dinner of smoked pork chops and cole slaw very nicely. I used part butter and part butter-flavored shortening. I agree with Discobunny that the baking powder flavor is dominant.

This is a great recipe with very tasty results.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is I believe the instructions are not correct.  Kneading this dough will make them tough--better to give them just a few turns to pull it together and pat it out before cutting them.  Also, use a sharp knife or biscuit cutter rather than a glass; using a glass will smash the dough on the sides not allowing it to rise as high.  As another reviewer stated, watch the amount of milk that you add, it may not all be needed. But the taste is great--and I used butter rather than shortening.

I made these biscuits the night before Thanksgiving. Used a small almost 2 in. cutter and cut to what looked like 1 in. Baked the next morning and was very disappointed. I don't know if it was because they sat overnight or if the cutter was too small or if they need to be really thick.My husband thought they were good and I'm too much of a perfectionist, but I thought these were not good. My ingredients were fresh. I might try again making them very thick and cutting a bit bigger.

Try another recipe to save your time and materials!  I followed the recipe as directed and ended up with a mess.  The first problem I noticed was when making the dough, there was too much milk called for.  With that, the dough was liquidy, needing even more flour.  Trying to get the dough out of the bowl and flattened onto the table was almost impossible.  I had to pick up the dough and attempt to make a flimsy ball of dough for the biscuits.  The end result:  bad tasting biscuits, 20 minutes wasted, and a messy table!

These was really good. I made 2 batches the first one I followed the recipe to a T. They turned out good but did not raise the way I had hoped. Second time around I made these changes. 1. I used buttermilk instead of milk. 2. butter flavored shortening or butter whichever i have on hand at the time. DO NOT knead just mix till combined, let dough rest for 1-3 hours before patting out and baking. brush top with melted butter before and after baking. making these few changes made some outstanding biscuits! Thanks for sharing!

I've made these twice now, and they've turned out perfectly both times.  I always use ice cold milk and butter (shortening is not available in Greece) and handle the dough as little as possible.  This makes for an even flakier biscuit.  Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome biscuits..... My grandmother died and never wrote down any of her recipes. I searched for a biscuit just like hers for a long time and I have now found it.... These turned out perfect. I used butter flavored shortening, and that is the only thing i did different than the recipe. I'm a southern girl and I lvoe my biscuits and these turned out perfect the first try.... Great Recipe!!

Every recipe I've tried has been a 4 or 5 stars.  I followed this recipe exactly as written.  My ingredients were fresh, so I know that's not the problem.  They were not at all what I was expecting.  I'll stay with my own recipe. UPDATE 4/19/09: Just wanted to say that I have tried these again, but instead of rolling the biscuits, I barely kneaded them while still in the bowl(maybe twice) and just broke off pieces the size of a lemon, rolled in a ball and lightly pressed them in the pie tin.  They were so much better this time.  Also, if you are using salted butter, definitely decrease the amount of salt in the recipe.  When I made these the first time, I feel like the high humidity where I lived prevented the biscuits from rising properly.

I made these the other night to go with stew. It was a really hot, dry day so they didn't cook up as big as they could have. I've learned that with baking, the weather has a lot to do with how your baked goods come out. They were, however, excellent! My husband thought they were wonderful, especially with honey. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is nearly identical to my own recipe!  I love how it can be used for either rolled or drop biscuits.  They'll come out perfect as long as you use fresh baking powder and don't overknead.  I'm not a fan of shortening, so use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I also substitute buttermilk for the milk.

If they won't be served with something rich flavored like soup, sauce, a sweet topping, etc. there are tons of ways to create a flavor of your own!  Just experiment by adding your favorite herb/s, cheese/s, and/or spices!!  Dry ingredients (herbs, spices, parm cheese, etc.) mix in with the flour, or sprinkle on top.  Moist ingredients (ham, chile peppers, etc.) add with the milk, and freshly shredded cheese goes in right before the milk.  This is a really great basic recipe with endless possibilities!

This is the best biscuit recipe I have ever used! :o)

I really don't knead the dough. I skip that part and just pat it out to about 1 inch thick and cut them with a drinking glass.

These do not have a chance to cool off in my house. Hot from the oven and they are are gobbled up!!! Would rate it a 10.... but 5 is as far as they will let me rate it.

I follwed exactly and the biscuit turns out rather bland. I made the following changes and the biscuit turns out slightly crispy on the outside, soft in the inside with a light buttery flavour.
I used 25 gms sugar, 100 gms butter, 1/4 tsp salt, enough milk just to make into a dough, try to pat the dough together and cut with an 1 inch biscuit cutter, avoid over kneading.
Brush biscuits with butter to before baking to add flavor and softness.

These biscuits are delicious.  So quick and easy to make with ingredients already in your pantry.  For an added twist substitute buttermilk for regular milk and watch them get gobbled up.  Much better than the buttermilk biscuit recipes I've tried on this site.  This recipe is now one of my staples.  Hm, hm good.

These have become a necessity in our home.  We serve these with stews, roast, and even made into breakfast sandwiches.  These are so yummy and diverse, they are great!  My husband loves them best with butter and syrup, and my daughter likes them best with honey.  They are great!

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny, how you can bake!! I rate my recipes on a scale of 1-4, with the rare exception deserving a 5. Well Johnny dear, your biscuits received the grand and glorious 5-Star rating in my household. I do have one question: The recipe calls for shortening. Is that Crisco or butter? I used Crisco and they turned out beautifully. Now I'll wait and see what the texture is in the morning. I think I'll have to check and see what other recipes you've submitted, Johnny me boy. Your biscuits will be made over and over and over again in my household! Caio...Poni (rhymes with Bonnie)

They really get huge if you let them sit in the fridge for an hour befor you bake them.  One of the best biscuit recipes I have seen.  They were so big, I would almost recommend that you roll the dough to 3/4 inches instead of 1 inch.

I had never made biscuits before this but I will  not even look for another recipe! This recipe is easy and comes out perfect EVERY TIME.  I have made these at least 20 times and each time the biscuits were soft, fluffy and delicious.  I do use butter instead of shortening, always, and even substituted honey for sugar one morning in a pinch...  absolutely no difference. These biscuits are AMAZING!

One last note...  I don't roll them out and use a glass to cut, I just roughly shape them with my hands and set them on the baking sheet!

This is such a terrible recipe. I don't understand why it can have such a high rating. It has such a strong taste of baking soda that I couldn't even swallow it. Maybe others did not add so much baking soda? This is one of the worst recipe I have ever found on here. I followed the recipe just as it is and the dough is so wet that I could not put them together , in the end I added much more flour and knead it too much till it has glutenized. Total failure!!!!!

I love this recipe! I make them all the time. I too use just under a cup of milk. The dough is sticky but once you flour up your surface and put a bit of flour on top of the dough it works into it and is fine. I try not to knead mine very much at all, the more you knead, the tougher your biscuits. Mine usually makes about 7 biscuits, perfect for my husband and myself. I love love love this recipe and have told many about it!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used butter rather than shortening and I didn't kneed it at all; I just pressed it all together with my hands. I baked them close together and brushed them with melted butter before putting them in the oven. They were delicious, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

I have to admit I was excited when I read this recipe as I always want to try a new way of making biscuits and based on the previous comments I thought they would be great. Unfortunately, I don't have the same idea of them. I just pulled the first batch out of the oven and they are hardly big and puffy. The second pass is baking as I type this and they appear to be much higher, as mentioned by the original poster of this recipe. It may be best to let them sit  overnight as they suggest for a higher product. Now, there is a recipe on the Clabber Girl baking powder can for biscuits that are very similar but there is no sugar stated in this one. I had difficulty handling the dough, very sticky and I believe reducing the amount of milk to 3/4 cup as stated on the baking powder can is necessary.  Just too much liquid for me.  They do produce a nice flavor ,though. Sorry to say, they are just not what I thought they would be.

Oh my.  This northern gal has always been terrified of making biscuits ... no more.  I cheated the first time and skipped the rolling/cutting and just did drop biscuits - they are SO GOOD!  Especially with fresh butter and honey.  Mmmm definitely going in the make again pile!!!

Great and easy!  I just mix by hand and scoop by large spoonful onto the baking sheet and cook.  I hate all the rolling and shaping for biscuits and these don't even need it.  Whole family loves them!

Oh yeah, awesome every time.  Not in the recipe, but judging from the picture, the dough is rolled out and folded and re-rolled a couple of times.  This makes them rise to major heights and they split open really easy.

Excellent recipe. I followed as written and they turned out wonderful. I almost forgot about them so they were more brown than I prefer but it had nothing to do with the recipe. I will add a touch more baking powder to make them rise more but other than that...Perfect!

Ha! I made biscuits!!! Ok so I have had problems making biscuits for YEARS! But these came out great for me. They rose beautifully and even had that crack in the middle of the biscuit so that you can just split it with your fingers. Silly but I've been trying to get that darn crack in a biscuit for 2 years. Oh yeah I did use all butter and buttermilk. I'll be using this recipe from now on. Thanks!!

Awesome recipe! Made a few changes: used carnation milk. Made it into buttermilk by souring the milk with white vinegar-2tablespoons of it. It will not make the biscuit sour! As I mixed all dry ingredients, I melted my butter and placed it in the dry mix.when adding my buttermilk, I used a little bit at a time.only to prevent the dough mix from being too wet. Once all ingredients were put together I did not overmix the ingredients to prevent the biscuits from being tough. I dusted a plate with flour and scooped out one tbs of dough in the mix and patted flour on the biscuitmix about  4 times . Twice on each side. I dusted the bottom of a Pyrex dish with flour and placed the biscuits in the dish- baking for 12 minutes. Do not be tempted to keep the biscuits in there any longer since it will harden once you take it out the oven. This recipe made 9 small biscuits. But my family loved them! Yummy!! Will make again!

I honestly can't believe I haven't rated this yet!  This is truly my son's favorite Saturday morning routein!  Mommy gets up and makes a double batch of these and he munches on them all weekend.  None are left by the time Monday rolls around!  I have also made garlic cheddar biscuits with this recipe, just added a couple/few handfulls of shredded cheese and some granulated garlic and they turned out amazing!  Thanks for posting! 5 stars indeed

Wow these biscuits are amazing!  I am eating them right now, and like them so much that I have to share with everyone!  I made this recipe exactly as stated except for using butter in place of shortening.  I don't have a flour/butter cutter thing, so I just use my hands until it is all combined and crumbly.  I used a wide rim glass for cutting the biscuits.  I made them to accompany beef stew, they are so good with just butter, my fiance said that I didn't even need to make beef stew, he would have just eaten the biscuits for dinner!  I am excited to try them again with all kinds of flavors (cheese, garlic, herbs, etc!), with fruit, or make an egg and cheese sandwich!  My fiance said they are better than any store bought biscuit he has ever had; I have to agree, and the are so easy to make!  They are so light and fluffy! YUM! Thank you for this recipe!! :)

I made these biscuits few days ago and they came out so good. They are very fluffy if done the right way by not overworking on the dough. I didn't need all the milk given but only about 3/4 cup as other reviewers mentioned. I also found that I could reduce the salt to only 3/4 tsp although my husband said it was perfect for him! Overall a great recipe. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

AMAZING.  i've made these several times and usually double the recipe because we eat so many.  I took some advice from the other posts and use only half of the baking powder and let them sit for 10-15 minutes (after cutting, before baking) which makes them fluff up a lot without being too light.  it is CRUCIAL that you have the sides touching and cook about 10 or 11 minutes.  I usually turn the broiler on for a few seconds to get the nice slightly brown top.  also, adding a little more sugar can be nice depending on your tastes.

This recipe is wonderful! I made very few changes. First, I prefer the taste of butter in biscuits and I think it gives more flavor (some people commented that their results were bland). Second, I didn't need to use quite a full cup of milk to get the right consistency. Third, I wanted an herbed biscuit to go with dinner so I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of dill weed, 1 large clove of garlic (minced), 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper and 1/2 cup grated Romano cheese. YUM, YUM, YUM! All 10 people at dinner raved about the results. I was very pleased! :-) I ended up refrigerating the dough for a few hours before I needed it. The biscuits were light, fluffy and flaky. Perfect!

UPDATE: To make these a drop biscuit just add an additional 1/3 cup milk. To make a delightful orange drop biscuit add 2 tsp. of orange zest to the  dry ingredients. Then blend orange juice and powdered sugar together to make a glaze. Drizzle over the hot biscuits.

These rolls are great with just a couple modifications and I've been making them for a couple of years now with great success!  First, they'll look more like "drop biscuits" but for the flavor and texture, it's so worth it; after cutting in the butter or butter-flavored shortening (both work great), add the milk slowly and mix just until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl.  Don't knead them, and definitely don't over mix them either.  Use a cookie sheet sprayed lightly with Pam and using a tablespoon, "drop" about a half-dollar sized amount onto the pan.  For a different taste, try adding 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Excellent!

These are a good looking and tasting biscuit!  I didn't over work the dough and didn't roll to thin.  I've tried 3 different biscuit recipes from this site this week, and this was my favorite.  I did sub 1/2 butter for 1/2 shortening in the recipe.  These are great warm with honey or jelly.  I used the leftovers the next day with sausage gravy.

These biscuits are so easy to make, using ingredients I always have on hand.  I'll never buy grands again.  These came out big and delicious with or without butter.  My husband likes to use these biscuits to eat soup (instead of using a spoon).  I highly recommend  Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice Soup from this site.

These biscuits were fantastic, and very easy to make.  I made them with the Sausage Gravy I recipe from this website, and also had one with just Honey and it was great.  As per other reviewers recommendations, I did not knead the dough at all . . . just  pattede it into a circle as soon as it was mixed together.  I doubled the recipe and did not need all the milk the recipe called for, and ended up adding 1/4 cup flour to make the dough workable.  Some people said they weren't cooking right at the temp recommended, so to be safe I cooked mine at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, and they were fine.  This was my first time making biscuits and we couldn't believe how well they turned out.  We will be making these many more times!

They turned out FANTASTIC!!  I used bread flour because thats all I had. I cut the shortening in with a pastry blender and then added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup buttermilk. I might use all buttermilk next time. I then cut them with a 3" cutter. I ended up with 7 large biscuits. Make sure you use fresh flour and baking powder (not old stuff thats been sitting around for a year!!)  It makes a huge difference and will turn out light and fluffy!!  Yum.. no more store bought for me.

Great recipe!  The biscuits fluffed up to an amazing height.  Two words of caution, though: don't overknead the dough, or your biscuits will get tough, and only add as much milk as needed; one whole cup makes the dough too wet to work with.

Just made these biscuits this morning for Thanksgiving! Delicious! I didn't have any shortening, so I substituted butter. It came out nearly perfectly, but was just a LITTLE crispy. Made 11 regular sized biscuits. My advice: 1) Don't overbake. Even if they appear too soft, take out after recommended time. 2) I only used 2.5 teaspoons baking soda, heeding the advice of other reviewers 3) I used 3/4 cup fat-free milk. 1 cup is just too much liquid. The dough was still a BIT gooey with 3/4 cup, but the finished product is awesome. 4) I added an additional 1 tablespoon of sugar. I can't resist a little extra sugar, plus you can't really taste the sugar in the end product. I think just 1 tablespoon may have allowed the baking soda flavor to take over. The recipe is great overall, though. Everyone loved them at the Thanksgiving get-together.

Wow! What a great recipe! Here are the changes I made. I used butter instead of shortening. Gives a superior flavor in my opinion. Being from Kentucky I HAD to use buttermilk instead of milk. Also, don't knead biscuit dough. It makes the biscuits tougher. Just pull you off a bit of dough and pat it out. Make sure your butter and buttermilk are cold. Add your buttermilk slowly. You may not need all of it depending on the weather. Humid=less liquid. That's all I can think of. Try this recipe. It is great. Thank you so much for submitting.

This is an excellent recipe.  I only had lard to use the second time I made them and I think that they were even better.  My mother says that lard is the answer for flaky biscuits.  Thanks for sharing.

When I made my second batch of these I didn't knead them at all, just mixed the dough until it formed a ball and rolled it out and cut it.  They turned out better this way, light and fluffy which is what I wanted.

I have been making these biscuits for several years.  Sometimes with 50% whole wheat.  I usually use butter instead of shortening (hope to try with coconut oil soon.  I use for top of a pot pie also.  Let sit for 30 hour after rolling out and cutting before baking- you will get a better dough and higher rise.  Good with sausage gravy to!

I've tried this recipe twice, but followed the suggestion in someone else's review and used 2 tsp of baking powder and half tsp baking soda. I rarely have all the ingredients needed so below are some  substitutes I find helpful.
Substitutes:
1.)Instead of shortening, butter works fine.
2.) a few other Reviewers suggests buttermilk for a little extra flavor. Since I never buy buttermilk, I learned that milk & vinegar works great. Just pour a cup of milk, then take about a tbs of vinegar and add it to the milk (do not stir!) and let sit for about 5. The milk with thicken a little and have a slight sour smell. Works every time.

Hubster calls them "HO HOUSE BISCUITS" after a scene from one of his favorite Clint Eastwood cowboy movies. I've been make this recipe on a weekly basis for years in Colorado, kneading the dough no more than 8 times-softer and makes for fluffier biscuits.  After kneading, I usually refrigerate the dough while crockpot meal is simmering or prepare and bake immediately during last 1/2 hour of stove top meal. I use a rolling pin and a very large mouth glass to cut only 5 biscuits from each batch. Large and fluffy biscuits every time! No changes are made to the temp, but bake a few minutes more until tops are lightly browned.  High altitude cooking sometimes requires small adjustments.

This was the best biscuit recipe I've found so far, and I've tried plenty, trust me. I mixed the dough and let it rest in the fridge, and while I did knead the dough some, I may follow the advice of others and not knead it at all.

UPDATE: Made these this morning and didn't knead the dough; they came out light and fluffy. I'm going to try buttermilk next time. I found that just pressing the dough down with my palms instead of rolling makes for thicker biscuits. I'm upping this to five stars.

I've made my share of biscuits, and these are at the top of my WOW list. To my thinking, the ingredients are the same as a standard biscuit. However, "kneading", which is just a fold and gentle press in the case of biscuits, makes oodles of puffy layers. I have made this with all butter, as well as with shortening. I actually prefer the butter and only 1 tsp. sugar unless they're for shortcakes. I also loved the results of someone's advice here to melt butter (1 Tbsp.) in the pan during preheat, dip the tops and flip. Crunchy yum!! Thank you, J.P.

These are really good!  I followed the advice of others including: not overmixing the dough, only using as much milk as I need, butter should be cold, and brushed w/ melted butter before baking.  Also, I used butter instead of shortening.

I think I prefer a few other recipes more for a fluffier and lighter biscuit, but these are great if you plan on smothering these big guys with gravy.

This is my go-to biscuit recipe from now on.  I've made these now three times, each time resulting in biscuit deliciousness! :)  The third time I cut them slightly thicker than recipe states, left them a little longer in the oven, and they came out huge and fluffy good!  These biscuits rock!

Amazing!!!! I have been searching for a biscuit like this for quite some time now. Many failures later have produced not one quality keeper. This is especially sad because I am a former Culinary Arts major ;-( The days of being teased by my Southern In-laws, about my biscuits, are over. This recipe is a keeper and thank you so much for passing on this treasure! I hold "from scratch" cooking near and dear to my heart.

I had considered making biscuits for a while but I was a little hesitant because anytime I have tried to do so in the past I ended up with rocks. I have never ever been able to make biscuits before. Not so anymore I tried this recipe, it turned out beautifully!! So fluffy and delicious!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for the recipe!!!!

Good recipe. Might try using buttermilk next time. You can make 10 buscuits if you increase all ingredients by 50%.

Great taste and texture.  We use fresh ground wheat and substitute the shortening with butter.

I gave this three stars because except for the addition of sugar, it is just like most recipes for biscuits.  I kept seeing references made for butter.  The receipe calls for shortening, not butter.  I surely do wish people would stick to reviewing the recipe as is, not with their changes because then they are no longer reviewing the recipe.

Yes. Yes! YES!!! This is the biscuit recipe I have been looking for.  I used half milk/half buttermilk (and a pinch of baking soda) for a little twang and brushed with melted better before baking - they were perfect.  Tender, buttery inside, tender, crunch outside. The clouds parted, angels sang, my family loved them, I'm a hero.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Like this recipe needs another review!  I have never made really good biscuits before, they were edible, but just.  Finally I got raves for my biscuits!  I pulsed all the dry ingredients in my food processor then added butter flavor shortening, cut into pieces, and pulsed 6 or 8 times, then transferred it to a large bowl and added the milk.  I patted the dough into a rectangle roughly 9" x 6" and used my dough scraper to cut into 6 biscuits.  They sat on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes until the oven was free and rose even further.  Thank you John for sharing a new favorite!

I had almost given up on biscuits as all the ones I've tried have turned out dry and dense.  Not these!  They were light and fluffy, just like I like them.  I used butter instead of shortening because I just don't use shortening (in anything).  I only gave it four stars because I feel like it is lacking a little in flavor - maybe it needs more butter or maybe make it with buttermilk?  I don't know - it just needs a little extra something.  I'll have to experiment to figure out what it is.  Overall, best success I've had with a biscuit to date.  Oh, and I also did let them sit in the fridge for about 3 hours before baking.  That may or may not have made a difference, according to other reviewers.

I have tried for years to make biscuits and the best I have managed to do is just okay UNTIL I found this recipe. They rise high. They have a nice crust and are tender and moist inside.
I use butter for the shortening and fat free milk.

I've been looking for a biscuit recipe that wasn't too fussy, and this one is it! I brushed the biscuits' tops with butter before cooking; they turned a beautiful light brown on the outside while the insides were moist and fluffy. I did not turn them onto a board for kneading, instead I mixed them in the bowl by hand just until the dough held together. I rolled them out on a piece of parchment paper to about 3/4" thick; I got nine that way and they were still plenty large. 

These are excellent with Texas cream gravy: 2 tbs bacon drippings, 2 tbs flour whisked together in a skillet on medium heat until they are combined and hot (1 minute); slowly pour in 1 1/2 c milk and lower heat -- whisk mixture until it thickens (about 5 minutes) and then add salt & pepper to taste. YUM! =)

Wow these were fantastic! Just what i've been looking for! Thank you thank you for this recipe,it will now be the new family biscuit. So easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.I think I added too much milk as they were very sticky so I added flour a tbls at a time until it was workable. I did not roll out just patted out as to not over work the dough...

Substituted butter, added a tad more sugar and a big dollop of sour cream to even out the milk to one cup. Yum! UPDATE: Made them with all buttermilk then  night before and refrigerated the dough.  The taste was great, but I didnt get the perfect "rise" that I did the first time.  I think it was an issue of not cutting in the butter enough.  The biscuits that had the huge chunks were nice and fluffy/flakey...next time, I will take the time and make them from scratch that morning.

Excellent recipe! I used butter instead of shortening & buttermilk in place of milk. I also add more sugar when eating them with whipped cream & berries, or leave the sugar out & add cheese & garlic, parsley & onion for herbed biscuits. We also make them plain for stews & soups. Soooo yummy!!

They are anything BUT light and fluffy.  More like hockey pucks.  I was careful not to overwork the dough.

Wow!  These were great.  I was a little concerned at first cuz' there was no way they could have been kneaded or rolled.  I put the dough into a 9" square pan and baked for 20 minutes.  My oven won't get up to 425.  Cut them into squares in the pan and they turned out great.  Not the usual hockey pucks my biscuits are.  We have them with sausage gravy tonight for dinner.  Excellent.

With very little in my kitchen, I needed a biscuit recipe that required the basics and ONLY the basics. This was the perfect one and I was amazed at how good they were! At the time I was just looking for something to go with a baked chicken breast that would be filling, I was no expecting to find a recipe to write in my recipe book to make again. I made this exactly as written, I just cut the recipe in half. Thank you for sharing!

I followed the other reviewers advice... Butter instead of shortening, don't knead, and brush with melted butter after baking. Awesome.

You have to like the taste of shortening to like these biscuits. If I ever make these again, I will replace butter for shortening. The shortening taste was way too overwhelming for me. Also, I don't know if we rolled the dough to thin but these made small biscuits and did not rise all that much.

Mine didn't turn out as gorgeous as the picture but they are beautiful none the less :) Tasty too but could use a little more salt.  Believe it or not, I cut back on the powder to 2 teaspoons and they were enourmous. Anymore than 1 teaspoon of powder per cup of flour works in the opposite way - it'll cause your baked goods to not rise as high.

First of all, I haven't rated a recipe so low before. With all these rave reviews, I thought I was on to something. The biscuits came out of the oven looking good. But had a bland floury taste. I've had, made and tasted better will not be making again. We ate it with honey butter didn't help.

Usually, I'm not crazy about biscuit recipes that use shortening.  I've tried several, and found that they're not as good as one's that call for butter.  However, this was the best shortening-type biscuit I've ever made.  I made exactly twelve normal sized biscuits, with less than a tablespoon of leftover dough.  The only change I made (besides making them smaller) was that I didn't knead the dough.  I'm always wary of overworking the flour as it toughens the end product, and since there's no yeast in these, I didn't think it would be a big deal not to do it.  I wasn't expecting great biscuits, but I got them anyway!  Add my five star rating to the rest!

This recipe has become our family biscuit recipe! I think the key is to be cautious in mixing - don't overdo it! I sift all of the dry ingredients into a large bowl, then cut in the butter with a pastry blender, and then I use the pastry blender to mix in the milk - I just continue cutting it all in until the dry ingredients are no longer dry. It's a quick process and you will have a lumpy, wet, sticky dough. We drop it by handfuls on the baking sheet - no rolling and cutting. Perfect every time!    I had a bunch of strawberries on hand a few nights ago, so I added about 1/4 cup of sugar to the biscuit recipe, divided the dough into 6 pieces, sprinkled the tops with sugar, baked, and topped with fresh strawberries and cream. Oh - so good.   Thanks, JP, for a winner!

Not sure what you guys are using for biscuit cutters to only get 6 biscuits out of this recipe!  I used buttermilk and butter to produce 12 fluffy biscuits which were perfectly browned and crispy on the outside, light and airy on the inside.  Only refrigerated for about 30 minutes before baking.  Avoided a lot of handling and no kneading.  I'm the proud owner of several batches of hockey pucks from previous recipes.  Will definitely keep this recipe active and share it with my kids & other family members.  Thank you!!

I am terrible at making biscuits!!! This recipe, however, seemed to work very well. I read many of the reviews, the one advising you to use a little milk until the mixture leaves the side of the bowl is a good one. I added it gradually, and found that I didn't need the whole amount. THIS TIME, but when making in the future, I know I may need it all. Grandma used to say the key to biscuits was not to overmix, or knead in extra flour, I did what she said, they were light and fluffy. Thanks, JP!

In my hands the best recipe for baking powder biscuits is this one: 2 c. flour, 2 t. baking powder, 1 t. baking soda, 1/2 t. salt, 5 T. butter, 2/3 to 3/4 c. milk.  I do everything else the same.  It is  similar to JP's biscuits, but doesn't have sugar.

This has by far become my favorite biscuit recipe, I don't know What about it makes it better because at first glance it looks like every other biscuit recipe I've always tried but nothing else makes biscuits as flaky and tender. Love to make Big (use this recipe to make 6 and bake @ 400 instead of 425) biscuit sandwiches on Sunday mornings =). One note, the recipe calls for a cup of milk, I always use this amount but they are drop biscuits this way and not the kneadable type so lessen the milk if you prefer to roll and cut your biscuits.

Mmm!, these are so good and so easy to make. I followed the advice of COOKIECLAIRE and substituted butter for the shortening. I ended using a bit less than the milk required by the recipe when mixing the dough. Tried to knead (well, not really knead, I folded to bring together and patted down, maybe 12 to 15 folds) as little as possible and the biscuits came out fluffy and they are true to their name "Big Daddy Biscuits". Thanks J.P. for sharing this recipe!.

I know this recipe doesn't need any more reviews, but I just HAD to say something!  These biscuits were the best I've tried, and so easy.  I did end up using an entire cup of milk, but that may be because I live in a dry climate.  Also, I used unsalted butter instead of shortening.  The dough was easy to handle, I did not roll it out, but patted it and used a juice glass dipped in flour to cut them.  I also baked them in a cast iron skillet so they were touching each other.  Thank you JP!

Easy, easy, and easy and my quest for the best biscuits is over! I've been making these for 3 years and they are still my fav. Make sure your baking powder is still active or they will be flat as a pancake; replace baking powder after 6 months. Also, the less you knead the more delicate the biscuit. I usually add only 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 tsp of salt. Sometimes I use butter, sometimes crisco. I pat the dough flat now and cut it into six equal pieces and round the biscuits-less work and you get the right size. Thank you Big Daddy!

These turn out great every time ! Be careful with the milk though - depending on the humidity of the day ,the flour might not take it all and leave your dough too sticky and wet - add the milk slowly,working your dough as you go.

I made these buscuits for breakfast on Mother's day this year.  They were very moist, and tender.  They were a snap to make too!  I used butter flavored crisco to give it that butter taste.  When they were done, I split them and put a pat of unsalted butter on each!  Delish!!! I didn't kneed them, just let it rest for a few minutes and then rolled them out!  My mom and my children loved them.  Very tasty!!

I have never made homemade biscuits before but this recipe sounded easy enough.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The taste of these were horrible.  They were so sticky that I think I used too much flour on my hands, on my countertop, on my rolling pin, etc that they were like bricks when I took them out of the oven.  They literally came out of my oven and straight into my trash can.  I think I'll stick to the storebought biscuits if this is what making biscuits is like.  Sorry, but these were not for me.

I took until the third try before I got them just right.  The key is DO NOT OVER KNEED. They are so yummy.  I make a least one batch a week.  They are good warmed up in the microwave.

This has become my standard biscuit recipe...it is fantastic!  In addition to making the traditional plain biscuits, I have used this recipe to make cinnamon biscuits, as well as a crust for chicken pot pie.  To make a crust for a 9x13 pan of pot pie filling, make one batch JP's biscuits and roll into a rectangle to cover top of filling in pan.  No bottom crust needed, bake until golden!  Turned out fabulous!  I highly recommend this recipe. :-)

WOW! We love these!!! Helpful hints: Make sure your baking powder is fresh, and be gentle with the dough. Pat rather than knead.

This is such an easy recipe. I skip most of step #3; only kneading the dough then dropping it by tablespoonfuls onto a baking sheet. The biscuits turn out great every time!

I found these the other day and have kept wanting to try them; finally I found time.  I used real butter instead of the shortening, and did not knead but maybe five times.  I brushed the tops with butter before and after baking, and I only had to bake them for 10 minutes.  These biscuits were very light, fluffy, and DELICIOUS!!!  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I used about 1.25 cups.  Okay, so I altered things some, but thank you for the yummy recipe!

These biscuits are absolutely wonderful!  I am very impressed..........they taste just like the ones at KFC! I will be making these again and again.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe. I didn't have any shortening, so I substituted margerine, and it worked.

These are the absolute BEST biscuits!! I have never had a "bad batch"! I did find that letting the dough rest (in fridge) for a few hours result's in MONSTER high biscuits. These are fantastic as is but you can add seasoning or other ingredients. One favorite variation of ours is to add fresh choped chives, fresh minced garlic and butter flavored shortening in place of regular......TASTY!! :)
If you have tried this recipe and had unfavorable results.....try again! You won't be disappointed!

I don't recall ever making homemade biscuits in the past...except with bisquick, so I was excited to give these a try.  They turned out really well and did rise beautifully.  My dough was a little sticky so I had to add a tad more flour to make it "workable" and I didn't roll this out and use a biscuit cutter.  Instead I just tore peices off and shaped it with my hands.  They did look a little funky after they were baked, but we still ate them.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't mean to sound critical because I hate those type of people.  However, these biscuits were probably the worst biscuits I have ever made.  And to top it off...I made them for the 1st time when my mother-in-law was in town.  So I'm sure you can feel my pain.  Honestly,if you want a good buttermilk biscuit recipe, open up the Betty Crocker Cookbook.  My mother-in-law came back into town and I tried the recipe from the cookbook.  OUTSTANDING!  Sorry John.

I wasn't expecting anything better than my usual biscuit recipe, but I found these to be moist and light.  The texture before rolling and after baking was soft and silky.  I got 12 small biscuits, but next time will try for 8 big bicuits.  My advice is to portion the dough into pieces and shape into biscuits instead of rolling and cutting; rolling them always means leftover scaps.  Good biscuits!  Thank you.

I have never made buscuits from scratch before because most receipes that I've seen call for buttermilk (which I never have or buy)or they seem like way too much trouble. I am so glad that I found this receipe. I followed it exactly except I didn't have shortening so I used margerine. They turned out great! Light, fluffy, tender and very easy to make. Thank you!!

This recipe was incredible!!  I took the advise of some other reviewers and used 1 1/2 tbls. of baking powder and I substituted buttermilk for the milk.  I also made the batter the night before and chilled until morning.  I did not knead the dough.  It was easy and again, they were INCREDIBLE buscuits!!

Wow--I was really impressed, and I thought I made good biscuits.  These were easy, light, and gone in a flash.  Here in the deep south, big biscuits like these are called Cat Head biscuits, incidentally, because they are as big as a cats' head.  Whatever, they are now the only biscuit recipe I will consider.  I did have to use less milk, about 2/3 cup.

I have tried this and countless biscuits recipes and still couldn't make a good biscuits. All turned out dense, hard, dry. I wondered if it was the technique,I read on all the tips everywhere and still couldn't find what the problem was with such an easy recipe. Now I discovered what was wrong with all these recipes. Read the ingredient list. It doesn't include EGGS. EGGs is what will do the trick. Add 1 egg and you will be much happier with your biscuits.

Yep this takes a few tries (too salty the first time) but this is now a go-to recipe! These are the modifications that made it work for my family ::

2 c flour,
2 tsp baking powder,
1/2 tsp baking soda,
1/2 tsp salt,
1 tbs sugar,
1/3 c butter,
3/4 cup milk

 :: Don't knead it, take it out of the bowl just after it all combines, briefly pat it into a ball and then roll it out to 1/2 inch, fold the whole thing in half before you start cutting. A large round cutter is pretty key to getting "grand" sized biscuits. This makes 5 large biscuits and 1 runt biscuit.

Very easy to make! I am 41 years old and have tried making biscuits many times with no success until I made these! Now I make them and freeze so I can just pop them in the oven when I need a couple.

Delicious biscuit recipe!  A good, old standard.  I baked mine in a cast iron skillet.  I preheated the skillet in the 425 oven, then added a couple tbs of butter to melt.  The biscuits cooked in that pan of melted butter.  Then during the last 5-minutes of baking I basted the top of the biscuits with melted butter.  The result was a tender, rich, buttery biscuit that went perfectly with my homemade sausage gravy.  This is now officially my keeper biscuit recipe.  The only alteration I made to the ingredients was to only use as much of the milk as was needed.  By this I mean that I poured a cup of milk, but I added that milk to the dough sparingly just until the dough came together.

OH YUM!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  My husband is on a restricted sodium diet and I’ve been searching FOR MONTHS for a good, low sodium biscuit! This is it!  Here’s what I did: to the 2 C. flour and 1 T. sugar  I used 2 t. low sodium baking powder (I’m going to purchase no sodium baking powder next!), ½ t. no sodium baking soda, ¼ t. salt, 4 T. buttermilk powder, substituted water for the milk and used cold, unsalted butter instead of shortening.  I figured that with the yield of 6 biscuits, each one has approximately 261 mg. of sodium.  I didn’t really knead the dough either – just sort of patted it together on a floured counter, using flour as needed so the dough wouldn’t stick.  Don’t know why I didn’t think of this before…take a good basic biscuit recipe and simply reduce the salt, etc.!   Simply GOOD!!!

Look No further for another biscuit recipe.. These are the perfect biscuit to make. I made 150 of these for a Church event and everyone raved how yummy and tender they tasted. Once you make this recipe you will never want to buy those pre-made bicuits.

This was the best biscuit recipe I have ever had! My family loved it and wanted me to write it down so I could make it again. The dough was very easy to make. They took about 15 minutes to bake. The biscuits turned out crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I substituted butter for the shortening and left out the sugar. :)

I just made this recipe and they tasted delicious! We only use wheat flour and non-dairy milk. they worked out just fine! My husband was very impressed. 
I followed the tip from CookieClaire. I only added the amount of milk I needed. Until the dough left the sides of the bowl. I did not knead 14-15 times. I did knead maybe 3-5 times until everything looked well incorporated. Cut these bad boys into circles and baked until nice and golden. They taste wonderful! Remember people...follow instructions but it takes some knowledge about cooking as well. It's all trial and error. God Bless!

I made some modifications to this recipe, but these were stellar!  I used this recipe to make a copycat version of red lobster biscuits.  I didn't have the biscuit mix it called for, but i had all this stuff to make these, wow!  So the actual changes i made were to chill it in foil like he described for 1.5 hours, added 3/4 to 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 tsp garlic (probably will add more the next time i do this or just spread with garlic butter), used butter instead of shortening, and sprinkled some parsley in it.  OMG, yum!  Great recipe.  My picky husband loved them as well, so i always love finding things to add to his repertoire.  Next time i will try leaving in the fridge for 3-4 hours.  Thank you, these were so good.

A good basic biscuit recipe. A few tips: use a cake pan or baking dish just big enough to hold all of the biscuits. They should just touch each other but not be packed in tight, they bake up taller when they can sort of climb up each other as they rise. When you cut the biscuits cut straight down without twisting the cutter. This prevents the cut edge from sealing & allows them to rise better. Pour a little oil or melted butter in the pan before adding the biscuits top side down & turn them over to coat with the oil. Make them early enough to allow them to sit in the pan for about 1/4 hour before putting them into the oven. This allows them to relax so they'll be lighter & fluffier. If you think the flavor is bland replace the shortening with butter.

These came out soft and tender!! A key to soft tender biscuits is to handle the dough as little as possible! I mixed in the milk with a fork turned the dough out and rolled it just enough to make it flat. Also, make sure your shortening is ice cold, I put mine in the freezer for about 30 minutes before using it. This will definitely be my go to recipe for biscuits!

Love biscuits, but had never made any.  This recipe was easy, biscuits are great.  I followed a little advice from other reviewers on further trials.  change 1 Tbs baking powder to 2 tsp + 1/2 tsp baking soda.  I also changed the shortening to lard.  Also, before and after baking brush melted butter on top.

You can't get biscuits any better than this. I have been trying for years to find a good biscuit recipe, and I am no longer looking. Light and tasty. The only thing I do differently is use buttermilk instead of regular milk, but these are excellent as written. Thank you, John, for posting.

These are by far the best and easiest biscuits you will ever make. Directions and ingredients are spot on. 

The only change I make and it is totally my choice if I have it is instead of using shortening I will use left over bacon grease that I keep stored in my fridge. It adds a ton of amazing flavor!

Wonderful biscuits! I use coconut oil instead of shortening and almond or coconut milk instead of regular, and they turn out perfectly!

These were pretty good. IJ have a recpie that is a lot like this, with the exception of 1 egg, it also calls for less baking powder and more shortening.
 Mine did not rise shy high as the recpie said it would, but i think that it was because my baking powder was a little  (ok a lot ) old. 
I will make these again.

Absolutely Wonderful!  With the exception of butter for shortening, I mixed the dough up in no time at all, cut the biscuits and refrigerated them for 3 or 4 hours.  The baking time will be longer due to this, but, oh my goodness, what lovely big biscuits, with a soft delicate texture to enjoy.  Truly a simple recipe with wonderful results.  These were served with bowls of fresh made vegetable soup.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

Ok, so what did I do wrong?  I love biscuits! I opened a new can of baking powder and a new can of shortening (I use Crisco).  I used a bit less than 1 cup of milk and used sea salt rather than regular because that is all I had.  The biscuits did not rise at all and the taste is so-so, Bisquick biscuits taste better.  I guess that I should have read the reviews first.... So sorry that this was a waste of time and materials.

Being raised in the south biscuits are a daily food item. Try adding warm bacon grease instead of the shortening. Very Very good

These are the BEST!!! They don't taste too baking powdery and their texture is the very best. I get so many requests to make these. I added just a bit more sugar.

 Had no shortening so used butter. 
I did it all in the food processor.

I used buttermillk (just personal pref) but these are the best biscuits ever. I do find letting the batter sit for about 5 min before I knead/roll them out tends to make it easier (and doesn't have me adding more flour which dries out your biscuits).

Not much different than my normal recipe for these, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I didn't use all the milk, but other than that, followed the recipe to a T. They turned out about the same as my usual biscuit recipe...I think I just need to do some biscuit research and see what I am doing wrong! They don't rise much and, although the flavor is good, they are a little chewy/tough for my liking.

I replaced the shorterining with butter and they turned out excellent.... my husband has lived in the States for 9 years and misses his American breakfast here in Bahrain. I surprised him with these and he loved them. Will make them every week now. Thanks for the awesome recipe.. super easy and super tasty... :)

I was in the mood for homemade biscuits and my yahoo search turned up these.  Simple recipe and the biscuits were pretty darned good.  I'd like to find a more buttery tasting recipe or maybe add a little more butter to these or brush them with butter fresh out of the oven.  If you are looking for a good, solid biscuit recipe, try this one!  I'll definitely make them again.....just with more butter!

Definitely would make these again.  Fluffy.  Tasty. Followed other prior suggestion - used 4 T buttermilk and 3/4  c milk.  Used 2 1/2 t baking powder and 1/2 t baking soda. Used cold butter rather than shortening.  ** make sure to only roll them 1 " thick - first time I made them too thin.

I let them sit in the fridge for a while and they turned out perfectly. I cut them short and made about 12 normal size biscuits. And to the people who say "Adding sugar to a biscuit makes it a scone"- It doesn't. Adding CREAM to a biscuit makes it a scone. Without sugar this recipe would be too salty.

These turned out great, and quickly disappeared at the supper table! I made a recipe and a half, which yielded twelve biscuits for us. I had buttermilk, so I used that instead of milk otherwise I made as stated. Also, I was in a super hurry, so instead of rolling out the dough and using the biscuit cutter I shaped the dough into a rectangle, and used a pizza cutter to the biscuits. Doing it this way was really speedy. They took a smidge longer to bake, about 5 minutes, but this could just be my oven.  Otherwise, they came out golden brown, light and puffy! Definitely a keeper!

Giving this 4 stars based upon my two tries, but I may change it over time.  They don't look as pretty as the picture and mine just aren't raising like they should.  I used butter flavored Crisco shortening and skim milk, because that's what I had.  My first try the baking powder was old.  The second I used brand new and they were better, but just weren't what I'd hoped for.  I want BIG fluffy biscuits, like you get in a restaurant.  I have been baking them right away, so next time I'll try letting it set a bit and be more careful about not twisting the cutter, hard to do when you are using a glass.  The flavor is good, so I'll keep trying.

Very, very nice! I used all butter instead of shortening. I never knead biscuit dough as I find it makes them tough. instead I pat the dough into a coherent mass. Might leave the sugar out next time as I'm not sure it needs to be there.

Great. My juice cup was too small, so they came out like towers. Go for a bigger cup to cut the biscuits.

Have tried several biscuit recipes from this site and others. This is, without a doubt, the best. I did follow discobunny's suggestions and used buttermilk instead of milk, cut the baking powder down to 2 tsp., and added 1/2 tsp. Baking soda. They were light and crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Highly recommend!

I added a teaspoon more of sugar and a half tsp of vinegar to my milk before mixing the dough.I used an ice cream scoop to put them on my ungreased cookie sheet and they were great! I used the left over biscuits for strawberry shortcakes!

Fantastic! This recipe deserves 5 stars as is, and you can make it 10 stars for your family:) I have made these both with butter flavored shortening and also with butter (1 whole stick frozen then grated into the flour mix) . Also, I tried cooking immediately versus letting the dough sit overnight. Both versions were great. The butter  version was richer and fluffier so I will probably stick to that one. For a more brown top, I took another poster's advice and brushed melted butter on tops after 10 minutes. I also don't see how 1 cup of milk was too much for some people. I have always found it to be perfect. I recommend you try the recipe as written, then tweak it to fit your family's tastes. Thanks JP!!

Great biscuits!  My boyfriend (who doesn't cook much) made these for me when I had a craving.  He says the directions and recipe was "precise, clear and wonderful".  They were delicious and we'll definitely make them again.  We used butter instead of shortening...and (accidentally)used salted butter.  I'd recommend using unsalted but ours weren't overly salty by any means.

These are amazing! I've never used a recipe that called for shortening so I was kind of nervous to make this one. This was an absolutely perfect recipe and definitely what I was looking for. These are very universal biscuits and could be eaten with pretty much any meal. I'll never buy a tube of biscuits again!

i love this!
but i changed a couple of things.
i put cardamom and cinnamon into the mixture to give the biscuits a nicer flavor. it turned out really well. i even sprinkled sugar on half of the batch and added extra cinnamon to make them sweeter then the other half. on half of the batch i decided to put baking soda as well. those biscuits turned out a bit thicker and fluffier. :) i love this recipe!!!

its amazing with HONEY!!!! :D

Pretty good.  I got 8 smaller biscuits out of the recipe. Cooked it at 425 and they got crunchy on the outside and were soft on the inside. Next time I will cook them slower at 375 or 400 so they are softer on the outside.

I'm not a regular biscuit-baker, and I know I have a lot to learn still. I had to add about 1 more cup of flour to the dough in order to successfully roll it out and cut the biscuits. When they baked, the biscuits rose so high! I do think they were a little dry, but I attribute that to user error and being a novice at making biscuits. They were excellent with sausage gravy!

On advice of many AR people I tried this recipe yesterday. 
Untill yesterday I have never been able to create fluffy biscuits, leaving me with hockeypucks each time!

I am proud to report they were big, fluffy and flaky and delicious! This will be my biscuits basic recipe as of yesterday!

LOVE THESE.  For the SUPER-FAST version...just pat the whole ball of dough to about 1/2 inches thick and slice like a pizza before baking.

These biscuits were a hit with biscuits & gravy!  They weren't quite as flaky as I had hoped, but I am going to try again.  I put the dough in the fridge overnight, and the biscuits still baked up high the next morning!

This was my first attempt to make homemade biscuits.  Even though these were so much easier to mix up and make than I thought they would be, my family, me included, thought they were very bland and tasted like flour.  Still looking for the perfect biscuit.

I was searching for a biscuit recipe that reminded me of the ones my grandmother used to make and stumbled across this.  While it wasn't exactly what my memory was looking for- these biscuits were extremely simple to make and tasted very good.  The "big daddy" part of the title did not lie.  Mine rose about 2- 2 1/2 inches tall while baking and were very flaky and oh-so-good with the friend chicken we had with them.  I will be making this again...and again...and again

These are a great base biscuit!!  They are easy and they go a long way! I have learned that if you cut the milk back th 3/4 cups it works much better for me! I also like to add a tbsp of fine garlic powder to the dry ingredients and that gives them a great savory flavor if you want to serve them with dinner and a lot of flavor when adding gravy atop!! This is my staple recipe in my kitchen! Thank you!!

Excellent! Wasn't sure about the sugar, but was plesantly surprised, was out of milk, so I used buttermilk, & I also used butter instead of shortening, only made 4 biscuits. Was perfect for our Sunday morning biscuits & gravy. Boyfriend asked for recipe, because when he works out of town he cooks for the crew, figured they would enjoy these biscuits & gravy!

I dont understand what I do wrong.  My biscuits do not turn out huge or fluffy. They tasted great, and are tender but mine do not raise very much at all.  I also think there is way too much liquid in the dough.  I have made these several times hoping Ill get it right. I have even cut them extremely thick to get the huge biscuits, with no good results.  These just did not turn out the way they promised.  They were good biscuits but more like every other biscuit recipe ive made.

This were the easiest and best biscuits I have ever made. The dough is very runny and wet once mixed up, but I just add a little more flour and then knead a few times on a floured surface. They are fabulous!

These looked nice but something was missing.  Maybe they needed more salt?  Following several recommendations, I used salted butter instead of the shortening.  Seems that would have made them more salty.  Anyway, I'm still searching for that perfect biscuit recipe.

Followed the recipe to a 'T'...my biscuits came out flat, hard and not flaky at all. They tasted good...that was about all. Might try again using another's tip of not kneading the dough.

This is the first time I have made biscuits from scratch. To be honest, I was not expecting them to come out as good as they did. We had  great time making them (loads of laughing at the fact we felt like idiots because we have to look at the recipie every minute). They were so yummy, and fun to make. This recipie gets an "A" in our house!

perfect, fluffy, and easy. :) This recipe is great. I topped them with venison stew. I think this is a great base recipe. You could add anything to it and it would taste great.

These biscuits are wonderful!  I used margarine instead of shortening but otherwise followed the recipe.  I got a dozen good sized biscuits from the batter.

I've been using this recipe for almost two years now, so I guess it's about time for me to review it.   These biscuits are very easy to prepare, and they yield very big (although the recipe may exaggerate this a little bit) and very fluffy biscuits. I make these for biscuits and gravy, and they pair perfectly.   Whenever I need a biscuit recipe, I just look for J.P's big daddy biscuits, because I know they won't ever let me down.

This was my first time making biscuits from scratch.  They were good, but I'm sure I can make them better with practice.  They definitely weren't as big and fluffy as some of those in the pictures.

I make these all the time, I can't believe I've never reviewed them!  I use butter instead of shortening.  I usually mix them with my food processor, but sometimes I've had to use a pastry blender to cut in the butter.  I've been out of milk before while making these and used plain yogurt instead--which was fine.  They always turn out and are delicious.  I love them with sausage gravy or with lemon curd. Yum!

These are just like scones we have over here, except we would use butter instead of shortening.  I stuck to the recipe as given though, and they were lovely, light and fluffy and extremely easy to make. Even though there was little sugar in the recipe, they would be too sweet to eat with a savoury meal for my taste but were divine when split straight from the oven and with some butter.

Good recipe.  Biscuits were tender, flaky, and tasty.  They did not rise to be HUGE, but they were not flat and hard as hockey pucks either, so a success in my book.  They were easy to make.  I will make again and probably brush melted butter on the tops before I bake them.  I might also sub half butter for half crisco just to experiment.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I am determined to master this recipe!  I make scratch biscuits at my diner each morning and I have tried this recipe several times.  Here is what I have found.  First, if you roll them to the 1 inch thickness suggested they rise while baking but I have found they brown on the outside before fully cooking on the inside.  When I did a half an inch  thick dough it turned out much better.  Second, I thought they were a bit too sweet so I cut the sugar in half.  I like a savory biscuit with my sausage gravy!  Third, I have decided that bigger isn't necessarily better.  I DO like the flavor of these biscuits which is why I keep tinkering with them, but I no longer lust after the rediculously tall rise that is promised.  I think the taste is worth it even without the height!

Made these for our monthly "breakfast for dinner" to serve with sausage gravy and they were perfect.  I did sub butter for the shortening and from start to finish it took me 20 minutes.  Lovely!

I'm officially retiring my old biscuit recipe.  These are hands down the best biscuits I've ever made, and super simple as well.
My only complaint is that the recipe is SMALL so I double it straight off. 
I have made them with both butter & butter flavored shortening.  The butter produced flakier biscuits; the shortening more tender biscuits.  Next time I think I will try half butter/half shortening (best of both worlds?) and will definitely let you all know how that goes.
Word to wise - make sure your butter is COLD when you cut it in, and don't cut it too finely.  Those little lumps of butter are what help to form the flaky layers.
Amazing recipe!

I made these not to be biscuits, but to be the topping of a chicken/veggie casserole.  I don't have a pastry cutter and I definitely don't have the patience for the two knives thing, so I used a potato masher and alternated between light pressing/mixing, and cut through the end result a few times with a knife.  Also be sure to add the milk gradually, as if I had added the entire cup it would have been too much.  The end result was very tasty, much better than anything I could have bought in a store.

I rate these 4 stars.  It was hard for me to get 6 - 1 inch thick biscuits.  I used shortening but after eating them I wish I had used butter.  The flavor would have been a little better - let me add they didn't need much.  Overall these were pretty good, easy to make, and I will make them again but with butter as others have suggested using. --UPDATE-- I've started using butter and doubling the recipe.  I get 12 large biscuits that are absolutely out of this world.  I use buttermilk in place of the milk and butter in place of the shortening, and have learned not to over cut in my butter into the flour -- butter chunks = yummy goodness.  So, now I'm the best biscuit maker, ever! (Or, so my kids say. :P)

You know what is the best thing about this recipe, besides it making great biscuits? Calculate this recipe to 100 or ever how many you want and you have your basic biscuit mix already made up. Then all you have to do is mix in the shortening (or butter) and milk and pop them in the over. Here's a little hint. I could never make good biscuits but my daughter could. She said since I was used to making yeast bread that I kneaded the dough too much. Biscuits, you have to be gentle with them, with love.

I too, could not for the life of me make biscuits until I found this recipe! Being from the south, it's EXPECTED that I know how to make biscuits! I used buttermilk and since it's thicker, was able to follow the measurement called for in the recipe. I doubled the recipe and used both shortening and butter (only had 1 stick). I increased the sugar slightly based on some other reviews. This is a fantastice recipe and a great base to experiment with.

FANTASTIC recipe! It is quite sticky but just turn it out onto a very well floured surface and cover with more flour. Knead 5-10 times and flour the surface some more, then pat it out.

These tasted great with blueberry jam but they really didn't rise much (could have been my fault).  They looked like the little buttermilk biscuits that come out of the can.  Overall a disappointment.

These were great and fast! I wanted them to turn out a little taller (meaning more fluffy/have each one rise more), but with most breads the first time you make them they aren't perfect. I will make these again.

Great recipe, as close as I've found to the ones my grandmother made.  You may or may not need all the milk - the idea is to add it until the mixture just comes together.  I make mine the 'southern' way as my Granny did - barely knead them in the bowl by just turning the dough over onto itself several times.  Then I pinch off balls and gently roll them with my palms and put them in a greased cast iron skillet.  After I have them all in there with just small spaces between, I flour the backs of my fingers and use them to gently press down on each biscuit.  I brush them with melted butter when they come out.  Fantastic!

This is my go to recipe for making biscuits.  My family will gobble this all up as soon as it comes out of the oven.  I actually cut the dough into half the size that the recipes calls for and it comes out to a normal sized biscuit.  Plus I get twice the amount for the same effort.    I'm a lazy biscuit maker so I just drop the dough by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet and they taste just as great.  I even accidentally forgot to add the sugar and they still are wonderful.  Great recipe and a sure keeper!

This was my first attempt at homemade biscuits, I usually get mine from the tube.  This is a great recipe, easy to follow.  I did follow one reviewers advice and used the food processor and it worked great!

STOP SEARCHING AND TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!I know this sounds like every other review but this IS THE BEST BISCUIT RECIPE. I have tried soooo many others. These come out fluffy, moist, and very flavorful! I did what a few others recommended and mixed the dry ingredients first, then the fats, then the milk in a food processor, keeping the ingredients super cold and let the dough rest over night wrapped in cling wrap. I used 3 tbsp of chilled shortening and 3 tbsp of chilled butter. The dough was sticky but I think that is what it supposed to be like. When it is chilled overnight it is less sticky and you can cut the biscuits out easier. I didn't roll it out. I patted it out with my hands carefully and dusted off the excess flour I used to keep it from sticking to the board or cutter. Handle the dough as little as possible for the best results. Do not omit the sugar as other did. I don't care for sweets, but these need the sugar to balance the flavors out. If you have ever had overly salty or baking-soda-tasting biscuits it is because you need the sugar. They are not sweet at all like a scone, just very balanced. I also brushed the tops with a little milk to give them a nice sheen. Oh yeah ... I used King Arthur Unbleached All-purpose flour. It does make a difference in the final result. Much lighter!

Um... wow! These biscuits were awesome! I used half spelt flour and half kamut flour, replaced the milk with rice milk and omitted the sugar because of the rice milk's natural sweetness. Although I wasn't sure that these were going to work out because of my changes, I went for it anyways... and man-oh-man am I glad I did! These are delicious and went terrifically with our beef stew... deeee-lish!

These came out great considering I have never made a homemade biscuit in my life! I used butter that I had put in the freezer for 1/2 hour. I mixed the dry ingredients, then used my fingers to gently 'pinch' the butter into little pieces, coating the pieces with flour as I went along. This is how I watched my Nanny do it as a kid. I then dribbled the milk in slowly until it came together into a ball. I did not knead it or mix it after that, just patted it out with my hands and cut it with my round cutter. Baked as directed for 15 minutes. Came out perfectly golden and so tender on the inside. I will never buy the pre-made biscuits again - these are so easy and way cheaper also.

These were very good.  I have made these several times now and just want to say use a 1/3 cup butter in them.  They get better and better every time.  I have frozen them and then bake for 25 minutes like you would the ones you buy at the store.  No more store bought for us.  I see some say they are gettting "flat" check your baking soda date also make sure you are adding 1 Tablespoon and not teaspoon.   I love it!! UPDATE: Used cold butter with my pastry blend and OMG.. I got the best biscuits yet. I also want to add that I use my hands at the end alot to mix it. Still best biscuits around

These are really really good! I substituted half & half for the milk and butter for the shortening, just because that's what I had on hand. I mixed the dough as directed, but I didn't kneed it or anything - just spooned it out onto the baking sheet in 6 mounds, flattened it out, and into the oven it went. They rose well and taste wonderful! Great recipe!!

Incredible taste and texture. Keep dough at least 1 inch thick or you'll get coaster like biscuits. Definately a keeper.

Beautiful biscuits - very good and very easy. I often use this versatile dough to make some simple variations:

Red Lobster-ish cheddar: add 1 cup or more of grated cheddar cheese and 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning to the dough. Spoon the dough onto parchment lined baking sheet and brush with a mixture of 1/3 cup butter, 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning and 1-2 cloves minced garlic. Bake as directed.

Strawberry Shortcakes: add 1-2 Tbsp more sugar and a pinch of cinnamon to the recipe. Bake according to directions then cool. Once cool, split and fill with sweetened whipped cream and sliced strawberries. so good!!

I have tried several biscuit recipes in the past couple weeks, and now that I found this recipe it seems as if I am obsessed with making biscuits because they turn out so pretty and tasty! My whole family loves them and they are big and moist. I always eat mine with Strawberry Jam in the middle. I don't even use a measuring cup for the milk, just gradually add some until it is just right, not all sticky. Also, in another review it said not to twist the cutter or glass when cutting them out because it seals down the edges and they won't be as tall as the could be. It take a couple times to get them down! Keep trying!

These biscuits were ok, we ate them with butter and jam.  I made them exactly as written since I don't believe in rating a recipe if you make changes.  They were more the consistency of drop biscuits rather than the roll-out kind, so my hands got really sticky while trying to work with the dough.  I had to cut them with a pastry wheel, and even then the dough stuck to it.  After they baked they were fine, the problem was the raw dough.

My family LOVES thes biscuits!  I double the batch as we have a family of 7.  Instead of shortening & salt I substitute salted butter & in a double batch use 1 1/2 cupas of milk.  They remind us of KFC buscuits.  If there are any left over, they make great egg & cheese buscuits for breakfast!!

I have made these biscuits several times in the past few months and they are wonderful each and every time. Definitely 5 stars.  I have found that you cam make the dough ahead of time and chill until ready to bake.  The dough will actually roll better if slightly chilled.  I have substituted butter for the shortening a few times and it gives them a nice buttery flavor.  This is the only biscuit recipe that I use. Thanks for a great recipe.

This has become my standard biscuit recipe.  This morning howeve, I changed it slightly by using buttermilk instead of whole milk, as I happened to have some leftover and I never use buttermilk for anything so I said hey, why not try it in the biscuits.  They were delicious as usual, but even a little softer and melt in your mouth-ier than usual.  Try it sometime.  Tese biscuits are great as is, so I wouldnt run out to buy bittermilk for them, but if you happen to have some around it is a great substitution.  Next time I'll try using plain yogurt instead of milk, it should do the same as the buttermilk.

This was the greatest recipe ever!  I'm feel bad due to the fact that Great Great Gramma Hawley had made the greatest ever, but now...You take the prize J.P.  Great Job!!  I have been using your recipe for over a year now, and because of the raves of these biscuits, I've decided it's time to let you earn your rewards of great praise.  I'm a home cook making everything from scratch, but this recipe, I will never give out to family.  Have more great recipes?  just send them my way.  I'm sure I will appreciate all of them as will my family.  Thanks, lisa

I patted my dough out too thin, so they didn't get as big as they should have.  However, they were still excellent.  They turned out soft and flaky!  I did use the new trans fat free stick Crisco. Thanks for sharing!

These biscuits were fantastic and easy to make. I'm making them again tonight-- I won't kneed the dough as much. The less kneeding you do, the flufflier the biscuits. I had amazing biscuits this summer in Louisiana and we Californians just aren't used to fluffy biscuits... I'm so pleased I can re-create those amazing biscuits I had down south. Southerns know their biscuits.

Unbelievably foolproof. I'm sooo bad when it comes to making breads. This time I lightly spooned the flour into the measuring cup and leveled it off and had too little flour. Then I tried to convert 1/3 cp into tbsp and ended up putting in like 7 tbsp of shortening! But I kept adding flour and probably over-kneaded it but to my shock they turned out just great. This is a good recipe!

I've made this as biscuits and as pizza dough.  Just spread out on a baking sheet and top.  It will make a VERY thick, VERY VERY filling crust though.  Making it tonight with some Hawaiian toppings.

I have been using this recipe for years now. My kids like buttermilk biscuits; so I substitue 1/2 cup of milk with buttermilk and add a teaspoon of baking soda. I also split the shortening in half with butter and add 1/2 tablespoon of extra baling powder.

To get the most out of this recipe, do two things. First, sift all your dry ingrediants together. Flour needs to be sift as it gets compacted over time in those flour bags. Second, cut in the shorting/butter well. I mean REALLY well. Do those two things and your biscuits will pop!

I have made these 20 or 30 times and always were good. Tonight I added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary, 3/4 teaspoon grated parmesian and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. I brushed them with melted butter before and directly after baking.  Served with pasta or seafood would be fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and quick!  The dough was also very sticky for me - even though I only used about 2/3 C Milk - so I just made sure to knead it on a nice layer of flour.  I patted it into a rectangle and cut square biscuits rather than messing with a round cutter, too.

Fabulous!  I had given up on making biscuits from scratch because mine turned out always dry, but I ran out of bisquick this morning so I gave these a try.  This is my favorite biscuit I've ever made!  I used butter flavor Crisco.  Go ahead and put the whole cup of milk in...the dough will be sticky, but that's what makes them so moist.  Be sure not to overcook them; take them out as soon as they start browning.  Sometimes for biscuits with extra flavor I add sliced green onions, shredded cheddar cheese, and crumbled cooked bacon to the dry ingredients.  Give this one a try!

I've made these several times and these biscuits are fluffy and rise really high.  They're really good but you really do need to brush the tops with butter, or maybe add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt because they don't have much flavor on their own.  Or omit the salt and substitute buttermilk for the regular milk and you'll have a really good biscuit.  Thanks for the recipe Jim.

I thought these were delicious.  I do think that the recipe called for too much milk, but I just added a touch more flour and these turned out wonderfully...used them for busciuts and gravy and the hubby loved them.  Thanks John.

After reading all of these fantastic reviews about your biscuits, I had high hopes that were not filled. These biscuits, though the dough was easy to use, were bland and tasteless. Not even butter or honey could add enough flavor.

These are great!!  A little lost on flavor , bit pretty easy too make.  Needs more flour especially when kneading.  I use sour milk instead of reg, and added a bit more sugar (when making them for breakfast).  I also went savory after the first time I made them, added chp garlic, and some italian seasoning turned out great.  Don't roll too thin!!  It's thickness that you want!!  Double's and triples very well, using less milk.  I also used bread flour, which turned out better.

I had never made homemade biscuits before and these were so easy and delicious.  My husband has not stopped raving about them, nor my sister or her boyfriend.  I have made them 3 times in a week already...twice for breakfast and once for dinner. Thanks John!

My wife doubles the suger in this recipe and we eat them in half the time. We usually go thru a double batch in a few short days. These are great with eggs, gravy, butter, or honey. Absolutely a family favorite!

My biscuits usually turn out as pet rocks but these were nice and fluffy.  I rolled it a little too thin + used my medium sized biscuit cutter so they were not as large as others have alluded to. Going to make ANOTHER batch later today i think (for fun!) just to see how high the are supposed to be! Thanks for a great recipe!

It does not get easier than this!  I made the dough ahead of time and just stored it in the fridge until it was time to bake them.  They baked up so light and fluffy, and the whole family devoured them.  They were great right out of the oven with some butter, but I liked them even better at room temperature, with some butter and honey.  Made them last night, and I was asked to make them again tonight, so off I go!

What HUGE tasty biscuits these are!  I pulsed the dry ingredients and shortening in my food processor, then transferred to a bowl and added the full cup of milk (next time I will only use 3/4 cup) mixed it together, put it on a lightly floured counter and kneeded it about 6 turns (something I have NEVER done with biscuits because it usually makes them tough!) I then put the dough back in the bowl, covered it and put it in the fridge for 2 hours.  I got six large biscuits out of this recipe, that rose higher than any biscuit of mine has ever risen!!! I was astonished when I opened the oven door!! Thanks JP for a biscuit recipe I will use many times over!

These biscuit really are great. *Quick cooking lesson from the Culinary Institute of America.*  Mix biscuits as directed but leave out the shortening until the very end.  Form a very dry dough and then put thumbnail sized pieces of shortening in the dough.  Fold it in thirds over the shortening, roll it out slightly, fold into thirds again and roll... Repeat this process about 5 times.  Finally, roll it out to about 1/2 inch thick and then cut out the biscuits very close together.  Re-roll the scrap in the same way, then put the biscuits on  sheet trays or cookie sheets, brush on an egg wash and then bake.  Rotate the sheet tray about halfway through and finish baking.  The biscuits will be light, fluffy, and shiny.

These biscuits were great! Not only did they taste good, but they stayed soft for several days after I first made them. They were the first biscuits I have ever made that didn't turn into virtual hockey pucks by the time they were cool!  I also used margarine instead of shortening, as it was New Year's Day and nothing was open! They still turned out yummy.  I made small biscuits and got 18 in total. We'll make this one again!!

This is a great recipe!  I tripled it and used real butter in place of shortening and the finished product was wonderful.  We did let the dough set in the fridge for about an hour before cutting out giant heart shaped biscuits.  Then we brushed them lightly with milk and sprinkled granulated sugar over them before baking because we were making them to use for strawberry shortcake.  They came out great and may very well be the best biscuits I've ever eaten.

I used butter instead of shortening and I didn't get very good results.  These biscuits did not rise and was the texture of cornbread.  I don't think I will make these again unless I am short on Grands Biscuits

THESE BISCUITS ARE "I THINK I'VE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN GOOD!" I MAKE THEM AT LEAST TWICE A MONTH. I ALSO ALWAYS USE A CAST IORN SKILLET TO BAKE THEM IN.I PUT A PAT OF BUTTER ON EACH BISCUIT BEFORE I PUT THEM IN THE OVEN TOO. MAKES THE TOP CRISPY. OUR PREFERENCE. I USE TO MAKE OPEN FACE CRAB SANDWICHES WITH AN ENGLISH MUFFIN BUT DECIDED TO CUT THESE BISCUITS OUT LARGER AND FLATTER AND MADE MY SANDWICHS. WE LOVED THEM SO MUCH WE WILL NEVER USE A RUBBERY MUFFIN AGAIN......THESE BISCUITS ARE THE MOST REQUESTED RECIPE IN MY HOME.THANKS JOHN

These are definitely the easiest biscuits, with no added frills.  They are terrific, too, and even people who can't make biscuits can make these.  Next time, I will try to knead them less and use less flour to try and get them even more tender.  I also want to try them with a little more sugar.  This is a great recipe!

Ok, I have been trying to make a decent biscuit for a while now...and I have to say this is finally it. However, I did have to make them more than one time.  I read a number of the reviews and also made a few small adjustments as many suggested, buttermilk instead of milk, and did not knead as the original recipe specified.  The one thing that was not mentioned by any reviews I read was,  TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FRESH BAKING POWDER! Oh goodness, this is critical. After my first  batch that didn't rise well at all, I checked my expiration date on my baking powder and it was overdue to be replaced.  Just one of those things that gets neglected I guess (like flipping the mattress)? So after replacing the baking powder and trying a second time these biscuits are heavenly! I look like a pro to my family now! Thank you J.P.

These were great! I made them for biscuits and gravy and they are everything you want in that dish! I made as directed but scaled them up to 9 biscuits. If I were making them to eat without gravy I might use butter instead of shortening or half butter/half shortening, but the flavor was fine for biscuits and gravy since the gravy is the star of that dish. My oven tends to burn biscuits before they're done in the center and the tops never brown, so I flip them over half way through cooking and solve both problems. I did need the full 15 minutes since these are pretty thick if rolled out as the directions call for (which makes for the awesome high biscuit!)

I had to make some modifications since I have to bake them with gluten free flour. I added 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 egg, 1 tsp xantham gum and reduced the milk to 2/3 cups. Perfect texture and taste. That does not always work if you change to a GF version of the recipe.

It's a pretty standard biscuit recipe. I noticed a couple comments about them being dense - I never knead biscuits more than 5 times (my mother's admonition, "Don't mess with it too much!" echoes in my head!). Using a real biscuit cutter instead of a juice glass will help as well - a dull edge tends to seal the sides of the biscuits and keep them from raising as freely.

This is a great recipe. I've made many such recipes, but this is a winner. Usually, I do 1/2 cup of half-and-half to 3/4, with the remainder being water, instead of the milk -- I normally do not have milk. And, I also use butter rather than shortening. I measure out the ingredients --  mixing the sugar/salt/flour/baking powder, cutting the butter into smaller pieces, pouring the liquid into a measuring cup -- and place them all in the freezer. Whether making pie crust or biscuits, make sure you keep the ingredients cold prior to working with them. When mixing, cut the butter, then add liquid slowly, folding the ingredients. Place the mixture onto a floured surface, and fold and pat it down, rather than kneading it -- you do not knead biscuit dough, you need bread dough to develop gluten (linkages between glutenin and gliadin).  Do not over work if you want light flaky biscuits. Lastly, cut the dough with something sharp, so the layers that you have made by folding the dough are allowed to expand, creating the lift needed for a light/big biscuits. If you use a twisting motion rather than a straight cut, you will cause the layers to adhere to each other. 

Take-aways: keep ingredients cold; do not over work/knead/mix; cut with something sharp; place in an already hot oven

By far the best biscuit recipe ever. Perfect as-is, but sometimes I use butter instead of shortening, and they turn out perfect. They are tender, moist,  light and flavorful. Just don't overwork the dough, or they will be like tasty little rocks :)

Love them!! Easy to make. I used  cold butter and shortening to make up the 1/3 cup. I did not knead mine much. Just probably  4 times of basically folding them over themselves and patting them out.  I will definitely be making  more of them.

Worked great the first time around. I rolled them thinner than 1" (in order to get more than 2-3), and they were still so fluffy.

I loved these! I've made a lot of homemade biscuits however these are the best by far! I rolled the dough out too thin so I squashed two together before I put them in the oven and they turned out just fine, a lot easier to break in half!

I am 70 years old and have been cooking for over 50 years.  I tried to make biscuits when I was much younger, they were like hockey pucks, I never made them again, until I tried these.  They were wonderful and so easy.  I don't know why anyone would want to change the recipe. They are perfect just the way they are.  I will make them again soon, with dried beef gravy.

Love this recipe.  It's the only one i use now - simple yet effective.  Love the density and the texture.  Question - any way to juice up the flavor.  They are really good, but could use something 'extra'.  Perhaps I'll try butter instead of shortening.

I've used this recipe dozens of times now in fact it's the reason I signed up for an allrecipes account. I've made them rolled/cut and drop style plain and with a number of added ingredients (tonight ham, cheese, leeks and herbs) this is the best biscuit recipe I've ever used.

Fluffy and moist with a golden crust but mine turned out to have an over powering taste of baking powder so I tried another batch and reduced it to 2 teaspoons and they came out great.

These came out great.  I mixed the ingredients just until the flour was absorbed and then simply dropped them on the baking sheet like cookie dough.  No need to roll out if you are having difficulty with overworked hard biscuits.  I also cooked them at 300 degrees or less in my toaster oven because I cut the recipe in half and made 4 perfectly cooked biscuits.

Very good! I used butter instead of shortening and I did not knead the dough at all, just mixed enough to incorporate all ingredients. In my oven they only took about 6-7 minutes to cook but came out light and fluffy.

Great recipe. These made exactly 6 large biscuits. I put on generously floured surface, made a quick rectangle which I folded into the middle from both sides. Do this 3 times only. Make sure it`s 1" thick. Round it into a circle and use about 2-3/4" biscuit cutter. Press straight down. Lift up the biscuit and place on baking sheet touching each other. As you remove the cut biscuit just gently push the extra dough back into the circle. The final remaining dough should be just enough to make that 6th biscuit.
I also used Discobunny's suggestions as followed for more flavor: substitute cultured buttermilk powder (4 TBS Saco brand) + 1 c. water in place of the milk; dropped the baking powder back to 2 tsp; and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Husband said, "Now THAT'S a perfect biscuit!"

Great recipe!  Pre heat a cast iron skillet at 425 while making the biscuits.....bake in the Shirley for 15 min for a crunchy bottom.

Beautiful biscuits. I live at high altitude (5000 ft.) so I am used to making adjustments.  If anyone lives at high altitude the only adjustment needed for this recipe is to substitute bread flour for the AP flour.  Left everything else the same and they came out perfect.  They also freeze well.  I make sausage biscuits ahead of time with these so my hubby can pop one in the microwave before work in the morning.

These biscuits are the BEST... with some minor alterations lol ;) I replace the shortening with COLD butter,the milk with either buttermilk or evaporated milk, and DO NOT KNEAD THE DOUGH. Just lightly pat it into a square shape, and cut out SQUARE biscuits, thus eliminating having to reroll and getting a tough batch. The least amount of handling, the better. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe, JP! It's a family favorite around here, and a frequent flier on our menu :)

OK, Just tried this recipe and it was awesome. I love cooking from scratch and my husband is one of those "but it is so much easier to just buy storebought".......Needless to say, he now loves my biscuits and gravy.... followed the recipe to a T and only had to change the baking time...due to the region and time of year. Awesome!!! Thanks JP!

I've tried substituting butter for the shortening, but they just didn't turn out right.  Stick with butter flavored shortening and these are fantastic.

Great recipe!  Simple to make.  I substitute white sugar with brown sugar and use butter instead of shortening.  Just take it easy on kneading to have a soft biscuit.

SO AMAZING! My husband loves, and i mean LOVES these. Typically he prefers those biscuits in the can and I honestly really don't care for them. He is sooo picky and I've tried several home made biscuit recipes that he has not liked. After making these biscuits he said that he preferred these over those gross can ones which was MUSIC TO MY EARS! I will definitely be making these at least twice a month!

Our family LOVES THIS recipe. We used butter flavored shortening for added flavor. Recently we have been substituting buttermilk for the milk and....WOW!!! We brush melted butter on the tops once they're out of the oven. I have to keep guard so they aren't stolen before the meal! We never knead it and just gently pay it out for extra tender biscuits--I make the dough before I start on the gravy (or whatever you're eating) an let the baking powder work it a magic before I bake them

This is the second time I've made these. Both times I used butter instead of shortening since it's usually what I've got. They're always perfect. But, this time, I didn't have milk. I used what I had, unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I was a little apprehensive about using almond milk, but i wanted biscuits so bad. I will use almond milk now and forever for my biscuits. They turned out a little sweet and very delicious. I'm so excited!

Woah, these are the best! I can't say how many times I have made these. I received the recipe from my sister who found it in the Allrecipes cookbook. My father-in-law says that they are the best he has ever had. Maybe it's just me, but I always have to add like an extra cup of flour when I make them, otherwise they are too doughy to handle at all. Doesn't matter because they still come out fluffy and sky high. My mother-in-law asked how I got they to rise so much. I haven't made any other biscuits since I found this one. I will put up a picture the next time I make them. By the way, they are great as biscuits and gravy.

First biscuits I've ever made and they turned out PERFECT!  I took the advice of others and used butter instead of shortening, and only added probably 3/4 cup of milk.  I didn't change anything else.  Instead of "kneading," I "folded" my dough a few times and patted it down.  Wasn't ready to bake right away, so I put it in the fridge for about an hour or two .  Rolled it out, cut them out, put them on a cookie sheet that I lightly oiled with EVOO, brushed with melted butter and baked at 425 for 13 minutes and they are amazing.  I think they taste great (and I'm a bread/biscuit snob!!)  Thanks for a fabulous recipe... I will be using it over and over again!  :)

I make these biscuits at least once a week.  I do have to say this, I add an additional cup of flour. They were soup after I added the milk but after adding the additional flour they are perfect.  My husband raves about them every time I make them.  Sometimes I use butter flavored Crisco instead of the regular.

This recipe is ok.  Not the way I like them.  The ingredients need to be tweaked a lot for this to be better.  I personally don't wish to.  If you like these then that's fine.  I have been experimenting with biscuit recipes and didn't really like this one and wont make it again.  I like the other one I made a lot better.  I also think using shortening is a mistake.  Cold butter is better.  Not enough baking powder.  A few other things.  Sorry this just didn't meet my expectations.  Not horrible but not good either.  I didn't have problems with these being too hard or anything.  The recipe did come out like biscuits should I just didn't like the taste and some consistency.  If these were too hard or too soft you did something wrong.  15 minutes is too long.

Let me add my Thank You to the chorus of happy JP's Big Daddy Biscuit eaters.  I only tried biscuits one other time with not much success but this time my biscuits tasted good and melted in our mouths, just like biscuits.  I want to say like my Grandma used to make, but perhaps that would be a bit arrogant :).  At any rate, the biscuits took very little time and are tender and very tasty.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and did not knead mine, per se -- folded the dough on itself about 3 or 4 times is all and then patted it out.  I used buttermilk (the 2T vinegar to a cup of milk method).  I will definitely make these again and again.  And thank you very much for sharing your great recipe, J. P.

I made these biscuits this morning and I used alloyd's directions (one of the reviewer's) and they are the best biscuits I have ever eaten. I used buttermilk and omitted the sugar and baked in iron skillet just like she suggested. Melt in your mouth, fluffy and light. Almost like my mother used to make when I was a child.

These really only took me about 15 minutes to make AT MOST. These biscuits are super easy to make and they are super delicious too! I made these the other night and am making them again for breakfast today! I don't know if it is just my flour (used both the end of a bag and the start of a bag) but the dough tastes a bit sour to me, but once it is cooked it does not taste like that. I love how when they rise they separate into two halves so you only need the knife to spread, not separate! I would definitely say to make these. If you are not that experienced in the kitchen, they are super easy and probably impossible to mess up unless of course you were to knead them too long.

I have used this recipe many times. Very forgiving. I used cold butter instead of shortening. I have also used milk or buttermilk, either one works fine. Just pour the liquid a little at a time until the right consistency is reached. Brush the top with milk before baking.

These turned out perfect.  I used butter instead of shortening and brushed the biscuits with melted butter when I put them in the oven and then again a couple of minutes before they were done.  Had to cook longer than 13-15, more like 20 but my oven always takes longer.

I agree- butter instead of shortening, handle the dough as little as possible, pat, don't roll, and leave it pretty thick. One more good hint- use a really sharp cutter, not a cup or anything that will squish your edges together. a small tin can with sharp edges works great. They'll rise better.

I leave out the sugar and add chopped ham and cheese for a breakfast version, or add finely chopped sundried tomatoes and some rosemary or other herb to go with soups.

I have been trying to find a good biscuit recipe for months. This is perfect! I didn't knead it much either and used hard margarine because I never buy shortening. Best homeade biscuits!

So amazingly easy to make - I used all the milk indicated, then added 2 Tbsp of flour because the dough looked a bit soft. Didn't roll the dough out, just shaped it into a somewhat thick slab and used a glass to cut circles. Tasted a little like a scone. I imagine it will be good as a sandwich or as a dinner roll. Thanks for sharing, will make again and again.

These were delicious and you can throw them together and get them baked in less than 30 minutes. As other reviewers said, it is key to use cold butter, or if you use shortening, make sure it's not overly warm and DO NOT OVERMIX!!! I used 1/2 white whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour, mixed all the dry ingredients in my cuisinart, cubed my COLD butter into pieces, tossed it in and pulsed about 4 times til I had the coarse meal (a little bit smaller than peas). Tossed it into a bowl, poured in the milk and gently stirred until it was JUST BARELY MIXED TOGETHER. This is critical for tender, flaky biscuits. I kneaded LESS than 10 times, patted it into a rectangular shape maybe 3 x 6 inches, and used a serrated knife to cut into 9 biscuits. I separated them and baked them spaced apart, but you could easily transfer the dough to a baking sheet, cut them on that, and bake without separating. These rose beautifully and even w/the whole wheat flour, they were tender and moist. The people who are commenting on them being dense and doughy or dry?? Over kneading and/or overmixing.

These were excellent.  I ran out of my standard baking mix and tried this recipe.  Excellent.  I made a second batch and experimented with buttermilk in place of milk and some seasonings added.  It worked!

Ready in 45 mins?  Ha, try 20 mins!  Dinner was more than halfway done when I realized that I wanted to serve some kind of bread with it.  I quickly searched for biscuit recipes and this was the first one I found.  I memorized the ingredients, ran into the kitchen and from bowl to already pre-heated oven to mouth, these biscuits took no more than 20 minutes.  They came out light, fluffy, and simply delicious!

These are really great.  They definitely are fluffy... make sure you don't overbake.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did tweak it a bit.  I subbed buttermilk for milk and butter for shortening and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.  It was so delicious.  Mixed it all up in my cuisinart.  Easy, peasy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Im making these again for the 5th time. The first time I saw this recipe I just laughed at the title! My husband calls himself big daddy and his name is also JP. So I saved it. Guess it was meant to be! Its the only food so far that this family of 7 eats all at once. Usually I have to make a couple of sides with my main course to ensure everyone at least eats something. Jam, honey, butter, jelly even plain. Im serving it with chicken fried steak and gravy. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

First time I make bisquits EVER (never even made them from a BOX!). I'm a novice cooker, but I know how to keep instructions, so that's what I did. And I watched the video. I used a regular glass cup, about two inches in diameter, and that gave me 13 lovely bisquits! They were not huge, but they were PERFECT. My oven is gas, so it's hard to regulate the temp., but the bisquits still came out great. NOTE: I read and applied a tip that helped-- when lifting cookie cutter or cup, be sure to lift it straight UP, instead of sort of twisting it off. The twisting creates like a seal that makes for not-as-fluffy a rise. Also, I used fresh cream, since we have milk straight from the cow. My Ukrainian husband raved about them! Will def. be making again!

Tasty, flaky, everything a biscuit should be...Patted to 1" and cut w/ 3" cutter, got beautifully high results!  
Recipe said it made 6 grand size, so I doubled it...lol, got 20 super size biscuits!  Those 'grand size' must have been huge to get only 6!! Will put some away & hope they reheat well for chicken soup tomorrow...Good as an egg muffin, w/butter only, and  w/apricot jam...great recipe, has become my only recipe now! Thanks!

Simple recipe with tasty results. I do believe these were the best (and easiest) biscuits I have ever made. Lots of options with these. Tomorrow night I am flavoring the shortening with garlic powder and adding shredded cheese. This is my 'go to' biscuit recipe from now on!

Other than substituting butter for the shortening, this recipe was perfect! I was as gentle as could be with the dough and got "mongo" biscuits the first time! As others have mentioned, I did the milk a bit at a time and only used about 3/4 cup to get the dough to pull away. Absolutely wonderful. Thanks, JP!

These biscuits have converted me!  I am normally not a big fan of biscuits, but these are pretty awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly- very easy!  I brushed on an egg wash, popped them in the oven, and 13 minutes later had big, golden, fluffy biscuits!  I can't wait until the morning to slather one with my homemade nectarine pear jam :)

Love this recipe. I've made biscuits just about every weekend with this recipe and they always turn out great. I use butter instead of shortening and almond milk instead of regular dairy milk. Like others have said, do not knead the dough. I simply mix a few times, just until all of the ingredients are combined, then I flaten it out by hand and cut my shapes. Excellent!

These remind me of the scones I used to get at the fair as a kid. Slathered with raspberry jam, these were a real trip down memory lane! I generally don't like cooking with shortening, but I doubt they'd be quite the same with a substitute.

This is a great recipe and one that I will now always use. They are soft and taste wonderful I followed the advice of the first reviewer and did not kneed them much I really just folded a little and patted  the dough together and I used half  butter and half shortening plus I had no whole milk so I used evaporated milk. If you can't make biscuits you can make these, just take your time throw your heart in there and put some love on them biscuits while your doing them they should come out great!

I have been making biscuits for years but this recipe I have found is perfect every time I have made them.  I can even add cheese and garlic and parsley.  I am Southern and these are wonderful to put a slice of fresh tomato from the garden in between with pepper and salt.  My favorite way to eat a biscuit!

These were pretty awesome. My only problem was that I poured in all of the milk at once, which was apparently more than was needed. I managed to salvage about half of the dough, which still tasted amazing. Nest time I'll go more slowly with the milk. And yes, I will definitely be making these again.

This recipe is so good, I dont really see a need for trying another--if anything, it would only be as a change because these are made so frequently! They come out a bit crisp outside, and have a fluffy-chewy interior. With a bit of butter and honey, they are phenomenal!

I'm sure I can't add anything new as far as tips for success, but I'll list what works for me regardless:

1) Bake at 400 degrees vs. the stated temp. I found that to work much better and produced a beautiful golden brown biscuit.
2) Use a light hand throughout the recipe. Don't overmix the shortening into the flour, and knead minimally, just enough to smooth the dough a bit.
4) Add just enough milk to bring the dough together. The dough will be sticky, but the flour added from the kneading and from that sprinkled on your workspace will make it perfect.
3) Dont roll the dough out too thinly, so you can have a nice tall biscuit.

I was so proud of how they looked and tadted after my first attemp that I took pictures of them ;) Give this recipe a chance, I think you'll be happy with it!

I'm still working on my biscuit making skills so I've tried many recipes.  This one didn't turn out the tall biscuit I'd hoped for.  Might have been my technique.  May try it again.

I usually half the amount of salt called for & use only about 3/4C milk, but otherwise make these biscuites exactly as directed. Like Mary Poppins, they're "practically perfect in every way!" :)

Absolutely Devine! I made a few tweaks to pump up the flavor... Switched out the milk for buttermilk, used half butter half margarine, also added 1/2 tbls of baking soda. Don't over mix! Then let dough sit for about 15mins in a bowl under a warm towel. Brushed them with egg and buttermilk wash and done, AMAZING melt in your mouth fluffy delicious biscuits!

These were pretty good! Not very flaky, but need more butter for that. Made them with butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any on hand - no problem. They still tasted great with breakfast (made biscuits n' gravy) and my roommate ate the rest the next day.

I loved cooking these biscuits (I would call them a scone) but the best scone I've ever made. My son loved them the only mistake i made was starting to knead the dough for 20mins instead of for only 20 times still came out really good

Make them with coconut oil instead of shortening and let them rise overnight; they were very good.

These biscuits are great!  I did make a couple changes, instead of shortening I use butter (just a flavor thing for us) and I put the biscuits in the oven cold then turn the oven on to 375.  They come out better than Grands, at least that's what my kids say!

I've made these biscuits in the past and got great reviews from those who ate them!  Each time I had to make minor adjustments to the amount of flour. It's a "get a feel" type instead of just a straight up measurement.

I didn't like these biscuits. They were not fluffy. I thought they would have a little sweet taste because it had sugar.  to my disappointment, they were not.

perfect, read other reviews.I used my food processor as some suggested and they were helpful in understanding the baking process. I usually have canned biscuits with my Chicken Ala King. J.P.'S Big Daddy Biscuits were a hit.

These are so good...if you are having problems make sure your shortening is cold and here is the big one don't overmix handle carefully and as little as possible. I brush with butter after baking.

Wow! I've made my fair share of biscuits and this one is fool proof! Deliciously soft and flakey. I highly recommend this. I just put all the ingredients into my food processor and dumped out onto counter to pat out. Couldn't be easier. I did also brush my biscuits with melted butter. I just made these from start to finish in 25 minutes with cleanup. I turned these biscuits into freezer breakfast sandwiches for the family. Love the time savings. Bon appetite.

I cheated by using self rising four and I had a partial stick of butter flavored crisco so I used that and added shortening to make up the difference. They were very good. They didn't brown much but its probably because i didnt follow directions.

Base of the recipe i use. I dont add the sugar and use butter in place of shortening. I also add to the mix, 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, 1/2 cup cheddar, 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp onion powder, and brush with butter 10 minutes in and sprinkle with parsley. For added flavour, try using garlic butter.

I was lazy and used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose and baking powder.  I added some butter with the shortening and patted and folded a few times instead of kneading. These biscuits were heavenly.  Best recipe for biscuits I have found to date.

I have been "scratch biscuit challenged" until now.  Made these this morning as a surprise for my husband before he left for work.  I used buttermilk instead of reg milk and used a tbsp of butter for some of the shortening.   I didnt knead them at all, just patted them out and cut them.  I made them ahead of time and stuck them in the fridge for a while until I was ready to bake them.  My husband said they were the best biscuits I have ever made.  This will be my goto biscuit recipe from here on out!!!!

My favorite biscuit recipe of all time! I've made this countless times, and consistently get the fluffiest, fattest, moistest biscuits.  The only thing I do differently is use real butter, not shortening (personal preference), and make sure to ONLY use enough milk until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl - usually not the entire amount.  I actually just pour slowly straight from the milk carton until I get the desired texture I'm looking for.  Today, I made homemade butter (also from this site) and whipped up these biscuits to smear the butter on.  I couldn't think of a better counterpart and my eyes literally rolled into the back of my head at first bite. Thank you J.P. for such an amazing recipe. It will always be my go to for the most amazing biscuits!

I made these last night.  They were easy and tasted fantastic.  This was a first for me so next time I will add cheese and ham...play around with it.  I did have to knead mine or the dough wouldn't have been cohesive.  I used margarine insteadof shortening.  Will make over and over, thanks.

This recipe is tasty. I've used it twice as a dumpling recipe, and it is perfect. I've doubled the batch and covered enough of the chicken/turkey mixture to fill a "turkey pan". I did make 1 or 2 minor changes: in place of shortening I used unsalted butter (the first time) and margarine spread (the second time) in equal portions, both came out great. I would definitely advise melting your butter/margarine before adding it, otherwise it ends up a bit clumpy. Second note I'd like to make: Not every batch used the same amount of milk. My first batch I made at two separate times, then later combined them. First batch I used the full cup, second I had 1/2 a cup left over. The second time I made it all it once, and used a total of about 1 3/4 cups. Best advice I can give is to just to add small amounts at a time until you get the right texture. Overall I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is easy to make, and comes out great.

First of all I need to say that I have no idea what a "real american biscuit" is supposed to taste like since I'm French.
Second I tried to follow the recipe with what I had on hand (salted butter so no added salt), and the quantities were approximative at best.

I was first appealed by the picture, all in all it took me less than 30minutes to put together, baking time included! 45 minutes eating time included (and that's because I insisted on letting one cool down to see what it tasted like)
I cut it in 4 parts (but since I'm not sure that the size of the cup I used is actually the equivalent of an american cup, that might as well be the reason), they rose beautifully and the taste was perfect for a versatile biscuit that you can eat with absolutely anything you have in your kitchen.

At first my boyfriend was disappointed when I told him it was plain (from the looks of that big bun in the oven he thought it was stuffed), but then he was even more disappointed because there was only four.

Next time I'll add cheese, mashed olives, ham, or whatever I have on hand to the batter for what will probably be THE perfect snack.

All in all, it's good as is, super easy and quick, versatile... I love it! Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe a few times exactly as written with mediocre results each time.  Today, I made some alterations.  I, too, used butter instead of shortening per other reviewers suggestion.  I used buttermilk and needed more than what was called for.  Forgot to add the sugar - wasn't needed anyway.  I didn't roll them out, simply pinched off a portion and gently rolled it around in my palms to form a ball.  Once they were all on the baking sheet, I gently patted them down so they wouldn't be so round.  All in all, they reminded me of the biscuits my (Georgia) Mom made when I was a kid.  Yum!

In the south we know biscuits! And these are wonderful! I use butter or stick margarine if I'm out of shortening. Works great! Don't over mix and use only what you need of the milk. Also make sure your oven is hot and your shortening is ice cold. When done, cover in melted butter. Biscuit heaven!

These came out great.  After cutting the dough I let them sit under a dish towel in a warm kitchen for a couple of hours.  Didn't have any problems with them rising.
They weren't flaky but were delicious.

I've made these as is, used buttermilk instead of regular milk, used butter flavor shortening and made more substitutions than you can believe; I've never had a bad biscuit! The one thing I do regularly is double the baking powder for a lighter fluffier biscuit.

Excellent recipe.  I suggest using butter instead of shortening and I only ever use about 1/2 cup of the milk.  You only need enough milk to hold it together as a dough.

Just made these for breakfast to go with "dip" (over medium) eggs since we didn't have any bread in the house.  The only change I made was to sub butter for the shortening since I try to stay away from trans fat.  I cut them with a juice glass and ended up with 12 medium sized biscuits.  One tip that I have is not to knead the dough as the recipe indicates.  Biscuit dough will become tough if you handle it too much.  After you incorporate the milk put the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat it into a circle to your desired thickness and cut out the biscuits.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that I thought they were too sweet.    Next time I would reduce the sugar by at least half.

Not as flaky as I would've liked but that was probably because my shortening wasn't chilled.  They were super quick and my kids liked them.  I will probably be making these again.  Thanks

Just made these an hour ago, and the hubby loves them. I like them a lot, but not my favorite. Nice and fluffy but, I'm still on the search for a better biscuit for me. Will continue to make these until I find it.

Used these biscuits with one one substitution, butter for shortening, with Sweetened Whipped Cream (this site) to make homemade strawberry shortcake. So fast, so good! Thanks J.P., you're the new big daddy of biscuits in this house!

I was very happy with this recipe, as were my 2 kids. I used soy milk and soy based margarine because that's what I had on hand. They turned out great, so good in fact that I had to make a second batch right away, they are currently in the fridge waiting to be baked with dinner. Thank you so much for an easy and tasty recipe!

This receipe was supper easy to follow and the biscuits were amazing. I let the dough set for about an hour and they were so tall and fluffy. I have tried several other receipes and they were nothing like this one. It has gone into my favorites cookbook. They were great with sausage gravy and jelly.

As of my first go of these biscuits I was not impressed. The dough turned out way too sticky even after I only put in 3/4 c of flour and they didn't rise much at all. I will try this recipe again with my own tweaks, but then it won't really be this recipe anymore. My husband liked them because they were flat and a little crunchy so great with the sausage gravy I made. Which is why I gave them 3 stars.

WOW, outstanding.  Haven't made biscuits in years.  Just made these and had one with butter.  Going to have them in the morning for breakfast with sausage gravy.  Used butter flavored shortning and low fat milk.  Very easy, used my kitchen aid mixer.  At least 20 stars.

This was my first try at homemade biscuits, and they turned out great! Even my picky 3 year old ate one and was asking for more. We ate them with butter and honey with dinner. Very good! I would only like to have seen something on the top to make them a little less dry on top. But I will definitely make them again!

Very good!  My husband is southern bred and said they tasted fine - and they turned out much better than the store-bought ones did.  The only problem was that I ended up adding another cup of flour through the entire process, but that could have been avoided by using a dash less milk.  Quick, easy, and of course huge!

I tweaked the recipe, used butter instead, and did 'pull-apart' biscuits by using an icecream scoop to drop scoops of batter onto a pan. I couldn't stop eating these fresh from the oven. They are light, fluffy and so good on their own that you don't need butter, honey or jam! Easy recipe that I'll be making again and again.

Delicious! My husband is a big biscuits and gravy fan, and I've made these a few times with great results! They are super light and fluffy....crisp on the outside, and soft in the inside. I didn't use the big biscuit cutter, but I'm always tempted! One time I used buttermilk in place of regular milk and that was excellent as well!

AWESOME! After only one bite my husband said these were the best biscuits ever! I though so too. Nice crust, fluffy interior and lightly golden brown (I brushed with melted butter at 10 minutes). The only adjustment i'd make for next time (and there WILL be a next time!) Is buttermilk, that would be perfect!!

These were good biscuits - although the flavor was not huge. I did use butter as suggested by another reviewer, and although they turned out nicely....there could have been more flavour for sure.

Best biscuit recipe of all time. Seriously light and fluffy. Buttermilk tastes great or add vinegar or lemon juice to the milk called for. You won't be disappointed.

Half WW flour & half AP flour. Butter (1/4 cup) & margarine (generous tablespoon) instead of shortening. Soy milk in place of the regular. I rolled these thinner as I forgot these were supposed to only make six "grand" size biscuits so of course they didn't rise as they should've (perhaps my baking powder may be a little old) but they were nevertheless tasty. I added a tablespoon of whole caraway seeds to the batter, so it would pair well with "Cottage Noodles and Cabbage" from AR.

I have never made biscuits before. Never even attempted it! I have never made bread of any sort from scratch. That being said, this turned out perfect! Which reflects nicely on the recipe, not the cook ;) I used butter instead of shortening since that is what I had. I will not be buying canned biscuits anymore!

Your recipe is dead on for good ole homemade biscuit! The extra baking powder is perfect for a beautifully sky high rise!  The only change I made was using buttermilk instead of regular milk (have buttermilk that I'm trying to use up). Can't beat em!

Recently I moved to Australia from the US. Upon hearing one of my friends say "I always wondered what a biscuit was, but then I found out they are just an english muffin" I knew I had to make some biscuits to set her straight. This was my first time making a biscuit from scratch and I found it very easy. I left the batter in the fridge overnight. Mine aren't "mongo" but they are fluffy and delicious. Will definitely be making this again and again.

These are incredible! I have been searching for the perfect biscuit to complement sausage gravy, and this it it. It's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Perfection! I only knead it a couple times until the dough holds together. Then I pat it out into a circle, fold it in half, turn the dough, and repeat several times. This builds nice flaky layers into the dough.

Awesome.  I've made exactly as recipe states, and also tried w/ buttermilk and half butter/half shortening.  YUM!  These are my "go to" recipe for biscuits now.  Perfect texture, not too dry, great flavor.

Wonderful fluffy biscuits. Thses came out great for me (and sometimes I struggle in the biscuit making department).
Based on other reviewers advice...I added a tsp. of cider vinegar to the milk to "sour" it (like butermilk). Also instead of rolling and cutting - I used  a large ice cream scoop and dropped them onto the pan. Makes 8 big biscuits.

These were so good.  I modified the recipe some-used butter instead of shortening and didn't end up needing all the milk (butter has more moisture in it than shortening).  I used this as a topping for a pot pie (wonderful) and the leftovers I cooked as just dropped biscuits and it worked out fine.  I cooked the pot pies (individual ones) for 15 min at 375 F and the biscuit topping was cooked perfectly (my filling was already cooked separately).

I use this recipe frequently and it always turns out great! I don't roll out the dough I just grab small handfuls and put it on the pan. They don't look as pretty but they still taste great and are quicker that way.

These are PHENOMENAL biscuits.  I can literally have them on the table in 20 minutes, start to finish.  The only change I make is to use fresh buttermilk, but it isn't a necessary change -- just a really GOOD one. :)  I toss the dry ingredients, cut in a non-hydrogenated palm shortening, then toss the mixture with a fork as I add the buttermilk.  I stop with the milk while it is still pretty crumbly, but moist, dump it all out onto the counter top, then press it together just until all the little stray crumbles have come mostly together.  Dust it with flour, roll it out to about 3/4 inch thick.  I don't bother with a biscuit cutter, but cut it roughly with a large knife into 9-12 (2 inch) squares.  Usually I brush the tops with cream before baking.  These are SO insanely easy, and really, REALLY good.  They literally flake into the same beautiful layers you'd get at KFC...I know, not high class food, but honestly...who doesn't like KFC biscuits?

This recipe was ok.  I didn't really like the sweetness of the biscuits.  I've made other biscuits without sugar, and I think I prefer a more savory biscuit.  So, if you prefer a sweeter biscuit, then these are probably perfect for you!

My first biscuits turned out very moist, and flaky.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again!  Very delicious :)

This is the best recipe for biscuit I have ever made!!! I did use butter instead of shortening. and use less milk.  I mix it in my processor and added crumbs of mild cheddar cheese. My family loves these biscuits!

This is our new favorite biscuit recipe.  I add a bit more sugar because our family likes it a little sweeter.  Great recipe to use for biscuits and gravy!

I tried these biscuits in a hurry with all my children and grandchildren in.  I never make biscuits, although I make rolls all the time.  They turned out great - crusty on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Thanks!

This is the absolute best yet. I've tried for years to find a really good recipe and this is it. I didn't use all the milk, actually probably only 3/4 c. so I'd recommend starting out with less and then adding as needed. I used butter/Crisco mix. A definite keeper.

Just finished taking out these beautiful fluffy biscuits from the oven on Christmas morning. This is our first try at making bisquits, we will never buy store bought again. We only needed 3/4 cup of milk and we did use cold butter instead of shortening. Yum.

These raised really well, and were easy to work with! I foolishly followed other reviews though and added extra salt to the dough, as they had said they were bland. They were too salty and kinda ruined the whole experience! Should have followed it as written. Will definitly make them again though! Good solid recipe

I made these to go with sausage gravy and this recipe is GREAT!  Best homemade biscuits I have ever made.  Only thing I did wrong was I accidentally rolled the dough 1/2" instead of 1".  Came out great anyway - just reduced the baking time.  Will roll to 1" next time - can't wait!

I've made these several times already. I think they are my favorite biscuit. This makes 4 biscuits for me (I make them BIG). I usually double the recipe and get 8 HUGE biscuits. Thanks for the recipe... i love it!

Delicious!  I didn't want to take the time to roll the biscuits so I just rolled them into a ball in my hand and then squished them down.  They were super easy and super yummy!

These were absolutely fantastic! I added some fresh chives to the dry mix before adding the milk and they were so tasty! I also used a food processor and added the milk very slowly from the top and had a smidgen left in the measuring cup.  This is definitely our go to recipe for biscuits!

This is a great biscuit recipe. The best i've ever tried. I used butter instead of shortning becuase that is all I had on hand and increased the baking powder about a 1/2 T. SOOOO GOOOD!!!

Very good! It was pouring rain here today, so it only took 3/4 cup milk. I let the dough rest in the fridge for about 2 hours. Then I rolled it out to about 1 inch thick and cut into 8 triangles (like scones). That is much easier than making it into circles and the less you handle the dough the better.

I really like this recipe. It is my main biscuit recipe I use now. The biscuits are pretty quick to make and rise up nicely. But, do not over work the dough, as with any biscuit recipe to keep the biscuits soft. I just made some this weekend. And, also remember to check the expiration date on your baking powder if you do not use it that much. The fresher the more these biscuits will rise up nice and soft. I like to eat mine with butter, jelly, or honey butter. Yum!

I've made these twice now, following the recipe exactly both times.  The first time, I ended up  making smaller biscuits because when I rolled the dough out to 1" thick, it only made 6 small ones.  I ended up putting them on a cookie sheet and covering them with a towel, and I didn't get to bake them for two days, but my family said they were the best biscuits I have ever made (and I've made a lot of biscuits!)  The second time I made them, I doubled the recipe and put them in the oven right away.  They tasted the same - amazing!  This is a five star keeper for its simplicity and because you can make them ahead of time and they still turn out great.

Coming from the south, I am always on the hunt for the perfect biscuit recipe. And after making this one over 10 times...I can guarantee that it is at least perfect for me. It is light and fluffy. One thing I did differently, was I cut mine with a very sharp knife into squares instead of with a round cutter. I found that they rose up much higher that way.

Very good, basic recipe. Followed the directions for the dough, only adding as much milk as needed, and ended up not needing all the milk. I rolled them a little thinner then directed, folding the dough over a few times and rolling out again instead of kneading, and to make layers, and made smaller biscuits (about 1&1/2 inches across) out of it, baked them about 10 min. at 410 instead of 425 degrees. Used them with a sausage gravy and the only reason there's one biscuit left over is everyone is too full to eat it!

I was looking for a good, quick substitute to delicious, but time-consuming Hungarian yeast biscuits. After reading the reviews I knew these would turn out good, but didn't expect the amazing end result I got.  I didn't add sugar as I don't like the sweetness in savory biscuits. I used goose fat leftover from a roast instead of shortening, which gave the dough a rich flavour (typical Hungarian substitution). Also, I love the taste of whole wheat flour, so added some instead of white (a third). I'm glad I added the milk gradually cause I only needed a bit more than 2/3 cup. I didn't do as much kneading as originally written, even so the dough quickly formed into a smooth ball. This recipe is a definate keeper - really versatile and easy to make! Can't wait to try it with different herbs, cheese or butter instead of fat. Thanks for this super basic recipe!

Great biscuit and so easy! I soured my milk before using it (1 Tbsp. vinegar added to 1 c. milk, let sit for 5 minutes before using). This made 9 biscuits for me. My hubby said they needed more salt. I try and not use it where I can get away with it because it's not good for you. I would recommend NOT kneading the dough hardly at all. That way they're nice and light textured. Keeping this recipe!! Thanks Mr. Pickett!

very easy, light and fluffy.  I used only about 3/4 cup of milk.  I made mine with butter too, instead of shortening.

My kids inhaled these biscuits.  Truly fluffy (which we love) and not dense like the traditional Southern biscuits we eat.  I used butter instead of shortening (an ingredient I don't use) and didn't have any problems.  I also followed the recommendation of other reviewers and used my food processor, which made it easy.  I will make these again, but I will add a little more salt and maybe even an extra tbp of sugar.  My husband and I thought they needed more flavor which is why I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5.

I really enjoyed these!!! Moist and delicious!  I needed to use up some whipping cream, so I used about 1/4 c then added 3/4 c milk.  I did not knead these, just sort of brought the dough together, patted it into a very thick circle then cut the biscuits out.  I did put a couple small pieces of butter on top...oh and I used butter insted of shortening.  Very very good!

These are phenomenal!  They came out crunchy outside, fluffy and light inside.  YUM!  Definitely a keeper, especially as they doubled in size (or better!) in the oven.

Use Cold Butter Instead Of Shortening. Use Buttermilk. Do Not Knead. Mix Only Until It Sticks Together. (1 1/2" Thick). Place Biscuits Close Together. Brush With Melted Butter Before And After Baking.

Awesome flavor, shape and lift... my only problem was that they were a little tough. I'm not sure if it was me over-mixing it, or my weird electric oven or the fact that my honey opened the oven door about 40 times "Are they done yet??". I will definitely make these again and try to mix less. I got 5 good sized perfect biscuits and 1 slightly "special" shaped one from the remaining dough. They're all gone and there's only two of us here, so that's high praise indeed!

This pretty well my recipe - BUT - NO WAY should these be kneaded so much! Just tuen the dough onto lightly floured surface, pat into cohesive round & press out to size needed, then cut with sharp cutter. Incidentally, for a better rise, after cutting, turn reach round over & place on baking sheet. Den7

OK I tried these a couple of weeks ago and got hockey pucks.  Followed the recipe, used butter and thought I was gonna chip a tooth on these petrified Big Daddy's...whoa!  Then I tried them again with fresh baking powder (I thought maybe mine was dead) and boy did they work that time!!  Whooooeeeeee.  So make sure your baking powder is fresh.   BTW I rolled mine out about 1/2 to 3/4" and next time will do the 'Full Monti" and go with an inch thick.  They rose perfectly but that extra little bit will put them over the top.  Thanks John, your old Motor pal, Vinny.

I found this recipe in the Allrecipes Cook Book!  And let me tell you, it is the BEST! I have been baking for years, and I haven't found a better biscuit recipe! I brush the top of mine before baking with a VERY SMALL amount of ice cold water. It makes them flaky. MMMMM!

I woke up this morning craving my grandmother's biscuits. I didn't feel like running to the store, so I came to AR to find a quick and easy recipe. These biscuits are easy and delicious. They remind me of the biscuits my grandma would make when I lived in Georgia with her. This is the first time I've ever made biscuits from scratch, so I was nervous, but I followed the directions and they came out beautifully. I will make another batch to freeze, so on cool fall mornings I can pop one or two into the oven for a great morning treat! Cheers!!!

This is the best biscut recipe, I have made it at least 6 times. The only thing I changed was to add a 1/2 tsp more of baking powder. You must have your Crisco cold before using.

I served this as a side, and I could've sworn that if I hadn't told my family there was more food to come, they would've eaten this as an entree. They even said it was "way better than KFC," which made me laugh-- they love KFC biscuits.

Fluffy, easy, delicious. Two things to note: keep your butter cold, and only add as much milk as you need to bring your dough together. I added almost the entire cup and my dough ended up a little too moist. I got it back to a workable moisture level but it would have been easier if I had just added the milk more slowly from the beginning. Also, I had a little bit of dough left over so I made a mini batch of monkey bread. It was FANTASTIC with this recipe! I'm going to make this again tomorrow and perhaps add a splash of vanilla to the dough for a new batch of monkey bread. Yum!

These were quick and easy. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and only enough to make the dough hold together—it only took about 3/4 cup. I'd assume that the people whose biscuits were too dense just didn't need to use as much milk. Also, I'm a bit lazy, so I kneaded the dough right in the bowl, and just placed globs of it on the cookie sheet rather than roll it out. The biscuits turned out great (although they'd have been prettier if I'd rolled them out). Instead of refrigerating the dough, you can freeze it once you've formed the biscuits; just pop the frozen biscuit dough in the oven, and add about 5 minutes to the baking time.

These biscuits are awesome. I did them in my stand mixer and used butter instead of shortening.

Light and fluffy.  Good with jam.  Would probably be good for shortcake with a little more sugar.

These biscuits came out fantastic!  The only change I made was I used butter instead of shortening.  These were the lightest, tallest biscuits that I've ever made! Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these were really good!  Next time I will let them sit longer so they get even bigger.  We had this with our dinner just as a plain biscuit.  Next time im going to make bacon, egg and cheese biscuits w/these for breakfast.

I've tried an endless number of biscuit recipes and this is now my Official recipe for biscuits. The original recipe is perfect as-is but I've made some variations (substituted 1 C. AP flour for 1 C. white whole wheat flour or added grated cheese and/or herbs) with great results too. Also, you can make this in a FOOD PROCESSOR: Put all dry ingredients in processor and pulse a few times. Then add small, cut-up chunks of the shortening (sometimes I use cold butter) and pulse until coarse. Add milk a little at a time (you might not need all of it) until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and turns into a ball . Flatten dough with your hands (I skip the rolling pin) and proceed as directed. From start to eat, less than 1/2 hour! Thanks for the recipe!

A definite keeper!  I used butter instead of shortening because you can't go wrong with butter.  Husband and son love the big, fluffy biscuits. Make sure you have honey ready to enjoy a special treat with supper.

These biscuits remind me of the ones my dad use to make. I have been looking for a recipe that I could use for gravy and the biscuits would not get soggy. This is it!! I just cut back on the amt. of milk called for and they turn out alot firmer. For dinner I just make them as called for in the recipe.  Thanks

Very good and very easy! I made mini biscuits using a champagne glass to cut and served them as appetizers with apple butter. The only change I made was using half butter and half shortening.

I have made these a few times now and they always turn out great. This last time I made a bunch, baked them let them cool and made sausage for little breakfast sandwichs to freeze so my family could reheat something fast my husband had some this morning and said they were really good. so they freeze well too.

These biscuits are amazing!  I only kneaded a few times and patted the dough out, as other reviewers noted. I also used cold butter to replace the shortening because it's all I had on hand -  HUGE, light and fluffy biscuits!  I have a recipe for biscuits that I have used for years, but this one beats it hands down!  Thanks John!

I give this recipe 5 stars based only on taste for now, due to my lack of biscuit making experience (I'm sure) the texture wasn't what I hoped to achieve. I tried my best not to over-handle the dough, but perhaps I did, because they turned out pretty flat and dense, not light and fluffy like most of the others here.  They still taste wonderful and will not go to waste, but I look forward to trying this recipe again and hopefully perfecting it!

Update: I have tried this recipe again, this time with wonderful results, I did 3 things differently than I did the 1st time. 1) I used a large fork instead of my hands to work the butter in (I used butter both times), 2) I allowed the biscuits to rest in the fridge for 3 hours before baking, and 3) I set the oven a bit hotter, to 450, because they didn't seem quite done in the centers the first time.

My biscuits came out tall, light and fluffy this time, just as I was hoping, I'm so happy!

Mmmm...these are great!  I served them with vegetarian biscuits and gravy!  Update 5/14/17:  made these for strawberry shortcakes.  Added 3 tablespoons sugar and reduced the salt slightly.  Subbed salted vegan butter for the shortening.  Great!  I always make these as a drop biscuit instead of kneading and rolling.  I think the amount of liquid would have to be decreased for a cut biscuit.  They come out like big, tender clouds.  :)  Sometimes have to cook these longer than recommended to get to brown (could be because I'm using all vegan ingredients).

used a little less water, rolled up jellyroll style, wrapped in saran wrap, refrigerated overnight and cut off 6 equal portions. let stand on baking sheet for 20 mins or so and baked them on the top rack. i also tried freezing them but didnt get the same results they did not get nearly as big, but i could have done something wrong. will definitely make these again. 1st time had them w/ chicken a la king and 2nd time had them w/ homemade biscuits and gravy.

This is the biscuit we now use to make our sausage biscuit breakfast sandwiches.  I make up HUGE quantities of these and put them in the freezer for anytime someone wants to throw one in the microwave for breakfast or a snack.  They're perfect.  And don't get me started on how wonderful they are with some sausage gravy.

Yummy, just slightly better than my mom's recipe (must be the sugar). But 1 cup of milk is too much, so good thing I added it gradually as the recipe says. I would say 2/3 cup is more like it.

I ENJOYED THESE A LOT. Now this is a scone I grew up eating every Saturday & Sunday mornings with Tea and milk. The best breakfasts were made by they Mother.

I know it called a Biscuit in the United States. Whatever name you call it, it was great.

This recipe has been filed safely and one day my children will enjoy these as I did when I was young............................................I used 6 tablespoons UNSALTED cold Butter. I added a few drops of PURE Vanilla extract to the COLD milk.

Beautiful recipe!  I love the slightly sweet taste of the biscuits.  It goes great with sausage gravy, making biscuit sandwiches, or just spreading jam on them!

The only issue I had was that the dough was way too soft at first, but then I realized, it was my fault :D  I shouldn't've dumped the entire cup of milk in at once.  Next time, I'll add the milk in little by little.

I've never made homemade biscuits before and these were easy to put together on short notice.  They tasted great - the whole family liked them.  I did use butter instead of shortening because that is what I had.

Really great recipie, I dont know why anyone would waste their money buying biscuits ...They are so easy to make and delish!  
I used my stand mixer with the whisker attachment to cut in chunked butter (I used butter instead of shortening because I dont keep shortening around--I think the butter flavor is more tastey anyway).  Using the mixer works wonderfully, cutting in butter by hand is pretty annyoing.
I also roll these out thinner than the recipie calls (1/2 inch)--but I find them to be the perfect size.

I make these all the time.  Usually I use just a little less milk.  I've even made up super large batches and stored like bisquit mix!  When I need some I just take out a cup or two or whatever I need and add milk to the right consistency.  Love these!

This recipe got rave reviews from my family (made them for breakfast this morning). Easy to do, quick, and the results...moist, light, high-rise biscuits! I used butter (cold) rather than shortening and didn't overknead. I also prefer to bake my biscuits close together on the pan. Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

In fact, they turned out like cookies. Perhaps it was in the way I made them, but I kept everything as close to the recipe as possible & these things tasted bad.

Holy moly, these are wonderful!  I even thought I worked the dough too much, but they came out perfect...a little crispy golden on the ouside and fluffy soft on the inside.  I am not going to tell anyone I ate 2 1/2 of them tonight!.  I used butter flavor shortening and all they needed was a little jelly, honey, or to slop up some gravy!

I wasn't wowed by these but my hubby was impressed that they didn't come out of a can. I made these to use for breakfast sandwiches and they worked perfectly.  They tasted really good and I have no complaints.

Great basic biscuit recipe.  Couldn't be any simpler and worked well preparing the batter the night before baking.

I've made these biscuits several times & my family just LOVES them.  My daughter is a huge biscuit fan & I used this recipe to make breakfast sandwiches when she was home over the Thanksgiving weekend - another big hit. One time, I made the mistake of just pouring in the milk at once, I just sifted in a little bit more flour until the mixture was the right consistency.  They were still delicious and rose up nice and high.  I've let the dough sit in the refrigerator & I've mixed, rolled and cut them out right away - they were perfect either way.  Thanks, JP

Very yummy!  I used margarine and they turned out flaky, soft, and with a lovely buttery taste! They were great either topped with jam or with a pot roast.  Will make again!

These are great biscuits!  I have made them a number of ways now.  Everytime I used butter rather than shortening, and soymilk rather than milk (lactose intolerance).  I also make sure I don't mix to much before the kneading part--just enough to hold it all together (rather like making pie dough).  I started making them before I had a biscuit cutter using a juice glass.  They had a decent rise (I was pleased) and they tasted great.  After awhile I had made them enough that I didn't read the directions when I would make them.  Turns out I should have because I left off the kneading part.  The biscuits definitely rose less this way (still using the juice glass to cut them out).  I did this two or three times before I figured out what I was doing wrong (duh).  I was curious whether a biscuit cutter would make even more of a difference--they are so inexpensive I bought some.  Awesome rise now and still soft with great flavor!!  My advice--knead and use biscuit cutters...and always read the directions ;)

Very good biscuits. I made a double batch, ande it gave me about 30 biscuits(using a small cookie cutter). I used room temp.butter instead of shortening. I also flattened them thinner, and they still puffed up perfectly! Very tasty as well. Many pple said they were even better than Popeye's biscuits!!Update: For more flavor, I have made using a good sprinkle of pamesan cheese, and they were the ultimate!!...and oh...very important to note that you really have to mix the batter until it just comes together. Barely knead, otherwise they don't rise as much(I learned the hard way!)Thanks for the great recipe!

I did take advice and refridgerate the dough for a few hours and they were perfect, I think next time I may add some shredded cheese when I roll them out and perhaps add some garlic powder to the flour to kick it up a notch!

The biscuits did come out with a nice texture and they were pretty giant! The biscuits did taste a bit too "doughy". I guess it's due to the fact that I used Skim Milk - this is like adding water but that was the only milk I had on hand. I think using buttermilk and butter would help these biscuits taste less dry and have more moisture. 

The biscuits came out giant as promised from the author of the recipe. I was full after eating only one and a half and I usually can eat a lot more. Serving the biscuits with gravy is a plus as well. I used the recipe "Momma's Country Gravy" from this site with the biscuits

Love this recipe! I did tweak it a bit by adding more sugar for a sweeter tasting biscuit, but a good recipe just as it is. My dad now uses this recipe and tell everyone it's my recipe.

Although these were nearly the best biscuits I've yet to make, I found that although I stuck to the recipe in ints entirety (...well almost- I accidentally went on kneading the dough for apprx. 15 mins., overlooking the fact that the recipe said 15-20 "times"), I thought that the recipe lacked in taste, texture and depth-they were kinda short and not so BIG. They weren't bad, though....I can see the possibilities of perfection with a few additions/alterations!

I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  These biscuits are completely average.  I did experiment with cutting these, and the trick to a high rise is a sharp cutter, cutting straight down and back up.  They seemed a bit dry and not much flavor.

Yummy.  Instead of rolling out and/or cutting, I just dropped them on a cookie sheet with a spoon like drop cookies.  I formed them slightly with the spoon so that they were about 1 inch high and 2-3 inches across.  Made about 12.  They may be more dense that way but they were perfect for biscuits and gravy as well as jam.  Family loved them.

OMG, these are the lightest, fluffiest, easiest biscuits I have ever made!! I've tried so many recipes, and FINALLY found the one that is my keeper.
Thanks so much J.P. *Big Daddy*:) The only thing I did was brush them w/ butter at the beginning of cook time and in the middle of cook time-delicious!!

These biscuits are very good!  I love how they puff up.  You must take them out when they just start to brown on the edges, or they will be too dry.  I will make these again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time ever making my own biscuits. I had to substitute the shortening with one stick of unsalted butter.  These biscuits came out pretty darn good and were a hit with my husband and 3 year old daughter. No more Pillsbury refrigerated biscuits for us!

Soft and delicious! And took all of 5 minutes prep time.  Mine didn't rise much though - next time I'll let them sit for a bit before popping them in the oven.

these were pretty good.  The 1st time I made these, I tried using 3/4 cup milk as suggested and my husband and I thought they were a little dry.  The second time I tried using 1 cup milk and they were so gooey I couldn't get the dough off my fingers let alone try to roll them out.  (definately if you make these use 3/4 cup milk) These do get very large when you bake them.  I will be looking for another recipe though

Living in Holland I have to make a lot of things from scratch - mixes are either expensive or not available.  What a blessing in disguise because these were great!  My dutchie loved the scones, as he calls them, and was impressed to no end.  I was also a bit worried because the dough was wetter than I thought it should be...but it was fine in the end.  I used butter (naughty, I know) because shortening is quite pricy here.    I will make this again and again.

I used butter instead of shortening...Okay, y'all, I thought I had royally messed these up.  I used the entire cup of milk and it made the dough super gooey, so I had to keep sprinkling flour on it to get it to stiffen up.  I was afraid that it made me "over handle" the dough.  I don't have a rolling pin, so I just patted fairly evenly with my hands.  I had to do it twice and had one bicuit that I pieced together.  UNBELIEVABLE! That last, sad little bicuit is the one that I had fresh out of the oven with a puddle of butter and jelly and it was STILL fluffy and perfect!

These were very easy and quick to make and oh so yummy!  My husband and kids got very excited over these.  It also makes the perfect amount for our family, versus other recipes that I have to scale back so I don't end up with 10 leftover biscuits!  I've made these twice, served once for breakfast with sausage gravy (made 24 hours in advanced, stored in refrigerator and baked in the RV while campling - so nice to just take out the dough and cook it - Yeah! No mess!) and then again a second time as a side to dinner.  I was wary of handling too much do to other reviews but found that I didn't handle them enough.  The ones that ended up rising the best were the last two biscuits that were made out of each batch - the ones that had been smushed together and then flattened out a few times.  So next time I will knead the dough per the recipe and see if they all will rise as beautifully as those last two.  Fantastic recipe!

I followed the recipe almost exactly and these were very floury and dense. Might try again with minimal handling, but I only kneaded say 10xs -oh well, still have some Bisquick as the old stand by. Even tried a second time, no big whoop.
Revision: OK, so my husband made these the other day and they turned out great! Fluffy, tasty and quick. Maybe it is just me! :)

I have been using this recipe for years.  I have tried other biscuits, but I just keep coming back to this one again and again.  J.P.'s recipe is fantastic!  I usually use buttermilk, instead of regular milk.  If I'm using them with fruit I add a 1/4 cup sugar.  I agree with others that the less you handle these, the better.

I dont know whats wrong with people that change a recipe then complain that it didnt work!  Dont you know that when you change milk to buttermilk...it changes the amount the biscuits will rise?  When I make pancakes , I add a bit of water to the buttermilk.  It makes them fluffier, they rise beautifully !  One cook named Azuledive admitted that it might be her mistake...amen! Give credit to where credit is due..the only change you can make is half butter /half shortening...nothing else except spices...Thank you J.P.  I appreciate your sharing with us..

These biscuits were good.  My dough was a little hard to manage so instead of cutting the dough with a cutter or a floured cup, I did the spoon drop method which actually worked out perfectly for me.

Great recipe! I've been trying to duplicate the soft buttermilk biscuits served at Cracker Barrel, and these are as close as I've gotten. Very soft and flavorful, just perfect. I made 12 instead of six and they still turned out big and fluffy.

I'm not a big biscuit fan but these were really really good. I made some for dinner around lunchtime and had to make more because the family devoured them rather quickly. I used only 3/4 tablespoon of baking powder since everyone mentioned how they had a bitter taste. I also skipped the kneading and cutting and just plopped the dough onto the baking sheet. (the less you handle the dough the more tender they are) I've even made them with cheese and garlic.

These were lovely.  I kept exactly to the recipe and only kneaded 18 times. They rose beautifully.  Now - I live in England - and we call these savoury scones where I come from (I didn't realise until we were eating them!)  To make an English cream tea you make this recipe adding 1 heaped tablespoon of sugar to the recipe. Then serve then split in half across the way (making two discs) and topping each half with raspberry or strawberry jelly and then whipped up heavy cream - together with a hot cup of English tea of course.  We also eat savoury scones adding any combination of cheese, bacon, fried onion or grain mustard to this recipe.  Thanks for reminding me of all this John - I'm off to make some sweet and cheese scones!

These biscuits sure tasted great--reminds me of KFC biscuits, only better!  However for some reason the top of my biscuits didn't brown.  I wonder what happened.

Absolutely the best consistency I have ever tasted in a biscuit.  Simple and easy to make, and they taste great, too.  I see what the others mean about a little bitterness, but as long as you put anything on them (even a little butter) that taste goes away.  I would scale back a little on the baking soda, and I might even TRY that next time, but I am too afraid of killing the texture, it's so perfect!

These made the best cinnamon rolls I have had in a long time.  Definitely better than anything I have made before.  I couldn't find my old recipe for cinnamon biscuits so I had to find a new one.  I just had make the dough as the recipe calls, roll it out, then spread dough with softened butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  I jellyrolled the dough and sliced.  Made 12 mega biscuits!
I am making the reqular biscuits for Thanksgiving.

What an awesome Awesome recipe!  These biscuits turned out so yummy and Big!  My kids LOVE it!  I used margarine instead of shortening because I just didn't have any around, I loved the taste of them with just butter on it. So Good!!  This is going in my favorite recipe box for sure. Thanks JP!

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I can believe that I made biscuits.  Every attempt I ever made resulted in rocks.                                     UPDATE 03/15/10:  These have become my secret recipe biscuits.  Remember to not overwork the dough more than you need to.  I like lg. biscuits and normally get 6 biscuits out of this recipe. After placing on parchment paper covered baking sheets I coat the biscuits with butter flavor cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. I let the biscuits sit in a warm area and "rise" while I prepare the rest of the meal.

This biscuit recipe was excellent. I used honey instead of sugar, used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour, and baked them on a baking stone. They turned out excellent! Next time I plan to double the recipe, add more wheat flour (I love grains), use cake flour in replace of the all purpose flour, and refrigerate over night to relieve me of hazzle for the morning I bake them.

Biscuits and gravy! How could anyone not like this! The biscuits were big and fluffy but I thought they were a bit on the bland side. It's been a so long time since I have had home made biscuits that I might have forgotten what they were suppose to taste like! I made six biscuits and ate two of them myself and gave one to Molly (my dog)... She liked them also! :)

I had originally put this as 3 stars because they didn't come out right the first time, but I tried making them again today for Chicken and Biscuits and they turned out wonderful! They baked up nice and high and were fluffy on the insides. The problem I had before was that I kneaded the dough too much. Don't spend a lot of time kneading this dough.
The taste wasn't out of this world, but nothing butter, honey, or jam can't fix, plus I'm in Australia and biscuits here are what we call cookies so this recipe will do the trick and no doubt will take care of my biscuit cravings. Now to try and make homemade sausage for biscuits and gravy. I'm very excited about this!!
Thank you J.P. for such a great recipe!!!

These are just too good! The only thing I did differently was bake them in a cast iron skillet (can you tell I'm from the south?) They were so pretty my mom thought they were packaged biscuits. They turned out so big and soooo fluffy. I think this will be my recipe for biscuits for life. The only thing I will do differently is leave out the sugar. We like our biscuits straight up without the little sweet taste y'all! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

My husband and I live at high altitude (around 5300' above sea level) have tried *many* different biscuit recipes over the past 3 years.  None of the ones we'd tried previously turned out well, even with high-altitude adjustments.  These turned out perfectly, no adjustments needed!  And, they taste wonderful and have excellent texture.  Thanks, J.P.!!!

I'm in love - These were scrumptious! If you're watching your carbs or dieting or anything like that, you'd better watch your back, because these bad boys are addictive. They bake up big, moist and fluffy and are great with butter and honey or for soaking up really tasty gravy. For those that complained that they were plain, well, not to insult your intelligence, but it IS a straight-up biscuit recipe - if you want garlic, cheese, cinnamon or whatever you're going to have to either experiment or find another recipe tailored to exactly what you're looking for (although it's so easy to adapt this recipe that I'll never look elsewhere). J.P., you're my hero!

Made these biscuits at midnight and baked them the following morning.  Could not wait to try them.  They are the BEST BISCUITS I have ever made!! I did use butter, doubled the sugar and used buttermilk.  I was so thrilled with the outcome that I quickly copied the recipe for my daughters. Thank you J.P. and all of you who made the above suggestions.

I don't know what went wrong here; I've made biscuits plenty of times, but this recipe did not turn out at all.  The biscuits were horrid and not fit for human consumption.  I will look for a different recipe in the future.

THese biscuits are wonderful.  I didn't use the shortening I used real butter instead and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tarter.  They baked up big and fluffy!   For a quick throw together biscuit this is the best baking powder biscuit recipe I have found so far.

These are biscuits.....can't really think of anything more to say.  I will try them again, mine rose somewhat, but were too dense, so I'll practice to see what I can do.

Nice and fluffy.  I made 8 and they still baked up large.  They are very smooth & light, but they ARE just ordinary biscuits.  I let the dough sit 20 minutes.  Used the whole cup of milk.

Great BIG biscuits!!! I used Butter Crisco. They rose to a nice height, had good texture and taste. If you want more salty, omit the sugar or put less.

A 'true' biscuit, these were light and delicious. After I stirred the milk in (which I did not use a full cup of)....I kneaded just a bit then formed 6 biscuits with my hands, no rolling or cutting...very easy!  Altho, I should have doubled the recipe, they were gone in no time.  Thanx John.

Very good biscuits! I have made these several times without any modifications to the ingredients and always came out great. Only thing is that dough is very sticky so be sure not to add too much flour and to not knead too much. I knead the dough about 6 times and then pat the dough to about 1" thickness.

This is a good recipe but the biscuits need more shortening.I found them to be a little dry the 1st time I made them but upped the shortening to 1/2 cup the next time and used the 3/4 c. of milk. It makes a stickier dough but a better overall biscuit.Also made 12 smaller biscuits and baked 10 mins.

These biscuits were fantastic - great texture - not too dense.  I don't know what happened with everyone else, but my biscuits came out huge, like promised in the recipe!  Great the next day also, easy to make.  I used this with Bill's Sausage Gravy, and they are a match made in heaven!!!

I don't know why people had problems with this recipe. My college roommate and I made these biscuits this morning for a rare homemade treat. They turned out great! Just the way our mom's used to make them...nice and light, but extreamly tasty.

These biscuits are the best!  This was my first time making biscuits from scratch.  I followed a couple suggestions from other's reviews:  substituted buttermilk for milk, didn't knead the dough and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  Simple and they baked up all fluffy.  This will be a staple recipe in my home.

i made these because of the rave reviews, but i was kind of dissapointed.  maybe i shouldnt have kneaded the dough?  they were crunchy on the top and bottom but soft in the middle, but they hardly rose at all.  i will try to make this recipe again, but next time i wont knead it and i will roll out to 1 1/2 inches instead of 1 inch. i will also try using buttter flavored shortening and brushing w/butter before i bake.  but they are quick and ez.

Kneading the dough does NOT a tender biscuit make!!  These were flavorless, and not worth the bigness, to not have any taste.

GREAT!  I made these biscuits last night for my family and they all thought they were store bought.  I will NEVER use store bought biscuits again.  Very simple.  I made them smaller because I have a big family with small children and they were perfect.

I love these biscuits.  I hate rolling dough! I just pat these out and cut with a biscuit cutter.  I don't make them really big, so it makes about 8-10 regular sized biscuits.  Thanks, J.P.!

I love this recipe, too!I have made these numerous times. I am getting ready to make them now. I have no problems put this recipe, ever. I think the problems are user error. I have made these with both butter and shortening, as well as rendered lard. Always a beautiful and consistent turn out! I think these are especially excellent with jam, and superior under the weight of a breakfast gravy!

A big hit with the husband and toddler. We enjoyed them with country gravy and chicken for dinner, then with jelly the next morning. I anticipate making these a lot. When I rolled out the dough I folded it over, rolled it out again and did that a few times before cutting the dough with a glass. It created layers in the biscuits which made it easy to half and spread.

Biscuits are perfect with sausage gravy. My husband begs me to make his favorite meal. He loves his biscuits. Now if I could only get him to eat grits.

I have made these once a week for almost a year! Finally a PERFECT biscuit recipe...my only change was to use buttermilk (or most often I add a Tbs of vinegar to the milk instead bc buttermilk is expensive.) I double this recipe (don’t you love how allrecipes does the math for you?!) and it makes 13 biscuits. They are BIG and fluffy and delicious! Thanks for this recipe J.P.!

The recipe results in a soft textured biscuit that taste delicious; one of my favorites. Does not require a lot of time to prepare and is a family pleaser.

This is my go to recipe for baking powder biscuits. I've made them many times now, usually as written but I've also found it to be very forgiving when I need to substitute an ingredient.

I've made these with water when I had no milk. Yes really.
I've made these with oil when I had no shortening.
They turned out fluffy when I forgot to kneed the dough that one time. In these times I'm thankful for the little things and this recipe is one of them.

My boyfriend grew up with a Mon from the south who cooked, baked, broiled, and sauted from morning until night. I tried EVERY BISCUIT RECIPE I COULD FIND. Unfortunately, none of THOSE even came close...until today!!! Today is the day that I came so close to his mom's biscuits, I could almost see the memories of his mom serving him those biscuits in his eyes!!! Thank you so much!!!

Loved this recipe!  I didn't have shortening so I substituted with margarine.   I used the parchment paper for easy clean up and lightly brushed the biscuits with melted butter before I put them in the oven. I tried and failed with recipes in the past. My son and hubby agree this recipe is a keeper!  :)

I make these using 1 to 1 Gluten Free flour (Krustez brand) and add about 1/4 cup more milk . Instead of rolling and folding, I do them as drop biscuits.  My GF friends love them and are so glad I included them in my cooking.  
*tip* Spray a little Pam* on your drop spoon before each scoop.  It helps them slide off the spoon.

Great, great, GREAT recipe.  I have never made homemade biscuits before, relying on those in the tube.  Well NO MORE my friends.  This is amazingly easy and delicious.  Way cheaper too, as I always have these items in my pantry.  Just be careful not to overmix because they will get too dense (trial and error lesson).

I used margarine instead of shortening and added 1 tablespoon of honey to half of the dough just to try it out, and it turned out thickier and got brown around the edges faster, while the dough with no honey came out of the oven white.

I followed the directions exactly as they are written and these biscuits were light and fluffy. I didn't bother to roll them out I just dropped them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and they were great.

Very simple recipe and easy to follow.  I also used butter instead of shortening for the flavor.  The key to tender biscuits is to not overwork the dough so I kneaded it just a few times.  I also let the buscuits rest for about 20 minutes before baking to allow the baking powder to activate.  The buscuits turned out tall and  and tender: delicious and a hit with my sausage gravy.  Will make these again.

So perfect! I used butter instead of shortening and prepared them a little differently than specified. I used a food processor to cut in the butter, and refrigerated the dough for about a half an hour before turning it out onto the counter. I rolled the dough out and tri-folded it twice in lieu of kneading before the final roll-out. I cut the biscuits out with a pop can I sliced in half; this worked exactly a million times better than the blunt edges of some of my cookie cutters. They were a big hit!

I've been making biscuits for over 20 years and I have to say that these are by far the best I have ever made. I wanted buttermilk biscuits so I added a little vinegar to the milk. My dough was very wet, so when I turned it out onto a floured surface I just lightly kneaded to get it not sticky. The dough was very light. I didn't work it hard at all. They  raised high and were light and fluffy. They were melt in your mouth delightful. I baked at 450 for 10 min. but I don't think that made any difference. This is my new go to recipe from now on. Thank you!

These came out perfect!  Tender on the inside and a little crispy on the outside, with a terrific taste.  Thanks to discobunny, I now know about powdered buttermilk (found it at walmart) and added a couple tablespoons to the flour mixture.  I also used butter and skim milk.  Ended up the best biscuits ever, with sausage gravy at breakfast and strawberry shortcake after dinner!

Made these the first couple of times exactly as the recipe called and they were scrumptious. They had a great taste and they were moist.
I ventured and mixed in half cold unsalted butter and shortening and they were delicious and had that buttery taste.
Great recipe thank you so much for sharing!

These biscuits were awesome. I used 6T. Butter instead of the shortening, and they were big and fluffy. Don't use a rolling pin...just use your hands to pat it down. And when you use a glass or cookie cutter to cut out the biscuit, don't twist it because it will impede the rising of the biscuit. I baked them for 14 minutes. I will definitely make these again!!

Simple and delicious! I used butter instead of shortening, brushed with butter before and after baking and added real bacon bits and cheese to the dry ingredients after the butter was cut in.

Although I enjoyed making and tasting these biscuits, my grandmother hated them. Before I told her I made them, she said "Don't ever buy these again". After informing her that I got the recipe off of the internet, she advised me to never make them again. That being said, my children loved them and they were gone in seconds. I did like that they came out perfectly. It looked just like the picture and they are easy to make.

This recipe was SO easy to make! I'm no pro in the kitchen by far but I have made these buscuits a few times and I can't help but snap pics and brag to my sisters at my buscuits I made from scratch! I'm in my 30s so it doesn't seem like the in thing to be making things from scratch anymore which is why these simple buscuits can be so impressive when you make them!  Definitely try this recipe!

Tried this for the first time today. They turned out great! Followed the recipe mostly to the tee. Used a dash more of sugar. A smidge more of shortening. Poured milk in a little at a time. Didn't use the full cup. My 9 yr old finicky son loves them! Will make with him next time.

AWESOME! This is my go to! These puff up beautifully and taste delicious. The only thing I do differently is I DON'T knead the dough. Throw some honey on these while they are warm and you will have to try very hard not to eat the whole batch.

The quantities are wrong!! 1 cup of milk should be a half cup. The dough was a batter! What the heck?

I love soft biscuits, and these were perfect.  I did not knead the dough as much because I was afraid it would make them dense. Next time I will try making the dough ahead to see if it makes them even taller.  These had a very fresh taste and light texture.

This was a great recipe. I've tried many recipes for big and fluffy biscuits, only for them to look like a flat hockey puck. This one is great. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I used some other reviewers tips and substituted butter for the shortening and it gave the biscuits more flavor. More salt would be ok too, if you like. Also, don't pour the whole cup of milk in, it will be too much. Do like the recipe says and pour a little at a time. I'd say I used 3/4 cup of milk total.

They didn't rise up big at all.  They did taste good, though.  I did everything just as the recipe said, but don't know what went wrong. I might try again.  I will check my bakeing powder, to see if it is still good.

Tasted Great!! Came out kind of thick though. Just don't knead it and it'll be less thick :)

*Subbed Shortening for Margarine to add flavour.

Substituted bacon fat for shortening and buttermilk (1 c. whole milk + 1 Tablespoon lemon juice) for regular milk.  Once the batter was mixed, dropped the biscuits in mounds on an ungreased pan, nearly touching. They baked up beautifully!

Light and fluffy if you don't over-mix or knead too much. My new go-to biscuit recipe. Want to spice it up?  Add cheese and pepper or herbs.

Made one batch with butter and milk (browned more) and another with lard and almond milk.  both are excellent but prefer the butter/milk a little more.  Next time will use butter/almond milk combo.  Yay!

These were fantastic! And SUPER EASY! I substituted the milk for plain almond milk for a dairy free version. I did them up on my silicone pie crust mat (found it on Amazon) and clean up was a snap.

I made these with my granddaughter. It was a very simple and quick recipe. We also brushed them with melted butter. They were a huge hit. My daughter thought they were a little heavy. But the best recipe I have found.

This review is long overdue. Have been using the recipe for 8 years every year. Never failed to impress yet so simple to make. Thanks!  
Sometimes I used butter instead and reduced the sugar by half, depending on occasions.

These are the best - I make them all the time.  I was never quite successful until I found this recipe.  I also like them because I don't keep self-rising flour on hand, which so many recipes call for.  Try them,  I don't think you'll be disappointed!

Delicious and HUGE! I was skeptical of the size claim because the recipe didn't seem that different from any other biscuits I've made but these tripled in size in the oven right before my eyes.

These are great dinner till type biscuits or biscuits you would put ham and egg on, just not what me as a southerner considers a biscuit-- I want buttermilk fall apart butter biscuit, but this is a fantastic biscuit for a different reason! Everyone would enjoy these and they are great for beginners!

These biscuits are absolutely wonderful! I made them for Thanksgiving dinner, for my all of my in-laws, all 24 of them devoured them, they did not last! I did tweak the recipe a little bit, I decided that I was only going to knead the dough 10-12 times, as I've learned the more you knead or play with dough, the tougher the outcome is. 10-12 was perfect, it was melt in your mouth texture.

It says to roll the biscuits out to 1 inch thick and I ended up with biscuits 5 inches high and very doughy in the middle. They tasted good but 1 inch is probably too thick.

I have tried many homemade biscuit recipes and this is hands down the best I have used.  I used butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 buttermilk 1/2 white milk and they turned out perfect.  This is now my go to recipe for big moist and fluffy biscuits.

I have tried many different biscuit recipes, and this one was by far the easiest dough to work with!   It does indeed turn out large, picture perfect biscuits.  They were not voted best tasting out of all the recipes I tried, but as far as prep, they were my favorite!   A good solid recipe that won't disappoint.

Nice texture, very good fluffy soft insides and slightly crunchy, harder outside shell. I only used about 3/4 of a cup of milk. They baked for about 15-17 minutes. I also used all butter, I didn't have any shortening. They were perfect, except that they had little to no flavor. I think if you used buttermilk instead of regular milk, or normal milk instead of almond milk like I did, they would have had more flavor. Other than that they were REALLY GOOD. They also rose PERFECTLY! I made 9 biscuits instead of 6 fatter ones.

First attempt at biscuits a success! These are pretty and delicious. After reading the comments I substituted butter for shortening.  I don't keep shortening in the house.  I also minimized how much I played with the dough. Thanks for a great recipe. This ones a keeper!

These biscuits are amazing! Definitely satisfied my 2am pregnancy craving and they took no time at all to prep and bake. I also used butter instead of shortening, only because I don't have any at the moment, and they're great. I have a feeling my husband will wake up and I'll have to make 6 more. If you have a house full of biscuit lovers like us, treat yourself and double the recipe!  Thanks for sharing this recipe. You have made a prego and her baby very happy.

I will never buy frozen biscuit anymore!  I followed everything except for substituting butter from shortening and it turned out great, I mean big, fluffy, and so moist. Listen to everybody, don't over kneed the dough.  Thank you so much J.P. For this wonderful recipe.

I subbed butter for the shortening and whey from yogurt making for the milk. These are THE BEST biscuits ever! They rise and flake beautifully! Making some tonight to go in top of pot pie.

I read a lot of reviews for this and I have a couple of comments. First of all, thank you. I love these. I made them to go with my beef stew tonight. I rolled them too thin so they didn't get very big but that was my fault. I ended up with like twelve instead of six. I also used butter instead because that's what I had on hand. I had to use a glass to cut them and it worked fine. I used all of the milk so I had to flour my surface and my rolling pin quite a bit but it was fine. The bottoms came out crispy and buttery and the insides were soft. Super good! Thank you JP!

I made these with butter instead of shortening and only had 1/2 cup of milk so i used  half & half for the rest. Mine came out great. They rose big and tasted so good. The key to make biscuits is to  cut up the butter/shortening and do not over work the dough. Handle it as little as possible and they will come out moist and big.

As a foreign allrecipes member I can't compare this recipe to other homemade/bought versions, but I find these buiscuits delicious! I made just one and it was just delicious as it is, I loved the buttery/soft texture. Ideal for any kind of topping as it was neigher salty nor sweet.
I made it with whole wheat flour because that's all I had at hand. Will definitely make it again!

These biscuits look like the kind my mommy used to make and the only thing I will change will be to use coconut oil. Below 76 degrees it is a solid and above 76 it is a liquid. I use coconut oil for everything and only use real butter and I use whole milk all USDA organic. Also the flour is USDA organic as well.  ???

I make these biscuits all the time. They have never failed.  My family ate a lot of awful biscuits until I found this recipe. I usually put my unbaked biscuits biscuits in the fridge or freezer for a while before baking and get a really big fluffy biscuit. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Most excellent biscuits! i will definitely use this one again!
I made a couple changes...  The most important thing to know for those who don't have a lot of biscuit experience- recipes are subject to the environmental conditions where you cook. I've done them in TN, NJ, CO, CA, WA and NY. recipe and handling/baking was different in all locations. I do recommend you look at the video- this dough was a bit wetter than I'm used to, and if I hadn't looked at the video I probably would've added far too much flour and ended up with floury bricks, like some of the unhappy reviewers.

The only "shortening" I have in my house is coconut oil. I needed a bit more (about 2 extra TBS) to get the right consistency before adding the  milk, which I needed a bit less of- I'd say I used about 3/4 - 7/8 cup. 
I learned this last bit  while living in the south. After kneading and rolling out the dough, use a sharp knife (I always use my pizza slicer!) and cut the biscuits out. Every time you scrape the dough together and re-roll it to get more biscuits, they get a little tougher.  
 After putting the biscuits on your pan, put the pan in the fridge for at least 15 minutes to get your shortening of choice to firm up again.  Pop them in your preheated oven- and after preheating, let the oven stay at temp at least 15 minutes before adding the biscuits.

I make these all the time, the only thing I do different is I do NOT knead the dough 14 or 15 times, I add the milk and stir for a second or two then flop it onto the lightly floured board, knead about 1 or 2 times until it sticks together, then roll or pat it out to about 1 1/2 inches thick, cut with a juice glass, put the biscuits onto a non- greased cookie sheet and bake,  they come out light and fluffy,  the extra kneading will make biscuits tough,the less you handle it the better.  (same goes for pie dough, if you knead it too much, you end up with a tough crust).

I am not a biscuit-pro but this recipe worked for me.  I tried two recipes at the same and this was my choice.  Good flavor.  I made these as directed; no substitutions, no modifications.  Quick, easy.  Worth a try.

Awesome!! This was so easy and mine were not dense at all! I mixed all the ingredients by hand until just combined then I sprinkled each handful of dough with flour and kneaded them into biscuit sizes. The recipe made 7 drop biscuits.

Made these biscuits a couple of times, now.  1 time with shortening, 1 time with butter, didn't knead either time, just folding over & patting the dough out.  The best so far was the butter and just one fold.  Both times, the recipe rested in the fridge for 6-12 hours.

I didn't even try that hard, and it came out good.  I added too much milk (I was impatient), but I had a silpat and did not have to worry about it sticking.  So I plopped the dough/batter onto the pan, and it came out fine (though perhaps not as much rise).  I cut the biscuit into squares and served it with Bill's sausage gravy.

Wouldn't change a thing. Rolled out the dough to 1" as instructed, but used a big cup to make fat 5" wide biscuits of perfect flavor and texture. A bit dry at the edges, soft and dense in the middle. A simple, classic recipe, thanks!

I finally found a biscuit recipe worth my time.... Thanks for sharing. I did substitute margarine in place of the shortening and I did not knead the dough. Given my previous experience with baking I decided it would only make them more dense to knead the dough. Also the margarine adds to the flavor. Thanks again for sharing!

I woke hungry for biscuits this morning. It's Sunday morning, wanted to fix a big breakfast for the family...  Thought I'd try this recipe today and found it a tad bit disappointing.  Yes they raise up nicely, look ok but taste was bland and dry.  I would not try this recipe again, it's missing that "something" to make it a great biscuit.

Love these biscuits.  They're perfect for biscuits and gravy mornings and they get so big!  Remember, it's important to mix/knead them as little as possible otherwise they won't get fluffy.

Great recipe. I did throw my own spin on it. I added a stick of melted butter and one egg.  You will have to take away from the amount of milk needed. It makes a great biscuit for homemade sausage gravy!

I LOVE this recipe!  After baking many years, this recipe is exactly what I had always hoped I would find.  The second time I made them, I added 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese - delicious!

These turned out great! They're huge and fluffy just the way I (and my family) wanted them. another Recipe I was using the biscuits kept getting hard on the tops ad bottoms but I was surprised when this one didn't. My only problem was the amount that they said to knead the dough, typically I try to knead my dough for about 10 to 15 minutes and that does great, this recipe said to knead 15 to 20 times. But it's all a matter on what people prefer.

Lights out.
My first time making biscuits and I wouldn't change a thing. I only had butter on hand so that's what I used instead of shortening.
I also watched the video and that was helpful.
Awesome biscuits!

I followed the recipe except used margarine instead of shortening. I also mixed the ingredients using my mixer with the dough hooks. Texture was great and after 4 days they were still as soft as the first.

Good when short on time and ingredients. I sift my flour, salt and baking powder together so its well incorporated. Great for stews or gravy. I also used margarine rather than shortening since that's what I had. I don't bother cutting round ones, just pat out the dough and cut squares with a sharp knife.  No left over dough or over-worked dough that way so always tender!!  Great and simple baking powder biscuits when I don't have stuff for my buttermilk recipe. Wonderful when teaching an 8yr old how to bake!  ;)

Incredible!! Like some others, I swapped butter for the shortening and used 1/2 cup of wheat flour...but man-o-man these are tasty and fluffy with just a touch of crisp on the outside as you bite in! DO only use as much milk as needed (I ended up with a few tablespoons left over) DO NOT mess with the dough too much -- that will ruin even the best recipe! Thank you John for a wonderful recipe! :-)

Very good basic biscuit recipe. I stepped it up a notch to suit my families taste buds. I melted a few tbsp butter, stirred in some garlic salt and added 1 clove chopped garlic. After one puts their own personal tasty touch to it enjoy!

This was absolutely delightful. What a great base biscuit recipe. I whipped these up this afternoon for the first time ever. I didn't knead it at all, just kind of pressed it together and shaped it into a rough rectangle and cut them into squares. I added some shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses to it. The possibilities are endless. Raisins and cinnamon.. dried cranberries and orange peel... diced ham, cheese and chives. Next time I might even try them plain, I'm sure they're wonderful that way too!

I used all butter (grated in, frozen.) I prefer the dough to be slightly wet and do all my mixing/kneading in the bowl with a spatula.  I turn the sticky dough onto a floured surface and sprinkle it with flour and roll it quickly into a thin sheet.  I followed another review and folded the sheet over once (if its too sticky, just use a knife or bench scraper to help it over.) Then use a floured cookie cutter to cut out 8 med. sized biscuits placed spaced apart in a foil lined cookie sheet.  Brush melted butter on top of each and baked mine for about 12 mins. always checking after the 1st 10 mins.  Oh, I also bake them on a rack moved up to the second highest level otherwise the bottoms get too brown before the tops get a chance to.  Very delicious!   Thank you, John!

I think the biscuits were fabulous. For those of you who said the biscuits didn't rise, may I suggest you check the expiration date on your baking powder. Also, as many others have suggested, use a metal biscuit cutter (they usually have taller sides than a cooky cutter) a glass cutter will press the sides down rather than give you a clean cut) I used the food processor and they came together super quickly.  I didn't need all of the milk and, after reading many reviews, I think the original recipe should be revised to say 3/4-1 cup milk as the amount of milk can vary depending on the flour, humidity and who knows what else. The minimal amount of sugar makes the biscuits brown nicely.   Use BUTTER instead of shortening,  add the milk SLOWLY and brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter BEFORE and AFTER baking  and you will have the the best biscuits ever!

I  pulled the biscuits from the oven several minutes ago and just popped the first one for a quick few bites: Biscuit nirvana! Many thanks to JP for sharing this great recipe. The biscuits have turned out nicely fluffy but also with a very slight crispiness to the outside which adds a certain robustness to the experience of biting into it. Like others on this forum, I made a few modifications which luckily did not result in damaging the quality of the biscuits. My modifications include:. 
1.) I used whole spelt flour. The texture and consistency of the biscuits is fabulous.
2.) I substituted coconut oil for the shortening - 75% of the amount of shortening the recipe called for.
3.) I also added just a bit of cold butter (approximately 1/3  cup) as it appeared that the mixture needed just a bit more fat.
I believe that the coconut oil may account for the lovely slight crispiness. It also added a subtle flavour to the bisquits.
4.) I also doubled the recipe.

In short: Yum!

Basic recipe. Changes that worked for me: 1/2 cup of softened BUTTER!!!, BUTTERMILK!!, Self Rising flour plus 1 teaspoon baking powder, 450 degrees (thermometer read), NO KNEADING, just get everything wet, then flour your hands and place the ball on floured countertop, hand form the dough to 3/4 to 1 inch thick (no rolling pin), cut and place biscuits on pie pan touching (I also use parchment paper). Brush tops with melted butter, Bake 11 to 14 minutes. check at 11 minutes.  If not brown on top, turn your oven to high broil and toast for about 90 seconds.  Fluffy, YUMMY!!!!

This is my baseline biscuit recipe now.  I modify it with sour cream and agave instead of sugar and milk.  You've got to watch the browning with the sour cream.

Just made this recipe.  WONDERFUL!  Didn't overwork the dough, in fact I barely worked it at all.  Just lightly formed it with my hands, and cut with a pastry cutter.  I DID add more butter though.  They came out fluffy and buttery, they were delicious.  Best I've ever had.

Pretty good and easy to throw together.  I kneaded exactly 15 times and thought the biscuits were tougher than I expected.  I also would add a touch more salt.  Otherwise, a tasty recipe.

They were good in taste, but when they finished baking they had a hard crunchy layer on top that had separated from the rest of the biscuits.

Rave reviews from the family. (Husband pronounced them "great" and "best you've ever made" about seven times in twenty minutes.) Substituted real butter for the shortening, didn't over-knead, doubled the batch and got 14 biscuits about 3.5" across.

I love this recipe!  I have made it a number of times and they always turn out well.  I never use shortening, substituting cold butter instead.  My other variations are to substitute 3/4 cup of the milk with yogurt, which allows me to use a little less of the butter.  I add a little extra milk if needed for the dough to come together.  The biscuits with yogurt are light and moist - delicious!  I have also made this recipe with almond milk, giving a lovely, nutty richness to the biscuits.  This is a can't-miss recipe!

I loved this recipe! Although I hate shortening, I just equally replaced the shortening for butter and to lower sodium I omitted the salt. They came out big and tender,served them with a good hardy beef stew.

This was my first time making biscuits and they were amazing!  The only change I made to the recipe was I used butter instead of shortening, just because I like the flavor the butter gives it.  This is the only recipe I will use for biscuits, easy and awesome!

very easy and delicious. I followed tips from others to make this a bit better such as baking in my pre-heated buttered cast iron skillet for 10 mins at 450; using half cold butter and half cold shortening; also I added vinegar to the milk to make butter milk; I only made half of the recipe and it yielded 4 nice large biscuits I used a pub glass to cut the dough and I tried not to handle too much as other reviewers mentioned. thanks for the recipe and all for the tips

I have been trying out many different recipes and techniques to make what I think would be the perfect biscuit. This is it... they are dense but rose well. Some said these were bland, this is fixed by using butter instead of shortening ( it has salt). I have also added some finely shredded cheddar cheese or some parmesan and they were awesome. Some advice though...shake your baking powder or soda anytime you use it and replace it monthly if possible. second knead the dough minimally, I patted it to a large rectangle... folded left and right side into middle and then folded in half. then repeated 3x this creates the layers, roll out and cut ( no twisting)-simple but important tips I have learned along the way.

Not a bad biscuit. Pros: very pretty, bakes up nice and tall. Not too dry, not too greasy. Cons: a little dense for my liking. Doesn't taste bad, but not great either, a bit bland. Probably won't try this one again. The search continues!

First time making biscuits and they turned out perfect! I didn't knead the dough like everyone has suggested, just dropped onto a surface and flattened out with fingers. They grew more in width than in height, so don't make them too short. Will bake many more times. These are perfect for breakfast sandwiches.

The ingredients are a good basic biscuit recipe, though I use half a cup of shortening and little or no sugar. Since it is a law of biscuit making to handle the dough as little as possible, I don't know why it calls for kneading--and 14 to 15 times!! If those babies aren't tough, then, I will be greatly surprised. I don't knead at all, and I don't use a rolling pin. Put the mixed dough out on a floured board, dust it with more flour, pat it into a round about 3/4 inch thick and cut into rounds. Gently does it. Bake as the recipe directs.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is outstanding! I learned from my grandmother that you never knead biscuit dough, just mix it until it comes together and stop; however, the first time I made these I followed that thinking and the first cut busicuts were not nearly as light or raise as much as the second cut biscuts (the biscuits I cut from the dough left over from the first set).  Now I wouldn't knead these like you would bread, but I would use the same type of motion, working the dough until it is less sticky and comes together.  I get great results every time with these.  So tasty and beautiful!

Very nice recipe if you're looking for something quick with the ingredients that you have in your kitchen. It requires little preparation and is done quickly. I thought the prep time was highly exaggerated, and would have said 10 minutes myself. Cook time was exactly 14 minutes for me. Would be longer if you used a larger cutter for the biscuits, which I would recommend and will be doing myself next time. I substituted unsalted stuck butter for the shortening. I did not over-kneed the dough, which would make them hard. I placed the biscuits touching on the sheet. Would suggest erring on the side of thick when rolling out dough. Yields a nice, fat biscuit. Nice no-frills recipe that reminds me of the simple old school Betty Crocker recipe, only a higher biscuit, which is nice. OH! Forgot to mention, add the milk slowly and stop when you have enough. I used a little under my one cup of milk.

This is even better if you flatten the biscuit out to about 1/4" and then fry it in oil/shortening. You can even decrease the shortening to about 2 tbls and use the difference to fry the biscuits. Fry in medium heat for about 3 minutes each side then drain on paper towels.

Just made these and the next batch is in the oven. I didn't want to forget to reply..THEY ARE GRRRRRRRREAT.They ate them so fast they forgot I hadn't eaten yet. lol. I didn't have any regular milk so I used evaporated milk and it happen to be fat- free. Didn't notice that when I bought it. They are tender, has a melt in your mouth feel to them. I don't know what recipe I tried before but it was not tasty at all. But this one means I will never ever buy another can of biscuits.

I have been trying different non yeast biscuit recipes from allrecipes for months; probably 15 in all.  These are my favorite so far; moist, flavorful, and very easy to make.  I used evaporated milk, doubled the recipe and had 14 perfect large biscuits. I only kneaded 3 times, then patted down. I have learned that the less you handle the dough, the better the biscuit with non yeast recipes. In fact, I do not think you need to knead this dough at all. I live in the South and have been told that the secret to great biscuits is the flour and many Southerners only make biscuits with flour from Booneville Flour and Feed Mill in NC-I am going to order some flour from them and try this again.  Also someone made grits on a chef contest show (Top Chef or one of those) and the judges raved about the grits and they were from Booneville Flour and Feed also.  I am finally going to try those products.  I love Allrecipes and have made some wonderful meals from this site. I especially love to put in the 3 ingredients I have in my frig and chooose out of the recipes that come up; a great way to stretch the dollar.

I thought this recipe was perfect! My nephew and niece asked for biscuits and gravy and I needed a quick and easy recipe. I took the chance on using this one and I am so glad I did! It didn't make very many, just enough for four or five people, so if you need more you might want to double the recipe.  You won't go wrong with this recipe, everyone raved about how good they were!

I used reduced fat buttermilk because I had no regular milk, and I imagine that is what kept these from rising up "super high."  However, I must say that these were quite tasty.  Somewhat heavy or dense, but still somehow really soft.  We gobbled them up with butter and jam. Nom!

Very quick and easy biscuit!  A little on the dry side, but it's a biscuit--I can understand that it's not going to turn out like a moist, rich cake or something!  To help with the dryness, I just brush with plenty of butter.  :D Overall, a great recipe!

My 10 year old daughter and I made these together.  I had never attempted biscuts other than store bought ones.  They turned out great!  We did use salted butter instead of the shortning.  We rolled ours more around 3/4" thick just so we could make more.  We did read the previous reviews about not overmixing once we started to add the milk.  We will save this one.

Best biscuit recipe ever.  I knead mine slightly less then what the recipe calls for (maybe 5 times at the most) and use cold butter rather then shortening.  I also mix by hand, rather then with a mixer or spoon.  They ALWAYS come out amazingly!  I have even doubled the recipe and they came out perfect.  A permanent recipe in my recipe box!



12/2019. These are still my go to biscuits. With 2 kids now, I do use a mixer to make things quicker, and they are still just as good!

SO GOOD!  I used butter instead of shortening and didn't knead them, just formed the dough into a ball and then rolled it out to 1" thickness.  I took one reviewer's suggestion and brushed them with melted butter before baking, and then brushed them again when they came out.  AMAZING!  Gave them some extra flavor and a crispness to the top.  Why would I ever use a different recipe?

I have been hunting for a good biscuit recipe for...I don't know how long. These were easy and delicious baking powder buscuits. I used the food processor and it cut the prep to no time at all. The cup of milk made the dough a little wet so I added about a 1/4 cup additional flour. My buscuits nearly tripled in size, I patted them out to an inch and they were at least 2 1/2 inches after baking. They were still a little doughy inside after cooking for 13 min, but still delicious. I will pat out a little thinner next time and they should be perfect. *A tip I learned from Cook's Country Test Kitchen is to rotate your baking powder every six months or so because it looses it's potency. This may be why they rose so significantly. GREAT RECIPE!! Thanks for sharing.

This has been my go-to biscuit recipe for years! Love them! For those of you coming out with tough or dry biscuits, it's because you're rolling the dough out too thin and/or over kneading the dough. I made this mistake a few times when I first started making homemade biscuits which turned out more like hockey pucks. So what you do is after kneading it only for about a minute or less, roll the dough out to about 1 inch thick (which is very thick), cut out circles, and then repeat until the dough is used up. This will give you huge fluffy biscuits every time :) I guess this is what the recipe says to do, but I'm just reiterating the importance of not rolling the dough to thin or over kneading b/c it's crucial! Also, make sure that your butter or shortening is cold.

I used half whole wheat flour but I could for sure taste it.  I put the dough in the refrigerator for a couple hours.  I also used the food processor for steps 1 and 2.  I would try again- it was a little dry but better then eating all the bad stuff  in the grands biscuits.

I have been making these biscuits for years and they are always a hit. For a healthier, vegan twist...I use coconut oil in place of shortening and almond milk in place of milk. They are light and flavorful.

For my first time making biscuits, and for the fact that I made these to quench a sudden, intense craving for biscuits, these were okay. Not exactly good, but they weren't bad. They came out more cakey than flaky (which may be my own fault, considering I used butter instead of shortening) and entirely too salty, and after baking for 13 minutes the bottoms were burnt and the biscuits as whole were slightly dry.
This recipe is basic and has potential- next time I'll use shortening as the recipe suggests, cut the salt in half and check the biscuits after 11-12 minutes instead of 13. But for now, it only gets 3 stars.

These are the BEST buscuits you will ever make in your life. If you follow the directions fully, you cannot make a mistake. When it says "Cut in the shortening", I dont have a flour cutter thing so I used a potato masher and it came out the same and really made a difference rather than just mixing it together. Try making your own butter too. It will make these the BOMB!

These biscuits are so yummy! Very easy to make. I do not recommend that you knead the dough. Once it is mixed with the milk, turn onto floured surface and pat and turn over a few times to get a light and fluffy biscuit. I used butter rather than shortening and when they came out of the oven I brushed garlic butter on top. They were all gone within an hour. A definite keeper! THANK YOU J.P :)

I have baked this recipe several times, and used the dough to make monkey bread.  The recipe is great as is, but the last time I made them I substituted half the shortening for butter, and refrigerated overnight.  The biscuits were even better! such a wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe. I made my first batch of homemade biscuits with this recipe. 1 cup of milk was a little too much so I did have to add a little more flour during the kneading process cause the were too sticky. I made this a second time and added about 3/4 cup of milk instead and it was better. Recipe made 7 large biscuits for me. We pour chicken stew over them here in NC. Delish

I make these all the time. I roll out the dough then double it up to make a nice pull apart. Also if I want to make them "fancy" for a nice dinner I will melt some honey and fresh rosemary together and glaze with that, topping with a light sprinkle of kosher salt after baking.

This is the best biscuit recipe I have found on the internet. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and the prep is done very quickly. These biscuits are very good and they are suitable for breakfast, lunch or dinner. What I love the most about these is they really are versatile (like the author says). In other words, you can eat them with gravy or with fruit and they will taste great. In the future I plan to substitute the shortening with butter and perhaps replace the milk with buttermilk. I would suggest this recipe to anyone especially if you are looking for a biscuit recipe that will go well with a Thanksgiving dinner.

Loved this recipe.  Great texture and taste. Did alter it due to suggestions in other reviews.  Used 2 tsp of baking soda instead of 3, added 1/2 tsp baking powder and used buttermilk instead of milk.  I rolled to 1 inch thick and used a 3 inch biscuit cutter .  The recipe only made 5 full size biscuits.  They doubled in height.  I will butter the top and sprinkle with a dusting of sugar next time as a local restaurant offers.

I have been trying to make biscuits for over 30 years and every time I ended up with hockey pucks.  I made these tonight, and even with baking powder that expired 3 days ago, they rose and baked to perfection.  My husband literally put his fork down and got out of his seat to kiss me and say "whatever you did to make these biscuits, keep on doing it".   FYI: I did not make any changes to the recipe (I don't believe in rating a recipe that was "tweaked".)

Thanks JP, these biscuits came out great ! My kids love them, I could only just eat one grand biscuits because of the size. I can't wait to make more of these biscuits. If you follow the directions your biscuits will come out good, I used butter flavored crisco and a tiny bit more sugar. Excellent !

Tasted good but the recipe should be modified to address the appearance. The biscuits were only lightly browned when made as directed.

Thick and fluffy but taste like baking powder. I tried Grandma's Baking Powder Biscuits, which have a much better flavor (no baking powder taste and a bit sweet) and don't require all the kneading and rolling that these do.

I search high and low for different Biscuit recipes & I thought I would give J.P.'s a shot, I am glad I did! Great recipe, I tweak just about every recipe I see from anywhere & this one was no exception. I replaced the Milk with Buttermilk & used Butter in place of the shortening. Other than that I stuck to the recipe, which made eight nice big & fat, thick bisquits. Brushed the top with melted Butter and baked them for around 18 mins. at 425 deg. F. They were perfect, flaky & tall as you ever seen in a Bisquit. My whole family loved 'em! This recipe just moved to the front of the pack for our go to Bisquits. Thanks for sharing!

I used lard instead of shortening and had to add about 1/2 cup extra flour.  However, these biscuits are phenomenal. Can hardly wait to experiment with adding cheese, herbs, beer, etc.  Delish!!!

Near the end brushed with melted butter and it was great!  I needed to knead the dough more because the dough was sticky, but they still turned out flaky.

These turned out perfectly light, fluffy, and tall!  The whole family loved them.  Other recipes I've tried for baking power biscuits have always turned out just ok- not very fluffy but not too flat.  I was so pleased with how this recipe turned out- not so much shortening that we felt sick after eating, but definitely enough to make a great biscuit.  I made the recipe exactly as listed.  We'll definitely be making these again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, J.P.

I have to say this recipe does not disappoint.  I made exactly as the recipe states and they were wonderful the first time I made them.  I have been using another recipe for years and I thought it was tops until I came across this one.  What made me try it was I liked the fact it only made 6 biscuits and not have a bunch left over.  This is now my new biscuit recipe.  Thank you so much for submitting it.
Our family loves them!

OMG these are perfect! I used vegetable oil and substituted white for light yellow sugar (that is the only one I had) - since it is less sweet than white I added about 1 tbsp more. I also substituted milk for buttermilk, and since it was non fat I added an extra splash of oil. I spread some egg yolk on them for pretty glossy top. The dough was soft and very easy to roll and handle. I made them in 5 min and they were ready in 15. My grandma would be proud. Super delicious!

I always use white lilies recipe and this was even better! I used butter instead of shortening 5TBS to be exact and reduced the baking powder to 2tsp and used buttermilk in place of regular milk! I now have my go to! **Also you can make this dinner friendly by adding chopped chives and garlic with cheddar cheese when you add the butter but before the milk!

My new favorite "go to" biscuit recipe. I follow the recipe as written with the exception of using butter in place of shortening. Sometimes I cut the biscuits a little thinner and it makes double the number. Excellent.

Love this recipe as is, though to make it oversized, we add extra milk so we start with a very wet dough, then we knead the very wet dough on a heavily, heavily floured surface - dusting the top of the dough heavily, but working in only as much flour as is needed.  Really tender dough can result this way as well.  ALTER AT TIMES AS FOLLOWS:  1a)  half whole wheat (shorter rise, but a nice crispness sets in if it is allowed to brown fully - really yummy in a different way - I personally prefer biscuits this way, but not everyone will), 1b)  use raw sugar if using whole wheat, as there are more minerals which are really good for you.  and/or 2)  substitute a scant 1/3 C powdered milk, then use more than one cup, still turn out the very wet dough on a heavily floured surface.  It is harder for *us* to overwork the dough this way.  Whatever works for you, though.

Plain but good.  Followed the directions exactly except that I refrigerated the dough a few hours.  I mixed the dough and left it in the bowl, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator until just about dinner time.  It cooked fine and I'll be making it again.  These go just as good with jelly as with dinner.

I tried this recipe along with many other biscuit recipes this one was the best but I felt it still lacked flavor. I tweaked this recipe many times and am very happy with the final result. Sub: 2 1/2 tsp baking powder & 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp sugar, 5 tbs salted butter (melted/softened), 1/2 c milk & 1/2 c buttermilk. The mix will be really gooey, use 1/4 c flour to flour surface before kneading. I hope you love my changes.

Perfect biscuits! I used butter instead of shortening and there was no problem. I also just formed each one in my hand, rather than rolling out and cutting. Way easier.

Awesome and pretty easy. I tried substituting flax seed for some of the shortening (4 Tbs flax and 4 Tbs shortening instead of 1/3c shortening) and it worked out. Might try to swap more, but not sure how far that will work.

Had to give 4 as I haven't tried it yet but have been looking for this type of recipe.  Like the idea of no fat half and half.  As for Robert in California - he hasn't lived until you have biscuits and gravy = very popular in the south - love to get it when we go on vacation.

Good biscuits, but a little too much trouble for what they are.  I used butter instead of shortening, still not the greatest I've had.  Worthy of a solid 4 stars.

Isn't it funny that all around the world things are called different names. 
In Australia - these are called Scones and are best eaten with strawberry jam and whipped cream. 

Or an alternative would be to boil some pumpkin and mash it through to make Pumpkin Scones.

I had never made biscuits before.  I did take other readers advice and use butter in lieu of shortening, 3/4 tablespoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1 cup.  The dough did seem very wet and the biscuits did not have the nice shape I would have liked.  They did however turn out okay and I used them to make my son sausage egg biscuits for breakfast.  He said they were good and seemed pleased.

I made these on the spur of the moment when I realized that I didn't have a carb to go with a vege main dish.  I only needed 2/3 c. milk.  I put it all in a ball and patted it down too much.  I had about 3/4" and used a regular glass to cut them out.  Only got 5 biscuits, which was more than I needed.  Heated one up with butter this AM.  It was OK.  I think the toppings are what make this biscuit great.  By itself, it was fine, but nothing to rave about.

I had tried another biscuit recipe on here, and wasn't thrilled. I didn't have many ingredients on hand, but I did have what this recipe called for!! They came out PERFECT!! I used margarine instead of shortening (I didn't have shortening) and I didn't roll it out, I just dropped them on the cookie sheet. They went perfect with my sausage gravy!!!!

Really good biscuits, super easy and I will definitely make these again. Like most recipes, I made substitutions based on what I had on hand.  Used whole wheat flour and butter. The biscuits were delish but not as high as they could have been, I am sure. I  will definitely try with white flour next time I have it on hand.

Best biscuits ever! I did modify the 1 tbsp baking powder to 3/4 and added 1/4 baking soda, and butter instead of shortening (because I don't use shortening). Man alive these were devoured! I got 8 big biscuits out of the batch and they turned out nice and light and flakey. The key is to *just* mix them and barely knead them. 

LOVE IT!

Wow!  Excellent!!!!! And easy too.  Can't get much better than that.  Didn't need to use the whole cup of milk, perhaps because I use a kitchen scale to weigh the exact amount of flour (160 grams), other than that the directions and ingredients were perfect!  And such light, fluffy, tall, perfectly browned biscuits.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I used the 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 reg flour... the buttermilk powder and butter instead of shortening. I also used the food processor - and when I turned the dough onto the counter - I only pressed it into a thickness to use my cutter. BEST EVER - such flavor...! Thanks to everyone who leaves suggestions!!

Excellent Biscuits.  EASY. I read many of the reviews and followed some of the advice as this was the first time at trying biscuits in years.  My biscuits years ago favored "Elle Mae's"  I did not knead the dough as the recipe called for, only patted and cut.  Otherwise followed recipe and all turned out well. THANKS JP

I made two variations of this recipe - the first in which I just placed the dough on top of a slow cooker chicken pot pie and let it cook for several hours, and the second in which I cut circles in the dough, placed them on a tray and baked them in the oven. The first time I made the mixture it was a bit too runny so I made a second batch with slightly less milk. Either way, the pot pie biscuit mix and the biscuits made in the oven had an entirely different texture! The first was very doughy and almost like bread and the second batch was definitely British scones. We'll be using this again but I'm not sure what changed the texture or what I can do to make the bread-ish consistency again. This made perfect scones, but I'll be searching for a slightly different recipe as I'm certain that American biscuits are meant to taste a little bit different from scones, right? I've heard of cornstarch or maize being used so I'll have to experiment. Still, worked great both times but not sure why they turned out so different!

these are really good but if you put in all the milk it calls for, you end up with drop biscuits. Those are still good, for rolled biscuits, use 3/4 cup milk.

Excellent. I prefer to use butter and they were crisp and buttery on the outside and tender on the inside.  Shortening is less flavorful, but yields a slightly better texture in my opinion.

I've made these biscuits at least 5-6 times with no changes to the recipe and they are FANTASTIC! I also made them changing the milk to buttermilk just because I had it on hand, and they were just as good. Moist, high and absolutely delicious! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!

Holy man!!! These little things are delish! I just made them for the first time and fiance and I loved them! I halved the recipe, since it's just the two of us.  When I finished kneading the dough I actually had it about 1/2 inch and baked them for 9 minutes... perfect!

These are absolutely incredible!  Soft and delicious.  By accident we managed to create the 'split' that appears in the middle of Pillsbury Grand Biscuits when we patted the dough out to only 1/2".  We realized our error so folded the dough over and patted it gently.  The biscuits came out with that split.  Anyway, a winner!!

I will be using this recipe as my biscuit recipe from now on.  I followed advice of another review and mixed 4 T buttermilk powder into the dry ingredients and then added water instead of milk--just enough to form the dough.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!  It was my first time making these biscut and they were awsome.  They rose soo high I should have taken a picture.  Even more so, the family LOVED them.  I dont have a food processor, so I mixed these in a bowl as in the directions.  I cut the buttter up before hand and then put it in the freezer to get real cold.  After I mixed the butter in with the flour, I actually put the mix in the freezer again for about 7 minutes and then kneaded it, and rolled the biscuts  as directed.  These turned out wonderfully.  I have a new go to recipe!

My #1 go to biscuit recipe, flaky and soft and tasty! I add half butter, and half shortening, butter for flavor and shortening for texture, just make sure whatever fat you use is ice cold, i put it in the freezer for 10-15 mins. I also add a TBSP of fresh thyme and a cup of sharp cheddar cheese, reduce salt to 3/4 tsp if using cheese :) Chives also work well in this recipe. I put the flour, sugar, salt, BP and the cheese+thyme uf using in my food processor, pulse 3 times, then add the butter and pulse 7 times, then add the shortening and pulse 5 times, then i switch to the plastic blade and mix on low while adding the cold milk slowly untill the dough comes together (I rarely use the entire cup of milk, it depends on the humidity and brand of flour that you use). I then cut into 6 rounds and let it rest in the fridge for an hour or so, then I brush with eggwash and bake in a preheated 350 F oven untill golden brown ( 15 mins or so)...to die for! Absoloutly heavenly! Thanks a bunch JP :)

Rose nice and pretty.  They were crumbly and a tad dry.  Tasted ok and better than some recipes we have tried.  But these are not for our family.

Adding a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to the milk a few minutes before mixing it in makes these "buttermilk" biscuits. We make these for breakfast at least once a week. :) I'll never buy the ones in a can again!

My first attempt was a screaming success!  Only changed regular milk to buttermilk and the biscuits were absolutely great.
All I can say is the less you work the dough the better.

Just pulled them out of the oven...getting ready to gobble some up with my homemade sausage gravy.  They're pretty but not as tall as I would have liked.  I used butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of regular milk.

i was looking for a recipe that had less butter than my  go-to biscuit recipe, and ended up being so disappointed with this "big daddy" biscuit recipe. i know biscuits- i barely kneaded the dough, i cut in cold butter. I used butter instead of shortening for flavor. These were so bland, still! They didn't rise very much, i had to cook these almost 20 minutes, and they fell apart when i got them out of the pan. Has anyone reviewing this recipe ever made biscuits before????

I made these on the fly and was dissapointed. I followed the recipe exactly and they did not rise like I expected them to. When I pulled them out out of the oven, they where harder than I would have liked them to be. These where not even tasty. My daughter who usually loves buscuits did not even want to eat it. She took one bite and didnt touch it again. Seems like it worked for everyonese else.

i made these for breakfast and LOVED them, the boyfriend commented multi times how great they were!  even with my modifications THESE WERE PERFECT...i used half wheat flour / half white flour; i used almond milk instead of cows milk and butter instead of shortening!  you can modify a recipe and still have great results!  this recipe is a keeper for us!

o my lord. these came out brown, dull & hard!
i followed the recipe to a T EXCEPT i added 1/2 tsp of baking soda & i used 1/4 cup of buttermilk & 2/3 cup of non fat milk.
i also used butter in stead of shortening.
i did, however, have the oven to 350.
& therefore left these in the oven for 15+ mins.
is that where i went wrong?

Good recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening and did not need the dough.  I also needed the full amount of milk but next time I may not.  I would suggest first pouring half the amount of milk into the flour mixture and then add more as needed.  After cutting out the biscuits, I placed them in the fridge for 25 minutes.  In addition to this, I brushed butter on each of the biscuits after 7 minutes of baking.  I then put the biscuits back in the over and baked for 5 more minutes.  The biscuits cooked for a total of 12 minutes.

I only had half-and-half at hand so I used that and cream soda (I use fruit juice when making scones and they tend to taste better than just plain milk, but I didn't have any at hand) in lieu of milk.  They came out moist with an incredibly flaky texture, so this is definitely my go-to biscuit recipe from now on.

I have gone through countless biscuit recipes and can never seem to find one that I like.  This one is AMAZING.  So fluffy!  The inside is soft and moist and the outside has a subtle crunch to it.  I used 1/2 cup of dehydrated milk and 1/2 cup 1% milk (all we had in the house.) which required just a LITTLE more flour while kneading.  Other than that, I did the recipe as written.  We loved them and this will be the biscuit recipe I use from now on.  And they're so easy!

Thank you for a great biscuit recipe! I made them exactly from the recipe and they turned out great. I also tried them with butter instead of shortening and they were still good. I love reading the reviews and getting helpful hints to try, but I don't like when someone re-writes the recipe. If you feel you have a better recipe, great. Submit it so we can try it. I love these biscuits!

These are now my go to biscuits. They're big and fluffy, not dry or hard like the product of so many other biscuit recipes that I've tried. I only had to use 3/4 of a cup of milk and I didn't knead the dough too much. As another reviewer suggested, I applied a thin layer of butter before and after baking. The biscuits were delicious. I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe is excellent, and it is similar to one I've used for years.  The addition of the sugar gives a nice taste to it.  Not hard to make, and very easy to eat.  Thanks.

I did not have any shortening, so instead I used butter. I liked how simple it was to make and the biscuits turned out to be nice sized. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was that the outer part (especially the bottom) ended up being a little crunchy. Overall they still tasted good. I would definitely make them again.

I just made these biscuits and they were a big hit.  I did a little light kneading of the dough (about 15 times) and the texture was still tender without being crumbly.  The texture was a bit of a cross between a biscuit and a roll.

I read a bunch of the popular reviews and went with what they said.

My changes: used butter instead of shortening, made the dough in the food processor, and lightly rolled/kneaded it with a bunch more flour (since the dough was quite sticky).

I got 10 biscuits and they're delicious!  I'll be using this recipe from now on, it's so easy and quick!

Being a southern-born woman, biscuits are a big thing to learn how to make as a kid.  I never did learn how to make good biscuits.  They always turned into rocks or had so much butter or shortening that they melted all over the pan.  This recipe is the best I have ever come across for both the ease and resulting biscuit.  My husband and I use this for our Saturday/Sunday biscuit and gravy breakfasts.  I make the biscuits and he makes the gravy from scratch.  We have always gotten rave reviews on them from our family.  So if J.P. has any other tasty and easy ideas for food, I think I will have to check them out, because so far so delicious!!

Very good and easy biscuits! My children love them! Sometimes I will use buttermilk instead, and sometimes I will add apples and cinnamon or chocolate chips or cheese and chili powder! Be creative!!!

Excellent recipe - only issue was they were still gummy @ 15 min, so put them back in for 3-4 mins longer - little darker than I wanted, but excellent all the same.

I think these biscuits are very good. My son took them to work with him and they went over good. They were big and fluffy, probably the best biscuits I have made so far. They were very tasty. Just don't  handle the dough too much . Thanks so much for this recipe its a keeper.

Great recipe! Like other reviewers, I didn't end up using any of the water but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I didn't want huge biscuits, so I made them normal size and then baked them for about 12 minutes. Perfect and delicious! Be sure to not overwork the dough when you add the milk and they will be light and fluffy!

These were the worst thing ever produced out of my oven. They were more like hard clay hockey pucks. Followed directions exactly, didn't over work the dough, still came out pale and hard as a rock on the outside and doughy on inside. Will never make again.

The best biscuit recipe. These were so moist and fluffy. They were really delicious. I didn't add salt or baking soda. I dusted them with butter when they were done. A big hit.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only change I made was that I used butter instead of shortening ( I didn't have any shortening). I put the dry ingredients and butter in the food processor and let it blend on low for a minute. I took that mixture and put it in a bowl. I added 2/3 cup of milk and pulled the dough together by hand. I chilled the dough while I made most of the rest of the meal then flattened the dough gently with my hands. I used a biscuit cookie cutter to form dough. I baked the biscuits at 400 degrees for approximately 10 minutes (my gas oven cooks hot and fast). These were wonderful with the goulash and would be very good for breakfast with jam. THANKS!

LOVE this recipe. I've found the recipe "as is" provides a dough that is way to wet. For me, 2/3 cup of milk is perfect. Otherwise, the only change I made was to melt about 1 tablespoon of butter and brush the melted butter over the tops of the biscuits the last minute of baking. Super yummy!!!

I don't usually make biscuits from scratch but I was craving biscuits and gravy this morning and didn't feel like going out to get some frozen biscuits.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and used my small food processor.  I also substituted buttermilk for the milk because I happened to have some.

I cut the recipe in half since it was just me this morning.  

Very nice biscuits!  Served with homemade sausage gravy.

WOW.... these did get huge... I was incredibly impressed.... the only thing I might try differently next time is using butter instead of shortening... otherwise superb... just be sure not to over mix or kneed... only use as much milk as you need... and you can make the dough ahead of time and refridgerate... they were a fairly light and fluffy biscuit... very good
update- I made again using butter in place of shortening and they turned out a little more dense but with a better flavor I think very good under gravy

These biscuits are the best.  I have made several different biscuit recipes that all turned out dry and unflavorful.  These rose nicely, and were very moist and flaky.  Definetly adding these to my list of go to recipes.

Makes a GREAT VEGAN BISCUIT! I made these with Earth Balance instead of shortening, and regular soy milk instead of milk. Mine always take a bit longer to bake (almost 20 minutes), but they're always worth it. Great plain with Earth Balance or with some preserves. 

For a hearty meal, throw some Smart Ground sausage (cut and flattened into patties) on a pan with a little canola oil over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, place on biscuit, and add some Daiya (vegan cheese) for an awesome vegan breakfast you didn't think was possible.

For some reason homemade biscuits intimidated me, but not after I found this recipe. These are so easy, and well worth getting the rolling pin out. They really are huge, and have a great flavor and texture. Don't tweak this recipe they are perfect as written.

Great recipe!  Easy also!

I made these again. This time I used liquid oil (canola) and just stirred and plopped them down like drop buscuits. Wonderful and much easier than rolling out.

These were very good, but I found them lacking just one item.  I went back and checked some other recipes and found that it was missing a 1/2 tsp of Cream of Tartar.  I made them again with that and oh-boy!  Melt in your mouth restaurant quality.

We love beef stew and biscuits and biscuits and gravy.  We hate instant biscuits, but didn't think we had time to make homemade, until now!  The first night I double the recipe and made them exactly as written.  Perfect!  Beautiful fluffy biscuits!  Tonight, I apparently didn't have shortening, so I used lard and butter to equal the shortening amounts and guess what?  Perfect!  This is a fantastic staple recipe that is easy, quick and tastes super no matter what you do!  Thanks for saving us!

These were fabulous. I made them exactly like the recipe, except that as did others, I didn't kneed the dough. It also didn't need quite the entire cup of milk. This was my first time making biscuits, and we were very happy with the results! They even tasted great reheated this morning!

My family loved this recipe.  They continued to go back for more biscuits after the first serving.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used butter instead of shortening and mixed every thing up in the food processor for a super fast processing.  They came out very fluffy and golden brown.  Will definitely make them again; I tip, DO NOT knead them too much OR add too much flour when kneading as this can make the biscuits a little hard.

I am eating these, freshly made, as I type this.  I had no clue if I was doing things right.  Having read quite a few reviews, I put in 3-3.5 teaspoons of baking powder and I tried not to knead the dough but it seemed unavoidable (I tried to limit it as much as possible).  It was really sticky and I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not so I wrapped it in foil and popped it into the refridgerator for about 30 minutes - baked them at about 350 degrees for 15 minutes and they are great - soft, fluffy (though not particularly huge), and they taste great.  Will def try 'seasoning' them next time!

Biscuits are a staple food in our family, and this recipe is our favorite. I will say that i always double the recipe and never use all the milk, and always use real butter.  They are some big fluffy biscuits.

Best biscuits ever!  At 75 years of age and 55 years of cooking, I never made a biscuit worth eating (I have only tried 5 or so times).  This biscuit recipe has made my day.  I only changed one thing: lard instead of shortening.  My Grandma, who made biscuits everyday, always used lard.  I won't eat biscuits every day but my Sunday brunch will always include "Big Daddy Biscuits".

I made these using half white flour & half wheat flour, no sugar and used Spectrum shortening. I used my food processor. I pulsed all dry ingredients first. Cut in the shortening, pulsed. I then drizzled in the milk while pulsing. Kneaded just a few times on a floured cutting board. These turned out great. Next time I think I will brush with butter before baking though.

I don't really understand all of the rave reviews.  These tasted VERY baking soda-y.  I think it would be a good recipe if the baking soda was cut in half.

Unimpressed with these biscuits... came out rather dry even at 13 mins and they were not fluffy...  Maybe its because I used butter instead of shortening I don't know.

WOW!  I am a novice at biscuits.  I did everything exactly, but I used half whole wheat and I used butter. (I never use shortening for anything).  These were awesome! First try!

I tried to make this twice. The first time it was as is and they were very good, but a little on the dry side. Second time, I made it with half and half coffee cream, and they turned out amazing. They are comparable to the ones from Popeye's (and I love those). Will make these again next week when my boyfriend's parents come for dinner.

Love, love, love this recipe. When I first starting making these biscuits I decided to substitute shorting for butter. Well, one day I ran out of butter and only had shorting. Decided to make the biscuits like the recipe says, and boy was I missing out. Using the shorting was SOOO much better! I'm so mad I waited this long to try it out. The biscuits were light, fluffy, with a little crunch on top (I did drop biscuits) This will forever be a winner in my recipe book.

I really need to work on my biscuit making skills. It’s something that I have wanted to master for some time. These were a good place to start and certainly easy enough to whip together for a novice. My batch came out as expected, better than canned but not quite grandma good.  I used butter flavored shortening but will try butter next time just to compare the differences. Family liked them with the sausage corn chowder from this site…Thanks J.P.

This is a great basic recipe. Just watch out when it says knead 15-20 times, that is way too much and you will end up with bricks.

Extremely sticky as written.  I added more flour, and the texture turned out pretty well, but it tasted strongly of baking powder.  There's a better one out there somewhere.

This recipe delivers exactly what it says it will. This was my first attempt at biscuits from scratch. It was so easy and the biscuits were so delish, that I'll never make biscuits from a can again!

OMG! Amazing!  My husband takes tremendous pride in his biscuts, and my daughter had these and told him (completely unprompted!) that he has to use this recipe from now on. lol. I was unable to follow the recipe exactly because I was out of shortening (I hate it when someone uses stuff up and doesn't tell me!!!) and I had to sub margarine. Since I used margarine, I omitted the salt. I also slowly added the milk as suggested by reviews and only ended up using about 3/4 of what the recipe said. I also decreased the baking soda as suggested by reviewers to 2.5 tsp.  Having said all that, can't WAIT to make them with the shortening, they must be truly amazing made correctly!**Have made these A LOT in the past month!  They are even better with the shortening, and also with butter flavored shortening! Have had a bunch of people ask for the recipe...have noticed that the amount of milk does affect how they turn out..also how much they are handled does as well so handle them as little as possible, and use less milk than called for. Still love these!

Good enough flavour, but nothing special. They stuck to the pan even though the recipe told me UNgreased!

These are what you call weight gains, because if you eat enough of these grand lip smacking biscuits...you are sure to put on a lb. or two. I tried many on this site and now I can finally stop looking.  Whoo! Hoo! The only changes I made was used buttermilk instead of reg. milk (didn't have any) sub cold butter for the shortening, and right before I place them in to bake...I brushed melted butter on tops and the sides.  I baked on the middle rack for 15 min. then and additional 5 min on the top rack to brown evenly.  I took them out and brush the remaining melted butter on tops and sides.  Yummy, yum, yum!  I am going to try this once again but prepare the dough the night before to see if it indeed rises a little higher.  I will post the results once again.  Oh! One more thing...I got exactly 6 biscuits and 1 little scraped dough, this recipe is to the tee if you have a large mouth coffee cup like I did. 3/12 inch opening.

Excellant and so easy to make.   I didn't knead the dough, just put spoonfuls into bun tins and they turned out perfectly.  I am considered a bit of a disaster in the kitchen but everyone loves these.

These biscuits were very tasty.  I made similar changes according to some of the reviews:  buttermilk instead of milk and 2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  Although I tried to limit the "handling" of the biscuits, they didn't come out as fluffy as I would have liked.  I always use organic whole wheat pastry flour when I bake, so perhaps next time I'll sift the flour to add a little more air.  Still, a GREAT recipe and one that I will continue to use!

Want to add a nice kick to these biscuits?  Add 1 Tablespoon white vinegar to the milk and let it sit for a few minutes before adding to the flour.  Now you will have buttermilk biscuits!  If possible, use BUTTER instead of shortening!  It's the lesser of the two evils!

My first time making biscuits from scratch.  Didnt turn out well, but im sure it was my fault.  They were hard and heavy.  Maybe I over mixed them.  I will try again one day.  Hopefully i will come back with a better review.

I have made these several times and am just now rating it. Wonderfully light and reminds me of the ones my grandma use to whip up without measuring out of her twin pines tin. She would make a well in the flour and cut in the lard with her fingers and add the other ingredients then break them off and roll and put in the pan, just before baking she smeared bacon grease on top of them....Oh sorry kinda lost myself for a moment.:-)

I made smaller biscuits so we could have enough with dinner, next time I'll double or triple the recipe and make them bigger. My hubby went crazy over them! Easy to make, definitely a keeper.

Good texture--perhaps not as flakey as I would like, but that was probably my fault with the butter. BUT NOT MY FAULT: tasted too much like baking powder.

Delicious!! I wasn't able to get mine to rise as much as I would have liked (I think that was my error in rolling them to thin or something-not the recipe itself), but the dough was very soft and easy to work with and the biscuits were very fluffy. :-D

These were amazing and redeemed my biscuit making skills! I did have a biscuit debacle some years ago which has kept me from making biscuits for some time. Tip: When rolling out, fold the dough over and over again and when it cooks it's like the flaky biscuits with the different layers! So good.

The biscuits definitely fluffed up big and tall.  I had a bit of trouble gauging the right amount of milk to use.  As the blurb describing the recipe says, it might take a few batches to get perfect results.  Going forward, I'll probably use the recipe to make more, smaller biscuits.  Even though I used a light-colored baking sheet, the bottoms burned slightly while the inside was still a touch undercooked.  And that's using after having made 8 biscuits instead of six.  I plan to aim for 12 biscuits next time, probably by aiming for thinner biscuits rather than smaller ones.

I love them!   Gave this recipe 5 stars.  I did follow the advice of "patting dough" rather than kneading it.  As to the cook who said they were "tasteless" I suggest using the full amount of the salt recommended and substitute butter for the shortening.  Very flavorful and oh, so fluffy!  Thank you for sharing J.P.!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!! These are the best ever. I have tried so many recipes and these are the winner! I made 16 servings and I put in 2 1/3 cups milk instead of the 2 2/3 c. I will keep this forever.

My family didn't think these were tasty at all. The only change I made was using butter instead of shortening since I don't cook with shortening. I don't think that made that big of a difference since others used butter also. Basically they were bland & tasteless unless we added a lot of butter.

I have to admit I was always intimidated to make biscuits, but I'm glad I did. I did use butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any and I don't like shortening. Super yummy! I did notice that kneading it only a couple times was enough and it was starting to look a little tough, so I think 15 or more times would be way too much.

These are nice and fluffy and were really really easy to make!  I made them in the food processor and it worked great.  Didn't use the whole cup of milk, used butter instead of shortening.  I also let them rest in the fridge.

I love these biscuits they are simple and delicious, I did make 2 changes. I use sea salt and buttermilk instead of regular salt and regular milk.

While this recipe makes AMAZING biscuits, my absolute favorite thing to use it for is the dumplings in any chicken/vegetable and dumpling recipe. Instead of using any boxed mix or the canned biscuits, I highly recommend whipping up a batch of this batter and dropping them as dumplings. They are utter perfection. Fluffy and light, yet stick to your ribs comfort food and incredibly satisfying. This has made *everyone* I've made it for's mouth water and they all come back for seconds, even though they're full!

Nice sturdy biscuit to go with homemade gravy. Everyone liked them so much that I made a double batch and used them for a meal the next day.

I have finally found KFC biscuits!  I actually double this recipe and make my biscuits quite big and thick.  I dust the extra flour off before baking.  These are amazing!!!!!!!!

Great recipe. I made two changes: 1. butter instead of shortening, and 2. used one cup of all purpose and one cup of whole wheat flour. Just a note re: using butter - if the butter is salted, cut back additional salt to 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon from the full teaspoon.

These turned out really tasty! I'll definitely make them again, though I might use just half the sugar next time. Also, in my oven they only needed about 10 minutes, so keep a close eye on them as they are baking.

If I could give these more stars I would.  Basic, no frills, excellent biscuit recipe.  I've made them several times now, each time they come out perfectly, and store nicely.  I think with a bit more sugar they would be perfect for shortcakes as well! UPDATE: This is still my go to biscuit recipe, it has yet to yeild less than scrumptious results.  I did, however, forget to mention in my initial review that I usually have to add in a bit more flour than is called for in order to be able to work with them, I think 2 cups leaves the dough a bit too wet for me (I usually start with 2 1/4 cups then add as I knead).  I've also rolled the dough out into a large rectangle and spread ground sausage (uncooked) over the top, then rolled and sliced before baking for sausage pinwheels and they turn out delicious too!  Just lower the temp a bit and extend the baking time to account for the meat.  Once again, FABULOUS RECIPE.

These do cook up big, I will give him that, but I find they don't have much buttery flavor and are not very flaky.  I find I have to cut back on the milk as these get too sticky and need too much flour in the kneading process to get the right consistency.  But overall, they are okay and easy to make which is nice in a pinch.

Very good!! Definitely the best luck I've had so far with homemade "Southern" biscuits. I used butter instead of shortening as well, and meant to try buttermilk like another reviewer suggested but forgot. I also made them the night before I cooked them. I cooked at 400 degrees because 425 seemed asking for burnt bottoms in my oven. I can't say that they are the biggest biscuits in the world, but they were good. Mine didn't rise as high as the ones pictured. I also doubled the recipe successfully.

I have never made biscuits before and these turned out perfectly for me following the recipe just as written.  I have a way of messing up even the easiest recipe when it comes to baking- so it's quite amazing that these turned out so well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

10/21/10 - I think I've got this recipe to work for us.  Although still a very, very, very sticky dough which I drop from a muffin scoop, the rise and taste is better.  I double the recipe except to use 2 1/2 T. baking powder, 11 T. stick margarine and 1 1/2 cups milk.  Yield 21 biscuits.  12/27/09 - 3 stars - I used stick margarine rather than shortening and less than 3/4 c. fat free milk.  Rather than roll & cut, I used a muffin scoop to make 8 1/2 drop biscuits.  DH said they tasted like Bisquick biscuits, too moist and rated it a 2.  DS loved them and rated them a 5.  I thought the salt taste came through (I used Kosher salt) and they were crumbly.

These biscuits are GREAT! There are fluffy and melt in your mouth good. Things to remember: do not knead the dough and overmix. I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of baking powder to make them rise a little more and I baked these at 375* so it all bakes nice and steady. I used butter and shortening together but just butter is good too. I also let them rise covered up for 30 minutes to make them taller but that's only if you have time. These were great, this is my new biscuit recipe for life =D

I made these to serve with a homemade Minestrone soup.  I have always used my Grandmother's tea bisuit recipe (wonderful fluffy and a family tradition), but thought I'd try these.  I probably will never make my Grandmother's bisuits again - these were fantastic.  Huge, light and fluffy.  My husband liked them so well, he asked me to make for breakfast the next day.  Comment on one review.  They do need to be kneaded!  Please do not skip this part.  It only takes moments and make a difference and make sure you do use your pastry cutter to make the mixture a fine "crumble" before adding milk.

These biscuits came out light and as tall as the picture, with a great crumb. So far this is the best recipe I've found here for biscuits,so many others were disappointments. I used half butter and half shortening. I had to use a bit more flour when folding but the results were still fantastic. I'll use this as my go to recipe when I need biscuits from now on. They heated well the next day in the microwave and were moist as the day I made them.

VERY good! We used butter instead of the shortening. I do recommend brushing them with melted salted butter right after taking them out of the oven, and maybe just before baking, too.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for several years now and decided to make it tonight when I needed a bread to go with our roasted turkey legs and carrots.  I substituted butter for the shortening and accidentally added a little too much milk.  I was afraid I would overwork the dough if I added more flour, so I just greased my hands and formed them into circles, then baked them in a round cake pan.  No kneading.  I brushed them with butter before and after baking them.  The result?  My fiance took one bite and said they were the best biscuits he'd ever had.  I'm giving up Alton Brown's recipe and will be using this one from now on!  They're tender, flavorful, tall, everything you could want in a biscuit.

Fantastic! I use the butter flavor shortening and a little less milk.

These were great! I made them two days in a row! Only change, I used buttermilk instead of the milk because I had a ton that I needed to use up. They were delicious and versatile enough to have for breakfast, or with dinner, as we did! Thanks!

Just okay for me. For biscuits that don't require yeast these were okay. Made good quick breakfast biscuits to serve with syrup. The absolute biggest plus in this recipe was that it was EASY to make with common ingredients found around the house.

Excellent - followed Discobunny's recommendation on the baking powder/baking soda trade-off & buttermilk substitution, and didnt knead the dough. Definitely the best biscuits i've ever made.

These biscuits came out better than any other that I have made.  My family doesn't like dense biscuits and these were a hit.  I may try to alter the recipe for scones for them.  I made them in the food processor and refrigerated over night. Thank you

Very, very wonderful biscuits. They always come out perfectly layered and textured. The first time around I used unsalted butter, they were really tasty, but they were somewhat bitter. The second time around I used salted butter and forgot the sugar (!) but the lack of sugar didn't seem to make too much of a difference. Salted butter makes them much more savory.

The flavor and texture of these biscuits is perfect! I did use butter instead of shortening but that was a personal preference. I was a little disappointed that I did not get the rise I was hoping for but I will blame that on my baking powder. I will definitely make these again in the future as they were quick and easy to prepare. They are perfect served with butter and jam.

I LOVED this! I may keep trying out a few new biscuit recipes just because I love to keep trying new things - but I know this will be a "go to" when we have biscuits and gravy on the weekends. I followed the recipe verbatim and loved the results! Very easy recipe to follow, and the biscuits had a nice golden brown crust for a little crunch and layers of soft fluffiness inside... perfection with some butter and good jam! Thanks! (My son said "5 stars mom"!!)

My family really enjoyed these biscuits with our chicken dinner tonight. I used all whole wheat flower and the buscuits were not quite the right flavor. Next time I will add a little more sugar, since that's what I think was lacking. I gave a 5 star rating because I used whole wheat instead of all-purpose and I wasn't sure if that made any difference (usually doesn't for me).

I had to throw away my first batch of dough because it was way too sticky and wet.  I made it the second time and used 2 TBSP more flour and only 3/4 cup milk.  They turned out perfect!  They are very light and fluffy.

Best homemade biscuits I've ever made!  No more hockey pucks for us :o)  I used my food processor, pulsing the ingredients as little as possible.  I sliced butter flavored crisco & stuck it in the freezer while I prepared the dry ingred. & I used buttermilk instead of milk.  I didn't roll them out, just patted them lightly into the right thickness.  Be sure to make the dough nice & thick before you cut them.  They turned out soooo tender & very flavorful!  Thanks for the recipe!

These came out huge and fluffy for me and were a big hit. I read the review that said not to manipulate the dough too much after adding the milk and that is what I did- mixed just to combine and then went straight to kneading. Will definitely make again!

They were great! I cut the milk to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup because it was humid outside. They turned out fantastic. I served them staight out of a cast iron skillet and i put cinnamon and sugar butter on top. these were better than the bisquik ones!!

I made these with Bill's Sausage Gravy.  They went well with this recipe but a bit dry.  Next time I will make some tweaks to make them more moist.

Wonderful biscuits with a nice tender crumb.  These were easy to prepare.  My husband said they were great.  I served them with sausage gravy and biscuits but they are also good with butter and jam.

I made these this morning for biscuits and gravy.  They were awsome!  I did use butter instead of shortening.  I also brushed the tops with butter before cooking.  I was in search of the perfect biscuit recipe and now I have found it!

These were fantastic! It doesn't need quite all the milk, though. I followed the recipe exactly and had to add nearly half a cup more flour to even it out, but they were great and SUPER fluffy. I didn't think they had too much of a baking powder taste at all. I got 8 biscuits out of this recipe and they were still huge.

I made a few changes for my own personal taste...but otherwise this is THE BEST biscuit recipe I have found. Everyone I know asks for these over and over. I only added 1/2 tsp. sugar and I used salted butter instead of shortening. SO GOOD!!

These were okay but not the best. I've had better. I even reduced the amount of baking powder and I could still taste it. They are better warmed over the next day.

I loved the taste. Great recipe. I made some apricot jam and I needed a biscut to go with them. These were quick and easy. I followed the recipes exactly and made small ones, they puffed up just fine.

Finally a recipe for biscuits that works for me! I used a smaller biscuit cutter (ladies' luncheon) but the flavour and texture remained wonderful although they cooked in closer to 10 minutes.

These are the best biscuits I’ve ever made.  Two very important things to note, 1) I substituted butter for shortening, 2) MOST IMPORTANT… FREEZE the butter and grate it.  This will minimize handling the dough.  These biscuits come out so good it is hard to describe!

I have used this recipe many times exactly as is and it has always turned out well. It may be true they are s little denser than some biscuits but I like the texture. I now also use them as the dough base to add to Chicken and biscuits and I also sometimes fold in a half cup of cheddar and a chopped jalapeno for variety. great recipe.

I loved these biscuits! Just like from the can but better! I followed the recipe exact, and actually had to use a little bit more milk than called for. I rolled them up in foil and let them sit overnight in the fridge. In the morning all I had to do was cut them and bake them. I made 6 jumbo biscuits and they baked perfectly. I didn't know making biscuits from scratch was so easy! But my husband thought they were just ok, he asked if they had butter, because he wanted more of a buttermilk biscuit, so next time I might melt some butter on top the dough before baking for him.

It was of biscuit consistency, but it lacked a lot of flavor for me. Not what I was looking for. No one gave these a thumbs up. I have made better. I will continue with my search in hopes of finding the perfect biscuit.

I find that despite how these are very light and fluffy, they taste pretty much just like if you were to buy pillsbury biscuits from the store.

I used melted butter instead of shortening and I didn't need the entire amount of milk.  Even though I rolled it to 1/2 inch thickness, they came out so tall.  The dough is fun and easy to work with.  Very quick, easy, and clean recipe.

I made two batches - one shortening one butter and I have to say that there's something about the buttery biscuits that I really like. The texture was a bit flakier and the flavor was slightly more pronounced. Both biscuits crumbled a bit when cut....I wonder what can be done to make a more sturdy biscuit?

I think this recipe works. I'm not experienced enough for these to turn out well. Mine were a bit tough. But I will keep trying. I served them with butter and jelly. My suggestion is to use butter, they are a bit flavorless with shortening.

I made these during the midst of a huge snowstorm so they didn't really rise at all.  However, the flavor was great and I think when it is dry I will try again.  I took others advice and didn't roll out, just slightly pounded out to a 1 inch circle then cut out rounds.  I also used butter and not enough milk :(  They were a tad crumbly but I'm sure they will be excellent next time.

The absolute easiest, tastiest biscuits!  Good with stew, to make "sandwiches", to make strawberry shortcake...

We love this recipe.  The biscuits are everything we want in a biscuit- big (they raise high as they bake), soft (you can pull them appart), and delicious.  We have them with butter and honey, sausage gravy, or with strawberry shortcake.  My tips to having them turn out especially good is not to cut the shortening in too small, not to overmix the ingredients when adding in the wet, and not to add any more milk than needed.

So so yummy! I made some variations of this recipe (e.g. cheddar cheese biscuits and cinnamon sugar biscuits) and they were scrumptious. Recommendation: If you want that nice golden brown color on top, brush an egg wash on top.   Easy egg wash: Beat one egg with 1-2 tablespoons of water.

This recipe is fantastic! I subbed butter for shortening and powdered sugar for the white sugar. Definitely be sure to add the milk as needed, rather than all at once. If you have the time, it pays to let the dough refrigerate for as long as possible. These were very easy to make and delicious to eat! They're very versatile and have a great buttery flavor! I made them last Sunday for breakfast, and last night for dinner to go with a creamy chicken, carrot and pea sauce.

This is by far the best biscuit recipe I have found.  Very fluffy and light, great texture, great taste.  Anybody who would prefer Bisquick or Pillsbury biscuits obviously doesn't know the true value and goodness of a homemade biscuit.

Great Southern biscuits! The real secret to great southern style biscuits is to cook them in a cast iron skillet with shortening melted and brushed over the tops also. That's how grandma made them :) Yum!

I followed other user's advice to add buttermilk - while my husband liked them, I thought there was something funny about them.  I should have stuck to the recipe but I figured I'd give it a shot with some buttermilk since I never usually have it on hand - or maybe I screwed up the baking powder.  I'm not sure.. but I'm going to continue trying this recipe and post back.

This was my first time I was successful at making homemade biscuits! I LOVED this recipe! The biscuits came out perfectly browned and fluffy in the inside. I did add some buttermilk. It was about a 1/4 cup and then started using the milk till it was the perfect consistency! I loved these so much that I'll definitely start making these so often. And so easy too. Thank you J.P!!

great recipe and forgiving to modifications. you cant go wrong. i didnt have some of the ingredients so i had to use butter instead of shortening, soy milk instead of regular, and wheat flour instead of all purpose and they still turned out amazingly fluffy and delicious. i just baked some more this week with the exact ingredients, and loved them.

This recipes was fantastic. I added a whole can of creamed corn instead of the milk to make corn biscuits, and the dough was a little gooey because of the extra liquid but the biscuits came out Fantastic! I highly recommend this modification to anyone who wants to change it up a little.

Fluffiest biscuit I have had in a long long while.  I did make some changes though.  I had some buttermilk I needed to get rid of so I used that and I didn't have shortening so I used some unsalted butter.  Updated:  So I had an old stand mixer that I had had for a while.  You know, one of those 300 dollar Kitchenaid's.  I used it to cut the butter and mix the dry ingredients.  Poured the buttermilk and mixed by hand in the bowl.  I need the dough a few times just to get everything together and then just flatten by hand.  There is no need to use a rolling pin.  I make about 11 to 12 biscuits from this recipe depending on how thin I press it.  I take them to work everyday and warm them up for breakfast.

This recipe worked perfectly.  The biscuits were delicious.  In fact, I could only use one hand because I was holding my newborn baby the whole time.  It was that easy to make.  Would definitely make this again.

I have to say these are FABULOUS!  I had a huge potluck at my house and wanted to make homemade biscuits to go with the Beef stew I had made!  I looked & looked and finally found this one.  They came out perfectly!  I prefer "drop" biscuits, though, so I didn't roll or cut, just scooped, put on pan & cooked!  BIG HIT!!  THANK YOU!!!

Fantastic and simple biscuit recipe. You could add anything you wanted to this recipe, but it really doesn't need anything. I will make this again and again!!! It's also great that it doesn't call for anything out of the ordinary - most people have this stuff in their kitchens at all times.

I made these at a friend's house and had to use light stick margarine because they didn't have shortening or butter. I accidentally misread the oven temp in the directions. I am a decent cook but bad with pastry. Even with all of those handicaps, these came out fantastic. Try them! They are great.

This recipe is really good with good ol' classic sausage or hamburger gravy. Only thing to watch out for is that like muffins, this shouldn't be mixed (or kneaded) too much-- they won't turn out as nice texture-wise.

I used left over baking grease from my sausage & bacon instead of shortening. IT WAS SO GOOD! I made it for the first time when I had company over & they loved it so much they left with some of the biscuits & the recipe. This one is a keeper for sure.

These were great. I used butter in place of shortening. I thought the dough was a little gooey at first but sprinkled a little more flour in and they were perfect!

I will never use another biscuit recipe. I do prefer the taste of a butter biscuit than an shortening biscuit so I subbed that. Sometimes I don't have the right consistancy I will add a T of shortening. I like the results of the biscuts touching in the pan better than standing alone. Breakfast, dinner, or dessert these are fantastic.

These are AWESOME!!  Truly the best biscuits I have ever made, and SO easy, too!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Smart Balance 50/50 butter, and they were perfection.  Didn't change any of the measurements, and it even worked at the high altitude where I live!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic!  I baked them to go with homemade turkey soup last night.  Even though I doubled the recipe, between my boyfriend and our roommate, I only had two biscuits left this morning!  I will definitely be making these again!  A few notes: I used butter instead of shortening.  I didn't knead these at all.  I just mixed them until they came together and then patted them into a round.  I let the dough rest in the fridge for about 2 hours before I cut and baked the biscuits.  Thanks for sharing!!

So easy and so good! Mine didn't end up all that huge, but I'm fairly sure that was my fault. I did a little too much tinkering with the dough while patting out and cutting. I made the dough several hours before baking it... wrapped it in greased foil, refrigerated, then took out and let it set on the counter for about an hour. They baked up perfectly in 15 minutes. Fluffy, light, and great taste! I brushed the tops with melted butter when they came out of the oven to keep them soft. Thank you, I can't wait to make breakfast sandwiches with the leftover ones in the morning! :)

I don't know what went wrong! I followed the recipe exactly and even heeded others' advice. I brushed the tops with butter, handled the dough gently, added the milk gradually, and refrigerated the dough before baking. But the tops of the biscuits failed to brown. I had to cook the biscuits much longer than 15 minutes, and even then the centers still turned out dense and slightly raw. The flavor was excellent, but the texture was awful. The biscuits did not turn out light and fluffy with golden tops. I'm still searching for the perfect biscuit recipe.

They are good. THey'd be better if I knew what I was doing and made them right... The flavor was there, the texture was off, so I think it's just me and my lack of experience with bread making. Won't give up though! Will try this again. Still tasted great with butter and honey :)

Yummy!  I doubled the recipe and yielded about 14 large biscuits, although I made the dough only about 3/4" thick.  I stuck the whole cookie sheet in the fridge for about 3 hours before baking.   Because the pan and biscuits were cold, cooking time was a little longer ... about 18 minutes.  (Note: Refrigerate the shortening for an hour before mixing with the flour will make a flakier texture ... just like when making a pie crust!)

Wonderful, wonderful biscuits!  I used freshly ground soft wheat flour and chilled the dough for a little bit.  The biscuits baked up high and fluffy and were delicious!  This has just become my staple recipe.  Thank you!

These were delicious! I made them too thin and small, but I can tell how delicious they would be thicker and with gravy on them.  I ate mine with regular and pumpkin butter.  The sugar gives the biscuits some nice sweetness.  Good stuff and great advice on patting the milk in instead of kneading it.

I made the recipe as written except I subbed buttermilk for the regular milk because that is how my Mom always made her biscuits.  My problem with biscuits has always been the ratio of how much of everything I need to put in!   I thought the recipe had a good flavor and they did rise nicely so I gave the recipe a 4 star rating.  The actual biscuit was probably a 3 star, but, that is entirely my fault because I think I overworked the dough and they were a little tough. I'll just have to keep practicing!! UPDATE: 7/6/17 I decided to give these another try and this time had much better luck.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes before I rolled it out.  I don't know if that was it or the fact that I was very delicate in working the dough, but, the biscuits were much more tender than my previous attempt.

This recipe made six hefty, dense biscuits.  Because I live in Florida, where it's still quite humid, I didn't add nearly as much milk as needed.  I also didn't knead the dough too much, just to bring it all together.  Very tasty with honey!

Yum!  And easy!  And even works at higher altitude (5000 ft)!  These biscuits were very tall and fluffy.  I made them with skim milk and margarine instead of shortening with no problems.  I also just toss the dry ingredients in the kitchenaid, and on low, I add the margarine (cut into smaller pieces) and let the kitchenaid do the work.  Then I add the milk on low until combined, and presto, 5 minute TASTY biscuits.

I have been on this site for years and have made several different recipes. This is the first one I've cared to review. These biscuits are awesome...better than KFC!!! My only words of advice are follow the recipe, don't over mix and know how your oven works. My oven runs hot. It only takes about 10 minutes for them to get done. Family loves them.

Mmmmm, these are VERY yummy and VERY easy to make.  The puff up so much too!  I've made them a few times and they're always great.  This is now my staple biscuit recipe.  I always make them mini with cookie cutters.

These were easy and good. I did not knead the dough, and I brushed tops with butter before AND after baking. They weren't the flaky kind of biscuit, but they were excellent anyway.

These were good, but not amazing like I hoped.  Maybe I just didn't make them big enough so they weren't as soft.

Boy....all these great reviews.  I must be doing something terribly wrong.  I have made these biscuits at least 6 times and my husband keeps telling me to "find another recipe".  They are like "sinkers".....heavy and not moist in the least.  HELP!!!!

Easy to make...Mine didn't rise that big, but I think it's because I flattened the dough out too much (I got 9 biscuits instead of 6). Flavor is OK. I think I'll try another suggestion and use cutter shortening or even chilled margarine one day.

These are great tasting biscuits! I would suggest to anyone that is making them and want them to be big, they won't rise so much as with store bought, they add a bunch of addivties to theirs, these are "homemade" so when you "pat" not roll, them out make them the thickness you want, they will rise a tad but you will get the results you want! Make sure you mix this well to, so that way you don't end up with biscuits that fall apart. TY 4 sharing

Knead or not knead biscuits. Seems to me that there are two schools of thought.  Do both work?  I pat and fold 4 times, then roll and fold once.  After the biscuits are cut, the next batch made from the scraps gets extra handling and are just as good and tender, they may even rise better.  The advocates of kneading  agree.

Okay, I've been making these for awhile and my family loves them.  But we had a little dilemma yesterday when the kids wanted cinnamon rolls and hubby wanted biscuits.  So, I made the dough, then rolled it out into rectangle shape.  I sprinked brown sugar and cinnamon and rolled it cinn. roll style and pinched the seam.  Sliced the roll in 1 inch pieces, baked them, drizzled with icing.  OMG!  I cannot make them this way too often, could not stay away!  I was a rock star with my family!!

Great recipe!  The biscuits turned out big and fluffy.  I only needed about 1/2 cup of milk instead of the 1 cup the recipe calls for.

Awesome biscuits, just amazing!  One thing I have to tell myself whenever I make these:  The dough must be rolled thick.  Thick.  Thick.  Thick.  I have to keep chanting this or I roll them out too thin and get J.P's Little Daddy Biscuits.  I roll my dough to about 3/4"-1" thickness- like a hockey puck- and they get HUGE in the oven.

This is the best biscuit ever. We always double it, sometime triple just to get enough to go around because everyone loves them. They are even bigger if I make them first and then leave them on the pan and don't bake until just before dinner is done.

These biscuits were stellar! I made them in Argentina, where I had no access to a blender, which made me a little bit nervous..but I hand beat them and they turned out spectacular! I used all the milk but took the advice of someone on here and used a little less baking powder.  I also definitely recommend refrigerating them a few hours before cooking them.  I'll make these again, this time in the States:)

My 3 year old helped me make these.  So easy!  I had all the ingredients already.  I baked mine (my cutter made 12) at 400 for 10 minutes.  Everytime I make the canned biscuits they burn terribly on the bottom. These didn't, I was quite pleased.

This recipe was nice because I had all of the ingredients on hand and didn't need anything special. With that said, they were a little plain for my taste, but they still hit the spot and got the job done in both taste and simplicity.

Pretty good.  I read some reviews that said they were a little bland so I added 1/2 tsp onion powder, some black pepper, chopped chives and used half shortening/half butter.  We ate them with sausage gravy!  I'll definitely make these again but I'll probably play with the spices a little. UPDATE: I made these exactly as the recipe stated -wonderfully flaky!  I had to bake for about 22 minutes.  Next time I'll omit the sugar and add more salt and add butter to the tops!

Out of the few biscuits I've tried lately I think these are the best so far.  I like to make mine in the food processor with the dough blade, I hate having to cut in shortening by hand.

Very nice - very fluffy and moist!  One tip that I found was beautiful with them; brush the top with butter and then sprinkle with your choice of cheese; bake until cheese is golden and bubbly; or even put a little pocket of cheese inside; instead of patting (works better than rolling; biscuits turn out fluffies) the dough to 1" do to 1/2 " and on top of one circle; put about a tablespoon of mild cheese (or to your taste) and put another circle on top; and very lightly press the edges down to just adhere the edges slightly.  Or use more sugar and a bit less salt with unsalted butter and put a tablespoon of jam or fruit in the middle instead of the cheese.  Yum!!

As someone suggested, I made up ahead of time and wrapped in foil--sprayed with pam (in a tube shape) & place in refrig. for several hours until I was ready to use them.  They turned out HUGE!  Everyone really liked them with their strawberrys & whipped cream.

I'll cut back the sugar a little next time.  Also watch the milk - as others say, you may need more or less than 1 cup.

These were great, and so easy.  Read several of the other reviews about sub-ing butter for shortening.  Compromised and used butter flavor Crisco.  Really good!

It's a good solid recipe. I added 2 TBS buttermilk powder (I would have used buttermilk instead of milk if I had it). You may not need one cup of liquid - I didn't so don't go past 3/4 cup at first and see how the dough is. Don't overmix it or they will not rise well. Make sure your oven is at the correct temperature before you put them in.

Just reading the reviews on this recipe, I had to try it. I didn't have any milk but did have a little half and half and a little cream, so I combined them and added water to make a cup. I also used butter rather than shortening, again just because I didn't have any. Lovely fluffy biscuits. I will do this again! I followed one of the reviews that said to knead gently, so ended up with maybe 7-8 times. Just beautiful!

All I have to say is: Awesome! I ended up making these two or three nights in a row, my friends loved them so much. (Besides, I won't pass up an opportunity to practice my biscuit making skills!) It does take a try or two to perfect these, but it really is worth it!! 

I agree with other reviewers, add the milk a little at a time, you won't always need all of it.

Biscuits require a really soft hand, and this dough needs little, if any, kneading. Just rolling out the dough to form the biscuits will usually be enough. 

Leave the unused dough in the fridge between batches. The longer you can let the dough set in the fridge, the bigger they rise. 

This is going at the top of my list. Perfect for any biscuit occasion.

I have found the perfect biscuit.  I don't think I will every go back to store brand.  They were quick and easy and I ate way to many.  I added the whole cup of milk although I should have stopped at about 3/4 c.  The whole cup make the dough sticky, but the biscuits were great.

I just made these and they are wonderful! I will never buy store bought biscuits again! I followed the recipe exactly (i did double it), but I think next time I will replace the shortening with butter, not because they taste bad now, cause they don't, just curiosity due to other reviewers! I will be making these often. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first time I ever tried to make biscuits.  They were not difficult at all, and they turned out so great!  My husband, a big biscuits & gravy fan, said they were the best biscuits he'd EVER had.  I'm not a huge biscuit fan, but I have to admit, even I went back for seconds on these!  My children gobbled them up as well, and said they were "the best".  This is the recipe I will always use.

These are great biscuits. If you like to experiment with basic recipes, this is a good recipe to experiment with. I like to put a cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese into the dough just before I knead the dough. It also makes a good base for quick cinnamon rolls. And whenever I make these biscuits, I always get great compliments. So thank you J.P.!

I really liked these.. I have tried for a very long time to make biscuits. Nothing I seemed to try worked at all. Until now. I've made these 3 times so far and have had nothing but compliments from my hubby. The last time I made them, I rolled the dough thin and brushed the top with melted butter before folding. I did this about 15 times and had 'peelable' layers. It's very time consumming, but well worth it. The biscuits didn't raise as high by doing this, but still were taller biscuits compared to others that I have made. Thanks for providing such as easy recipe!!!!

This recipe is great! I've never had luck with making biscuits, they always came out like bricks...but with this recipe they came out perfect! I used only real butter vs. shortening and I took other reviews advice and folded the dough several times onto itself versus kneading it. The biscuits came out tall, fluffly and pulled apart in layers! Better than the Pilsbury peel-apart biscuits! I will never buy store made biscuits again! Thank you for a great, easy and really fast recipe!

This recipe is awesome. It's only my first time making them but My Goodness they are Yummy. They didnt rise as much as I wanted them too but after biting into them, that didnt even matter.  There is certainly no need for me to look any further for a biscuit recipe. This is the perfect one for me. I cant wait to put these on my husbands plate for dinner tonight, He's going to love them.

I did use COLD butter in place of the shortening, otherwise I made them as is.  They were great.  They baked up nice and high.  And they were so soft.  The butter gave them awesome flavor that I don't think they would have had with the shortening.

Very, very good. Raves reviews from our friends who were over for dinner. Followed the recipe strictly, except I used butter for the shortening and really didn't knead the dough (just used my hands to finish mixing it). The only way they could have been better is if they'd been a tad more flaky.

Great Biscuits and easy to make with ingredients you probably have in the cupboard. Light and fluffy, but make big hearty biscuits. Similar to biquick biscuits, but less dense and minus all the additives,preservatives, and excess salt.

This is a good basic recipe and better than other baking powder biscuit recipes I've tried. We have these often for breakfast with milk gravy.

When I make them I use bacon grease for the shortening (no Crisco available where I am) and UHT milk. I've even made this recipe with water when there's no milk in the house; the recipe is still tasty, although the texture is a bit different (lighter and less dense than with milk).

These are the best biscuits..I also make them and exchange 1/2 the white flour with wholewheat...they still taste great and are healthier as my grandchildren just eat them up with jam...it is a treat for them and when they come to Nanoos house they are always looking for them...good job.

These biscuits were good.  I have made 4 different recipes this month and these were my second favorite.  A lot of people tell me not to knead dough because that is what makes it so tough so I didn't but when I reworked the dough scraps, basically kneading them, those paticular biscuits came out taller so if I had kneaded the whole thing they probably would have been even taller.  i will probably make them again.  I am desperate for a great homemade biscuit recipe, it is my new goal! :)

These were OK, but not because I used half white whole wheat and butter instead of shortening. We just didn't like that much sugar in our biscuits (prefer the traditional salty, not sweet taste) AND if I followed the recipe, would have used way too much milk. Kids loved them though, and otherwise, flavor and texture were good.

Very good recipe. Just a few comments---I did decrease the temp 25 degrees and next time will add a little more sugar. I also would not use 1 full cup of milk, just enough so it pulls from the sides-- about 3/4 cup. 

My husband and daughter loved them! Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at homemade biscuits and they turned out great. I did follow CookieClaries advice and this really helped me alot on the preparation. I don't think I will ever go back to store bought biscuits with my sasauge gravy.

Excellent biscuits.  Threw them together last night to have with beef stew.  They were awesome.  Nice texture and flavour.  I mixed the dough in my food processor until it just came together then patted them out and cut them.  It doesn't get any easier than that.  I let them sit for about 3 hours before baking so they'd puff a little on their own.  Picky husband even liked them.

beautiful biscuit, tall, rustic looking, but I'm sensitive to the taste of baking powder and baking soda and immediately wanted to cover that taste up w/jam. even so, there was still that familiar aftertaste, as I suspected there would be. nice and soft, nice consistency, too salty though. I should have left out the salt since I used salted margarine. I will definitely make these for others because I don't think people are as sensitive to the taste of baking powder as I am. mine came out like a scone, crispy outer layer, soft and light on the inside, which I love. no kneading, just a couple turns. I think most people would be very happy w/these.

I would give these biscuits a 3 1/2. They were good, but nothing amazing. They didn't rise as much as I had hoped for. I might make these again, but I will definitely be on the lookout for another biscuit recipe.

The first batch turned out a little more scone-y. You really have to watch the amount of milk added. The first batch needed less than 1/2 cup and was a really wet dough. The second batch turned out fantastic and need right around 1/2 cup and made a perfect dough. Taste is great, just have to keep an eye on the milk amounts!

My fiance is a biscuit and gravy freak. I am always searching for the "perfect biscuit" recipe. This recipe was good, but one thing I would change is the amount of salt. I'd cut it down by half. I was always taught you can put salt in but you can't take it out. I made this recipe step by step and the biscuits came out way too salty for my family.

Other then that, they were great. Big and fluffy, just like it promised.

Excellent!! Few tips. A pastry dough cutter works the best to work in the shortening or hard butter To get crumbles. If dough is sticky had a little more flour in as you knead. Don’t over knead ?. Leave the dough the full 1 inch thick for a great big soft yummy biscuits. Make sure they are a light brown or they won’t be done in the middle. These are great.

Holy moley Batman! Awesome. After being biscuit challenged for years, this is the ticket. I did sub the shortening with butter per suggestions. Talk about mist and flavorful. Anyway, a word warning. I patted mine out about 1" thick and used a 3" cutter, baked as directed and they can out a serious 2+" high. But man they were good. Thanks J.P. :)

Awesome.  I subbed almond milk (Allergy to dairy and recently soy), and it still turned out big and fluffy and delicious. I might make another batch tomorrow...

The only reason I rated it a 4 and not a 5 is b/c they didn't get as HUGE as I wanted.  But the recipe says to it may take time to tweak so that's what I'll do.  I will say the flavor was FABULOUS and I am absolutely going to make them again!

I have made so many biscuits, some good, some not so good. This recipe was just okay. They rose nicely, but were too salty and heavy. I'll give it another try. There are so many 5 star reviews that I'm sure I did something wrong. I really wanted this to be the perfect biscuit recipe.

I make them at least once a week sometimes twice. So easy & very quick, by the time the oven is preheated the biscuits are made & ready to go in. No more opening a can open from me. Thank You for this wonderful recipe.

This was a good biscuit recipe.  I made it a day in advance and they still baked up nicely the next day.  I also used salted butter instead of shortening and left out the salt.  They were flaky and would start to break into layers when picked up.  Served gravy over them.  Husband loved the meal and talked about it for hours afterwards!!

These were great! However, in my case they did not rise to the extent that would be pleasing. This may be due to leaving it in the fridge overnight. If they were soft and flaky, I would no doubt rate this a 5!

I normally use this recipe served with allrecipes "Bill's Sausage Gravy" (made with the "Breakfast Sausage" recipe in the gravy). Fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside and soak up the gravy perfectly. Really yummy biscuits even just to serve them buttered!

Great biscuit recipe!!!  I wish I had butter flavored shortening on hand, but I only had plain vegetable.  The biscuits turned out well with the unflavored shortening, but I imagine that they would have been even better with some of the butter flavored variety!!

I have been making this recipe for several years now. It's a great go-to recipe, easy and quick. It's also a very hearty biscuit, yummy with biscuits and gravy or strawberry shortcake. My advice, don't over mix or over knead and I once I pat my dough out I cut them with a knife instead of using a glass or round cutter. Yes, you'll end up with square biscuits, but they taste just as yummy and you've saved yourself some time and effort.

With all the great reviews on this, I'm a bit disappointed with how mine came out... I guess because I didn't follow the recipe to the "t". I substituted butter for shortening so it tasted a little too buttery for me. I also didn't have milk when I made it so I just used water instead. It still looked undone after over 25 mins of baking, and the taste was just off. It wasn't such a big hit in our house. I'll probably make this again but I'll follow the exact recipe next time.

This is the best biscuit recipe I've ever tried!  Simple and scrumptious!  (Ok, I wrote this review almost two years ago and I wanted to update it.  I always use this recipe and have made these probably 20 or 30 times.  I've found that kneading the dough lightly and quickly and not messing with it much, gives the best results.  I pat it out to about an inch thick, cut out with my biscuit cutter and bake as directed.  Everyone loves my biscuits!  Thanks, John, for submitting the recipe!)

I have been searching forever for a really great biscuit recipe and I FINALLY have found one. Do not be afraid to knead the dough 15-20 times like it says to, the biscuits will still be fluffy and light. I doubled the recipe and got 17 biscuits, 16 for my hungry family's dinner and 1 for "testing" ;) I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half for mine.

I had to give this 5 stars since I had every ingredient on hand and these were so easy to make. Although I've probably had better biscuits, they still came out big and fluffy and my kids loved having fresh baked biscuits in the morning.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I only ended up using about 3/4 cup of milk.  The biscuits didn't rise.  It was really disappointing.  I'm sure it's probably something I did wrong because there are so many other good reviews for this recipe.  I'm just not sure what I did wrong because I followed it step by step.

This is a great recipe. I followed the past advice and did not knead, but just patted the mixture. 1st attempt at these and will stick with this recipe as it has earned the 5 stars. Thanks for sharing.

My husband had been asking for biscuits, so I surprised him in bed with these. The flavor and texture were great. They didn't turn out as large as I would have liked, but that was on me. My baking powder is a little old, and I wasn't thinking so I added all the milk. That made it too sticky so I had to add more flour. I can't wait to make these again (and to see how big they turn out when you're paying attention ;)

Dough was sticky, but just added more flour little by little.  Split dough in half, added italian seasonings and parm cheese to half and the other half plain.  They both came out wonderful.  Lot's of options for add-ins.

Simple and tasty!  I had these whipped up in no time and they cooked as my dinner did.  I think from start to finish I invested a whopping 20 minutes on these babies, and they were absolutely delicious hot out of the oven with a pat of butter.  Thanks much!

I halved the recipe and made 4 mini sized biscuits. I made the dough the night before and chill it in the fridge and baked them the next morning. They rose nicely, but it didnt come out as fluffy as i thought. I also added raisins with the milk. Good recipe overall. Tasted like scones. I would try this again since it is easier than scones ^^

These are the best biscuits ever!  I usually make them in the evening and bake them in the morning.  They are a great breakfast treat served with butter and preserves.  I find the trick to be to use really fresh baking powder out of individual packets.  I tend to have to bake them about 3-5 minutes longer than in the recipe or else they are sticky in the middle. Thanks!

I made this today for biscuits and gravy. They were very good. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour to be more healthy and they still were good. I am sure with all white flour they would be divine.

I first used this recipe for a chicken and dumplings recipe on this site.  The dumplings came out great.  The second time, I made them for biscuits and gravy, and they turned out nice and tall - gorgeous, in fact, but they were a little dry and kind of bland.  I would probably make them again, but not before trying some other recipes to see if I find one I like better.  *Okay, I just keep making them.  I tried them following the recipe without really kneading the dough and didn't notice an improvement.  This time, I made them with butter, and added cheddar cheese to half the batch.  These were received MUCH more favorably by both husband and son.  I will probably use these again (they're so easy!).  I cut mine at 1/2 inch thickness because while the WOW factor is cool, who really needs/wants four inch high biscuits?  :)

This was the first time I had ever made homemade biscuits ... I usually would just use bisquick.  Well, this is the last time I'll be using bisquick for biscuits.  This recipe was so easy and the biscuits came out perfect.  We had them with the cinncinnati chili recipe found on this site and served them with honey butter.  Next time I will double the recipe and use them for biscuits and gravy or even add a little more sugar to them and use them for strawberry shortcake.  Thanks JP!!  Big Daddy Biscuits ROCK!

I just love this recipe and make it anytime I want homemade biscuits.  Rather than cutting these out I normally knead the dough a bit and press it into a rectangle and cut it into six squares that I gently round off with my hands.  This keeps the dough tender and there is no waste!

These were good biscuits. I can't say they were "the best", but certainly a good recipe. The flavor was a little bland though. These were big and very moist and fluffy inside. I cut this in half and got 4 biscuits. I didn't knead them just folded them 10 times. We did a taste test and preferred them with sausage gravy over the bisquick biscuits. 4.5 stars for these because they are just the right taste and texture for holding up to gravy.

WOOHOO!  I was beginning to think I would never be able to make decent biscuits as an adult (much to the chagrin of my Southern ancestors), but last night I proved myself wrong!  These biscuits are AWESOME!!!  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  The biscuits rose to perfection and were lightly browned in about 15 minutes.  We served them with butter, homemade grape jelly, apple butter, and peach syrup.  It was a little piece of heaven on earth!  I got 10 good-sized biscuits out of this recipe instead of 6 mondo ones.  The only thing I might do differently next time is use butter instead of shortening.  Otherwise, don't change a thing!  THANKS J.P.!  :oD

I make these on average about 1 sometimes twice a week. These are by far the best biscuits I have ever made.  I tweak them a little here and there depending on my mood. These have been refered to as velvet. I make these for my husband to take to work with some soft butter and honey and look out they are gone in 5 minutes.  I always double or even triple the recipes.  Leftovers what can I say biscuits and gravy. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM pure heaven. My kids adore them and when asked should I make JP Big Daddy's and it's a loud yes yes yes by 4 of my 5 kids.  Great recipe don't be afraid to tweek it just a tad, little more sugar, little less milk, less shortening and some butter.  Works well with powdered milk to, some cinnomon and nutmeg. Very versitle.

These biscuits were terrible:( I was looking forward to a wonderful fluffy biscuit-- simialar to a rest. food chain-"Cracker Barrel" but these were horrible.
First of all they did not looked cooked at all, they looked like we just put them in the oven, they did rise up but they never turned golden or fluffy. They were very dry, and they stuck to the backs of your teeth. I will not make these again.
Thanks anyway.

Finally!  A biscuit recipe that raises like it promises (even without letting it rest before hand), and doesn't come out of the oven like hockey pucks.  I followed some of the other reviews and used just slightly over 3/4 cup milk instead of the full cup, and they came out beautifully.

I eat biscuits or rolls with dinner every night and these are by far the tastiest biscuits I've had in awhile.  I have never made my own biscuits from scratch-always from a mix and I will never make from a mix again.  SOOOO good.  I can't wait to try again to get em as big as the picture.  I did use butter crisco and agree with others 1 cup of milk is too much and 3/4 wasn't enough..Just in the middle of the two is perfect!  GREAT SHARE..THANKS!

Amazing biscuits!  I usually make baking powder biscuits, but wanted to try a new recipe for them.  I chose this one.  We had some friends over for a brunch and I made these bicuits and gravy and a few other things.  I made a double batch, just in case.  I had to make more.  I couldn't believe that I had run out, but I did.  
Wonderful, fluffy, light tasting, golden brown biscuits.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The hubby and I really liked these!  The recipe doesn't make a lot but it doesn't matter because they are so filling.  Just one biscuit was enough for me with some gravy on top.

These biscuits were really easy to make and were ready in minutes. Mine were a bit too salty, next time will try without the salt and perhaps with the butter flavored shortening. So much better than mix biscuits!

Just as advertized- Big and light and delicious- I agree that 3/4 cups milk is not enough and 1 cup milk is too much- probably depends on whether you sift the flour.  I needed to cook these for the full 15 minutes, bottoms were perfect, used an air bake cookie sheet.

They were okay but 13 minutes is way to long...Maybe I made mine a bit thinner I don't know but the bottoms were burnt...I also used butter for more flavor istead of the shortening.

I did not like these biscuits.  I followed recipe exactly but was not impressed at all.  The biscuits was heaving and would not get completely done in the middle.  They were doughy after leaving them in the oven even after the required minutes. I will not try this recipe again.

Perfect exactly as the recipe goes.  I actually did make the biscuit dough 1" thick when cutting biscuits and was pleased with the results!  Very "Southern-country style" biscuits.  Actually does make exactly 6 biscuits.

These bisquits lived up to their promise. They were definitely the biggest fluffiest bisquits I have ever made. My kids and husband liked them, and my husband said that they tasted like KFC's biscuits. I will definitely make them again.

They are big. I've used higher baking powder to flour ratios before, but never achieved the size of these suckers. Makes me ponder... Anyway, great, easy recipe.

These biscuits were very good, all though I did increase the sugar to balance out the tartness of the baking powder.  My family loved them and asked for more.

These did not turn out well, but I won't rate them poorly because I think it was mostly my fault.  I didn't have shortening and I ran out of butter so I subbed applesauce for half (which usually works); the taste was fine but the biscuits were hard and chewy, and did not rise well.  I will probably try them again as written because they did taste really good :)

I guess I'm not in the majority, but I didn't like these very much.. the sugar was completely out of place... and that sugary taste.. just kinda stuck around even after a sip of water. I won't be making these again.

great easy recipie. Tastes like biscuits. Very good with honey butter. I must not have cut mine thick enough because they didn't puff up more than regular biscuits. Still, they had perfect texture and are well worth making.

Great biscuits!  Great flavor--no yucky baking powder aftertaste, and they are so big.  I never need the whole cup of milk, I usually only use about 3/4 cup.  This has become my regular biscuit recipe!

OOoooohhh! This is the best biscuit I've ever tasted, and I've tasted a few! They remind me of a biscuit I ate up on the Blue Ridge Parkway at a little restaurant that serves biscuits with butter and molasses as desert. I have never made a biscuit that turned out well before these. This is the one!!I nailed it the first time. I cut them a little small and they got a little top heavy (my fault) next time I'm using a big biscuit cutter (approx 3") and not a little jelly jar. If you want a good biscuit and have never had great success at making them, use this recipe. It is the best, and dang near fool-proof! Thank ya kindly...

I'm eating one of these hot from the oven right now and they are awesome biscuits. I baked them right after making the dough (no resting time) and they rose up great. Went great with my smothered pork chops, whipped potatoes, and green beans. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

This recipe was great!  I made it in my food processer in advance and kept it in the fridge until needed.  It still turned out beautifully.  I used it to top "Bacon Cheeseburger Upside Down Pizza" (from this site) as per another reviewers suggestion and it was so yummy!

These are great, and yes the longer the dough sits the better they are.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I serve my turkey a la king on them, have also used with a hearty soup for a nice winter meal.  excellent!

This is the BEST recipe I have ever had for baking powder biscuits.  I use this recipe whenever I serve biscuits and gravy (with our home raised ground pork), to eat with butter and jelly or for strawberry shortcake and whipped cream.  I am a trained home economist in foods and nutrition and this recipe is at the top of all other biscuit recipes.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe "as is", and was NOT disappointed!!  With about 5 minutes left to bake, I started brushing melted butter on the tops.  They turned out better than "popeyes".  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. If the dough is too sticky to knead, it may solidify after a bit of time, or you can just drop chunks of it on the pan with a spoon. I used butter instead of shortening.

amazing recipe. tastes delicious. is a very sticky, and needs a lot of flour, but otherwise great. i used butter instead of shortening, and buttermilk instead of regular milk, probably made it better, but I can't imagine it being bad either way

This recipe is really great. I have made it several times to rave reviews. The key is to spend a long time cutting the shortening into the flour. I've tried it with both butter and crisco, and if you're up for a real treat -- the butter gives the biscuts a wonderful, rich flavor. I roll out the dough a little thicker, so that they will be nice and puffy out of the oven.

OH MY GOODNESS!  These are wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly (used butter flavor shortening) and had trouble convincing my family these were homemade.  This one is definately a keeper.  Thanks John.

I don't make biscuits I make cakes but when I saw this recipe I had to try it. They were the best biscuits I have ever had and easy to make which makes them even better. I would recomend these to anyone.

I've never been a good biscuit maker, but definitely the less you handle these babies, the flakier and fluffier and bigger they are.  I used some leftover sour milk and added a half teaspoon of baking soda to the mix.  I couldn't believe it.  I will never buy another can of Grands again.  Great recipe for sausage/cheese/egg biscuits too.  I finally had to hide them from my husband!

These biscuits are sooooo good! I've tried many different recipes and have also been spoiled by Southern biscuits. Mine rose to be at least just as high as those pictured, and the taste and texture were amazing. I think it's important to mix and handle as little as possible, and I also use butter flavored shortening and the taste is so much better than regular. LOVED them!

I was very excited about making these biscuits and couldnt wait to taste them! Boy was I dissapointed!!!The biscuits rose very nicely - but did not have a good taste at all.  I'm from the south where biscuits are KING and this recipe did not stand up.  I've read the other reviews and have to assume that maybe these people are not from the south or are not use to good biscuits.  This recipe went in "file 13" !!  Sorry.

This is the recipe you need if you're trying to out do your southern mother in law! Light and fluffy and rather large although I think they could have risen even more if I didn't knead them so much.

I wrapped the dough around hot dogs cut in half and baked them in the oven.  The biscuits didn't puff up as much as I would have liked, but they tasted pretty good.  I'll try making them into regular biscuits next time.

I have tried to make biscuits before and they never came out right. This time the did and they are good. They weren't huge. They were normal maybe due to my inexperience. I probably did something wrong. But we're getting somewhere. thx.

I made these for breakfast with gravy of course. My family (including 1 very picky 3 year old) absolutely loved them! Having read the other reveiws, and using 3/4 c of milk and butter instead of shortening, they turned out fantastic. Thanks for a great recipe.

I attempted to make biscuits 3 times today in preparation for an upcoming party.  The first batch was Angel biscuits with yeast.  They didn't rise and looked/tasted more like English muffins than biscuits.  The second batch was southern buttermilk biscuits, which were dense and didn't rise.  The third batch was J.P.'s big daddy biscuits.  Success at last!  I will stick with this recipe and make/freeze several more batches tomorrow.  Thanks for saving the day, J.P.!

I have NEVER been able to make a good biscuit - until now!  These are the best, easiest and most tantalizing biscuits I and my family have ever eaten.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were textbook.  Mine cooked up light and fluffy and almost like the grands biscuits that pull apart and are layered.  I will definately make this again and again.  We had chipped beef with them last night but they got eaten more with butter and jelly instead.

I'm a Chinese live in Taiwan with my American husband. This is not the kind of food I'm familiar with. But my husband said it's great and I love it myself, too. Since I made bread all the time and learn my lesson that always leave some water/milk depending on how dough is going. I had no problem to make it even the first time. Everyone should try this great recipe!

Mmm mmm mmm!!!!! I JUST finished baking a double batch. The last biscuits I made (from a different recipe) were better used as coasters. But these ones....OH MY GOODNESS. Yum. So light and flaky. I should've used a wider glass to cut out bigger biscuits, so I ended up with 25 small/med sized ones. Excellent recipe. Will try brushing butter on top to brown them next time. Can't wait to make the next batch!!! Soooo wonderful.

i just made these after reading some of the other posts. i used butter flavored crisco, 3/4 C milk, and a little less baking powder. i also spread melted butter flavored crisco on top before baking. they baked perfectly, although i think i may have let them in a minute too long (i cooked them for 13 minutes). the only reason i'm giving this 4/5 stars is because of the aftertaste. i don't know if i should have used less baking powder and more sugar, but it was a little bitter. still, the biscuits themselves turned out VERY moist and delicious, when buttered.

Cooking for an old time southerner (my Dad), I hoped I could find a biscuit close to the kind my Grandma used to make. So far these are as close as they come! The one thing I do differently is to brush on melted butter to the tops of the unbaked biscuits which adds flavor and makes for better browning on the tops. These were GREAT!!

YUM!!! I did substitute butter for shortening and use "quick" buttermilk instead of milk but these were FANTASTIC.  They were light and fluffy and very big.  I made 9 biscuits with this recipe (instead of six).  If these aren't coming out properly for you, I suggest checking your baking powder (make sure it isn't too old) and don't overhandle the dough.

This recipe is SO easy - I just threw everything in my stand mixer, used the dough hook to knead it, and then plopped six handfuls on to a cookie sheet. I used non-hydrogenated margarine (that nice olive oil flavoured Becel) instead of shortening, and half whole wheat flour. I also used half evaporated milk and half skim milk for the liquid. They looked and tasted perfect; thank you!

Absoluetly delicious! I served these for brunch and have made a batch every day since. My husband and I agree thaese are the best tasting biscuits we've tried.  My only reason for not giving 5 stars was that mine didn't rise as I believe they are meant to. perhaps, I'm doing something wrong, although I did follow several reviewers who suggested using buttermilk and not kneading the dough...so maybe I should stick to the original recipe next time.  Definately a keeper and I found no bitterness at all as some have mentioned.  Try this recipe, you'll not be disappointed.

These were okay - great flavor, but not as flaky and tender as I'd like.  I might have over-kneaded, but I think I'll stick with Bisquik for now. 
If I made these a few more times I'm sure they would come out better for me, but I doubt I'll make again.

Tasted kind of bitter. Perhaps there was a tad too much baking powder? But without the baking powder they probably wouldn't have rised like they did.

I've made these twice in two days. Everyone loves them, and my husband says they taste like KFC biscuits. Went great with a pot roast yesterday, and worked out well in a pinch when I realized we were out of bread today - served them with some veggie-tomato soup. Great for dunking in soups! It's my new "official" biscuit recipe! The only change I made was to use light brown sugar instead of white (I was somehow out).

Excellent biscuit.  Mild flavor, moist and worthy of the name BIG Daddy Biscuit.  Perfect for any topping you like.  They do not brown which keeps them soft.  I increased mine to make 12 servings. Still perfect.

I multiplied this recipe by 5, divided dough in thirds, kneaded it 15 to 20 times each, put it in a bowl with a lid.  An hour later we arrived at the church potluck.  I patted out each section of dough and cut about 35 - 40 biscuits.  This took less time than the oven did to heat.  5 minutes is all the longer they lasted.  I got rave reviews.  Everyone loved them!  And easy, too.

I found these to be a great biscuit. Mine raised about two inches high. I placedeached biscuit next to each other so it helped to bring them up. I also used lard and a little extra sugar and found them to be very light. Even my picky eater ate three of them!!! We use them with biscuit and gravy and just some butter and and homemade jam. i also have microwave them for a couple of senconds the next day and they were good.

This was my first time at biscuits.  These were a huge hit with the family.  I cut mine a little to big though and they didn't puff up too much, but the taste was great.  Thanks for the quick and easy and tasty recipe!

Not exactly what I had in mind.  These biscuits tasted okay, but weren't fluffy and light. They didn't rise into very big biscuits even with me using the amount of baking powder that the recipe called for.  Overall, I just didn't think these were biscuits that I would want to eat again.

These were good biscuits, and fairly easy to make. They rose beautifully, and my husband was very impressed (he had asked me to make some homemade biscuits- I usually use the canned, refrigerated variety). This was my first time making biscuits, and they came out great. I only wished I had made more! I cut them with a juice glass, and that worked great.

!! Now I have added yet another vice to my life.  These were freakin awesome. I used crisco cause...well, thatswhatIhad. So there! But really, they were good.  Make sure u cut them tall.  I found that a bit above an inch is better.Also makre sure they aren't leaning to the side or else they will tilt while baking. John rocks!

These biscuits were absolutely wonderful! I have never made biscuits from scratch before and they were quick and easy. I made them a bit smaller and made more of them. Fixed them with a sausage gravy recipe from this site. See my other reviews for that recipe. DELICIOUS!

After 10 YEARS of trying to make biscuits...I have FINALLY got it, thanks to this recipe!!!  My husband and his family(biscuit afficianados)agree that these are not only edible..but GOOD! I doubled the batch with no problems..used White Lily Flour..I think the key is to not over-knead it. Second only to my Maw-Maw's(which I just CAN'T make!) THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!

This was my first time ever making biscuits & they turned out just fine.  I rolled them out to about 3/4 of an inch thick and they doubled their size while cooking.  I will make these again.

These biscuits were absolutely great.  I made a few mistakes, such as making them too thin (one third an incg) and overcooking them. I more then doubled the cookin time waiting fro them to brown, which never happened.  I eventually just took them out, but yo my suprise they were still delious. I used butter due to lack of shortening and soy milk. I will certainly be making these again, and im sure they'll trun out even better next time!

These turned out to be just about the best biscuits that I've ever made.  Like others I used butter flavored Crisco.  To save time I just used my fingers to cut in the Crisco, it's really easy.

This first time I made these I thought they were good but needed something.  I made them again adding 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar for rising effect, cutting the baking powder to 4 teaspoons and used 3/4 cup of milk then 1/4 cup of melted butter.  They were better after the additions.

These were great.  My mom always made wonderful busicuits, but I never learned before moving out.  This was my first real attempt at making them and it was great.  I used All purpose flour and omitted the salt and baking powder and used butter for the shortening, thats all I had on hand.  They weren't HUGE, but I think I rolled the dough too thin.  All in all, they were really good, will be adding to my recipe box for many more uses!! Thanks for this recipe.

My family and I have just found a new biscuit recipe for our "weekend biscuits and gravy"!Thank you for sharing this great recipe.  I made the dough and let it "rest" while I made my gravy. I put them in the oven while the gravy was thickening and they came out great!

I've made these twice now.  Both times, they failed to rise as noted.  First time the flavor was good but they were hard and crunchy.  2nd time I bought a new can of baking powder and the texture was better but there was a real bitter flavor to them.  I am going to keep looking for another recipe, though it was fun to try and make the biggest biscuits ever!  Good luck if you do!

Wow!  Did these suckers bake up big.  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted the shortening with butter, and I also I used 1/2 c milk & 1/2c evaporated milk.  The result was excellent.  Even were moist and delicious warmed up in the mic next day.  Only mistake was not making more.  This one goes in my recipe box. Thanks JP!

I have made this recipe many times and love that it is so easy.  The biscuits always turn out nice and fluffy.  It is now my biscuit recipe of choice.

Pretty good biscuits, a little on the dry side.  I did leave out the sugar as we were having these with gravy.  I made 1 and 1/2 of the recipe so we'd have plenty. These did come out big, just dry. I think I'll keep trying biscuit recipes.

These biscuits are huge!  I left the dough over night in the fridge wrapped in tinfoil, and when I baked them the next morning, they did turn out gigantic.  They were a little more bland than some other recipes, but if you're looking for a plain flavoured biscuit to put with something else, this is your recipe!

I made these for the first time, about a year ago.  Since then, I have tried other recipes, but keep coming back to B.J.'s biscuits.  They always turn out super!  My one suggestion is:  roll them out thick.  They get a bit hard if they're too thin, or too small.  :)

If you haven't figured it out by all the other reviews, these are great!!! My kids were quite the whole time they were eating, this doesn't happen much.  I made some honey butter to go with these and they melted in our mouths.  My husband was jealous and expects me to make them for him tommorow.  Thanks for a great breakfast.

This recipe is easy, quick and tasty!  I have also used it to make "Pigs in Blankets," which my kids love.  I cut a slit in a hot dog, insert a strip of cheddar cheese, and wrap the whole thing with the biscuit dough.  Bake as directed for the biscuits.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Mine didn't turn out as well as I would have hoped.  I made drop biscuits and they didn't rise up at all, but that's okay.  I added a little extra salt, and I think it was way too much to begin with - I think I am overly sensitive.  However, they did kind of remind me of the biscuits from KFC - which I love.  I'm not sure if I'll make them again, but I would advise others out there to give it a shot.

These biscuits are GREAT! I made them for dinner last night and got HUGE fluffy biscuits that my family devoured. I decided to make them again this morning and add cinnamon and raisins and they were gone in 5 mins! This recipe is very versatile and I'm betting  you could add almost any fruit to these to make a great breakfast roll. I'm thinking this dough would be great for roll up cinnamon rolls too for those of us who like a cinnamon roll that isn't too soft. If anyone trys it, post it so we know :)

I will say these biscuits rose up as everyone said but I only gave 3 stars because I felt they were lacking in taste.  I may try this recipe again with buttermilk and see if it makes a difference.

very simple. it took me no time at all to make and they were very delicious! a tip i saw on the food channel is to press your thumb in the center of the biscuit and then brush melted butter over them. Excellent Biscuits Big Daddy!!

Thanks I have been looking for fluffy biscuits. Boy are these a joy to eat. I have turned them into savory biscuits also. My husband didn't like biscuits very well until I tried this recipe. Now we have them at least once a week.

Next time I make this I will have to double the batch, I only got two from the last one (my husband ate the other 6.)  I used margerine and they turned out great, next time though I might use butter or butter flavored shortening just to get more butter flavor.  
I also think they could use a bit more salt, but I like my biscuits buttery and salty.  Definitely a keeper!

Great Biscuits!!! I used butter flavored shortening and it gave it a great golden color and buttery taste. I reccomend doubling the recipe if your household is full of biscuit eaters. We had them with Sausage gravy and the next day we had them with honey. Now we need some jam or preserves and we'll have it! Thanks so much!

Reading the all instructions is important! I added all ingredients, kneaded, and cut the biscuits out. I came out with about 21 biscuits. Maybe I need to pull out my seam guide that I use for sewing to determine what an inch is. I am now reading that I was supposed to get 6 huge biscuits. If you didn't read the instructions thoroughly and came out with what I did, these would be good for a brunch filled with jams and jellies. Also, I used butter flavored shortening in a stick form. This gave my biscuits a nice color before putting them in the oven and also made it much easier for me to measure.

These were light, fluffy, and delicious.  The only alteration I made was to roll out the dough to 1/2 inch (not 1 inch). My biscuit cutter was 3 in. diameter.

This is an amazing biscuit. I've made it a ton of times, and even shared the recipe half a dozen times.
I'll have to try it "sweetened" up a bit more for desserts!
Fabulous recipe!
Works everytime!

My husband says these are the best! I agree. I have used this recipe several times and it always turns out well. Thanks for a great recipe! Oh, I always use buttermilk instead of regular milk. You have to add a little more because it is thicker, but it really adds flavor.

I made smaller biscuits with this recipe because I didn't have a cutter large enough for the "mondo" size. The recipe made 12 regular size biscuits, and I baked them for 11 minutes.  They were fabulous!!  We had them with fresh tupelo honey and sweet unsalted butter. Heavenly!! Thanks J.P.!!!

Everyone in my husband's family brings a special dish to Thanksgiving Dinner.  I'm the newest member, so I asked what to bring this year.  They said, "Bread"!  I thought what could I do to show off with bread.  That's where this recipe came in.  I've been asked to bring these biscuits every year!  What else can be said?  These are THE BEST!!

This is an excellent recipe for 'quick and dirty' biscuts. My results were best when I let the dough sit for an hour or so before I cooked the biscuts. They can also sometimes be a bit dry...but that just means you get to use more butter, or gravy, or whatever!

These were wonderful.  I added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and after they were baked I brushed them with melted butter and garlic. This is keeper.

I never realized making my own biscuits would be so easy. I had to cut down on the milk, only used about 2/3 cup. Add your milk gradually like the recipe says or you might end up with a runny batter. These are full proof!!! Thank you John for posting this wonderful recipe.

These were wonderful!  They had a very fine texture, and tasted amazing.
I took me two batches to get the desired heighth, and I solved my dilemma by not rolling the dough out at all.
After kneading, I merely patted it smooth, leaving the dough very thick for the cutting out.
They turned out enormous!

These biscuits were wonderful!  I need to cook without dairy or wheat, because of food allergies in the family, so I've had trouble finding biscuits that rise, and aren't crumbly. I substituted white spelt flour, and rice milk, and they turned out big, fluffy, and soft! Definitely a recipe to keep!

Five stars in every catagory.  Only took 15 minutes to make, my six year-old read me the directions and my 5 and 6 year-olds help me make them.  And everyone loved eating them.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and the biscuits are always perfect. These biscuits are not only BIG but also delicious. Friends and family beg for this recipe. I like being able to put the ingredients together early in the day. That saves me time when I'm busy cooking the meal. I highly recommend this recipe. It's great!

These are the best biscuits. Used a teaspoon of sugar instead of a tablespoon and just made the dough about a half an inch thick for regular sized biscuits.   I had lost the recipe I usually use in our recent move and this is a great replacement.  I made these for dinner and immediately after dinner made another batch and put in refrigerator for tomorrow.Ccan't wait to see how BIG those turn out.  This is going in my permanent recipe book.

My five picky kids love these biscuits!  I make a double recipe whenever I need a quick bread for dinner.  I like to use margarine instead of the shortening.  The flavor is even better and they look great.  It's so convenient to be able to make my own, great tasting biscuits instead of using the canned ones.

These biscuits were some of the best I've ever tasted and they were so easy to make I was almost sure I had done something wrong, but not so, they were delicious. Thanks J.P., they will permanently be in my recipe box.

Very easy, very big!  In a "Martha Stewart moment," I cut the biscuits with a big star cookie cutter I have.  They came out great and even kept the shape pretty well.  No more tube biscuits for me :)

I  made an account just so I could rate this recipe. I'm very critical of biscuits, and my husband married me for my ability to make biscuits and gravy. I have always been searching for the perfect recipe until I made this one. I always double the recipe now because it's a feeding frenzy when I make them. Sometimes I use butter instead of shortening if I'm feeling a little more southern. The trick for a fluffy biscuit is to not mix the dough too much and use REALLY cold butter or  shortening. You can also refrigerate the biscuits after they are cut and prior to cooking to get the fats solid again. Sometimes I even make these the night before and leave the cut biscuits in the fridge overnight and they end up HUGE (YUGE, even). If you're feeling rich you can even brush the tops with melted butter as soon as they come out of the oven.

These were very dense and the use of shortening instead of butter definitely was a let down flavor wise.

We loved these biscuits!  After reading reviews we tweaked the recipe in the following ways:  We omitted the sugar.  Once the dough was made we patted it out, folding it in thirds 3 times before cutting the biscuits.  We followed another reviewers advice about placing  biscuits in pan touching one another and melting butter in preheated pan first and coating biscuits on both sides with the melted butter just before placing into oven.  
These small changes to this wonderful recipe gave us flakey, layered biscuits that were slightly crispy on both the tops and bottoms but fluffy on the inside.  Couldn't ask for a better biscuit!  These were scrumptious right out of the oven and toast up deliciously as left-overs.  Gave this a 4 star rating because of the changes I made.

I made these vegan as well using almond or soy milk, they tasted exactly the same.  Sometimes .I also add some herb's for fun that match what they might be going along side.

These biscuits came out very nice first try.  I am going to try what they suggest next time and make the dough the day before and refrigerate overnite so the baking powder can work some magic.  They were tender and lovely inside and the outside had a nice firmness to the bite.  just yummy.

We thought they were delicious, but I did make several changes. I used one cup all-purpose flour and one cup whole wheat. I don't use shortening, so I subbed with lard and I skipped the sugar.

I baked them with einkorn flour. I used half of the milk (that's all I needed) and I rolled them out to 1/2" thickness instead of 1". I still baked them at the same temperature and for the same amount of time. I rotated the tray halfway through baking. They turned out awesome!

The recipe was easy, prep time  was quick and the family and I both loved them. I made one addition I added a 1/8 tsp of cream of tartar and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. These were light, fluffy not at all doughy and tasty. I will make these again and again.

Wow they actually taste just like biscuits! Plus they’re easy and quick to make. And just like other readers have stated, it is better not to knead and use cold butter. Absolutely delicious!

Very good biscuits!! I messed up and added too much milk so I just added a little bit of everything else and they didnt rise as much as I hope but I'll pretty sure that's because of my initial mistake. But the flavor was right on and I will definitely be making again!!

I followed recipe as written for a couple batches; them made alterations.
changes as follows...
I added 1 tablespoon of vinegar to the milk to sour it. I added a teaspoon of baking soda to the flour mixture along with the recommended amount of baking powder. 
I increased the sugar to 3 tablespoons.
Lastly I placed biscuits on the prepared pan but put sides touching and cooked for additional 3 - 5 minutes (or until tops are a light golden. I immediately buttered the tops pf biscuits when removed from oven.   I found that my alterations made the biscuits Taller softer and delicious. this is my go to now. they are [nearly] as fast as canned biscuits but made with a lot more LOVE.

I have made this recipe twice always as directed, second time was in a pinch of what to serve with stew and these did the trick. Its easy and tasty. Slightly more hearty biscuit that really puts the homemade in the flavor. These will be my go to biscuits and I bet they would be great with gravy!

I have made these biscuits for the past several years. must say, they are amazing! The only change I've made is I use butter rather than shortening. Personal preference is my only reason.

Best one, I have tried some recipe before but this one is easy and practical and result is a amazing light biscuit . just some notes: 1- I used half baking powder and half baking soda 2-oven must be very hot so the biscuit will start to bubble up and get light 3-I add about a teaspoon Cinnamon to it which helped with taste and its look 4-I used about 70 g butter instead  5-baked it for 45 min and then grill it above about 4 mins

I cannot stress enough how good these biscuits are! I did follow the recipe, however I tweaked it just a bit. I only added 1 tsp sugar and used buttermilk. I also used an iron skillet with melted butter in the bottom, coating both sides of the biscuits before putting them in a 450 degree oven for 16 minutes. They remind me of Popeye’s. Perfection!

Wonderful.  I used buttermilk instead of milk, fresh corn kernals cut off of 3 cobs and a litttle less sugar.

Used one stick frozen butter grated.  Used pastry blender to blend into dry ingred  until like coarse crumbs.  Mix in milk and spoon onto cookie sheet.  Form into biscuits and bake as directed.

I will definitely make these again. My mother asked me where i bought the good biscuits because I am famous for my bad biscuits.  My grandson even asked for the leftovers later for a snack!

Very good. Made them with milk the first time. Second time tried buttermilk. Flavor was much better with the buttermilk. Used butter in place of shortening both times. Only needed 3/4 cup of milk. Texture is perfect.

These are excellent biscuits!!!!  But I would like to write about something else.  It doesn't seem to matter what the biscuit is, if I bake it for the allotted time, the end product tastes like raw dough in my mouth.  I have discovered that if I bake biscuits waaaaay beyond the given time, they are way more palatable and become more bread-like.  I baked these for almost 25 minutes and they were wonderfully flaky and not-doughy.  Just something that I have discovered.  Thought I'd share this with y'all.

I made it as written and they turned out great! The dough started pulling away from the side before all the milk was added, so I didn't use all of it. The biscuits look just like the picture. We ate them with stew and they were perfect. My husband's only disappointment was that the recipe only made 6. (Will double next time ;))

Excellent. Easy to make and they turned out great! I used butter instead of shortening as I had a bare pantry but still worked. This recipe has gotten me through many a tight food week. Thank you.

So easy and they turned out perfect! The perfect biscuit recipe for when you don't have (or don't want) buttermilk. 

I kept the recipe as is but added some seasonings during the kneading phase to give them a little extra flavour.

I made no changes.  My biscuits did not rise.  In fact after adding one cup of milk, the dough was so wet There was no way I could have kneaded it.  I pieced together the dough into very rough biscuits, baked  at 425 for13 minutes and the result was a very poor flat biscuit.  I am using new baking powder.
 The good thing:  they tasted great.

Despite worrying that I undercooked them, they came out fliffy and golden brown top and bottom. I kept the butter cold and tried my best to handle the dough as little as possible.

Very good in the original recipe. I tried one suggestion for using half a cup of butter and three-quarters cup of milk. That version was okay but the original was way better.

Made these last night to serve with beef stew.  Made the receipe exactly as written and they were perfect!  Light and fluffy without a lot of fuss.   I had a few left over which we had for breakfast with butter and blackberry jam.  They were just as good as the night before.  Highly recommend this receipe.

This is my go to biscuit recipe. So good every time. I do use butter instead of shortening, always in every recipe. Still have great results. Also, I don’t knead  20 times, it’s over kill. I just sort of fold it until it comes together.

I like this recipe but, as others have said, the milk amount is too much and should be stated in the ingredients list as a range; say 3/4 - 1 cup milk. 
That being said, I did add the whole cup of milk without paying attention to the "gradually" instruction and came out with a wet dough. But I made lemonade out of lemons by turning them into drop biscuits (I scooped them on the pan with an ice cream scoop).
One last note: I put them on an ungreased cookie sheet as instructed and they stuck to the pan. Next time I will use parchment paper. 
Very good biscuits, though, even after all of the hiccups :)

This recipe came out nothing like the picture.  The final product was shaped like a deflated balloon.  I have another recipe I normally use, but wanted a biscuit a bit more moist than usual.  But, I think the 1c of milk was too much.  The dough required lots of flour in order to knead it.  But in spite of what I thought was too much, the biscuits were moist.  The outside was crisp and the flavor good, but not rising made the inside pretty dense.

Fluffy, high soft biscuits.I taste no baking powder at all. But I used unsweetened almond milk and maybe that made a difference. Also, 450 degrees F for 12 minutes. I live at 8600 feet altitude and these are not dry at all. A pleasant surprise.

I’ve made this recipe every time I’ve need biscuits over the past several years. I make it exactly as called, or sometimes subbing butter or lard or coconut oil, and it ALWAYS turns out!!! I grew up eating biscuits all the time and won’t make our family recipe anymore because this recipe is better!

Amazing.  I used a stick of butter because I didn’t have shortening.  I also brushed a bit of butter on the tops before baking.  Excellent!!!!!   Thank you

First of all, I have made these as written, and they are wonderful.  This time, though, I made them vegan by using almond milk instead of regular milk and Earth Balance for the shortening (as I usually use butter).  They turned out beautifully, and made the perfect base for vegan strawberry shortcakes topped with whipped coconut cream.

I make these biscuits all the time for my family. My husband often requests that I make double batches just for him to keep as snacks.  I do substitute butter for the shortening. We once got low sodium baking soda by mistake and it made the biscuits very bland. For extra fluffy biscuits you can use self rising flour instead of all purpose flour.  I think some issues people have had may come from over mixing or using too much milk. Either use just the milk you need to make them the right consistency or add more flour if necessary. Unlike some reviewers I do knead the dough but not as many times as specified....just enough to change the consistency of the dough. I also roll them out onto a well floured mixing board. I normallly brush them with melted butter (sometimes garlic butter)  to add flavor  and make them extra crispy on the outside.

I have looked for years for a go to biscuit recipe. This one made the cut. I use half and half instead of milk. Leave the dough one inch or thicker,  I only get six biscuits from recipe. Great as breakfast biscuits with gravy or a dinner biscuit with chicken soup or what ever. Grand kids love the biscuits so I make a double batch. And they are quick to make.                                                      Scott

Delicious, and I used a wheat flour. Would double the recipe next time, to still get about 10 biscuits but to make them thicker. :)

Super simple recipe that came out great.  I made it my food processor which made it come together so fast.  

The other thing I did was bake the biscuits in my largest cast iron skillet.  I greased it thoroughly and plopped the fat biscuits in it.  They came huge and perfect.  I think next time I might make them thinner -- personal preference.  I'm also going to look for an extra-large biscuit cutter so I can use these for egg sandwiches.  

Yummy!

Best biscuits ever!  I made a double batch. I HAD to add about a cup of extra flour because I couldn't kneed it it was more the consistency of a thick chowder.

Recipe is a keeper! I used butter instead of shortening.  Also buttermilk instead of milk.  They didn't rise as high as I thought they should.  Looking at my baking powder can it expired Nov. 2015!!!!! dugh! I guess I need to replace my baking powder!  They were still good and very tasty! This is my new go to biscuit recipe!  Thanks

These biscuits are dead-on perfect every time.  I always place the shortening (butter) in the freezer for about 30 minutes before cutting it into the flour mixture.  Thank you for sharing this!

This is a basic, easy recipe that turns out well every time (though I usually don't end up with pretty, straight biscuits!).  I substitute butter for the shortening, and we like the buttery taste.

I did use butter instead of Crisco. I also, as another reviewer suggested, just patted the dough, instead of kneading. The biscuits were good, but not great.

I used whey from my homemade Greek yogurt for half the milk. Quick, easy and tasty! I use less sugar in savory dishes, more for desserts (plus a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg).

I agree with the cook who said cold, cold, cold dough, hot, hot, hot stove. I used buttermilk for added flavour and also cooked mine in the cast iron pan. I got 7 large biscuits - they were light and fluffy and delicious. Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out fantastic.   I may need a wider juice glass next time though, because these bad boys really rose to the occasion!  These aren’t as tangy as buttermilk biscuits but they’re nice, easy no-frills biscuits.  Plus, the texture is spot on!  Flaky, soft, and tender...if you don’t over-knead (literally 15 times like the recipe says), and you’ll end up with magic. Nice recipe, J.P.!!

I've made these so many times!!!  I can't stand the taste of refrigerator tube biscuits  even though my husband loves them.  Long story short, my husband finally eats my biscuits!  On occasion I get busy and just drop these instead of cutting out rounds, but they taste just the same.  And if you brush them with butter the little nooks and crannies get nice and crunchy.  
And for the sake of the recipe, if you change stuff, please don't rate it with a poor review.  Baking is science!  I wish Allrecipes could go in and delete all these types of reviews!

I think maybe letting it rise longer would be better. With that being said - these were GREAT!  I changed the recipe to make whole wheat biscuits - a bit healthier.
 
I used 1/2 whole wheat flour in place of white flour and Bread flour in place  of all purpose.

I also used buttermilk in place of milk and followed another's suggestion of  baking powder and baking soda. The ratio was approx. 3 parts baking powder and 1 part baking soda.

The result was a good light biscuit - considering they were wheat (which I find tends to be denser).

My husband said that these are a keeper!

Great recipe! I used margarine instead of shortening because that’s all I had and they turned out great. I’ve made them twice in the past couple weeks. My kids just gobbled them up.

I've never had any luck with biscuits but thought I would try once more. Since this recipe had more than 4K reviews, it seemed a good one. I made it as directed, using butter-flavored shortening, and my husband loved the biscuits. 

I read the reviews about cutting out and not trying to re-roll the leftover dough, so I patted the dough into a nice rectangle, then used a sharp knife to cut it into six pieces. Yes, the biscuits were rectangles instead of circles, but it didn't change the taste, and there was no waste.

These biscuits are amazing.  I use my food processor to quickly blend the dry ingredients and butter (I prefer to use butter for the fat) and they come out perfect and are SO EASY.  When I make them for people they can't believe they are homemade!  I bake them on parchment on a cookie sheet, no spacing necessary.

I would actually rate this recipe 3.5 stars, somewhere between it was OK and I liked it.  This is a pretty typical biscuit recipe, with a bit of extra baking powder.  For better texture, use White Lily Flour, or substitute half the AP flour with Cake Flour.  For added flavor, use whole fat buttermilk, and use butter instead of shortening, which has no flavor at all.

These had good flavor. I used sour milk by adding a Tablespoon of vinegar to the milk and letting it sit  for 5 minutes.  I did not add sugar. The dough was a bit soft but I just added about 3 Tablespoons more flour and it was fine.

The key is not not knead the dough at all. Cut in the very cold butter and just mix lightly with a spoon or spatula till it barely comes together. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a circle to your desired thickness. Don't need to roll it out just pat it out and then use a biscuit cutter and press straight down (don't turn while cutting the biscuits). 

I use a cast iron skillet. They did cook about 15 minutes as the dough was a little loose but the biscuits had a great flavor and were very light. Not dense at all. Good recipe.

Excellent biscuits! Have made these several times & they’re always great. I use my food processor, chilled dry ingredients, frozen butter (cut into small pieces before freezing) & very cold milk. Pat dough into rectangle about 1” thick. Cut into 6-8 biscuits.

These were so fast and easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly. I couldn’t find my biscuit cutter but did have a small metal measuring cup   That had fairly sharp lip. Some of mine didn’t all rise equally but I know that was from the edges sealing a little when I cut them. It is a damp day so mine took about 16 min to cook. They were very good. My 7 yr and 1 yr olds loved them! They also didn’t stick to the baking sheet at all, which I loved. I will make these again for certain.

I've made these many times before but they never have turned out like this! I made my own buttermilk instead of using milk like others suggested. I also hand patted them into my cast iron, never rolled them out and they turned out beautifully! Finally, something that's a keeper

I don't know what happened, but they didn't rise and are tasteless. It looked like an easy recipe for a non-baker, but I guess I'll be sticking to the frozen Pillsbury biscuits.

Great recipe. I found that letting them rest in the fridge for a few hours makes them big and beautiful!

Excellent recipe, very easy to make, biscuits turned out light & tasty, not heavy or gummy. I'm not a baker, so for this recipe to be so good on my first try is a huge deal for me lol. I used what was on hand- fat free milk & salted butter, it was delicious.

Seriously people, make these biscuits. I live at an altitude that makes homemade bread products very difficult to make. These turn out every time! Only thing I change is to use buttermilk instead of milk, but I'm sure they would be just fine with regular milk too.

Turned out OK but wish I had read the reviews first.  Will definitely try this again but will add only enough milk to moisten until dough comes together.  Will not knead as suggested.   Agree the less the dough is handled the better.

I thought this would be the go to biscuit recipe I had been looking for.  It was not, but I may try it again using suggestions from the others.  I made them exactly as written and I was disappointed.  They were more doughy than flaky and lacked flavor.  Next time I’ll use butter instead of shortening, add more salt and handle the dough even less than I did with this batch.

Used this recipe for bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and was not a fan of the sugar in them.  Otherwise they were okay...just not as good as my usual  biscuit recipe.

These were easy and great...loved that the dough was nice and damp so the biscuits turned out moist with a great golden bottom and top.  Nice rise, too!  I baked mine in a black iron skillet...yum!  Keep working with the dough to a bare minimum for best texture.  No one likes a tough biscuit.  Thanks for making this Southern girl happy.

The only thing "mongo" about this recipe is that it was a huge mongo failure.  Sorry John.  I have never had a recipe completely fail me on Allrecipes.com.  This was the first.

I made this three times and all I got were:  
a) hockey pucks and
b) things that resembled sugar cookies -- scratch that because sugar cookies actually have more rise.

I was very careful and even used some of the others' suggestions on this site.  No go.  No more J.P. biscuits for me -- Pillsbury here I come!

I need more stars lol. I'm a Yankee without female guidance for cooking. I'm in Tennessee now and my bucket list included learning to make biscuits from scratch. You made me a hero and helped me thru something that was rather personal, even if it was silly, out was still very personal. I can never thank you enough. Whomever continued this recipe, thank you from my heart. God bless.

Such a good, relatively quick recipe.  I make biscuits and gravy when family comes over on the weekends, sometimes as breakfast for dinner.   Also good as a biscuit with butter and jam.

I added an egg and used almond milk and whisked together and then added to dry mixture with blueberries. I shaped into scones and baked for 18-20 minutes and they turned out to be the best scones ever.

Excellent recipe.  They were light and Fluffy and Perfect.  I used this to make a version of Bojangles' BoBerry biscuits by adding 1 cup of blueberries while kneading the dough lightly and topping with a glaze made of powdered sugar and milk when they were done. * Note:  I did not have shortening so I used real butter instead.

I made 1 1/2 recipe. Used unrefined cane sugar, mixed the dry ingredients, grated 1/2 cup frozen butter into it, pulsed a  few times in my food processor. Added the milk, pulse a few more times and turned out onto the counter. This dough was a stinker to work with! It was so soft and sticky that I had an awful time patting it out and then cutting it. I ended up cutting each piece with a biscuit cutter, scraping it up with a spatula, and then shaping into a vague disc. I ended up with 10 nice size biscuits. I was convinced that they would not turn out, but I baked them anyway. I’m so glad that  I did because these are truly some of that that’s biscuits that I have ever made. Just a bit sweet - great with sausage gravy or jam!

I'm not sure what if anything I'm doing wrong but  I've made these biscuits twice and they will not rise I end up with flat biscuits. They also have a bitter after taste. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

This is an alright recipe. Definitely not the best on here.
I've now tried three different biscuit recipes on here and this one sits at #3. I think neading the do so much ruins the texture; I suggest mixing it, laying it out and rolling it to 1" would be sufficient.

pretty good...I did cut them with a pizza cutter as I wanted square shaped for sandwiches! I've made them twice, the first time I made the mistake of immediately putting in storage container - by the time I got them to work they were dense, probably from the trapped steam.

I would give this recipe ZERO stars if at all possible.  Kneading the dough turned the final product into a dense hockey puck.  The amount of salt is too high, the biscuits did not rise and the final texture was so grainy I spit out my first bite, well, what didn't immediately crumble the second I touched them. I would never recommend this recipe. Please heed my warning.

One inch dough thickness was too thick.  I would add a little more salt and roll the dough out to about 1/2 inches thick next time I make these, and I will make these again!

Recipe is great just as written. I like freedom fresh made offers, by allowing  me to season the dough to compliment a meal even further. This recipe yields only 6, so a perfect batch without much, if any left over.  My batch today was garlic enhanced to be a bed for chicken and gravy. Great comfort food there!

Based on everyone else's pictures, I goofed lol But they still came out fluffy and yummy, just a bit more dense and flatter  than intended. I'll try again but let them rise more next time.

I have made this biscuit recipe a couple dozen times, and they are perfect every time! Fluffy, flakey, extremely excellent flavor! When I make strawberry shortcake I sprinkle crunchy, large crystal sugar on top! They come out lovely and sweet!
These are the most delicious biscuits I’ve eaten since my Mom passed. They are just like hers! These biscuits rise high, and separate cleanly to reveal home made goodness! This recipe is the easiest I’ve ever made!

I combined the dry ingredients in the food processor, then added the cold butter that I had cut into small pieces.  I dribbled the milk in while pulsing the food processor.  Perfect.

Great recipie. I use it all the time. Just remember buscuits are 20% recipie and 80% technique.  If you struggle with this recipe, give it some extra practice  Learning how to handle the dough gently and not over mix it, and keeping everything cold are key.  I keep my shortening in the freezer. Also, get a pastry cutter. It makes all the difference.

I came upon this recipe because I needed biscuits  for my gravy. I rarely have buttermilk on hand.  My first go with these, after reading NUMEROUS reviews and suggestions was a little try.  Before my 2nd try, I watched the video and did EXACTLY as they did.  BAM!  They came out perfect!  This time they accompanied fried chicken.  Do not be afraid. of these they are easy for a first timer, like me.  The dough will be sticky, but after kneading will be easy to work with and cut.  I have done it both using my cast iron skillet with dough sides touching and just placed on a cookies sheet and they rise beautifully.  I DID NOT chill my shortening, just pulled it out of the pantry but I did use COLD milk.   I hope my tips help someone else.

I made them with butter instead of shortening and half and half. I mixed all of the dry ingredients with a whisk, trimmed the butter to very thin slices,  and used 3 ounces of butter. I used the whisk to stir it in until it looks clumpy, then I  added the half and half until it was a moist dough. I took it out of the bowl and put it on the counter. I pushed it down to about a 1/2 in thick, floured the top and folded and floured it about 10 times pushing it down every time. The Biscuits came out beautiful and taste  great!

I usually take the easy way out and make bought frozen biscuits, but I was out of them tonight. So I decided to make these. They are super easy to make and rise really well. My husband said they were better than the frozen biscuits (which are pretty darn good). Served them for dinner with eggs, sausage, and gravy over the biscuits.

I make these all the time now, love them. I have probably made these a dozen times in the last couple of months, it is now my go-to biscuit recipe. I have decided that this weekend I am going to make a couple batches and freezing them to bake as needed. Figured it would be easier and make more sense considering I do make them a lot. Thank you for sharing this, it's amazing!

These biscuits were so easy to make -- and they  were delicious too!  I could see myself making these whenever I need a quick biscuit or bread.  I have made them twice now.  The second time I added chopped rosemary to the dough; brushed the tops with melted butter, and sprinkled with a little sea salt.  But even without these changes, they were very good.

We love these biscuits! Big, fluffy, moist but not dense. So I've made them many times but today was different. I had no butter but was determined to make a nice lunch for my son who came over to visit. I used olive oil and they came out great! Slightly different flavor of course. And while I  normally serve them with butter (yum) I served these with olive oil with Italian spices and garlic salt. I did NOT knead this batch but mixed it a lot and I did have to add extra flour as it was runny. Scooped it out  with a 1/3 cup measuring cup onto the baking sheet. They were great!

I will never buy canned or boxed biscuit dough ever again. So easy and quick to make! Oh, and did I mention, they are delicious?! I used butter instead of shortening. Also, I followed another reviewer's tips to cut in COLD butter. Perfect stuff.

Loved these big fluffy yummy biscuits.  Added half butter in place of shortening  and a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  They were awesome.

This is a great recipe. I used pastry flour and lard but I believe they would still be tasty and fluffy without the changes.

My only biscuit recipe for the last couple of years. I'm finally writing a review. I absolutely love this recipe. I do use real butter instead of shortening. Biscuits come out so tender and melts in your mouth. The trick is to not knead so much just till ingredients are combined.

This recipe makes a tall, elegant biscuit that has a very tender, flaky, moist interior with a delicate crust. These biscuits are the closets taste and quality to my Ganny's. That's high praise since my Ganny was a pastry chef at one time for the Rice hotel in Houston. Everything she touched turned to yum!

I'm 69 years old and had never made biscuits.  So many years wasted!!  I used lard instead of shortening but followed recipe otherwise.  They turned out soft and flaky inside and had a slight crisp on the outside.  Delicious ... I will definitely be making again.

These are the best biscuits ever, I would use buttermilk instead of regular milk, or decrease the amount of regular milk used in the recipe. I use a dough hook to blend milk and dry ingredients, and I only use 3/4 cup regular milk per 6 biscuits instead of the full cup. Always double the recipe, these keep well in a ziplock for weekday snacks.

I reviewed this once, then thought I needed to add some cheese as for me that felt like the only thing missing. I used butter instead of shortening, and added 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese and YES! They are so delicious!

I have been looking for a recipe for years. I don't know why it took me so long to find this recipe. I LOVE IT.  So easy and perfect every time (after I realized not to roll my dough too thin).  Allrecipes NEVER fails me.  I have made with variation of buttermilk and frozen butter in the mix. EXCELLENT

This has been my go to recipe for biscuits for a few years now, once I discovered cooking from scratch was a way more enjoyable time in the kitchen. I always make a batch and a half.
  After making these, more times than I can remember, my only changes have been two things; I've started using bread flour and I really limit the kneading...I plop the dough  out onto a floured counter, give it about 5 "shmoosh and folds" (baking lingo!) and start cutting biscuits. I get about 12 to 14 fluffy, high rise biscuits...plus, with the end pieces I make an abstract, goofy biscuit for my granddaughter :)

Hope this helps...great recipe. Thanks!

Very easy quick recipe. Love the taste although I used butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any. I live out in the country and can't just zip to the store. Will use this recipe over and over again. Been looking for a bisquit recipe and this is the one.

I make these several times a month. I have used the recipe as written and have altered it. Every version has been good. Last time I made them, I added 3/4 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese,  1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp Italian herbs (tasted like Red Lobster's  biscuits).

Great biscuit and easy to make.   I made the full recipe but refrigerated half of the dough for the next day.  They were great both days. Thank you for an easy and good recipe.

My go to biscuit recipe. Absolutely delicious. Every time I make them everyone raves and there isn’t a single biscuit left. The key is to not over handle the dough. Just cut in the butter, mix the milk in until everything is wet, dump out on the counter, pat down and cut out whatever shape you want (I’ve done them all) and bake. Don’t over bak either. I love adding in seasoning a like basil or adding shredded cheese. I also love making these to top my vegetable melody.

I've made these dozens of times and they always come out great.  Sometimes in a humid climate I have to add significantly less milk (think half), so be sure to add it gradually and stop when it starts to get sticky. I always get 6 biscuits - don't go smaller in order to get more! The best part about them is that they're big and thick.

I am not traditionally a baker but I love to cook. I have decided recently I prefer homemade much much more than store bought processed stuff. These biscuits were amazing. I subbed butter for shortening out of necessity, but will try them next time with shortening and maybe buttermilk. This was an easy recipe to follow and they come out so beautiful!!

I made the suggested change of only 2tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp shaking soda. Also added another tsp sugar and used butter instead of shortening. There are without a doubt the best biscuits I've ever made. I'll be using this recipe from now on! DELICIOUS!!!

I really liked this.   I have my own recipe that i usually make, however those are too fragile when making biscuit sandwiches and are always falling apart. This recipe worked wonderful.  The biscuits were light, yet firm enough that the biscuit didn't all crumble up when bitten into.  This is a keeper.  Definately will be my go to from now on.

I made these and they were pretty flat, then I realized that there is no acid in the recipe to activate the baking powder.  (Usually buttermilk is the acid, but milk doesn’t have enough acid.). I added just a pinch of cream of tartar and they rose beautifully.  So this is my new biscuit recipe with just that little addition.  Or you could use beer like one cook did, also with great results.

Not a fan of the sugar content, but nice biscuits nonetheless, despite being a tad doughy. I put a thumb print in the centre of each to aid rising (Chef John of All Recipes method) and brushed the tops with buttermilk to enhance browning (Chef John method).

I used self rising flour but I checked the proportions of baking powder to flour and they are the same as in this recipe. Beautiful fluffy biscuits.

My go-to biscuit recipe.  Super easy and PERFECT biscuits every time.  A couple of tips.  Don't over roll the dough.  Use a light hand and cut the biscuits thick.  Roll consistently to avoid misshapen humps and nodules, but don't press down too much.  Also, use parchment paper on the baking pan.  Parchment has magical properties.  I will give the bottoms a nice golden color, without it scorching.  I've made these with and without parchment and the results are vastly better with parchment.  Finally, don't let too many people know once you've perfected this recipe.  Old and young alike will beg you to make these over and over....

I loved this Recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to make two batches. The first batch I made according to the instructions and they were great but had a bitter after taste. The second batch I lowered the baking powder increasted the sugar and used buttermilk. OMG! What fantastic biscuits. One person was correct with their coment on using a biscuit cutter, the sharp edge helps. What ever you do Don’t over work your dough. I Only knew omg dough two times( just enough to get it covered in flour and a ball shape) I will keep this Recipe for some time . Love it.

These were great on the  side with stew, and for breakfast with butter and jam the next morning. Yum! I may try adding some rosemary next time I make them.

Turned out great, HOWEVER this doesn't make very many.  Each batch only makes about 6 and that is with rolling the dough to 1/2 inch thick.  So if you need a ton double, triple the recipe.  I also used butter flavored Crisco.

First off, THANK YOU to the reviewer who so kindly pointed out that over working the dough creates more gluten, rendering the end product hard. With that in mind, I followed the recipe except for substituting butter for shortening. This is the first time I've tried to make homemade biscuits, after a number of attempts, that resulted in fluffy, delicious biscuits! We live at around 2000 ft., so I adjusted my baking temp (decreasing by 10 degrees), and baked for 13 minutes. The tops of the biscuits did not come out golden brown, like the ones in the recipe's picture, but they were still very good. I'm really happy to have finally made edible biscuits!!

I originally thought this recipe was for buttermilk biscuits and got all the way through it before I realized my mistake. I added 1 cup of buttermilk instead of regular milk and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda. The dough seemed a little wet when I rolled it out. The biscuits did not rise much at all but they tasted amazing. I’ll tweak this recipe a little bit more.

very good recipe!! Easy also.  I stink at making biscuits but this is the best recipe, the first one i made that turned out.  I made them in a cast iron skillet like another person suggested, butter in preheating oven and then flip the biscuits after placing them in so the get butter on both sides.  Thanks to both of you!!

These are the best baking powder biscuits I've ever made.  I substituted buttermilk for milk and added 1/4 tsp. baking soda. I added a little more buttermilk so dough was slightly sticky. Kneaded the dough as recipe states.  That did not make them tough as some have stated. These were moist, tender, fluffy and high. So yummy!

I don't know if anyone else experienced this, but when I added the milk, I got batter, not dough. I double checked...made sure I have 2 cups of flour and hadn't missed anything else. So, I added another cup of flour; three total. From there, everything went fine. I did not knead my dough, though. Everything I've ever read about biscuit making says to just do enough to bring the dough together.

Oh.My.Hell.  
Best and easiest biscuit recipe I've ever tried!  They came out light, fluffy and sooooo irresistible!  I was able to get almost 1 1/2 dz out of this recipe and I used all the dough.  I've always used butter but I think the shortening is what makes the difference.  They had a nice rise and with the little extra bit of sugar, a wonderful taste.  This recipe is a keeper!

Fantastic recipe! I baked mine in my cast iron skillet after melting a stick of butter in it first (placed raw biscuit in melted butter, then flipped and then baked in oven). This created a to die for buttery “crunch” that everyone raves about. Thanks for the recipe, J.P. 5 Stars,

Fast and easy. Needed a non-yeast recipe because we were in a hurry.  These fluffed up and were tender and flaky.  I rolled them out like puff pastry dough.  Roll the dough, brush lightly with butter, fold dough into thirds, repeat.  Then cut.  Then gather scraps and repeat.  Thanks for the quick biscuit recipe!

I made these exactly the recipe says, except I ended up not needing the full cup of flour. I used more like 2/3 cup.  I have never been able to make really good biscuits. I have tried so many recipes, so many methods, and have never been able to do it! I wanted to do a victory fist pump when I pulled these out of the oven.  They were tall, SOFT, had the perfect crumb.  I will be making these a lot for sure!

These biscuits come out very fluffy and have a great texture. I gave it only four stars as they don't have much flavor. They really taste like flour and not much else. They need a little something else to them, so I may try butter instead of shortening and maybe a little more sugar on another attempt.

Good recipe.  I used fresh milled wheat, so I used 2.5 cups of flour to compensate.  I also used butter instead of shortening.  They came out good.  I used a small biscuit cutter and only had 8 biscuits.  Next time I will flatten to 1/2" - 3/4" to get more biscuits out of it.  These were nearly taller than they were wide!

This is the absolute best biscuit recipe I have ever used!!!  The biscuits are so delicious. I have to make several batches when my family comes to visit because they love them. When they are right out of the oven I brush them with butter. Letting all that delicious goodness soak into them.  My mother - in- law asks me to make the biscuits!!!

Mine was a little too sticky...probably should have added a little more flour....and not as pretty as the ones in the picture....but I really like that you can refrigerate overnight  after mixing and bake the next morning.  Will be doing this  again .

New update: 1/16/19
I was kneading them like I do bread dough. I watched a video today and learned how to knead biscuit dough. they turned out really good and flaky. Someone told me to keep the dough as cold as possible so I mixed the dry ingredients together then placed them in the freezer for 15 minutes.  I use butter instead of shortening. I always bake them in cast-iron. I pre-heat the skillet then i place butter in the bottom, I place the biscuits upside down in the butter then flip them over to bake. The bottoms come out nice and brown, crisp with a nice butter flavor. 

Update 12/24/2018
I made these biscuits today. I didn't have any shortening so I used butter. Another recipe said to pat them out and then fold it three times like a letter then repeat 7 times. I did that with these and they turned out great. I used a big glass to cut them out so I only got 5 of them. They turned out big and tasty. 

I was hungry for pigs in a blanket so I searched for a good biscuit recipe. I found this one so I made half a batch and that was just right for five hot dogs. My main problem was it's pushing 100 degrees outside so I was not about to turn the oven on.  I saw on a Facebook group someone backed bread on the BBQ grill so I figured why not. I preheated my cast iron skillet on the stove for a couple minutes and then placed them on it. I don't have a thermometer on the grill so I have no idea how hot it was but it was hot since they finished in 16 minutes. I turned the skillet 18

Nope.  Didn't work.  All that happened is that is jut stuck to everything and never seemed to mix correctly.  I ended up with half the dough and ver could get it to roll out correct.  Not sure what the mixture problem was but I followed it as explained.  The dough was too milky and stuck to everything.  As others say, it is the milk/flour mixture that just isn't right.  I ended up with a mess and half the dough I started with.

These biscuits turned out perfect!! I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I think that added the perfect amount of flavor. These are amazing, good ole Southern biscuits. Delicious with butter and jam!

My first review after years of membership! The Biscuits ROCK!
I followed the directions to the letter and was left with a sticky mess. I decided to add more flour and stir until I could atleast knead the dough. Cut them too thin their first time around, so had so knead it back together,  second time...success!
I had no hope they would turn out but put them in the oven anyway, they were 3 inches thick and VERY tasty!!! I went a ahead and made my gravy! (I was waiting to see how the biscuits turned out, otherwise I was going another route with the sausage) I am mixing the night before to see if they do get taller! Thx for my new biscuit recipe!

This is a consistently great recipe. The only changes I make are adding two tablespoons of butter in with everything else and it works better when I use a pastry cutter over a food processor.

I wasn't crazy on these... I thought they were pretty dense and hard. I've never heard of kneading biscuit dough before, usually you want to handle it as little as possible. Size wise I didn't think they rose up any bigger than regular biscuits. And like some other reviewers have said, I thought the taste was pretty bland. They weren't gross, they just weren't good.

I adore this recipe.  I found it a years back and have used it ever since.  I make a few adjustments everyone and then.  Use butter instead of shortening, honey instead of sugar.  So YUMMY!  Thank you for sharing. :)

Yum!  This recipe works every time.  It was hard to work with dried blueberries but shredded cheese works well :). I added shredded cheese then wrapped it around pepperoni sticks.  Left overs still had enough for biscuits.  Don't forget to bake Sean side down.  I forgot and well they split.  This also works well for hotdogs.

I liked them, but they were not quite what I would call biscuits. They tasted more like homemade rolls. I would make them again, but not as buscuits

I have made these several times now. I substitute half the shortening with butter.  I also bake mine in a cast iron skillet put very close together which causes them to rise higher. I make these about an hour before baking and let them set which also causes them to rise even further. Be sure to grease the bottom of your skillet and I use bacon grease for that. Yes, I do. They come out tall, flakey, tender and delicious.

I have been testing and retesting biscuit recipes for about 2 years to find the one I could recreate most frequently in my climate. These are those. I don't have to keep buttermilk in the fridge either which is nice since biscuits are the only thing I use that for. This recipe is easy, fast, and you probably have everything you need for it already on hand. I keep my Crisco in the freezer which might help. Highly recommend lightly broiling them to turn them golden brown when the baking time is up BUT don't walk away. Nothing sadder than a burnt biscuit.

Perfect! Nicely browned on the outside, soft and light on the inside. I used butter, not shortening. I made drop biscuits to avoid kneading such a sticky dough, and they turned out great.

My search is over, I have found the best recipe for biscuits.  This has become a must have on the weekends for my family.  I have made this recipe several times, making slight adjustments.  The best outcome for me is to use butter milk  instead of milk and 1 stick of frozen butter, chopped into small pieces instead of shortening.  My 12 year old daughter has become a pro at making these biscuits.

I used 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda. Cold butter instead of shortening, and buttermilk instead of milk. Great flavor. So easy.

The biscuits are nice,light and flavorful. I did add 1/4 tsp soda and substituted butter and buttermilk. I use another method in mixing and forming. For this reason I awarded this rating. Overall a very nice biscuit with lovely volume. A keeper!

Made 40+ of these for a big potluck and church and everyone loved them so much they were taking them home. Then found out a few days later people liked them so much they were the topic of conversation at a Bible study 2 days after I brought them, lol. These are fantastic and super easy to make! Worth a try for sure!

I've made this recipe a few times and they were ok but today they turned out perfect. Apparently I had been over mixing the dough. This time they were light and fluffy.  I think the next time I'll add a little more salt. Then the time after that,  I'll  try it with butter to see how the  flavor changes.

I have made this several times and they are always a crowd pleaser.  The recommendation to let the dough rest before forming and baking is a good one.  Also, many, many flourings, foldings, and rollings make these even airier and easier to split.

These weren't bad, they definitely didn't turn out huge,  but I think I rolled the dough out to thin as I got 13 biscuits out of it! Texture was great, nice and fluffy, but they were missing something  in flavor that I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe butter.  I would like to try again and substitute butter for shortening and see if that makes a difference! Good recipe to play around with!

Just tried making these again, all of them are going in the trash. Burned on the bottom and taste like I'm eating baking soda. Don't know what I'm doing wrong but sadly wont be trying again. Made these to bring down to a dinner but looks like I'll be making a pit stop to grab a can of biscuits from the store..

I love this recipe, it's light and fluffy and I always have all the ingredients. I substitute butter for shortening as a rule because shortening weirds me out, and normally I don't write a review if I modify the recipe but the effect of that change is negligible. These biscuits were great with gravy, as a chicken and biscuit sandwich, and by itself. Will make again.

Achieving the perfect southern style biscuit can be elusive. This is a great recipe. However, mastering biscuit making technique is also an important ingredient. I agree with Discobunny; the buttermilk powder/ice cold water substitute for milk improves it a bit, but it's still very good using the original recipe. 

A few well-intentioned tips: Light kneeding is essential. Do not over-handle this dough. It should be somewhat wet/sticky when you turn it out and should  stay that way.  A light dusting of flour as you kneed will help you handle it. Please do yourself a favor and learn how to kneed biscuit dough and this recipe will work. It's not like kneeding bread dough. Also, practice.  

Next, I used lard and bread flour and the biscuits were especially soft and held together well (good if you're making biscuit sandwiches) and didn't crumble to the touch. Solid Crisco shortening also works well, as well as varying combinations of vegetable shortening and butter. Try grating frozen butter  or lard and you'll get great results.  

I also suggest that you weigh your flower instead of volume measuring it. You get much more accurate and consistent results.  2 cups of all purpose flour =
8.5 ounces or 240 grams.  Same weight for bread flour.  I hope these tips help.

I loved these biscuits! Best recipe for biscuits I've ever used . Only thing I changed was used 1/3 cup butter instead of shortening only because I had none. Also brushed the tops with melted butter before baking . Delicious ! Those who had tough biscuits remember only kneed till the dough comes together otherwise you will have hockey pucks .

Great biscuits.  It is important that you only handle the flour enough to get things mixed.  Instead of kneading, I recommend folding in thirds and patting them out three times.  Also, the brand of flour you use is important.  I only use Dixie Lily or Pillsberry for biscuits.  They are very low gluten flours and make great busicuits.  I also HIGHLY recommend you use a scale to weigh your flour (4.5 ounces a cup for a total of 9 ounces flour)..  It makes all the difference in consistency when baking.

Great recipe! I made my biscuits a little small because I was worried about making them -too- big, have a better idea of how thick they should be now, but other than that, they were perfect! Made with butter instead of shortening and mixed with my hands (found it to be easier).

These biscuits are INCREDIBLE!!!  I didn't quite need the whole cup of milk but that could be different the next  I make them.  Just add the milk a bit at a time.  Do not handle the dough too much.  I turned the dough out onto parchment paper and made folds in the dough using the parchment paper, rotating parchment paper 14 turns/kneads and dusted the dough lightly when needed.  Clear as mud?  Learned that technique from a King Arthur Flour Co. YouTube video.  

Next time I'm going to try substituting beer for milk and butter for Crisco!

You definitely need to make these! I don't really use salt, so I cut back to 1/2 tsp. I recommend you just follow the recipe. Lol It needs the salt!
Also I had no milk so I substituted coffee creamer.  Worked just fine. I'll definitely make these again! Thank you!

Outstanding and simple to make. Skip the kneading. Added a little garlic and onion powder and used butter and half and half. Baked in a butter coated cast iron skillet at 475 for 12 mins. Turned out GREAT. Will try beer next time.

The first time I made these they were vary dense and I could taste the baking powder and were bland. This time I sifted the dry ingredients together than I followed Discobunny's suggestion of cutting back on the baking powder to two tsp and 1 tsp baking soda. They  turned  out lighter  and the baking powder taste was gone. It would be the perfect biscuit however they are still bland.

Finally, after many years of marriage, I can finally make biscuits without my husband saying "These are not as good as my mother  made".  As a child his friends liked to be at his house in the mornings so they could snag a biscuit and they still rave about them.  So glad I found this recipe.  Thank you Big Daddy.

These are the best biscuits I've ever made. The only thing I changed was using butter instead of shortening.  These took approx. 23 minutes to bake as they are very thick-cut.

Like others, I used butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of milk. I also  used 1tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, which gave the biscuits some added flavor. Yum!

Finally a biscuit recipe that  turns out the way I like biscuits! The only change I made was using butter (same measurement) instead of shortening. That was Only because I didn't have shortening on hand. I usually don't so I'll continue to use butter. Love them! Thank you!

I had no bread for breakfast, so I decided to try these biscuits.  I made them exactly as per the recipe, and when they were done, I drizzled a little melted butter over the top (left over from the eggs I made to go with them).  They were easy to make.  Next time I will use butter for the recipe, instead of shortening, as I think it will give them more flavor, but it's a really simple basic recipe and I will definitely be making them again.

Fabulous!! Only change I made was using buttermilk instead of regular, and did not knead the dough. Patted it out on a floured cutting board to a thickness of about an inch. I wish you could smell the house right now!  Gotta run, the blackberry preserves are calling me.

These are perfect for kids in the house when you run out of groceries! And since I almost never have yeast and it only calls for baking soda, it is a snack saver. So glad I found it and I used this same recipe years and years ago and here I am again using it!!

These were super easy to make and turned out better than I expected.  I made these to go along with a gravy recipe on this site.  It was a huge success.  The only changes I made were 1.  I used salted butter instead of shortening 2.  I used 2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp soda instead of all powder.  I also used 2% milk.  I did not knead the mix.  They were delicious and we will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Love this recipe! I used butter instead of shortening because I prefer it. I cut up the butter into half inch squares and folded into dough. I did mix until combined and skipped the kneading as recommended in other reviews. In my experiences, kneading is not a good thing when it comes to biscuits. These are dense, buttery and perfect for smothering in gravy!

Made per instructions. Used self-rising flour. Used frozen butter grated on the cheese grater and parchment paper on the counter for easier cleanup. Gradually add the milk as not all may be needed. Used a glass to cut the biscuits .... making sure not to twist.. Very easy recipe to follow. Made them for Thanksgiving.

These were great! I am a baker and have tried many different biscuit recipes. I only had almond milk on hand so used that with a few tablespoons of sour cream (to add some fat). It's important to add milk a little at a time until dough just comes together. As other's recommended, I let the dough sit for about an hour before cutting and baking. I also substituted half the shortening with butter, for flavor.

These were by far the easiest and best biscuits I have ever made. I substituted the shortening for butter and they turned out perfectly. They were so big and fluffy. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will use this every time I want to make biscuits.

Just a quick note - if you sub butter that's salted you may consider lowering the salt a tad.

I tried this recipe and the biscuits were great. I've made them several times and they turn out big and fluffy everytime. - Update this is my go to recipe and now I use real butter instead of shortening, just because I like the buttery taste. They turn out great!

These biscuits are PERFECT, great flavor and texture. This is the only biscuit recipe for me. I make it as  written except I use butter instead of shortening. A few tips to help make sure yours turn out perfectly every time ... WEIGH your flour. If you're just scooping you really have no idea how much flour you're getting and it's often too much.  If you're using butter (my favorite) freeze it first, then GRATE it into the flour. Do NOT dump the whole cup of milk in at once, start with about 2/3 c and only add more if needed. You may not need a full cup and too much liquid makes them dense. Make sure your baking powder is FRESH, it loses its freshness quickly so you need to replace it every 6 -12 months. Enjoy!

I will make these again! They are huge and fluffy soft and a little flaky. The only change I made was instead of The shortening I used coconut oil.

This is the best and easiest way to do biscuits !! I will  tweak it to suit our taste buds.  The recipe works for sweet and savory applications.  My  Honey has renamed them "little Mama" biscuits, and asks for them often.  So versatile !!

I have tried a few other recipes for biscuits, and my family has enjoyed these most for breakfast biscuits! They hold together well and raise to be thick enough to cut in half! They remind me of fresh Bob Evans biscuits but slightly more dense.

I avoid baking at all costs, excluding box mixes. But, since I had a great sausage gravy recipe I bit the bullet with homemade biscuits! These were great, buttery flavor and a nice crumb. They didn't rise much though. I grated very cold butter with a cheese grater and added the given amount of salt while using salted butter. I added an extra half cup of milk (tip, next time add all the milk and wait for a bit to let it all moisten). The dough was quite tacky but I just floured a cutting board generously and used a glass cup to cut out rounds. This is my go to biscuit recipe :)

GLUTEN FREE/FODMAP VERSION: made these using Bob's Red Mills ALL PURPOSE baking flour (2 cups plus 2 tsp Xanthan Gum). I used Lactose Free milk and reg butter (FODMAP diet allows). You can substitute flour-per-flour with the addition of Xanthan Gum, in most cases. Bob's flour has a chart to help you determine how much Xanthan Gum to add per cup based on what you are cooking.

Amazing! The only change I made was to use butter, and I kneaded them as little as possible. So good, my partner and I accidentally ate them all in one morning.

Perfect. These are SO good. Fluffy, stay together, delicious. I am so happy to FINALLY have a good biscuit recipe. And it is SO easy.
Note: the dough was not very solid when I turned it out on the flour. But not to worry, it will firm up enough in the turning. 
Make these. you'll love them. Honey and butter; bacon, cheese and lettuce; sausage and mustard ... these hold up to it all  ;-)

My dough was more like thick pancake batter.  I had to add more flour to get it to pull away from the side of the bowl just to get it onto my board for kneading.  Other than that they were ok. I probably won't make them again.

So the first time I made these, I followed the directions exactly, and though they tasted OK, they had a slight  taste of flour and baking powder. So the next time I put in two extra teaspoons of butter (I didn't use lard, I never have lard on hand)  and really worked that in. And instead of 1 cup of milk, I used maybe 1/3 to a 1/2  cup, just so that it comes together and isn't dry. Followed the directions after that, kneading 15 times. Baked for 15 minutes, and then took them out and gently brushed the tops with butter. They were PERFECT. Delicious!

Omg. I was feeling really sick today but my husband works physically very hard and I made Chicken Noodle Soup, I did not gave the endurance to make buns, so I made these biscuits just as written, I used butter instead of shortening.... Instead of cutting them out and handling the dough lots, I patted it into a big round circle and cut it in 8 wedges. My son devoured 2... I absolutely loved them, usually biscuits give me heart burn and these were fabulous, no heart burn. This will be my main recipes from now on... Thank you very much for this great recipe.

We really liked it.It's a simple recipe and tastes good. I made it in my food processor. Put all the dry ingredients in and swirled them together and then I cut 1/3 cup of butter up and put it in and pulsed until the pieces were pretty small and evenly distributed. I used 1 cup of buttermilk rather than milk as well.

Awesome recipe, it has been a go to recipe now for years. And even my mother in law (who is a great baker) asked recently to have it. ;)

I followed directions to the letter but it was too much liquid and the dough was too wet. Only add a bit at a time instead of using the amount in recipe. Did not really rise. I will try again with less liquid and review this recipe again.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I found it last night and made it this morning.  I've never been able to make good biscuits despite being a good baker.  I think all the tips provided by reviewers are what really helped me.   The trick is to handle the dough as little as possible and mix gently.  Treat it like pie dough.  I used butter instead of shortening, buttermilk instead of milk and 2 tbsp. of sugar instead of 1 tbsp.  Also I absolutely LOVED the trick the one reviewer noted, freezing the butter and then grating it.  If you have an electric grater, no need to freeze it, but the grating works so well and makes the cutting in process so much quicker and easier.  When adding the grated butter to the flour mixture, try to get the grated butter in there as singularly as possible, then fluff with a fork.  Then using a pastry cutter, cut in for just about a minute, then you're done with that step.  

These biscuits are SO tender, this is a keeper recipe!!!

These are my "go to" biscuits. Like other reviews, I occasionally use butter instead of shortening. The biscuits always come out flaky and delicious.

Easy and tasty. Had these with scrambled eggs for breakfast so only used half a tsp of sugar. Also cut the BP to 2 tsp and used butter straight from the freezer. Barely kneaded them at all, just a couple of times to bring the dough together on the board. Baked for 14 minutes at 420 until just starting to brown on top- my oven runs a little hot and I prefer my baked goods lightly done. They rose well and tasted delicious.

I added a little sugar to the biscuit mix and also used 0 sodium baking powder to control the amount of salt that is in this recipe. This was a great recipe that I loved and finding as the go to recipe for breakfast biscuits now. LOVE It!!!

I've made this recipe so many times now. Flawless. Can I tell y'all something though? Mix some shredded cheddar (like a cup) into the batter, and just spoon out lumps onto the pan. Don't worry about kneading or rolling, life's too short. While those are  baking, whip up some melted butter+garlic+parsley, then brush that on top when the biscuits are done. You now have copycat cheddar bay biscuits, like Red Lobster.

I almost rated it three stars but when I tasted this I couldn't. It's buttery and soft. This took a lot more work than it looked like. The butter wasn't sticking to the flour so I just added the milk early. There was too much milk so I ended up adding way more flour than needed. I couldn't knead the dough then because it wasn't unstickey enough. The biscuits weren't even that big but it tasted great so that's why I put four stars.

We make these biscuits almost every week for various meals.  Sometimes instead of cutting them out we just make balls and stuffed chunks of cheddar or mozzarella cheese inside for a tasty cheese bomb.  They are also great coated in an herb butter before baking.

I've made these biscuits several times but always ignored the part about kneading the dough; I've always treated my biscuits like pie crust and handled the dough as little as possible. And my biscuits always came out a little flat. Tonight I made them again and had one PERFECT biscuit out of the batch: perfectly risen with golden edges, splitting slightly in half straight out of the oven. It was the "reject" biscuit I'd made out of the dough scraps, which had been worked and rerolled. Can't wait to make these again following the recipe's instructions!

I love these biscuits, my husband says they taste better than anything you'd get in a restaurant. I do always substitute COLD unsalted butter for shortening due to personal preference. They rise up nice and fluffy and are deliciously buttery. They come together fast and easy. I cut them out with an old bar glass I have (sizes them just how we like!) since I don't have a biscuit cutter. Make sure you only add as much milk as you need, I've also used buttermilk in a pinch and they were great then too (I did have to add slightly more due to the thicker nature). DO NOT OVERMIX YOUR DOUGH, you will end up with dense, yucky biscuits. I have served them with sausage gravy but my husband's favorite is to have them as breakfast sandwiches with eggs, cheese and bacon or sausage patties.

These biscuits turned out amazing! They are the biggest fluffiest biscuit recipes I've tried. I didn't have all purpose flour only had unbleached bread flour and they still turned out amazing I just brush them with melted butter before I put them in the oven and then once again once they came out of the oven and they were delicious with the little drizzle of honey

Made these this morning, came out great! I will definitely stick with this recipe.
I took the tips from the other reviews and did not overly mix the dough. Since the  butter is cold, I would suggest cutting the butter into smaller pieces to better incorporate it. 

Baked for 14 minutes, made six biscuits. Combined with sausage and gravy.

These are a big surprise for me.  I needed a scone recipe last minute and found these.  I whipped them together very quickly; didn't even have time for kneading and they came out fantastic.  We have a vegan in the family so I subsituted shortening for vegan butter and used non-dairy milk.  The consistency was very sticky and I didn't hold out much hope.  I just used a spoon to place a dollop of dough on the cookie sheet and missed out the whole rolling and cutting the dough and they still came out great.  The second time I grated orange rind and added that and plan on doing a number of variations.

I loved this recipe! The only changes I made were substituting butter for shortening, using buttermilk instead of milk and reducing baking powder to 2tsp and adding 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I don't have a pastry cutter so I couldn't "cut" the butter into the dough. Instead I cubed it up and threw it in. It was still in chunks when I baked it but I think it made the bottoms and top nice and crispy. I love the flavor and texture of these. Will definitely make these again and again! 
*i made 9 smaller biscuits and baked for 14 minutes.

Very doughy, could do with less milk. Overall, pretty good and crispy.

This is the best biscuit recipe there is, in my opinion. For those who struggle to find a biscuit recipe, remember 2/3 of biscuit making is pure technique. Just practice it and be careful not to overwork the dough. It also really matters what ingredients to use. I only use Rumfield baking soda for my biscuits, because  it  doesn't  leave a baking soda aftertaste. I also use butter instead of shortning.

Wasn't as fluffy as I hoped. I used the last of my baking powder, I will try again with new baking powder. Good, I loved the crispy edges.

It was messy to make but tasted wonderful! The only draw back was it was a bit bland and not as moist as I had hoped.

This has become my go-to recipe for biscuits. Easy to make, with big fluffy results. Hubby loves them with gravy. I use freshly made baking soda (not that difficult to make and fresh is great) and butter instead of shortening. They come out light and fluffy every time. 

It's at the point now that I have to triple the recipe every time. Oh, well, just means there are one or two for snacks later on, if I remember to hide them from my crew.

I will never us another recipe after making these biscuits. They were moist and flaky in the middle and golden brown on the outside. I used the recipe as written but only needed about 3/4 cup of milk. As others have said I barely worked the dough after it came together. These are pure heaven......you won't regret making them!

This biscuit recipe was good, but the key to really really good biscuits is to increase the baking powder from one Tablespoon to three Tablespoons and switch the milk to buttermilk.  I have been making my biscuits like this for years and make them the night before and let them rise at room temperature the next day before sticking them in the oven will definitely get you the big talk about biscuits that you want.

Very buttery, delicious biscuits, but they were a bit on the denser side.  This biscuit is seriously addicting, and it uses less than the one stick of butter usually used.  The bottoms were a bit dark, but not burned. It's a keeper!  
Tip: One cup of milk may seem like a lot, and when I turned it out it was very, very sticky, but just make sure it's on a well floured surface.   For browning, make sure you turn the pan around halfway through.

These turned out phenomenonally, though I did make a few tweaks. I made the dough a few hours in advance and let it sit in the fridge. I cut the baking powder down to 2 teaspoons and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. I substituted the shortening for butter and the milk for buttermilk. Finally, I added a drizzle of honey to the dough. Delightful and HUGE.

First off, I have made these a good 25+ times so I speak from experience when I say that these are a great recipe that results in great biscuits, it is fairly simple, but I would suggest you get biscuits cutters and a pastry knife. A pastry knife makes cutting in the butter/shortening easier. I use butter instead of shortening (butter creates a flakey biscuit with more layers) but shortening works perfectly fine. I have had almost no problems with this straight forward recipe and I would definitely recommend that you make these lovely biscuits.

This is the recipe that has made our biscuit and gravy mornings perfect. What absolutely perfect biscuits! I definitely feel that using a dough cutter to cut in the shortening, then using an actual biscuit cutter for shaping them is what makes them look like a nice restaurant did them. Love these! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is our favorite! I use butter instead of shortening and usually a little less milk.  The secret to soft biscuits is to NOT OVERWORK the dough.  Mix until just bound and then pat into shape before cutting with cutter.

I followed the recipe, brushing with butter before baking on the top rack. Baked for 13 min and they were perfect. A little dry, maybe I'll try using butter instead of shortening. Texture was good, will definitely make again

I will be certainly making these again, but there are a couple things that need to be changed. First, when I made them the first time, one cup of milk was too much and made it into hard drop biscuits. So I highly recommend you put 3/4 of milk. I also realized that the hotter the stove is the better they come out.(around 400-420) but don't leave them in too long, because then they will become hard. I also added about 1/3 of butter along with 1/3 of shortening. butter gives them better consistency as well as better taste. I also suggest put an egg wash( brushing a beaten egg over the top) as it keeps moisture and keeps then fluffy. Once again make sure you put 3/4 of milk! if you do these simple tips, they will be five star biscuits! loved them!

These biscuits always turn out great for me. I substitute butter for the shortening, otherwise i keep it the same! I also find using whole wheat flour makes them really hard and they dont rise very much, so i use either half whole wheat and half unbleached all purpose flour or all all purpose. they have a better texture and better rise.

This is a really good biscuit recipe, but it takes some experimenting to get them where you want them. Our flour is heavier than flour in the US so I have to use more baking powder to get proper lift. I also have to double the recipe if I want to end up with 8 large biscuits. Make sure you dont overwork the dough.

Really liked them the first time I made them. But, being a Southern girl,  I used lard and cut a half a stick of butter in the recipe. Also I...wait for it..used bacon drippings. Don't worry health nuts, I substituted 2%milk for whole milk.

My husband LOVES biscuits and he says these are the best he's ever had! I let the dough sit in the fridge overnight and did not knead as other reviewers recommended. I used butter instead of shortening and brushed the tops with butter and garlic after removing from the oven. I don't own biscuit cutters and used a glass instead. They still rose beautifully but I'll be buying cutters for my next batch to make sure the edges aren't sealed. I did re-form the dough for the last two biscuits and while they weren't as pretty, they still rose and tasted delightful! Thank you for this recipe! I'm excited to freeze a batch to bake as needed!

Followed other suggestion, used 3 tsp of apple cider vinegar in the cup of milk to make buttermilk, used 2.5 tsp of baking powder. May use 3 next time to make them even taller! The best biscuit we have ever tried ! Oh and used 1/3 c Butter. No trans fat shortening in our house...

These came out perfect.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I added 1 tsp of vinegar to the milk to give them that buttermilk flavor.  Also it is a very wet dough but you add flour as you knead to get it to the right consistency.  Knead as directed but  be careful to not over knead or they they can become hard.

I made these bisquits and they turned out fabulous! I used butter instead of lard and half and half cream instead of milk(didn't realize I was out of milk). They are so moist and fluffy. I will make these again for sure!

Ok, I've been making this recipe for about 10 years now about twice a month... because it's good.  I've also made small changes a lot, just to see what would happen.  I won't bore you with all of them, but if I may, a few pointers.
1.  Use lard.  Not crisco, not anything other than lard.   
2. Grate the lard frozen or very, very cold and measure, 62g is just right for the recipe.  And put it in the freezer until ready to mix.
3.  Use AP flour if you have to, but if you have anything lighter use it, not cake flour, but the point is that you want not a ton of gluten, they're biscuits, not bread.  
4.  Use only as much milk as you need to get the mixture to not have any dry bits on the bottom of the bowl.  I've made them mostly by hand, but lately been using my Ankarsrum Assistent with good results.  The milk needs to be COLD and if you'd like, use buttermilk. 
5.  Once the lumpy goodness has been achieved and it forms a wet mass that you can get out of the bowl.  Do so and with a liberal amount of flour pat down to about 3/4".  Fold once horizontally, and then vertically and once more if you can.  Then pat down till about 3/4" again. 6.  Thou Shalt Not Twist the Cutter.

This is the best biscuit recipe ever. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I left out the sugar and they still were awesome. I also used butter instead of shortening because shortening is horribly bad for you. Then I began making them with whole wheat flour and the are still super fluffy. My daughters love them at breakfast some times they won't eat anything else so I began replacing 1/4 cup flour for 1/4 cup protein powder and still they are super fluffy. Some times before I add the milk I will add 1/2cup of shredded cheese and they still come out fluffy. I have also added garlic salt to pair with pasta dishes. This is definitely the best biscuit ever.

I just made these biscuits and  what a hit!!  These are so easy to make and the taste is wonderful.  Big & beautiful.

Can these be doubled so you don't have to make two batches?  

Thank you so much.

Never made biscuits before. I chose this recipe because I did not have buttermilk or cream of tartar which others required. I had all these ingredients and followed this exact recipe. Pure Perfection! I'm from the south and this could have been Biscuitville's recipe! My only regret is I used a juice cup so they turned out small. Making these again and bigger soon!

I followed another review and only used 2tsp baking powder and 1tsp of baking soda instead of the tablespoon of baking powder in the original recipe . I also used half ghee half coconut oil instead of shortening and coconut milk in place of cows milk. This is what I had on hand, but they were still so good! 
Thank you for the recipe.

I have made these biscuits many times and we've always liked them but I never thought they came out quite as big as advertised. This time I made the biscuit batter, turned it out on a floured board and folded over in thirds, like a business letter, pulling in all the loose bits as I went. I did this about three or four times, changing the direction of the fold each time  and then patted it out into a rectangle, wrapped it in cling wrap and put it in the frig for about 3-4 hours. When it came time to bake them, I cut the biscuits into 6 pieces using a sharp knife. I don't like to use a round cutter because you end up with scraps and when you roll or shape them they bake up very tough. This way there's no waste and you get 6 very tender biscuits. These baked up bigger than ever and were the best I've ever made. I think letting them rest before baking let the baking powder really react with the other ingredients. Also, I always use buttermilk when I make biscuits and I use half butter and half lard that I render myself (not the stuff you buy in the grocery store).

This is my husband's all-time FAVORITE biscuit recipe! We've made it countless times and we agree that other recipes pale in comparison to this one! I've never had to change one thing for this recipe....the flavor may be enhanced due to using butter-flavored crisco...
 If there are leftovers, I simply put them in a freezer bag and freeze them until my man requests biscuits and sausage gravy again! Awesome!!! Thanks

Single father raising 5 kids at home... This recipe is just what I needed!
Very good biscuits and extremely quick to slap together. I agree with the 20 minutes from brain to mouth comment.

I also mixed in the milk a little at a time and used about 7/8 cup. I guess this amount will vary depending on how accurate I am with the dry measures.

I followed discobunny's tips and substituted butter for shortening, 2 tsp baking powder for the 1 tbsp. and added 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  I thought I was a good cook, but I had no idea what "Buttermilk Powder"  was.  I immediately googled it, ordered some and 2 days later, I was making these biscuits. They are absolutely delicious!  Crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  (I did brush with melted butter before and after baking.) The only thing I had a problem with was following the advice not to knead the dough.  I used the full amount of liquid and my dough was VERY moist.  I mixed it until it was just blended and had a huge problem patting it out and cutting out the biscuits.  Any tips on how to not over mix, but to get the dough to not turn out too sticky?  Should I cut back on the liquid or just combine the ingredients a little more?  A tip...You mix the buttermilk powder into the dry ingredients, then add the water separately.

Amazing recipe! The first couple of times I made it it was extremely wet and sticky (because I doubled it I guess). I also brushed them with butter right after they came out of the oven wich made a nice finishing touch. This is the best biscuit recipe I've found!

Thanks for an easy, consistently good biscuit!  I use butter in place of shortening because I like the flavor. I've made them with all purpose and self rising flour and I've always had beautiful fluffy biscuits. It's become a staple in my house.

Made this recipe using 1 C all purpose flour and 1 C whole wheat flour because I ran out of white flour... Used buttermilk instead of milk and butter instead of shortening. Turned out incredible.  Served warm, split down the middle with a pat of butter and honey.  I probably ate 5 in one sitting! Can't wait to try exactly as recipe calls for next time to compare, too.

Been using this recipe for almost 4 years now. My husband begs for them, just like this morning. It's an easy recipe for substitutes to. I've substituted shortening with butter numerous times. Thanks for such an awesome biscuit.

Exactly the biscuit I was looking for.  Tall, more dense then airy and yet flaky.  My palette does prefer a bit more salt.

Truly a great recipe. Biscuits were tall and fluffy! Just as you'd want for a wonderful breakfast of biscuits and gravy. You might make the dough thinner than you normally would because these rise a LOT! Great recipe.

Subbed butter for shortening because I avoid shortening whenever I can.
Delicious!
Very sticky. Had to use a lot of flour to knead, but that was somewhat expected.

My husband is so picky when it comes to biscuits... This recipe has been my go-to for a few months now and I love it! He's even gotten upset when I tell him he has to wait for my phone to charge so I can make breakfast! I've made them with regular sausage gravy and chocolate gravy and used them for a bread pudding! Now I'm trying to use them for biscuit burgers tonight since I have no buns!!! I have no doubt I'll succeed!

Wonderful recipe! I've made this over a dozen times and its perfect the way it is. Remember not to add too much flour, its a very soft dough, but comes out great! For a slightly healthier version, I've substituted 1/2 cup of flour for whole wheat and added 1 Tbs of  wheat germ.

These are the best biscuits ever and my boys are probably the biggest biscuit critics in Texas! These are as easy to make as it is to open a can of store bought! They are as good if not a bit better than that big chicken fast food restaurant from Kentucky & the other fast food restaurant that stars a clown. I did use bread flour instead of all purpose, but I don't see that as making very much of a difference. I also did not need the full amount of milk but I live in a suburb of Houston where the humidity is thru the roof.

1. Way too salty (my SO's opinion was "reminds me of potato chip saltiness")
2. Way too doughy I probably should have used less milk or added more flour but it was my first time making biscuits in years so I didn't go with my instincts to not follow the directions.

Very easy recipe and the biscuits were flaky and moist. I substituted butter (1/2 c frozen, then shredded into dry mixture) because I don't use shortening and I really like the buttery taste the butter gave to the biscuits. Oh! I almost forgot, I ran out of milk, so I had to substitute 1/2 c half and half (closest thing to milk I had in the frig). Yummy! Lastly, to save dough and not make them tough by too much kneading, I kneaded only about 10 times, rolled out to 1/2 thickness, and cut with a pizza cutter into squares. I then reshaped the squares into rounds. I made 2 for breakfast and froze the rest to see how well they thaw and bake later. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who loves a good old-fashioned tasting biscuit.

This is my go-to biscuit recipe, my husband always asks for it! I changed a few things:
*butter instead of shortening
*don't overmix it! (once the ingredients are combined, only knead a couple times or they will turn out tough.)
I do bake them for the full 15 min, but I brush them with melted butter about halfway through and they turn out super soft.

Delicious!  I used butter, and substituted about 2/3 of the milk for buttermilk.  I also used butter because I had no Driscoll.  They were so fluffy and good.  My ten year old son loved them.  Very much a classic biscuit.

I've never made biscuits, but these were fantastic.  I didn't use anything that was particularly cold except the milk, which I dumped in after cutting in the shortening.  I kneaded maybe 10 times.  Used a large juice glass, and I did twist it to make the cut.  I ended up with huge fluffy biscuits, about 3 - 4" high; that were light, flaky and fantastic with a bit of butter and fresh honey.  Thank you!!

I like LARGE biscuits that tower high. There is no way a two cup recipe will ever give me enough biscuits, so the first thing I did was double it. I also used butter milk for better flavor,  and used both shortening and butter. I love the results I achieve i.e.  tenderness and lightness of the biscuit when using  shortening,  and also using the butter  for added flavor.  Another tip you might appreciate is; before adding the milk or butter milk, I put my biscuit mixture into the freezer to make everything as cold as possible. Even my butter milk is in the freezer for 15-30 minutes before I incorporate the milk product into the biscuit flour mixture. This way, the butter and shortening will remain in it's solid state while I work and form the dough for cutting.  I yield 10 biscuits with the cutter I was using, doubling the recipe.

I only made a half batch and made one substitution: buttermilk versus milk. It might be my oven but the result was a perfectly light-browned biscuit but with an interior that was a bit doughy. I used all the recommended baking time. Flavor and size were outstanding. The next time I make them I think I'll turn the temperature to 400F and leave them in a couple minutes longer or until adequately browned.

No changes needed! The best biscuit recipe I've found, biscuits are tall, light and tender. I'll be making these fantastic biscuits again and again. I used my food processor to incorporate the shortening then stirred in the milk by hand. Making the dough ahead of time and placing in the fridge for an  hour or so makes a difference, as well. Thank you J.P. for sharing!!

The biscuits turned out great, did a lot of raising.  The only problem was they tasted a little like baking powder.  My husband said they tasted good but I tasted baking powder.

I have made them again and I didn't taste the baking powder so maybe I did something wrong.  Loved them.

My family and loved these! I made it with butter instead of shortening and barely stirred then formed it without kneading to keep it light and not develop tough gluten. The result: layers of buttery yummmm!  I asked my family if I should change anything about the recipe and they said, "Yes, DOUBLE IT!"

This recipe makes amazing large, fluffy biscuits. I followed the recipe exactly as is, and decided to take the advice to let the dough chill for about an hour, wrapped tightly in foil. The biscuits were so large and amazing.  Again, I made this exactly as advised and they turned out perfectly. My husband likes biscuits a little more brown, so I put his back in for a few minutes. Perfect recipe,  perfect ingredients.  Thank you J.P!

I made this for breakfast this AM along with creamed chipped beef and easy over eggs. I am not very handy with biscuits as a rule, but these are, hands down, the easiest and best tasting I have ever attempted. They were not only huge, but even fluffier than the pictures lead you to believe. Most definitely a keeper recipe.

Wow! These were awesome! I didn't have shortening so I used butter. I did add some vinegar to the milk to make buttermilk. They were very light and delicious. I don't know how they would come out too dense as another reviewer stated. They were so good I had to make a second batch.

I happen to not have baking powder this time making the biscuits. Used 3/4 tsp. Baking soda and 3/4 tsp. Vinegar. Worked like a charm.  These biscuits are awesome. Love them every time I've made them.  Thank you J.P. for sharing with us!

IS there a such thing as TOO much biscuit? If you make these and let the dough sit in the fridge overnight before baking, you will find out! The biscuits in my batch came out twice the size of the ones pictured here with the recipe.

These biscuits are great!!!. I did do what another reviewer suggest and changed my baking powder to 2tsp and 1/2 tsp of soda and 3/4cup of Buttermilk. And I will change it to 12 mins in oven they got to dark on bottom but still good. Will make again for sure and also added garlic powder, onion and parsley, black pepper  to batter for flavor.

I made these delicious bisquits this morning exactly as presented. I used lard for the shortening and 2 percent milk.  I added the milk slowly and mixed until the dough was slightly damp (about 3/4 a cup because it is rained yesterday!) I also moved my rack to the top of the oven and only baked until lightly browned. These were flaky and tasty! Thanks so much for the recipe! Great and easy to bake!

They were too dense. I made them with buttermilk, red the BP to 2 tsp. Add 1 tsp soda. I did mot let them rise. They need to have time to rise, not sure how long. But I will make them again. I also used butter. They baked up perfectly brown. Tasted good just too dense.

I didn't have any shortening on hand and used 1/3 cup of coconut oil ( non-hydrogenated but refined) instead. I also added a pat of butter when cutting the coconut oil with the dry ingredients. I placed my biscuits on an un-greased cookie sheet covered with foil and put them in the refrigerator overnight. The next morning, I cooked them according to directions and they tasted wonderful! They weren't the biggest, fluffiest biscuits I've ever had but probably the best tasting biscuits I've ever made with such a simple recipe. We will be having these on a regular basis. Thanks for a great recipe.

A couple of tips: Mix the fats very well with the dry ingredients before adding milk. The wisk works wonderful for this. Also, avoid "over-kneeding" the dough. I didn't kneed my dough 15-20 times as the recipe suggested. You don't want to overwork your biscuit dough, just enough to get it together.

Absolutely simple, absolutely perfect each time!   Love the 'barely there' sweetness of the sugar!


Even my nine year old did this one and I was both astonished and certain it was the best thing since recipes were created.   Can't beat this 1.... Don't hesitate to experiment with it.  I did these the first go round, 1/2" thick topped them with themselves, but I slathered some apricot preserves in the middle!   Mmmmmmm.   Try something new everyday and the possibilities are.... You know the rest!?

Not bad, but they were very dense. Could just be the moisture in the air. The flavor was a little lacking. Its ok if you plan to smother them in gravy. Otherwise, I might try using butter or butter flavor shortening instead of plain shortening.

A long time ago I worked with this lovely French lady in Toronto, at the weather station, in a cafeteria (CNIB) who made biscuits every morning for  at least 100 people. People would line up for her biscuits! They where HUGE and delicious. I never asked her for the recipe and I've been trying to replicate them ever since. This recipe is as close as I've come. Thanks for sharing and will definitely make them again and again....

I was craving biscuits when I found this recipe so I decided to give it a try. I used whole wheat flour and butter, because it's what I had in the house. As I was making them my 1yr old started crying and need to go to bed so I literally threw everything together, skipped rolling or even shaping the dough, tossed big globs of  the dough on a cookie sheet and popped em in the oven. Still turned out DELICIOUS! I baked them for 15 min which was a little too long in my oven but that was my fault for not watching closely. Great, easy, delicious recipe. Will definitely make again!

My Mom passed away two years ago, and she always made biscuits. I could never seem to match her wonderful big fat biscuits until today. Your recipe was awesome. The only thing I did was double the batch...greased the baking sheet, and buttered the tops of the biscuits before and after they came out of the oven. Loved them, thank you so much for sharing!

Thank you J.P!!! I come from a long line of biscuit makers and now mine have been voted the best!! Only change I make is instead of shortening I use cold shredded butter. Mix it in well with the dry ingredient . Make sure to mix and touch these biscuits as little as possible as this will make them tough,seriously,  DO NOT OVER MIX!!! Perfect biscuits every time!

These biscuits were sooooo good! I only changed one thing, I substituted lard for shortening because I can't have anything with soy. They turned out perfectly fluffy and flaky! Everyone in the family loved them!

These are awesome!  Used room temperature butter flavored shortening and all the milk.  Placed a thick layer of flour down to knead them...gently.  This isn't yeast bread you're making here people, they're biscuits.  You are creating layers in the dough so they raise higher, not trying to mix it.  Brushed the tops with milk before baking.  Perfect!

I too come from a long line of biscuit makers and this is a pretty darn good biscuit!!  The only change I would make is not knead the dough so much. Basically, turn out on board and pull together with a bit of flour,cut and keep as light as possible.  I will definitely make these again. My husband can't get enough biscuits...so I'd say he's the best critic...and they were all eaten really fast!  ;-)  Thanks for posting this John!  I'll post a picture as soon as it's available from my phone.

My favorite biscuits.  I never changed a thing. For those who think they are too doughy try decreasing your milk, and for those who think they are too dense try sifting your dry ingredients. Or you could always use pastry flour.

Good recipe, my family enjoyed this. UPDATE: I make biscuits & gravy at least once a month, & all I ever hear now is "I want homemade biscuits".  And then proceed to get the ultimate sad face when I'm out of gas & feel lazy :) So thanks, for making my life more difficult, but oh so delicious!

Best biscuit recipe of all time!  Made it exactly as it is written, but only cooked for 11 min.  I have a brand new oven and I think it is a little hotter or something, so watch them!  Over the past 9 years of my marriage I have tried NUMEROUS biscuit recipes and seriously my husband came in and thought they were those Frozen Pillsbury biscuits (His favorite).  They were so fluffy and had LAYERS.  I probably didn't pat them out thick enough because I made 11 biscuits not 6, (Probably why they didn't take as long to cook) but still awesome.  So much better than refrigerator biscuits!  Can't say anything bad about this recipe really.  Do NOT use a ROLLING PIN on biscuit dough- I have learned that from reading many recipes, just use your hands to pat the dough out.  Also be sure you are using a fork or even better a pastry blender to add the shortening.  Seriously- best biscuits ever!  Another tip-- don't wiggle your biscuit cutter around too much, should just be more like a stamp into the dough.

Excellent recipe. This is our go-to recipe for biscuits, and it comes out great every time. For us the stated recipe makes 8 biscuits, so we usually double the recipe.

This recipe is fabulous. I brushed the tops with butter as soon as they came out of the oven, and they were delicious. They took slightly longer to bake in my oven (everything does), but they were done in 20 minutes. I cut twelve biscuits instead of six, and they still rose fine. If you only made a half dozen they would rise HUGE (not a bad thing!). :)

You don't want to knead this dough like you would bread dough. I just pat mine down into a 1" round and cut out the biscuits. The more you handle biscuit or pastry dough, the denser and grosser it gets when it bakes. If you try to knead it, you'll end up with hockey pucks. Happy baking!

LACTOSE FREE VERSION!!! my daughter is lactoce free and so we made this recipe as is and only traded the butter for Coconut oil and then traded the milk for coconut milk. THEY WERE AMAZING!!! they had a little coconut flavour to them but we all loved it!! We used full fat coconut milk and had I did add a little more than what milk was called for but I dont think it was neessary. Also we baked ours in a muffin pan and used liners so they were like muffin biscuits. Simply droped the dough the liners with a spoon so it was super easy and mess free.

I have never been successful making biscuits until now!  This is an awesome recipe.  I don't think I kneaded enough because they barely rise.  It didn't matter with the taste though!

J.P.'s recipe is our go-to recipe for biscuits.  They are everything a biscuit should be and since the wife does not ever deviate from a recipe (no food imagination), we get consistently good biscuits every time she makes them.

Proportions were totally off (it looked like pancake batter), cooking time was wrong, and the end result were bland, flat hockey pucks.

This recipe was seriously so easy and and results were fantastic! Few tips - go slow with the milk. Better to have to add more than to add too much and the dough be ruined. Don't over work the dough. And i did a combo of cold butter and shortening. With more butter than shortening.  In my opinion, it helped make for a tender and flaky biscuit. :)

These biscuits are sky high and perfect.  You have to be able to cut in the butter or shortening properly for them to turn out.  Also a metal cookie cutter, I started out using a glass cup but if you use a sharp metal cutter it makes sure the edges don't compress and allows the biscuit to raise more in the oven.

Who would have known biscuits are so easy to make!  This recipe turned out perfectly!  Why have I been buying the packaged store kind...this recipe is so much better!  Perfect texture, not doughy as other posts claimed, just soft and fresh!  I can't wait to try it with shredded cheddar, raisins or flour coated blueberries! Try it, follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed!

Did everything it said to do in this recipe, and they came out very disappointing, like wafer bread. I think it needs wayyyyyy less milk.

These were amazing just as the recipe was written except I put them on tip of my turkey pot pie as a topping. They were fluffy just don't over mix otherwise they will be tough. Added this to my favorites will make this recipe from now on.  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe yields wonderful and light biscuits! 

I made these biscuits by hand (i.e. without use of a food processor). I made two small modifications: 
Butter instead of shortening 
Liquid - mostly 2% milk with a splash of heavy cream (both were on hand) and a splash of lemon juice (as a buttermilk substitute). 

Other methods included placing the butter chips, flour, and mixing bowl in the freezer until very cold. I also briefly placed the milk in the freezer for an extra chill. I stirred in the milk with a spoon and then kneaded minimally (estimate 2-4 times). I cut the biscuit with a glass, but made sure NOT to twist.

Favorute biscuit recipe. I don'tlike shortening so I use olive oil instead. Adds to the flavor in my opinion. This may make thema little less doughy initially but bakes up fine.

Followed Discobunny's adjustments and used butter-flavored shortening. Perfection! Buttery and oh-so tender.

These are the best biscuits I've ever had. I'd only made biscuits once before, and wasn't thrilled with the results (though they turned out like the picture, and were OK). So, I was reluctant to try again. I followed this recipe to the letter. I used butter-flavored shortening. They were easy to prepare, and turned out incredibly. Get the butter-flavored shortening; the butter flavor really sings in these. I will never buy pre-made biscuit dough again.

These biscuits are simple, and great for my limited space because they cook up well in a toaster oven. I have also added some garlic powder and herbs to them to make dinner biscuits with my pasta. The regular recipe is a great sandwich biscuit, since it does cook up so large.

The first time I made these I used liquid non-dairy creamer in place of the milk. This time I used the powdered buttermilk that you add water for the liquid. Both times they came out great. I just didn't knead too much and also chilled the shortening. The bottoms browned too quickly, so I may try lowering the oven temp the next time. Great recipe, though. Thanks John P.!

Super easy to make and kids seemed to enjoy them.
I made a few changes to the basic recipie based on other reviews and they turned out pretty good.
I only gave them 4 stars as they were a little bland on thier own but when coupled with gravy they were pretty good.
I used half all purpose and half wholewheat flour and soy milk instead of regular milk (we are a milk free family)
These will go into my recipie folder for a quick and easy low cost snack / meal

Really good for "light" and big. I think I might use this for shortcakes for strawberries in the future. They come out slightly too light for sausage (meat) and gravy. Just personal/I just like a fuller body texture for sandwich use or gravy dishes. Biscuits or so basic that very slight ingredient variance can mean big change in results. Next time I will add a little more flour for my altitude/7000'. I just guessed with the first batch. Great dessert biscuit!

This is a great, simple and easy recipe with great results.  I can't wait to impress the lake neighbors with these in a great summer breakfast.  I'll bet these will bake up nice on a hot grill.  Thanks

Wonderful and so easy! I used organic flour, Spectrum (organic all vegetable) butter flavored shortening and Silk Cashew milk (regular, not unsweetened) in place of regular flour, shortening, and milk. They looked a little dry when they came out of the oven so I brushed a little vegan butter on them. They were fluffy and delectable. Everyone loved them!

First time I made these I rolled the dough too thin and ended up with delicious, but not too fluffy biscuits. So I'm making them again and we're all excited to have them with some bacon and eggs. Definitely great flavor and super easy to make.

Baking is not a strong skill for me.  This was the first time I made them, and they came out light and tasty.  I only had skim milk in the house, but I always have plain non-fat Greek yogurt, so I whisked  about 1/4 cup of that in with the skim milk (I wanted to give the milk a little more depth).  And the biscuits were delicious! When I make them next time, I just might put rosemary in them for a little more flavor.  I will definitely keep making these.

These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly how it stated the first time I made them and they tasted great- family loved them.  Then I decided to try with butter and less/no kneading and I didn't care for their texture or taste.  I love them just as the recipe descripes.  Thank you for a great receipe that I will use from now on.

After reading the comments, I decided to add onion powder, garlic powder and a bit of grated cheese - delicious! Next time i will try sautéing onion and garlic and adding it. One thing to remember when making biscuits - DO NOT twist the biscuit cutter back and forth as it prevents the biscuits from rising as much as they would if you just press the cutter into the dough and slightly move the cutter.

I really like making these but sometimes they come out a little to sticky but a little more flour and you are good to go. Biggest tip is to not roll them to flat for fluffy biscuits and don't knead the dough to much just a tiny bit like maybe 2-4 times is all it takes. These were made with the help of my 5 years old and he says they are the best:)

for some reason my mixture came out very wet. i kept adding flour till it pulled off the sides.  not a bad tasting biscuit but i gotta keep looking. they just don't do it for me. not tall enough and they crumble when you try and slice them to butter them.  has anyone tried making the batter the night before?  any other tricks?  I'll give that a shot.

Great recipe. Super easy and super fast. We needed some biscuits to go with our stew and I wanted to try something new. I followed the recipe to the "t" and it couldn't have taken longer than 10 minutes to throw together. They were the biggest, fluffiest, baking powder biscuits I've ever made. The family loved them and we will definitely be making these again!

I don't have any shortening so I used butter and they turned out fine. I added sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture at the flour step before I added milk. I use extra extra cold butter out of the freezer and grate it in with a cheese grater and then i try not to warm the dough up too much before i put them in the oven. They rise higher with cold dough and hot oven.

I LOVE this recipe! I have had a lot of problems finding a good biscuit recipe in the past. Either they would come out tough or they wouldn't taste right but these changed all that for me and now i use this recipe all the time. The only thing I do differently is I put half milk and half buttermilk and I make sure not to over beat the dough. Thanks JP great recipe

absolutely the best Biscuit recipe of all. Easy, can't mess it up, lightly crispy on the outside and moist soft on the inside. I've tried the soda & sour cream recipe but it doesn't compare to these. If yours don't com e out right Use AP flour, Crisco shortening, and new baking powder. These are usually the reasons biscuits don't come out correctly. I've tried over 20 recipes and this is best. I'm always looking for better but I don't think this will be beat. "DON"T OVER BAKE"!!!12-13 minutes.

This is the first recipe I have felt compelled to rate in all my years on allrecipes.   Fabulous recipe.  The key to biscuits is to handle them as little as possible,  as other have said.  Also, make a well in the center and add half of the milk, then add half of what's left.  You want to err on the side of too dry vs too moist.  Finally,  add the rest.  I think I used slightly under the cup and mine tuned out amazing!  Oh, don't use a hand mixer either.  Take a fork and knife and cut the shortening in until the mix is crumbly before adding the milk.

So simple.. I usually make B isquick. Biscuits for my family because of the ease, but these turn out 100% better. And they are so simple to make.  Deliciously light & fluffy. Basic ingredients that I always have on hand.  I saved the recipe to my cookbook and will use it from now on.

I have been remiss in rating this recipe. These are the very best biscuits ever, and they are the ONLY ones I make. I have tried others, but always come back to this recipe. I don't use a cutter or glass to form the biscuits though. I just use a knife and cut them into squares - saves time, don't have to re-roll to use up the dough, and doesn't effect the final biscuit. Thanks J. P.

I use cold butter instead of shortening. These are the best biscuits I've ever eaten, and I can add cheese etc without affecting the quality. This is the only biscuit recipe I use now. Bravo!

These biscuits turned out great. Slightly crispy top and bottom; soft all the way through. I have made these many times with a 100% success rate. These taste awesome with honey, strawberry jam, sweet potato or apple butter, blackberry preserves...almost anything spreadable, really. This is my go-to biscuit recipe.

I was craving biscuits like crazy. Unfortunately, these delicious little buggers only threw more gasoline in the fire. I followed the recipe exactly except for I used half butter and half pumpkin puree instead of shortening and skim milk with a tablespoon of vinegar instead of regular milk. Proportionally it was all the same, though, and I was shocked (pleasantly so) at how buttery they tasted. This was my first time making biscuits, and I do think I overworked them a bit. One of these days I'll make them again and try to be more gentle, and maybe use sweet potato or applesauce instead of pumpkin puree. If they are as good as they are with the puree, I can only imagine how good they are with all butter.

I read all the positive reviews and was excited to make these. I wish I had read the negative reviews instead because I agree with most of them. Bland and the texture wasn't good. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't work the dough too much.

Made these biscuits exactly as written and they turned out beautifully! They were crunchy enough on the outside to hold up to sausage gravy and soft enough on the inside to eat leftover biscuits as a snack with jam. Thank you for an easy to make, yummy in eating recipe.

Great recipe and so simple! I reduced the flour and added a little flax flour. Also added garlic powder. Used "I can't believe it's not butter" and tasted great. Family loved them!

Great recipe... can be done quicker if you remove the unnecessary kneading and add a small 10 minute in the fridge.

Nice, moist biscuits that my entire family enjoyed. Like others, I tried to handle the dough as little as possible. Used 1/2 cold butter and 1/2 shortening. Doubled, this made 15 biscuits for me.

This recipe is perfect for the novice to the master baker! I, too, had to put a twist on mine by substituting frozen butter shredded with cheese grater and adding three ingredients. I included a tbls of black pepper, 1 finely chopped/seeded fresh jalepeno as well as handful of shredded cheddar. 
Made these for breakfast and was hoping to have at lunch with chili, did have to make a second batch for lunch!, no left overs after breakfast. 
Like so many others press down don't twist when cutting. 
BTW hamburger chain restaurant here in Texas trying make similar biscuits, hah!!! They should stick to hamburgers!!

I really loved these biscuits. They were very easy to make took about half an hour from start to finish. No way could I knead this for 20mins with a very active 4 month old around. It took 5mins to add all the ingredients together, 10mins kneading and 15mins baking. And they came out great. They were so nice and fluffy, melt in your mouth. Will def make these again

Used butter & cheddar. Did not knead, that toughens the biscuit. Only baked 7 minutes.

The flavor is superb. I end up needing to add CUPS of flour just to make it workable, and even then, the dough is still incredibly sticky and just tears to pieces when I move it to the baking pan. And then they just NEVER get big. They look more like chips by the time they're done. However, the flavor is OUTSTANDING, I mean it--better than store bought or even restaurant made. I just need help in making these actually resemble something even similar to a biscuit!

Big fluffy tender but tasteless biscuits.  I prefer my grandmothers from scratch original, but my husband prefers a more tender biscuit.  These fit the bill except they don't taste like anything.  I will try again any maybe sub out half the shortening for butter

For those who love biscuits but not butter substitute oil instead then add a little extra milk so the dough is too wet to turn.  Use a large serving spoon too scoop mounds of the dough onto the baking sheet and bake for a few extra minutes.  Voila, soft delicious biscuits with no butter.

This has become my go to biscuit recipe !!! I do not knead the dough and I mix everything with a mixer with just enough milk to start pulling away from the sides. Then I pat them out and put them right in the oven !!!! These are great !!!

really like this recipe as is! I have also added my own spices for a different twist or sweetened it up and either way these turn out wonderful. I don't have patience to knead and cut so I just drop em and pop em in the oven. The family loves em every time no matter what flavor.

Wow, these were super great ! Used them on my chicken pot pie and they are big and delicious.  I brushed with butter before baking. Also, don't require kneading, just rolled them in a big circle and pat down.

Good texture and size. Next time try with brushing the tops with butter and replacing some of the shortening with softened butter. It was missing the salty/buttery goodness.

These biscuits were awesome. I substituted "I can't believe it's not butter" for shortening and didn't use all the milk. Just put enough milk to make the dough stick together. I also kneaded the dough very little. They were tender and fluffy.

These are really good and definitely more for breakfast than dinner. Make sure you make them thick enough when ccutting them from the dough. I will be making again.

So simple and so delicious! Reminds me of the biscuits my southern grandmother made!  I used butter instead of shortening but other than that kept the recipe the same.

I have made this recipe 10 times now and every time they are perfect! Sometimes I use almond milk and sometimes cow milk and either work just fine. I think the trick is to not over-knead them. I mix in the milk until it is incorporated and that's it. Then I let it sit for a few minutes (it seems to make them rise better), and just drop little balls on a cookie sheet (it's faster than rolling them out). These freeze very well too. We just love love love these biscuits!!!

I used butter milk instead of regular milk (if you don't have butter milk then just add 2 tbs white vinegar to the milk and let it sour for a few minutes)

I've been baking for 35 years and this is by far the best biscuit recipe I've ever tried. I married someone from Kansas and he's a big critic when it comes to good biscuits so when he couldn't stop eating them, I knew I had a winner. I followed the recipe exactly how it states and they came out better than I expected. Definitely going into my family recipe box.

Very good! I don't knead them, I pat them out, then fold them 2 or 3 times, and repeat this 2 times. Creates nice, flaky layers. I got 8 huge, fluffy, delicious biscuits. Outstanding!

These biscuits are soft, but I thought it was a bit bland.  I prefer biscuits made with butter so the flavor is richer.  I would recommend swapping the shortening with salted butter for better flavor

This is a great biscuit recipe.  The only comment I would make is regarding the video on how to make these.  I don't think you should knead biscuit dough at all. Like pie pastry, kneading will make them heavier and less flaky. Simply gather the dough and press together firmly before rolling out.

Also, If you have opened baking powder in your cabinet that is older than 4 months, throw it out and buy some fresh.  If your biscuits are not rising as much as they should, stale baking powder is usually why. 

I have experimented adding some additional things to this basic recipe.  Try adding a little grated cheese, or some roasted garlic, or perhaps some diced sun-dried tomatoes just before adding the milk.  Also, I find they come out a little nicer flavored if you use buttermilk instead of regular milk, but they are delicious either way.

Similar to my biscuits but I use buttermilk and self rising flour. Do not knead the dough much at all or they will be tough. Use just enough milk so it will stick together, that way you won't need to knead much. Pour milk in a little at a time until you get consistency the way you need it.

I have tried making biscuits many times and this is the only recipe where they actually turn out right every time.  I make mine in a stand mixer and I always end up using about 1/4 cup less of the milk so add milk gradually until the mixture comes away from the bowl.

Pretty good ! My biggest woe in this is that I only needed 2/3 cup of milk (so just add the milk in intervals and see ) I kneaded it 5 times then melted a tablespoon of butter and used the trifold technique 3 times to finish the kneading process and stored it in my freezer as I waited for the over to heat up. They came out nice and flaky but admittedly a bit bland. Maybe next time I'll experiment :)

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it came out perfect both times. I blended my ingredients with a food processor, it's easier and crazy quick. Cookieclaire's suggestion of glazing with melted butter pre and post baking was a great tasting addition, along with her caution on kneading.

Wonderful. I only added about 3/4 cup of milk instead of the whole cup the recipe calls for because I felt the dough was getting too wet for biscuits. It worked out great. I have failed at making biscuits before because I skipped the kneading step. All in all great recipe.

These biscuits were really delicious. I used butter because I had no shortening in the pantry. I also did not knead as many times...but that's just because I'm lazy. 

I plan to make these again.

Awesome amazing :-) only change is that I used butter flavored Crisco, fluffy and perfect crunch on outside, used cooks Crisco and child milk and a slightly hotter oven as suggested by a lady on here, perfect and simple :-) :-) :-) :-)

Wow! Definitely the best biscuit recipe I have found EVER! And I've tried quite a few in the past! One tip I would have that really makes it easier is grating the butter (yes, I used butter as well) into the flour! It is so much easier to work with and really worked well. Delicious recipe!!

This is the best recipe for biscuits ever! And they are very easy. My mom has been making these for about seven years. I can defiantly say that I have "grown up" with these!

Excellent biscuits. I used 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter because I don't buy shortening. I also added 1tbs. lemon juice to my milk, for a buttermilk tang. I always let the dough sit in the fridge for a few hours before baking and make sure to handle the dough as little as possible. I also grate the cold butter into the flour mixture instead of cutting it, this gives it a yummy crumbly result. Thanks for the recipe :-)

I thought this was an easy yummy biscuit recipe. I used milk with a tablespoon of vinegar in it, comes close to buttermilk that way. This is the biscuit recipe for someone who is a novice, very hard to go wrong.

I have made several biscuit recipes over the years & this was the first that led to biscuits I could be proud of.  I did have to add a little more flour bc my dough was super sticky, but just a little more did the trick.  Thanks!

Great biscuits! I've made them multiple times, and I always have great results. The last time I made them, I added some diced thick-cut bacon and fresh sage. After pan frying the bacon and sage, I let them cool, mixed them into the dry mix after cutting in the butter, then added the milk and continued from there. I thought they might be too salty with the full tsp of salt plus the bacon, so I cut it back to 1/2 tsp. I will use 3/4 tsp next time. After they came out of the oven, I brushed on a little  bacon fat. Delicious!

I just made this and the recipe came out fantastic. OF COURSE, I made changes. I used lard and the milk was 2/3 milk with 1/3 half and half. I barely kneaded the dough and cut it into squares so there would be no waste and no need to be concerned with over kneading. I ate one while it was piping hot with organic butter. I loved it. This is now my go-to recipe for biscuits.

Great recipe! Butter buttermilk no salt and 2/3-3/4 cup milk. I cook these in my iron skillet greased with bacon grease. It adds so much flavor and much better than shortening. Recipe is a keeper, wonderful biscuits. Thanks for the recipe. Hot Tennessee Pride sausage( yes it does matter) and gravy biscuits are just amazing.

This will be my 'go to' biscuit recipe.  My husband ate 4 which was a big surprise...Per other reviews and my own experience I worked quickly with a light touch.  No kneading - used cold milk & butter.  I put the dough in the fridge for 15 minutes prior to cutting them out.

I've never had a better result with any other biscuit.  Yum!

I followed the directions. But my biscuits came out like dried up hockey pucks. They didn't hardly rise. They weren't fluffy. And they tasted bland. And I didn't over cook them. I don't know; I think I'll try another recipe.

I have never made home made biscuits before but woke up this morning with a hankering for biscuits and gravy. I found this recipe and in no time I was eating a delicious biscuit! I had too have two. First one with gravy and the second one without just to enjoy the biscuit. YUM! Read some if the tips from the experienced and helpful users below. I used butter and cooked a little hotter and faster for altitude as that has worked in the past for baking.  I have been spending more time in the kitchen and the taste of this recipe is a confidence builder for sure.

I really liked this recipe, clean simple and to the point, it didn't take me anywhere near 30 min to prep though, probably 5 minutes and 10 in oven, the quickest biscuits I have ever made that were extremely tender, well done :)

Great biscuits, very comparable to my southern mother in laws cat head biscuits. I really like that they do not require buttermilk, which I rarely have in my fridge. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand. I'm sure I will use it often.

FANTASTIC! I am not a good biscuit maker. Mine usually come out too hard, too dry, too yucky somehow! These were moist, flaky (the good way) and sooooo very tasty! Thank you so much for posting.

Excellent recipe! I used butter and skim milk and 1/2 teaspoon of salt (instead of 1), kneaded just until the dough was smooth, and they were really good! Easy.

I followed this recipe to the T and all we could taste was the baking powder.

This recipes is a keeper!! Tasted JUST like KFC biscuits. Mine didn't rise too good. I suppose its because I should give the baking powder a bit more time to do its thing.

These were absolutely perfect. Everything I wanted in a biscuit and very quick and easy. I substituted butter for the shortening and used the food processor to cut it in to the dry ingredients. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I really wanted to make biscuits since I never had before and this Thanksgiving I am in charge of rolls and biscuits at my Wife's Grandmothers house.  SO I needed some practice.  I used cake/pastry flour and home made butter instead of shortening.  Also, I didn't have a circular cutter so I just cut the dough into squares using an 8" chef's knife.  Also, I believe that I over worked the dough which kept the biscuits from raising as much as I had hoped. 
The biscuits themselves tasted great.  My kids loved them with honey and I thought they were perfect all by themselves.  5 stars for an easy and delicious recipe.

this is a great starter omit the milk use buttermilk and the shortning should be butter watch the salt content also and they seem to rise the best when hand patted out to about 3/4-1 inch thick for crazy good rise and just the wow factor when you present them to you family on sunday morning with some bangin homemade sausage gravy all over the top of them

Love this recipe!! I made it today and used 1 cup cake flour and one cup whole wheat flour . I also used almond milk instead of regular milk. They turned out so good!! it was a crusty biscuit compared to the original recipe but we loved it. I have recommended it to anyone who will listen.

These biscuits are awesome.  I have tried multiple recipes and these are the ones that always come out perfect.  I made these 4 or 5 times and loved them.  But,like the reviewer "Discobunny" I tried using the SACO brand cultured buttermilk powder and water instead of milk, although I kept the baking powder at the same amount instead of reducing it.  They came out even better.  Best biscuits ever and I have the recipe memorized now.  Great job JP, your biscuits are the best, and this is coming from a biscuit lover.

This biscuit recipe is good, and made nice big moist biscuits.  They were slightly bitter or salty, so next time I may add a little less salt, but overall they were great.

I blended the dry ingredients first, and then added the shortening, and blended it together with my fingers and then added the milk.

The secret to fluffy biscuits is to work the dough as little as possible, so as soon as everything was moistened, I patted the dough out on a lightly floured board, and cut with a biscuit cutter.  

I sprayed the baking pan with cooking spray, but if I'm cooking bacon, my grandpa- who's from the South always told me when I make biscuits, to put a little bacon grease in the pan and to lay the biscuits in the pan and turn them over so both sides have a coating of bacon grease. 

I used these biscuits to make ham egg and cheese biscuits, and they turned out great!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

Best d*mned biscuits I ever made :)  DID inadvertently do a test with kneading thing. Kneading went against everything I ever heard about biscuit making (or tried). Forgot all about kneading until halfway through cutting them out.  Kneaded the remaining dough - all rose much better.  Honestly the first time I ever had biscuits turn out that I was actually happy with!!

The first time I tried it, I used butter, after looking at some of the reviews. I should've obeyed the recipe, because when I went back to shortening they were light, fluffy and excellent! While I prefer using butter, shortening is the way to go here. And kneading is more like folding the dough on the board.

WOW! Awesome recipe, I used to use another recipe before this one and oh boy does this one knock the old one out the park. I substituted shortening with butter and milk with almond milk. And it was perfect! Soft and fluffy! I will definitely be using this recipe more often. Thanks for the recipe

I'll give it 5 stars as is, even though I use real butter instead of the shortening.  The shortening makes them softer, but we use real butter as a preference.

Love this recipe! Biscuits always turn out thick and fluffy. 

We use butter instead of shortening, and usually wind up using closer to 3/4 cup of milk than a full cup, or it gets sticky. I just mix the dough until all the flour is mixed in uniformly, and knead hardly at all. 

I've made them with up to 1/3 whole wheat flour and had them still turn out great.

I love to cook but have never been able to master biscuits (even growing up with grandma making biscuits daily and a wonderful wife that makes great biscuits). I gave these a try tonight and I have to say they were very tasty. The only changes I made to recipe was I used buttermilk and self rising flour. Very pleased with recipe and the video instructions were great. Thanks!

This has become a staple add on for homemade soup days. We use cookie cutters and make shaped biscuits though. No ordinary circles in our house! ;-) takes 5 min to make, they're in the oven in about 7 minutes.  Can't beat that! Sometimes I throw different herbs in too. Tops are great with a little water brushed on and coarse salt sprinkled. Super easy!

These biscuits were very easy to make and turned out wonderfully! They were fluffy and soft inside.  I took others' advice and mixed and kneaded the dough as minimally as possible.  I quadrupled the recipe for a large family breakfast and only needed 3 cups of milk. We used them for sausage gravy but also ate some with homemade jam and they were fantastic!  I will definitely be making these again.

These biscuits were the best. I have tried several recipes and box mixes. These were ABSOLUTELY DELISH, AND SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY!!!, Very easy to make. I did take advice from some of the other reviewers and put the dough in the fridge for a while. It worked out well, cuz it was gonna be a while b4 dinner and I just made the dough ahead of time. I did cut some of the shortening with Smart Balance and used mostly skim milk(thats just what we keep in the house)and happen to have a little buttermilk, oh and I didn't knead it too much also. OMG!!! My son was in Heaven, some jelly and butter, whoowee. This is definitely in the rotation. Thanks J.P.

This recipe is amazing!!  There was a difference with browning the bottoms of the biscuits between levels in the oven, the lower the level, the browner the biscuits got.  It could be my oven.  I followed this recipe exactly and the biscuits turned out amazing.  I have used other recipes online and things didn't work out.  Truthfully, I wasn't sure this would but it was great!!!

Didn't rise at all for me, maybe because I have really old baking powder. I didn't knead the dough, so that wasn't it.

I found this recipe a few years ago and bookmarked it and kept using it...then my laptop crashed and I got another and I JUST FOUND THIS RECIPE AGAIN!!  My kids and I just enjoyed biscuits and sausage gravy, and these biscuits never disappoint!  They're easy, quick, and produce excellent results every single time.  This time my six year old daughter helped me, and it was simple enough that she could participate easily.  Great Saturday-morning-breakfast-with-the-kids biscuit!

I just tried them yesterday and they came out delicious! I didn't have shortening so I used butter instead. But Like I said, they were so good.

We have used this recipe for a long time usually with wheat and white flour.
They are the biggest biscuits ever with a very good tast.  It is also a good recipe to make in half if there are only 1 or 2 in your house:)

I don`t remember how long it`s been that Big John has put this recipe on here. But I won`t look for a replacement be cause I think these are best. If there was a ten star rating thats what I would rate these. Tuna gravy and these biscuits for breakfast this morning. I have 3 great big hungry boys to feed and these will work out fine. Big John thanks for the posting of this fantastic recipe...

These were very easy, and very tasty biscuits. I used butter instead of shortening and they came out great! I also grated the very cold butter and that made cutting it into the flour much easier. These rose perfectly too!

Delicious and very easy to make. They rose beautifully and the texture was perfect. They held up well to syrup. The only things I changed were, I used butter instead of shortening, evaporated milk instead of whole milk, and I added about 1/2 teaspoon more salt than the recipe calls for because we like salty biscuits. No fuss, no muss, will definitely make again!

Very good very easy. I tried to make other recipes but they never worked out. This one worked out great. I did get 8 instead of the 6 but thats ok. Also only three of mine are really big and tall like there should be. I think its from not cutting them think enough. They taste great sitting here right now with a cup of early gray and one with honey and butter so yummy. I may try making another bach and freeze them to see if that works. it never fails that i want biscuits mornings i need to be at work and i dont want to cook much at 530 in the morning.

These turned out excellent! I have tried dozens of recipes and I could never get them to rise or taste the way I wanted. My initial thought was to avoid kneading them but I decided to stick to the recipe. They were not tough at all. I got so excited when I opened the oven to check them and they had risen so high! I even cut them out with a glass which is supposed to "crimp" the edges and hinder the rising. I did pour the whole cup of milk in and then had to add about 1/4 cup more flour. I'm going to try using butter next time instead of the shortening. Excellent!

Kind of bland, nothing spectacular. I think I would have preferred a more buttery flavour.  Maybe butter-flavoured shortening next time?  Taste improved with jam spread over top.

After over 20 years of trying to make biscuits that my husband likes, I have finally found the recipe!

The rest of us like them, too.  Very good biscuits!  Thank you for sharing!

I add a half stick of real butter to this for phenomenal flaky, tender biscuits.  This is the ONLY biscuit recipe I use now!  I have also added in fruit preserves and reduced the milk accordingly for a slightly sweet treat as well!

Great biscuits! I made 3 batches. The first batch was very good and it was made as written.  The second batch came out fantastic!  I replaced the milk with buttermilk, the shortening with butter, and the TBS of baking powder with 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.  I sifted all the dry ingredients and placed them in my food processor.  I added the butter (I cut them up into little pats) and processed for a minute until they resembled coarse crumbs.  I then slowly added the milk until it was starting to form a ball and then dumped it on to my flour covered counter.  Yummy! These were so good and will be my biscuit recipe from now on :)

I just got through making these biscuits. Like some others, I used 2-tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, and I subbed butter for shortening, as well as the buttermilk powder, but used 2% milk instead of water. I also added 4-T cheddar cheese powder, 1-T of garlic powder, and 1-T minced garlic, and a cup of shredded Mexican blend cheese. When I cut in the butter, I didn't think the amount of butter called for was enough for the flour mixture, but did not increase it this time. It did take a bit more milk than called for. I just patted out the dough and cut the biscuits without kneading or rolling. It made 15 large biscuits. I then put them in the fridge on a cookie sheet for about 6 hourss to let the flavors of cheese and garlic to meld, then baked for dinner. OMG! These were sooo good! I warn you, if you follow my changes, you can really taste the garlic, but we loved them! I didn't think they rose to be any bigger than any other biscuits though.

This recipe comes out perfect every time!  Make sure to cut in the shortening really well.  Stir the dough until it is just barely moistened, then turn it out onto a floured surface.  Knead only until it comes together a little more, then pat it out into a rectangle.  Skip the round biscuit cutter and use a large knife to cut into about 8 rectangles so you only have to cut ONCE.  If you use a round cutter, get them as close together as possible and don't re-roll scraps.  The key is to work the dough as little as possible!  Brush the tops with melted butter before and after baking and these babies will beat your favorite restaurant biscuits hands down!

I recently made biscuits from another recipe and they didn't rise.  So I bought new Baking Powder and used this recipe and wow were they amazing.  I made six really big biscuits and baked them for 15 min. at 425, and they could have baked a minute or two longer.  But I served them with gravey and they were yummy!!!  I also made the dough the night before and wrapped the dough in waxed paper and put in the frige. All I had to do was roll them out in the morning. I did knead the dough lightly just a few times before rolling it out. I used real butter and 2% milk. This is a great recipe and I'll be using it again.

I almost bought canned biscuits over these, and I am glad I didn't! They were flaky and delicious, and taste heavenly when homemade red plum jelly is spooned on! I look forward to making them for years to come. Insta save to ye ole recipie box!

This is the first biscuit recipe I have tried in a very long time. The biscuits were delicious and super simple to make. I used buttermilk and salted butter to avoid what some reviewers referred to as a lack of taste. Wow!

I should have read the negative comments before making this. I agree with most of them, they didn't raise all that much, dry and tasteless. After adding 2/3 c milk it was obvious that adding the last 1/3 c would make the dough way too wet so I stopped at 2/3 c. I'm going back to my good old Better Homes and Gardens cook book next time.

Today I made two double batches of these biscuits and both turned out great.  I froze the second batch.  For some reason, when I tried this recipe a few years ago, the bicuits didn't turn out so great.  I didn't need quite all of the milk and I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and the other 1/2 unbleached, all purpose flour. I also used olive oil instead of shortening.  My son and mother-in-law loved them.

I have tried biscuit recipes without good results.  THIS recipe turned out absolutely delicious.  I made them ahead and put them in aluminum foil like Big Daddy said could be done.  Wow!  My husband said that the biscuits reminded him of his Grandmother Lizzy's biscuits many, many years ago. They are soooo delicious and so easy.  Thank you, JP Big Daddy.  Finally, I have a biscuit recipe that works!!!

I use this recipe for one thing and one thing only: chicken pot pie. Instead of a pie crust, I make a batch of these, cut them out, and place them on the pot pie. Baked altogether, it comes out delicious.
I find I can't knead this dough for 15 to 20 minutes, since I do it by hand. Instead, I knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, cut the dough into biscuit form and knead each biscuit in my hand for a few extra minutes. The warmth from my hand and the concentrated kneading seems to work very well. These come out big and tender every time.

This is my go to biscuit recipe. They bake up nice and tall if I follow the suggested serving size but I don't mind squeezing in a few extra biscuits when I have extra guest over and they are still great! I lower my oven to 400 and cook for 15 minutes then I rub some butter on the tops while they are still hot.  One time I had a little extra dough that wouldn't quite make a full size biscuit so I rolled it out fairly thin, spread butter on, sprinkled with a generous amount of cinnamon and sugar and rolled it up. I cut it into 4 pieces and baked with my biscuits. They were great! Add some powdered sugar mixed with a touch of milk for a glaze and in no time I had both biscuits and iced cinnamon rolls, Yay me!

Wonderful biscuits, will not use any other recipe. My husband and two year old love love love when I make these, you can ever prep ahead of time and freeze, cooking time is a bit longer of course if frozen but still amazingly tasty!

These were outstanding!  Not too salty at all unsure of what previous posters may have done but they had an amazing light and crispy texture with no excessive salty taste. I added a bit more sugar as we like a sweeter biscuit and a bit of grated cheddar, these will be our new go to for biscuits.

I love biscuits, but I'm terrible at making them. I always knead them too much. I was so focused on not over-kneading that I almost forgot the butter! I had to add it last, after the milk. I barely touched the dough after that. They turned out great! Light and flaky. I will make this over again for sure. Those who complain that these are bland, might try making them with butter, or at least half butter half shortening.

These biscuits were awesome! When I made them exactly how the recipe said, the dough was still very wet, so I had to add probably 1/2 cup more of flour, but then the dough was perfect and I made them the rest of the way as stated and they were AMAZING! My husband said that they were a lot better than our usual go to biscuit recipe!

I just tried this recipe and it was okay but not great.  I was baking it for the thirteen minute minimum time and ended up taking them out 3 minutes early because they were over cooked.  I'm not sure if being over cooked was the reason I tasted nothing but baking powder but there is too much baking powder in this recipe.  I'm glad I didn't make these for family but just as a test because I would not feed these to guests.  Also don't need quite that much milk.  Was very sticky and gooey and hard to get out of the bowl.  I'll tweek the recipe and see how things go.  Thank you

These were very good. I did what another member suggested and used my food processor to mix the ingredients. I did find that 1 cup of milk was way too much, I had to add an extra 1/2 of flour. They turned out very good though. I made the bob Evans sausage gravy recipe from this site, and it was so good!

I love this recipe although I have to admit the first time I made it I did not read the directions just the ingredient list an threw everything into the bowl in one shot. But I will say the perk to that was these made excellent drop biscuits. I dont really have a counter top to work on so I have yet to make these the proper way but I love the drop biscuits it makes. I have also used these as dumplings in chicken and dumplings an it is amazing. But with that I threw some parsley pepper an a lil garlic powder in to add some flavor in the the chicken an dumplings. Usually when I make these I make them with the super sausage gravy recipe I found here as well. WTG J.P we love your biscuits even if I made them wrong lol

My 5 year old loved helping me cut them out. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they aren't quite as good as my moms, but they are sooooo close.

I used sweetened vanilla almond milk, and they came out great! I used to add some sugar when I used dairy milk in biscuits, and sweetened soymilk or almond makes them just right.
I'd use plain soymilk, or add a teaspoon of lemon to sub for buttermilk, if wanting a savory one.
Dismiss all the bad reviews. This is the basic recipe-just look compare to all the others. The only difference would be in the amount of milk, and as this recipe states "Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl." That means you don't have to use it all. Amounts for liquid will vary.
Just don't over work the dough, stir till just combined. If you let it set for a while, as others have mentioned, the baking powder will have longer to rise.

Not sure if others added something to the recipe, but I followed the exact recipe.  The biscuits came out dense and tasteless.  Looks good, but doesn't taste that good.  What can I add/change to make this better??

Love this recipe!! I now add garlic powder and shredded sharp cheddar to the dough although the original recipe is great as it is (family preference).  They make an excellent addition to soups and stews and my family asks for them all the time.

Great biscuit recipe and nice biscuits to slide under some sausage gravy!
Also used the recipe to make quick pizza dough when I didn't have time for waiting for the rising of yeast type dough.

These biscuits were my first attempt at making homemade biscuits. These biscuits were excellent. We ate them with chocolate gravy and jam. Later in the day, we just ate them dry and with butter. Excellent recipe.

These turned out wonderful! I used butter in place of the shortening, but otherwise kept the ingredients the same. I followed the reviews and did not knead the dough or over mix. Soft and fluffy biscuits were the result! Loved them! This will my go to biscuit recipe from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

These biscuits are good. They go together fast and with few ingredients. I always have to add a tad more flour to the mix so it's not quite as sticky. However, they rise beautifully and are soft and perfect for biscuits and gravy!  I don't roll out the dough. I just add some flour to the counter and then turn the dough a couple of times and pat down to the thickness I want. I then use a large mouth cup to cut mine out.

Oh my these are delicious! I have finally found my biscuit recipe. It only took 70 yrs to do it. I think I am a pretty good cook, but I just hadn't found my recipe. Then BAM I made these and they are unbeatable.6 perfect biscuits.

Very easy biscuit recipe. Nice texture and they looked perfect. Only thing I wasn't 100% in love with was the baking powder flavor.

I have never made homemade biscuits before, this was my first attempt.  I followed the recipe and the suggestions about not over kneading and the biscuits turned out great.  It was a simple and easy recipe that I will definitely use again.

I give it five stars after making the recipe to a "T" first and seeing how they tasted. They were yum =3 and after the first time making them I made them a second time with a few alterations to the ingredients. Still yummy, fluffy, and so big! =D Great recipe! Thanks.

They came out perfectly and he actually ate 3 of them! My fiance and daughter are sold on them too! We love them warm with some yummy homemade apple butter..Just wanted to say THANK YOU...:D

I had to change a tiny bit (because I didn't have enough butter) so I added just under a stick of butter, a tablespoon (or so) of honey and instead of milk I used 1/2 & 1/2. They were great!!

This is simply THE best scone recipe and I love that it is so versatile! Moist and buttery, they don't irritate the roof of your mouth like the usual baking soda scones. This is the only recipe I use, and I just add whatever I like to change it up - right now, I'm using it to make delicious pumpkin scones! I have added sharp cheese and caraway, bacon and cheddar, and always have a batch of plain ones handy - they go wonderfully with chili and stews! And, yes, they are huge! To make them extra buttery and flaky, make sure not to cut the butter in too finely. YUM!

Great biscuit recipe. I followed it exactly, but used cold butter instead of shortening. I don't think I used a full cup of milk either. This made 6 biscuits with scraps that probably would have made another, but I was too lazy to roll the dough back out. I would cut down the salt if you use salted butter.

Hands down this is the best biscuit recipe I have found for the traditional Saturday night beans and biscuits.  People request these biscuits all the time and I never get tired of making them.  I find they are best baked in a well buttered cast iron skillet and a light coating of melted butter on the tops before you bake them.

I followed the recipe exactly. They came out not as big as I expected them to be, like the pictures. They were sort of bland but they served their purpose for being apart of biscuits and gravy! =) Thank you!

I cut the recipe in half and made them in my toaster oven and they turned out marvelously.  it's the perfect amount for when I'm making soup for myself and need something to go with it.

I just made these to go with a turkey dinner, because I didn't have time to make dinner rolls.  They were very delicious!  I did have to add about 1/2 cup more flour, because my dough was too sticky.  They turned out beautifully.  This is going to be my new biscuit recipe for sure!

These biscuits are perfect. Just need to make sure you don't roll them/pat them too thin, and that your baking powder is fresh/hasn't been sitting in the cupboard too long. Thanks for the great recipe!

I make great yeast rolls, but have never been satisfied with my biscuits.  I even looked for a "biscuit coach" years ago when someone in our church bragged about his biscuits. He apparently had a secret recipe, though. 
     Thanks for posting this recipe! This will be the recipe I'll use from now on! Now I know why my former attempts weren't that great.  The ingredients were "So close, so close but yet so far away!" (from My Eyes Adored you by Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan)

Great recipe.  I thought maybe it was a little heavy on the baking powder just based on the taste, but I know that's tricky with biscuits 'cause you need lots of baking powder for them to rise up nice.  About the gal who was having trouble working with the sticky dough.  Good biscuit dough is always like that.  Put a dusting of flour on your counter.  Turn out the dough from the bowl onto the counter and dust the top of the dough with a bit more flour so you can touch it to flatten it out.  It just takes some practice.  It also might help to butter your fingers.  The less you handle the dough the better though!  Good luck.

This is a wonderful recipe.It`s so easy to fix and I really like being able to stir up the dough and placing it in the refrigerator to use the next day if I need to.The flavor of the biscuits is wonderful and they also reheat very well in the microwave.I am sure I will be making these a lot.

This was the best biscuit recipe I have ever tried. I have never found a recipe that I have liked. This one tops them all! Super easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Not sticky like some of the other reviews mentioned. I made a breakfast pizza dough with it. I made a double batch and I will make biscuits tomorrow! Can't wait! Will never buy canned biscuit dough again! :)

Great biscuit recipe! I've tried several recipes that have disappointed, but this one is exactly what I'm looking for. I substituted margarine for the shortening, just added milk until the proper consistency (maybe 3/4 C.) and omitted the kneading-instead just patted the dough together. I definitely recommend brushing with melted butter. The biscuits turned out fluffy and perfect!

these biscuits did turn out huge, i made 12 smaller size biscuits, and they were very big.

make sure you roll the dough to about an inch thick, otherwise they will burn on the bottom and still be gooey in the middle.

i didnt like the taste of the added white sugar. i wont make these again. will stick to classic baking powder biscuit recipe.

Followed the directions in mixing the dough. After reading other reviews I did not have the intentions of  kneading the dough for 10-15 minutes, but the dough was way too sticky to roll out. So I kneaded the dough for a couple minutes then added a little bit of flour and rolled out the dough. My daughter was helping and I was not paying attention to the fact that she rolled the dough pretty thin so our biscuits were not very bit. They were more like small bite sized biscuits. I added a little bit of butter to the top when they came out of the oven. They were good, no one felt as though they were dry and tasteless. I will make this again and pay attention to size so they come out bigger, but overall these were good.

I have made these multiple times now. I use butter instead of shortening, and only use about 3/4 cup milk (as other reviewers suggested). The trick is to only add just as much milk as you need. Once everything is mixed (but make sure not to overwork it!), I dump it onto a piece of parchment paper and gently shape into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.  I usually double the recipe and make about 9 super biscuits! Simple to make and easy to eat, what's not to love?

These are the easiest, simplest and most fabulous plain biscuits.  I used butter today and they are still great.  These are my go to biscuits.  I started them at 5.05pm and they will be out of the oven in 3 minutes.  yummy!  PS I just make them as drop biscuits using my medium sized melon baller and I get 12 good sized biscuits

These biscuits come out great every time I make them.  Previously I didn't have much luck getting biscuits to rise, but no hockey pucks with this recipe!

Everyone I've made these for has loved them; I've never had leftovers! I've also tried making them with buttermilk instead of milk or butter instead of sugar, and they're delicious both ways, it just depends on your flavor preference! Using butter instead of shortening to me does turn out a slightly crisper, more Southern flavored biscuit! I never knead the dough, just turn it out and use my hands to flatten it to the shape/thickness I want. I typically use a juice glass as my cutter though and get 12-13 good sized biscuits still from that method.

This is a pretty good recipe. I substituted homemade buttermilk for the milk(1TB vinegar +1 cup milk,sit for 10 mins.),substituted 3 TB butter + 3 TB shortening(for flavor and tender texture), used a "pinch" of sugar and did not knead dough "at all". I gently pat my dough into a circle then cut with cutter. I also brushed tops with melted butter before and after baking.They have an excellent rise, flavor and texture. I dion't like to waist "scraps" so I gently pushed them together into a rectangle and baked as well. Great taste with no waste. Made 7 "big" biscuits.

Love these biscuits. They're great with the shortening, but I often use butter instead. I also sometimes decrease the flour by 1/4 cup to make a dumpling/biscuit topping for chicken casserole. It's delicious, no matter what you use it for.

These are great biscuits!  I add just a little extra milk and drop them by a tablespoon onto a baking sheet for drop biscuits.  Biscuit making has never been so easy!

I have to say, I use this site on a regular basis attempting to find easy and cost effective recipes for my culinary class.  I used this recipe today and was pleased that I did.  I teach students that believe that everything needs to come out of a box so making anything from scratch is a chore.  They were not only able to follow the recipe, but also make something that I would actually eat.  Now we did make a couple slight modifications: 1) We used butter flovored shortening 2) we brushed the top with butter Besides that good recipe, I would use it again

After making these twice, I won't make them again.  I don't understand all the great reviews.  They were okay, not spectacular.  I made them a second time just in case I had done something wrong, but got the same result.  I found them bland and dry.  Very disappointing after reading all the reviews....

This recipe is so easy!  I used 3/4 cup of milk when I lived in FL but now that I'm in Mexico City and at an altitude around 8000 ft., I use the whole cup.  My Mother-in-law, who is from South Carolina, was amazed at my biscuit making ability!

Came out tender and fluffy, but the taste was bland. My family agreed and said nothing more than "they're ok". I'll try again with a pinch more salt and an extra T. of sugar, as well as butter instead of shortening.

This is the first recipe for biscuits I have ever made.  I made a triple batch and brought them to our church coffeehouse and they were a huge hit. I gave out the recipe name and site to several people who couldn't wait to make them, too.  This recipe was so easy and the biscuits were delicious! We've had them with sausage gravy and corn chowder.  I will NEVER buy those canned biscuits again - these are too good and too easy.  I can't justify serving biscuits from a mix anymore.  :)

These were so good and thanks to the food processor tip, these were super easy. Mine didn't turn out very tall but they were still delicious and fluffy. I will definitely be repeating this one.

Even though I have been baking all my life, I've never made biscuits before.  My family has always used the canned refrigerated type but not only are they getting expensive, homemade is always healthier.  So with that said, I've tried these a few times now.  I like the food processor method recommended by another reviewer for the ease. I've substituted buttermilk for better flavor.  I found that not kneading produces a more tender biscuit than kneading.  I like making them ahead of time and refrigerating.  The last time I made them I added a garlic-herb cheese.  My only real problem with these is they take almost twice as long as the 13-15 min. baking time as stated in the recipe, maybe I'm making them too thick.  But I will be making these again.

Sooo good! Very light and fluffy and perfect with some homemade concord grape jelly! I had my 2 little brothers over for dinner. Needless to say I should have doubled the batch as they ate them and wanted more! Thanks for the recipe John!

Everyone in my house just loved these.  I was very surprised to see that putting them in a ziploc bag they stayed fresh and very soft for 2 days.  My one and only complaint is they are a little dry.  They worked out a lot better for me as the biscuits in biscuits and gravy, instead of biscuits and butter with dinner.

This is a very good biscuit recipe.  The only change I made is, I like to use butter flavored shortening for a slight buttery flavor.

Very good!  I didn't bother rolling them out.  I kneaded them in the bowl and then rolled them in balls between my palms.  I then flattened them on a cookie sheet.  Turned out great!

I LOVED THESE BISCUITS!! And that's saying something because I have /never/ been a biscuit person. I did add two extra spoonfuls of splenda blend sugar, but that's only because I like sweet bread. I made the mistake of patting the first batch out too much like I use to make them at Cracker Barrel. These biscuits don't really rise like those did, so they really do mean 1 inch thick.

easy easy It didn't rise as much as I wanted to though. Maybe humid weather made it that way. By the way, I didn't use all 1 cup of milk and it turned out just fine. I like buttermilk biscuit so this feels a bit blend but overall very easy and good!

This were great and will replace my old biscuit receipe.  I also used margerine instead of shortning and next time a little less milk.  I used the whole cup and they were a little sticky to work with at first.  They received more flour while I was kneading them and then they were perfect.  This is a very moist and tender and fluffy biscuit.

Very nice recipe, thank you JP!! This is the first time I've made American Biscuits (I'm South African) and already they are on my favourite short list, with a few minor adjustments. 1 Tablespoon BP - I used 3 teaspoons. 1 Tablespoon sugar - I used 2 teaspoons. 1/3 cup shortening - I used 62g Holsum. Instead of cutting out rounds I shaped the dough into an oblong, and cut into 6 pieces with a knife, then popped them into greased muffin pans. (Don't flatten them - as the BP works they will fill up the spaces in the pan.) Brush with milk. 15 minutes baking and I had golden, crisp on the outside soft on the inside biscuits.  The less you handle the dough the lighter they  will be.  These are a cross between what we would call a scone and a bread roll. Hubby loved them with syrup!!

I find you need to let these sit for a bit in the unrolled dough form and it works best... maybe gives it time to rise or something like that. They do make yummy biscuits for sure!

These were very good, but next time I'll increase the salt a little.  I now need a biscuit cutter.  I used a canning rim instead, and it crushed the sides instead of cutting through them, so it messed up the rise.  Even so, a very successful biscuit!

I normally make biscuits from a mix but decided to make them from scratch for our Labor Day brunch.  The only change I made was to substitute butter for shortning. The unanimous opinion was these were the best biscuits ever!

I wanted to make biscuits this morning but was sad that all the recipes called for shortening, which I dont have.  Luckily, I read some reviews of this recipe that said it is ok to substitute butter, so I made them.  They turned out great.  I love the soft texture.  I will make them again. Thanks!

Yum! These are so amazing, as is. I've altered this recipe a few times to what I have on hand, ie butter instead of shortening, and sometimes I put in more sugar to make sweet biscuits, adding honey also makes these delicious. I serve them with honey butter or eat as is, fresh and warm.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Yum! needed some biscuits in a hurry. These were easy, fluffy and flavorful!  Didn't have any vegetable shortening, so I used butter. Didn't feel like rolling it out, so I just split it up in some extra large muffin tins. This was so quick and easy and had such great results. I will make this many more times!

I thought they were pretty awesome. Maybe a tad bit gooey but that was probably my fault for making them a bit thicker than 1 inch when I rolled them. I sifted all the dry ingredients together instead of whisking it. It's a very easy recipe. I'll be making them for my family again.

for me these turned out amazing.(: just tips, make sure you definately only use the minimum needed milk or their really hard to work with. another thing, i used half shortening and half butter for flavor and texture like the other reviews suggested and it worked wonderfully.(: dont need to knead all that much and stick to the original directions on thickness, first time around i cut them waayyy to thin. but once i got it together they turned out great.(: they taste good and are fluffy!

This was an easy recipe....I hate rolling things out, so instead I used the whole cup of milk (I also used butter instead of shortening), set the dough in the fridge to 'thicken' up and then kinda formed them with my hands......baked on the top shelf, then brushed with butter when finished. Although these were very light and fluffy, they were kinda bland tasting....I will have to fix that somehow next time I make them.

These biscuits were delicious and a snap to make. I ran out of shortening so i used butter instead. I made them smaller, so i got about 12 biscuits. We ate them with beef goulash as well as butter and jam. Wow! Will definately make often!

These were very good I rolled mine out to make four layers of biscuit. On the bottom layer I put real bacon bits, second layer I put cheese and the third layer I put chives then added more cheese on the top of the biscuits. Then cut out the biscuits. It made them a bit heavier but tasted so good.

These rose wonderfully and tasted good. The only complaint I have were that for us they were very salty. Next time I will reduce the salt by half.

This recipe deserves 5 stars. Easy to follow except that I used my Food processor and I turned out 6 beautiful biscuits ready for sausage gravey.  I have tried other recipes for biscuits and all have failed miserably.  Thanks

These are delicious and remind me of my grandmother.   This was my first experience making biscuits and I found it to be incredibly easy. The texture and taste is just perfect. The only change that I made was to use butter instead of shortening because I don't have any shortening. Other than that I followed the recipe perfectly. I can't wait to make them again and experiment a little bit more! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Just made these biscuits to go along with a creamy soup for dinner tonight. They turned out exactly as I had hoped! I followed the recipe exactly but didn't use as much milk as required. Still, my dough was a bit wet, so I added some more flour. Baked them for just 10 minutes and they were perfect. Yielded about 7 rolls. From start to finish, this maybe took me 30 minutes. Thanks for the simple recipe! (P.S. They taste almost exactly like the biscuits from KFC).

Great biscuit recipe.  We made these biscuits with Bill's Sausage and Gravy recipe and it was delicious.  Our waistlines will be paying for this but definitely worth it.  A keeper for our family.  Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent biscuits! Tasted just like I was looking for and I can't wait to try the trick of leaving it in the fridge overnight and seeing how big they are in the morning.

This will forever be my favorite biscuit recipe. I let my biscuits sit out for about 15 minutes before I popped them in the oven and they puffed up beautifully and tasted amazing! I cut some of them too thick though, so a few of them were pretty doughy even though they were cooked on the outside.

Great recipe.  I substituted butter for the shortening.  I mixed the ingredients but skipped the kneading altogther.  I spooned out the dough onto a cookie sheet (for drop biscuits).  GREAT! and with much less effort than the orginal recipe requires.

This was a very good recipe. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, when it's humid, you adjust the recipe to suite that. It comes with experience. I had flattened a few of them too flat, and they didn't puff up as much as I would have liked, but that was *my* fault! This is a fantastic, quick biscuit recipe! Will be a go to from now on!

I have never made home-made biscuits before and am typically not a biscuit lover. But I decided to make them on Father's Day (above all days) and they turned out GREAT!!! My hubby, two teen age boys, and three little ones devoired them. There was even a few tears when my daughter realized they were all gone. 5 stars for this one :)

Delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out tasty, browned and delightfully light. I will use this recipe every time I want Biscuits and Gravy, with strawberry Jam or just a fresh baked biscuit right out of the oven. Yummy!! Thanks for the post, J.P. !

I followed the recipe as written.  The biscuits came out nice, though not very brown, even after extra minutes in the oven - it could be the weather (very very humid), but they did rise up nicely.  I will definitely be making these again - they were fast and easy.  I would say total of 35 minutes with prep and cooking time.

Yum-O!!!  These are one of the BEST biscuit recipes I've ever found.  I used butter instead of shortening just because that's all I had, and they turned out GREAT!  I also cooked them on my stoneware, so the tops were golden and the bottoms were cooked perfect!  Next time I'll try what another review suggested and brush the tops of them with melted butter before baking.

I made these biscuits about a month ago and i must say that these were amazing! I substituted the shortening with butter and I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour.These came out perfect. I ate 6 of the 9 biscuits that i made and my son ate 3. I will always make these. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Really great flavor.  Mine did not rise well, but I was in a hurry, didn't let them chill as suggested by some of the reviewers.  I also might need to re-check my baking powder "use by" date.  I think next time I might use self-rising flour.  I have better success on the height issues, but overall, I'm definitely keeping this recipe.  Thanks for sharing - delicious!

Followed the recipe to the tee, and to my surprise... a huge dissapointment. Sorry, but bisquick would have been much better. However, I do have to say this is a good biscuit for serving with sausage & gravy... My husband usually raves about my baking...Not a word was said...ooops  sorry honey..maybe next time.  I'll try another...

I can think of no better use of flour -- I LOVE this recipe. It does take a few times before one can master the art of biscuit making. My first few times making these biscuits were good tasting but not nearly as big as the biscuits we make now. We literally make this recipe weekly. Soooooo good! (I've also mixed in wheat flour with decent results.)

I love this recipe and use it all the time, but never never roll it out.  I take it out of the bowl gently and pat it out to form a circle then use a cookie cutter or glass to cut out the buscuits.    They rise nice and high!

This is by far my FAVORITE biscuit recipe! I think I've discovered the secret to making big flaky biscuits (besides starting with an amazing recipe). I saw this on the Food Network and it truly works! Here's what ya do...once you've mixed your dough and flopped it onto the counter (make sure your dough isn't too wet) begin to roll or flatten it out (I use my hands), dust the top with a little flour and fold it over itself, flatten again, dust with flour and fold...do this a few times and then flatten to your desired thickness and cut into biscuits. The folds provide even air pockets and you end up with a biscuit that pulls apart in flaky wonderful-ness :) Good luck!

I love this recipe.  These biscuits are great whether they're served with jam or sausage gravy.  I use butter instead of shortening and I agree with the advice to not overmix once you add the milk.  Mix until it just comes together, pat out and cut out the biscuits.

These were easy to make and came out looking great.  However, they tasted more like pancakes than biscuits.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

These are great biscuts from scratch, perfect for spreading jam on or smothering in gravy.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My biscuits failed to rise but maybe 1/4 of an inch.  Being married to a southern man I am on a quest to find biscuits that are big and moist - this one won't do it for us.

I have been using this recipe for years! It is fail safe - as others have noted, the full cup of milk is not necessary just add until you have the right doughy consistency.  Sometimes I substitute buttermilk for milk, for a fluffy delectable flavor, or I sometimes add a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese for a variation, add to the dry ingredients before the milk.  Sometimes I add chopped roasted garlic for another variation.  A great biscuit all-around!

I LOVE this biscuit recipe!  I've been making it for a couple of years now at least, and it's my favorite.  My Southern food loving family and friends ask for the recipe every time I make them.  I make mine a bit smaller, so I get 7 or 8 from a recipe.  Never fail!  My kids love them with jam, and equally great with gravy in the morning.

Excellent! I rolled these slightly thinner than an inch - maybe 3/4 - and they were perfect. A biscuit for biscuits & gravy or a base for shortcake - couldn't ask for better.

LOVE....L-O-V-E...this recipe. I was looking for a simple recipe so I could include biscuits in a gift bag with homemade jelly....This is it! Making my second batch of the day. I followed the recipe as written, took a suggestion and raised the oven rack to the top. They are perfect!

These biscuits are amazing! They taste like fresh-made biscuits from a restaurant, and are pretty easy to make. I make them for breakfast whenever we have people stay the night. I also end up adding a lot more flour when I knead them, so that the dough isn't sticky. They turn out perfect. Great recipe, thanks JP!

Decent biscuits.  They didn't rise as much as I would have liked but for non buttermilk biscuits they were good.  I will try this recipe again but add some baking soda and use buttermilk instead or milk.

I've had better. These biscuits were pretty dense. The batter/dough turned out great but once they were cooked they were big and heavy. We drank a lot of milk to help get them down. Won't be making them again.

I used this recipe to make cinnamon rolls and it was awesome!!! Followed the recipe exactly, but when I rolled it out I put a thin layer of butter as the dough, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, rolled,cut and baked at the same temp. Tried other biscuit recipes that didn't work. This was AWESOME! Big and fluffy great taste! Thanks big daddy!!!!!!

This is so good, I use whole wheat flour, which doesn't rise as well, but really gives the bisquits something to claim. They are hearty, yummy things that I will make anytime I make bisquits

When I want to spend the extra time to do a biscuit the right way I use this recipe. It takes a bit longer than others but it is consistent and the results are impressive. If your hard to please mother-in-law is in town. This is the recipe you want to use.

Best biscuit recipe I've encountered thus far! I did make one small change...I substituted butter for the shortening. Tip: when you add butter, make sure it's cold...and grate it into your dry ingredients. When you grate the butter in, it mixes more thoroughly, giving you even fluffier biscuits!    This recipe also makes great herbed biscuits...just add 1 tbsp. of your favorite dried herb to the dry ingredients (I've used rosemary and an Italian blend) and...voila!

I make these biscuits all the time, they are awesome! Sometimes I use butter instead of shortening. Either way is delicious! It seems they get a little crispier on the outside when I use butter. You can also use buttermilk instead of millk.

Very good biscuits. Don't forget to wipe the flour off the bottom before they bake. It does make them a little dry if you don't. I may add a little bit of butter on top as they bake next time.

Light and fluffy but with a definite baking powder taste. I'm going to try a few of the modifications as those were rated very highly.

Best biscuits!!!  Holy cow, I've been looking for a good biscuit recipe that wasn't too doughy like some restaurants.  This is it!!!  Took another reviews advice and used the food processor to get the dough together, which made it so simple.  Followed the recipe except that I used butter instead of shortening.  Marvelous!  Can't see making another other biscuits again.  Definitely give them a try! ***Update: Made them again this morning.  Accidentally poured in 2 C milk instead of 1.  Decided to try doubling the recipe and they came out perfectly again!

Very popular in a house of men!  They loved it and decided that they were better than the "Grands" they love so much.  I didn't change a thing and they turned out wonderfully.  This is my go to biscuit recipe now.

I have made these biscuits several times. The first time exactly as written (and they were very good), then I made a few changes because that's just what I do. Cook's Illustrated suggests replacing part of the buttermilk with sour cream in their pancake recipe because, they say, modern , cultured, pastureized buttermilk is less flavorful than the real thing. Using that logic, I made this recipe tonight with 2/3 cup buttermilk and 1/3 cup sour cream. The taste was excellent. Next time I plan to also replace part of the shortening with butter and make them ahead of time as some others have done. I also fold just 3-4 times and pat into a square a little over an inch thick and cut into six biscuits with a sharp knife. I also slip them under the broiler the last minute or so to get a golden brown on top. Wonderful recipe John, thank you!

I've made these twice now - once following directions exactly except replacing all-purpose with whole wheat flour, and once with all the right ingredients but not kneading it. The first time the biscuits were only ok - whole wheat flour isn't great in baking powder biscuits, I learned. The second time I got PHENOMENAL biscuits, the best I've ever made! Crispy on the outisde, nice and soft on the inside. Thanks so much, this is my new go-to biscuit recipe!

This is a awsome recipe!! I have made them dozens of times and never had a problem with them. For christmas morning i made up this mix the night before except i didnt add the milk. I covered it with a damp towle overnight and in the morning i was able to just add milk , kneed and had fresh hot biscuits baking in no time at all. I  always double or triple my recipe cause they are a huge hit. I like to use butter flavored shorting and when they are done brush the top with butter but they are great without it.

Wow!  These are the most amazing biscuits I have ever made.  Replaced 1/2 cup of the white flour with whole wheat and lard instead of the shortening. I was worried about all of that milk and the soggy mess it made of the dough, but kneading it a little with more flour made it just right.  Popped them right into the oven and they skyrocketed!  A slice of butter and a generous spoon of preserves on these hot biscuits is divine.

I made these tonight for the second time. They were fantastic! The first time I made them, they were a flop, but the second was amazing. I tried them first in a food processor, but that overdid it. The second time, i did it the way the barefoot contessa says: in my KitchenAid.  Put all the dry ingredients together in your mixer and give it a quick spin. Cut the butter into pieces and throw them in. Run the mixer on low, until the butter's broken up into pea sized pieces. Then, add the milk slowly until just combined. Then take it out and pat down on floured surface. You can fold it over once to get more out of it, but throw away the rest because it's too tough after that. Brush the tops with butter and a little salt and bake. IMPORTANT: make sure your oven's at the right temperature! That really does make all the difference.

My first attempt at making biscuits! They puffed up great and were nice and flaky but were a little dry. I think I may have overworked the dough a little bit. Brushing melted butter on the top of the biscuits helped. Will use butter/margarine in place of the shortening next time. There was a slight baking powder taste but I'm hoping the butter/margarine flavor will help hide this. Overall a good, easy recipe. Thanks!

I will always make my biscuits from scratch from now on- these are delicious! I did not follow the instructions, though, for kneading the dough- only just barely mixed the milk in(I used butter for the shortening too). In my oven 13 minutes was a tad too long, so next time I will take them out a little earlier. Excellent otherwise though and I will be making again many times!

These were super!  I was surprised I could get biscuits like this without having to use a recipe that calls for rising.  They were so easy, and yet so good.  Let's just say it right out: they are just like the biscuits at KFC, but way cheaper.

Tried these was excited to make from scratch but found them to be a little dry.  Will make again but add a bit more liquid and brush to tops with butter.

Like so many others.. I've made flat, chewy biscuits so many times I gave up. I made these for my family, and these were an instant hit! They more than doubled in size, and were light and flaky! WOW!

Oh dear.  This recipe didn't work out for me at all.  Not exactly sure what I did wrong (I try to follow recipes exactly), but the biscuits turned out thin and dry, and within a few hours closely resembled hockey pucks.    I'm giving it 3 stars because there's every possibility I screwed something up and the actual recipe is just fine.

I tried, years ago, to make biscuits from scratch. maybe it was my baking powder, maybe it was the recipe, but they came out like little hockey pucks.  I decided to try these, because it was the first recipe that I had the ingredients for.  OH MY WORD... these puffed up better than those store biscuits, they were EASY as could be and they were YUMMMMYYYYY. Great recipe. Next time I will make a double batch and cut them bigger.

Whereas these are fantastic biscuits I wouldn't consider them to die for. There was a faint baking powder after taste that I'm not very fond of. But since I don't really care for biscuits and I could stand these. I'd say they're pretty good. It sounds like these can get huge, mine weren't but I did think they were a nice size. I mixed mine as another reviewer suggested, in a food processor, so easy! Thanks!

I was not impressed with this recipe, but I think it could be improved upon...it's a good base.  I followed it exactly for the first batch and the biscuits were rather flat and way too salty.  For the second batch I cut the salt to 1tsp., used margarine instead of shortening and didn't knead them or roll them out, just patted them to about 1.25 inch and then cut out.  I had better results with a small circle as far as rising goes.  These were nowhere near the Grands biscuits but I'll keep working with recipe to see if I can get there.  Thanks for a great base!

I was really amazed when I tried this recipe. I normally make yeast breads and could never get the biscuits to turn out, but these were wonderful. The flavor, size and softness were perfect. I used a combination of suggestions as far as tweaking the baking powder and buttermilk. My family could not believe how good they tasted. Definitely a keeper.

if there was a way of giving 10 stars, my husband would do just that to this recipe these are so good and yes they are big.the 2nd tme i turned mine into pizza dough  wow excellent pizza. but i did add finely chopped parsley to the dough at the very end just before turning onto floured surface then roll it out to desired thickness , you may not want to make it too thick as it is very filling, bake for about 5 minutes, remove from oven and top with yo favorite toppings, return to oven and bake until done maybe another 10 minutes. Will definitely be using this recipe as my pizza dough recipe since my husband doesnt eat yeast he was so happy to finally eat pizza after such a longtime. he ate about 3/4 of the whole pizza but we stil had leftovers after my 3yr old son and i had eaten our share

I just made these and had to immediately review.  I was worried because the dough seemed a bit stickier than what I had expected, but they turned out absolutely delicious!  After backing I drizzled them with a little melted butter mixed with honey and we ate them just like that.  They were fantastic!

These biscuits are just like the ones my mom makes, that she learned from her mom!  The only problem with my mom's recipe is that there is no recipe- she did everything by "feel" and so I never knew how to make them.  I know that these biscuits have the same ingredients that she uses, but now I know how to make them! I did take another reviewers advice and use my food processor for mixing- it was incredibly easy and took only minutes to turn out homemade biscuits. No more canned biscuits for us!

I have looked and looked, searching everywhere, for a perfect biscuit recipe.  I have been unable to find it....until now!  This is the best biscuit I have ever made!  I was even out of all-purpose white flour and had to use unbleached flour...and they were still light and fluffy!!  I also used cold butter in place of shortening.  Thank you for this recipe...I will use it always!

These are the best biscuits!  I make them exactly according to his instructions and they come out perfect every time.  I have used them as regular biscuits with dinner, for strawberry shortcake, with jam, and just last night as the topping on a potpie.  So great every time.  I think the trick really is in not overkneading it.  Thanks!

These were ok...my 3 year old didn't even finish one - and he LOVES biscuits.  I made them larger but the were still pretty flat - not at all flaky.  They did rise a tad...Thanks for sharing!

Well, I tried not to add too much flour, but I always do, so these did not turn out like the fluffy biscuits that the recipe touts.  That not to say that they weren't Loved!  I kind of think they tasted like a bit like KFC's biscuits, but then again I am not a biscuit connoisseur.  We had them with sausage and gravy.  Good combination. Easy to make.

I don't know just what I was expecting when I made these, super biscuits I guess. They were easy to make, but are just baking powder biscuits. Nothing special. I gave it 4 stars for the ease in making.

This is a simple but great recipe. I substituted magarine for the shortening. I also melted a little magarine & brushed the tops of the biscuits. This is a keeper!

Other than getting much puffier than regular biscuits, we didn't taste any difference.  I think I'll just stick to the Bisquick biscuits because they are quicker to make.

This recipe came in the Daily Dish today and sounded good with some creamed chicken on them for dinner.  (We have some left over Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style.) They came together quickly and easily and tasted great. I had butter flavored shortening, so I used that and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I give these 5 stars. I did not have enough all purpose flour, so I used self rising flour instead and I used 1 cup of beer instead of milk. They came out excellent. I definitely will be making these again. My nephew was here for supper and he said that these would taste great for biscuits and gravy (his favorite).

Made this exactly as written but without the kneading. They turned into hockey pucks (tasted okay though). Not sure if this was user error or the fact that I live in relentlessly rainy Oregon. Too bad I won't be able to really figure that out until it stops raining in May!

These biscuits are fantastic. I have tried many biscuit recipes over the years and this is by far the best. Especially with home made honey-cinnamon butter.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? My daughter probably put it best, when she said she could eat all of them by herself. These are delicious and very easy to make. The prep time is longer than it took me, but I baked them a few minutes longer to get that golden brown top. thanks!

OMG!  This was the first time I ever attempted to make biscuits before but this recipe right here made me seem like I've done it a 1000 times!!!  One thing, I didn't have any milk so incorporated  half and half instead.  It actually took about 2/3 instead of a full cup.  They came out so fluffy and beautiful that I HAD to eat a couple right away so I made some sausage gravy and chowed down.  They were FANTASTIC!!  Thank you thank you thank you!  My husband is going to flip out when I told him I made biscuits from scratch.

5 stars for taste and ease.  I didn't time them, I just took them out once they were a light golden brown.  They melt in your mouth!  Oh yeah, I used buttermilk.

These are really fluffy, big biscuits!  Used butter, as did some of the other reviewers.  Made a little early,so put in PAMed and buttered foil, as suggested, and refrigerated until ready to pat out and cut into biscuits.  Very tasty; thanks for sharing!

Great basic biscuit- made with super sausage gravy which was also good, but they'd be great with jam, butter- anything really!  I used some whole wheat flour instead of all white and they turned out great.  Also substituted margarine in for shortening.

Very tasty! I have made them numerous times; in fact, this is now THE recipe for biscuits in our house. I have even made them as drop biscuits when I was in a rush and they were still excellent. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was super nervous making these since I was making biscuits for the first time for our large extended family while on vacation... but they were absolutely fantastic and everyone raved about them. I served with a sausage gravy recipe from this sight and everyone ate until they were stuffed! Great recipe :)

I have never attempted to make biscuits, but this recipe looked so simple I couldn't resist.  Despite the fact that I added too much milk and patted mine down to 1/2 in instead of 1 in, the flavor was still great and they were light and fluffy on the inside!  I mixed just until the batter came together and then patted the dough out (no additional kneading).  I also subbed butter for shortening.  I served them hot out of the oven with "Fluffy Scrambled Eggs" from this site.  It was just like a Sunday morning breakfast out, only my husband and I were still in our pajamas!  I can't wait to try these biscuits again - next time with sausage and gravy!

That's an amazing recipe. I followed every step and used butter instead of shortening. My kids just love them... fluffy and tasteful! In my country, biscuits are not popular but since I came back from US I can't live without them. I think the secret is not working much the batter. If you do knead it much...your biscuit will come out heavy and dense.

These were okay... nothing above and beyond spectacular, though.  Mine didn't come out very fluffy - seemed rather heavy and dense.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, but the results could have stemmed from something I did in the process.

These do not live up to the hype. Not light and fluffy- kind doughy. No flavor. Just fine for deer camp.

Awesome recipe! This doesn't need another rating but I just had to. These are big, light, and a great biscuit. I added some dried oregano as we had these with a little Italian salad and they were a big hit.

This is such a good, fast, SIMPLE recipe! My 1st attempt at homemade biscuits and, while they didn't rise to the fluffy heights I had hoped (I think I may have let them sit out too long before baking), they are delicious and versatile. Love that I keep the staple ingredients in my pantry, so I'll always be able to make these in a pinch.

MMMM MMMMM MMMMM!!! Biscuits are now one of my favorite foods! I'm in Germany right now, where I eat fresh bread from local bakeries every day, but I decided to try baking biscuits for fun, and I am amazed - they are even better! I had forgotten how wonderful they are!

These were the first time I made biscuits from scratch. They were phenomenal!! I mixed the dough just enough for everything to come together and then kneaded for about 5 minutes. I didn't need the full amount of milk, used about 3/4 cup. The biscuits came out so fluffy and soft! I will be making more tomorrow for biscuits and gravy! Yum!

I did use goats milk and spectrum trans fat free shortening.  Instead of rolling, I just used a #12 foodservice scoop and got about 5 1/2 biscuits.  I used a stand mixer to combine the ingredients.  Made it easier and still got the delicious taste.

I love this biscuit mix, I've also used it for dumping by adding a little more milk about 1/4 cup.

I'm converted... WOW, these are good. I cut in cubed cold butter instead of shortening. I wasn't about to bother with freezing it and shaving it, and you don't need to either, they still turn out great. I went ahead and added the whole cup of milk at once and found it to be too much. After adding a little more flour the dough was beautiful to work with. I rolled it to 1 inch thick and use a cup to cut rounds. Baked them for 13 min. and they were HUGE, FLUFFY, YUMMY! I got 8 giant biscuits. I will never buy them from the can again...

These are awesome and easy if you're looking for a scratch biscuit recipe. I often just drop them on the baking sheet rather than rolling and cutting them out since we have a small kitchen and usually more then one cook working at once. Everyone loves the results!

These were awesome. Pretty easy to make, aesthetically pleasing, and soft on the inside. Just don't misread and add baking SODA instead of baking POWDER. Oops. And ugh.

These biscuits have a fantastic 5 star taste, but are flat and dense.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the use of butter in place of the shortening.  Next time I will try others' suggestions of refrigerating the dough overnight before baking to see if that helps.  Big, light, and fluffy they were not.

Very good recipe - On the quest for the perfect biscuit recipe, I've made 4 different versions from other recipes. This one is by FAR the best. However, the taste wasn't spectacular. I may split the shortening with butter next time.

Do NOT refridgerate the dough! I put mine in overnight and they had a weird texture and they didn't taste good. Nobody finished a single biscuit and I was throughly embarassed.

I don't know what happened, although the flavor was good, the biscuits were a little too dense. They didn't have a fluffy texture. I even mixed by hand, not electric mixer AND sifted dry ingredients. Will try again and NOT refridgerate dough.

These were pretty good.  I only made a 1/2 batch since it was only my hubby and I having dinner. I didn't need as much milk as the recipe called for and I don't think they fluffed up that high, but I would make them again maybe adding a bit more baking powder.

these turned out pretty good.  i have never made biscuits before and i was pretty apprehensive.  the dough was not as difficult to work w/ as i imagined.  i used the food processor to blend which i'm sure helped a lot.  i served them w/ cool whip and strawberries along w/ a glaze, 'strawberries in spiced syrup' from this site.  i will make these again.

Good, but I cut down the salt... I don't like them really salty. I might add a bit more sugar next time. Very easy, they almost double in height.

I first gave this 5 stars in 2009. Have made these dozens of times since,  just as written, except for the amount of milk. Love this recipe!!

I'm a much better cook than a baker, so taking that into consideration I'd say these came out pretty good! I'll definately try this again, but I'll use butter instead of shortening, as most people have suggested.

So deserving of 5 stars. These biscuits are moist and delicious. I always wished I could make biscuits like what you get in a restaurant and now I can. Yummy!!

These were awesome! I didn't change a thing.  I used my food processor and that made it so easy.  I only needed half of the milk.  Mine didn't raise to much, so next time I think I'll let them sit a little while before I bake them.

Fabulous!  Added some ground flax seed for a modicum of healthiness, used the food processor with GREAT results (thanks for the tip here in the reviews!), and the brushed-on butter, after baking, made them restaurant-quality!

It was good, I used butter, but found that I had way too much flour on the bottom left and the rise wasn't great- I think I over mixed it- while being very careful.  I'm a baker and I usually use a  kitchen aid on low with a cup of butter rather then half.  MarinA

These were the best biscuits I have made yet! The only thing I did differently was to substitute half coconut oil for the shortening, and the other half I used butter (I don't have any shortening). These were delicious!

Excellent and easy to make!  I used the food processor to combine the ingredients and rolled it out a little thinner than the recipe states- I got about 12 skinny biscuits that way.  They were DELICIOUS!

This was my first attempt at biscuits from scratch, and I was impressed! I used over half whole wheat flour (ran out of white), but they still turned out great. My kids loved them, too!

These were soo good and easy to make. I made them with my two little girls and they had so much fun playing in the flour and cutting out the biscuits.  I did use butter instead of shortening but that is the only thing I changed. I think they would also be good with cheese and garlic added maybe I will try that next time.

These are FABULOUS biscuits!  I doubled the batch & ended up adding another 1/2 c. flour to get the right consistency.  YUM.  Got rave reviews from my bread co-op that I am a part of for one of the nights I made bread for our group's families.

Great recipe, which was simple to follow. However, per some reviews, I used 1/2 cup of milk rather than a whole cup. Rolling the dough was easy. Using a large glass, I ended up with 4 biscuits instead of 6. Next time, I think I'll double the recipe. Made the recipe again 4/24/09. This time, the biscuits stayed in pan 45 minutes before baking - ditto on "huge" biscuits. Next time I'll make night before and see results in morning when baking.

My very first attempt at homemade biscuits at the tender age of 58.  Turned out great, although I did end up leaving them in the oven longer than the recipe stated.  The problem may be Denver's altitude.  I tried to make amendments to the recipe taking into account the altitude, but I'm still happy with my first attempt.

These were surprisingly fast to make and came out perfectly without having to worry about getting the measurements exact. The only precaution I took was making sure to not over-kneed since I have worked with other baked goods before, where the goal is to generate layers of air. They are every bit as good as the version from my favorite southern restaurant, Babe's Chicken House.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe and I didn't have the prep time available, so I threw all the dry ingredients in the Kitchen Aid mixer - mixed thoroughly. Next, I slowly added the shortening and lastly the milk. It was a little too wet, so I sprinkled in some flour while it was mixing. Then patted out the dough on a floured counter, used a smallish biscuit cutter and put them in the oven. They taste wonderful! Finally!- I don't have to go to the local diner to get the best biscuits in town!

Oh wow...this is one of the best recipes I have tried in a long time.  I'm a southern girl and biscuit snob.  The only thing I did differently is use Buttermilk instead.  I did use my food processor to mix everything and the taste was out of this world.  Loved the texture and the height of these babies were huge!  Thank you so much for a great biscuit recipe.

I use a pastry cutter to cut in the shortening. I use butter flavor crisco and start with very cold ingredients. This is to date the best biscuit recipe I have tried ! It is very simple and yeilds very tender and deliciuos results.

Great recipe! Really simple (no way I spent 30 minutes on prep!) And I had no shortening, didn't want to use up my butter, so I used canola oil. Also didn't realize I could skimp on the milk-it was too much so I added more flour. Got 10 very tall, fluffy, delicious biscuits!

Have made them as-is and with butter instead of the shortening and either way they are delicious! Thank you!

They were pretty good.  Turned out fluffy. I have seen many similar recipes and don't know if I would make a point of referring back to AR to search out this one

They were okay, I made them several times per the recipe to have an review like the others. NO DICE. They were still wonderful with a nice texture. Wonderful with honeybutter. But I will stick with Buttermilk biscuits.

I love these! I was looking for a good non-buttermilk biscuit recipe and this is it! I cut mine a bit smaller with my grandma's biscuit cutter and I butted them up against each other on the pan, so that they'd puff up together and get that nice fluffy pull-apart edge. They came out perfectly delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

These biscuits were good and hearty.  They would go good with gravy in the morning.  We had them with honey-butter at dinner and they were delicious that way too.

I needed a fast and easy recipe for biscuits since my husband wanted them and we didn't have any mix or refridgerator kind. I found this and I LOVED it! They were good even without the sauce! (We made biscuits & gravy). Awesome!!

First time ever, no butter in the fridge. And a craving for biscuits strikes. Made these with canola, and let the sit for a bit. Were great...slightly acidic tasting but that's probably my ancient b.p.'s fault.

Tasted just like the homemade biscuit mom used to make! I made one recipe of this, used my small biscuit cutter, and ended up getting 22 biscuits out of it.  I placed them on top of a crab cassarole that I had thrown together and baked them.  Went perfect with the cassrole.  I cant even imagine how big of biscuits these would be to only get 6 out of them!  Thanks!

I must be completely jaded by the dough boy featured on America's favorite canned biscuits. I wanted to try to make these from scratch and I found this recipe with hopes from the over 1,000 reviews.. Unfortuantely, I must've missed the stop on the five star train. They taste very "doughy" and I don't think the time provided was enough. Oh well.. I'll try again with another recipe. At least I made them with Sausage Gravy to cover up the floury taste...

These weren't bad. I will definitely either cook these less next time or I will make bigger biscuits so they won't be so crunchy as mine were. I halved the recipe and had about 12 small biscuits, so this recipe makes a lot. Buttermilk will be a great addition in the future.

Absolutely wonderful! I have never made biscuits before but now I will NEVER buy them pre-made again! These were so tasty that I had to make two batches because my kids came in and ate the first batch. They are great plain or with butter and jam but I made them for biscuits and gravy. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very tasty.  I only had skim milk, so I used half milk - half sour cream.  The biscuits didn't rise very high, but I attribute that to either the sour cream or old baking powder.  I will definitely make these again.

Delicious. I took the advice regarding using the food processor and it work out beautifully.  I think that I need to practice a few more times in order to achieve mile high biscuits.

THIS is my only biscuit recipe now! Tall and fluffy and delicious. No more biscuits from the store for us! These are foolproof and quick.  
Great with soups and fried in my cast iron for morning coffee. I brought a heaping basket of these warm from the oven, on a tray with homemade jams and jellies, cheeses, fruit and chocolates for guests...they are still talking about it! These bicuits will make a great impression.

These are great! Great base recipe for fluffy wonderful biscuits, I handled them too much, so they didn't get huge, but still came out wonderfully! Next time I'll let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour or so, barely handle it, and cut them a little thicker, but I'll use this recipe all the time.

These biscuits tasted great!  I made them for my kids for breakfast with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and they gobbled em up! I can see how this would be a very versatile recipe. I used all butter in the recipe. They weren't as fluffy as I would have liked, but I think I handled the dough too much, as I kept making it too thin. It is my first time making biscuits, so kind of to be expected! I still ended up with quite a bit more than 6!  I will definetley be making these again, handling less, and brushing with butter on the tops next time.  Thanks :-)

Wow, this was super and it was better than I expected. It worked out real good just like KFC. I added margarine instead of shortening and added 1 tsp white vinegar to sour the milk and it was great! I also baked it on a pizza pan with holes to get a good texture on the bottom and so it wouldn't get too brown and hard on the bottom. It cooked evenly all over. I did also brush melted butter on the tops before baking and it just looked beautiful when it came out. This is the best recipe I have found and will keep it as a treasure. I will also use it as a base to make dumplings, shortcake, and cobblers. Thank You!!! And a job well done!

Oh yes!  This is what I've been looking for!  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, but just because I had it on hand.  I brushed the biscuits with melted butter before and after baking.  Yum.

Yum yummy...very well done.  I replaced the shortening with butter and cooked for 13 minutes.  Cut in butter with my hands as I couldn't locate the pastry blender.

VERY good biscuits!  After the first bite, I said these were the best biscuits you could make without buttermilk.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again and again and again.  Thanks!

These were awesome biscuits. They were moist and tasted great. I was out of shortening so I used butter instead. 
My biscuits didn't brown on top. Does anyone have a tip to get them to brown. I did brush with butter before baking. Could that be why?

I couldn't find my regular biscuit recipe so I made these instead hoping they would be even better.  Well, I was disappointed. While they deliver on the name "Big Daddy" in that they puffed up quite high, the taste and texture was poor.  They were tough and dry and not flavorful. I won't be trying this one again.

This recipe is excellent, much better than store bought. We used butter in place of shortening and the flavor was awesome. This recipe is definitely a winner.

Delicious! I used soy milk instead of the milk and margarine instead of the shortening. Did not add an entire cup of soy milk, just enough until it formed a dough. Drizzled with maple syrup straight from the oven and tasted great!

oops.. i totally got confused with the temp. I thought it was 220º F .. so i started baking them and 15 min later they were still raw.. so i set the oven to 350º F and baked another 15 min. they are still really good!! they didnt rise that much but I think thats because I havent dominated the biscuit skill yet. I will upload a picture later. thanks j.p!

These were very tender!  I used butter instead of shortening and it gave them great flavor. I also only used 2 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 3/4 c. of milk.  I didn't roll them out.  I just formed biscuits by hand and they turned out very nicely!

Perfect as is. If you'd like them for dessert I would add an additional tablespoon of sugar. My son loves them that way for dessert.

Yummo! Thank you for this recipe! Everyone in the family enjoyed. I'll probably double the batch next time, they were so good. The little one loved using the cookie cutter to cut different shapes. I've never had a christmas tree biscuit before! Will definately make these again.

These weren't my grandmother's buscuits, but I gave it a 5 becuase they were still good.  I can't bake, like at all.  My husband does all the baking. I got brave and tried this one on my own, and they turned out pretty good.

Taste just like my grandmother's biscuits! Gradually add milk or they will be sticking all over the place. Next time I will probably use 1/2 a cup. Still great-- thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe says it may take you several attempts to get it just right - I think that's probably accurate.  Attempt #1 on 10/25/08 - I used butter instead of shortening b/c I love butter.  The dough is really, really sticky so you need a lot of flour to handle/roll it (at least much more than I used b/c the dough stuck all over the place).  I tried to handle the dough as little as possible after reading other's reviews.  These didn't turn out as well as I wanted them to, they were not big and they were dense, but not hard.  They had great flavor.  I definitely have a feeling my results will improve with repeated attempts!

great. use butter and a little less than a cup of milk.  No need to knead, just mix in milk a little at a time with a fork.  Use large scoop and put on greased cookie pan. Very careful to use a pan with sides!! the butter melted and went all over the bottom of the oven, huge mess and smell. Great taste though!

great recipe! I have tried this one twice, and the first time i made the recipe to a tee, the second time i tried half milk and half half and half cream with 1 cup of shredded cheddar, and i didnt knead the dough at all. after cutting into biscuits, i froze them in the freezer and took them out when ready to bake.. very moist and so delicious! also i put the biscuits closer together when baking.

These were so good I had to write a review! I altered it slighty by using butter instead of shortening, and about 3/4c milk.

These do score a 10 for fluffiness, ease, and appearance.  I thought they were a bit bland, so I'll try the buttermilk idea that someone else gave.  Also, I didn't like the tops so dry so I brushed them with some melted butter after they were done.  Yummy!

These came out just okay. They did not rise into the huge biscuits I expected and they were dense instead of fluffy like I'd hoped for. I made them a day ahead of time, only kneaded the dough a couple times and patted into a little round before cutting. **Update: I tried these again and have bumped them from a 2 to 3 star. 15 to 20 times of kneading produces brick biscuits. This time, after incorporating the milk, I picked up a handful of dough (non-kneaded), formed it lightly like a hamburger patty and put it on the pan, letting the biscuit sides touch. This was the least dense biscuit I've made so far. I used half whole wheat flour/half all purpose flour, cold butter instead of shortening, and will use this forming method in the future.

Wow!  I can actually make biscuits!  I used butter instead of shortening and 3/4c 2% milk.  I made 4 large biscuits and they came out fluffy and crispy around the edges.  I bet they would be even better with buttermilk!  I cooked them for 13 minutes and they were superb!  Thanks J.P.!

Delicious biscuits. I followed the recipe and I didn't overwork the dough. They came out great everyone enjoyed them. I made another batch and added a little more milk to make the dough wet and I made drop biscuits one morning. Those were excellent as well.

Spread some honey on 'em or put egg & cheese on 'em for breakfast. MMMMMM!

These biscuits have a great consistency and are HUGE but they seem to lack flavor.  Maybe a little butter flavored Crisco?

I made these biscuits a couple of nights ago and it's true, they are really the best.  Very light and nice texture.  Next time I might cut them into squares and then across, making them into triangles so they look like scones.  Some Devonshire cream and jam would be delicious on them.

Not to different from what I usually make with the exception of the added sugar. Very nice! The sugar just tweaked it enough that this is our new favorite! That is saying quite a lot! I have been using my mother's recipe for 17 yrs. Thanks for sharing.

Add me to the list of 1st time biscuit makers. These are easy and awesome! I always make recipes as they are written and tweak them later. Next time I will add the milk gradually because I did not need the entire cup and maybe use butter instead of shortening.

These are wonderful! So quick to make - easily substitute butter for the shortening...they were great with blackberry jam and I can't wait to use them for biscuits and gravy. I put all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid, mix it, knead it, cut them out, bake...it seems wrong that homemade biscuits are this fast! They are flaky, but moist. Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't have any shortening so I substituted butter, and I made the dough the night before to make my morning easier. I have to say that the refrigerated dough was so much easier to work with, and it took so much hassle out of my day, that I'll never do it the other way again. I loved these biscuits and this will definitely be a breakfast staple for me! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe for the biscuit-challenged like myself!  These came out terrific! Followed recipe exact except used buttermilk.  Made six big, thick biscuits, and had a couple with dinner, and the rest sliced in half and layered with strawberries and whipped cream.  They were best just out of the oven.  Will definitely make these again - I think they would be lovely with some herbs added, or if using as dessert biscuits with a sprinkling of sugar before baking.  Very easy and versatile recipe - Thank you!

Made this recipe as my first attempt at bisciuts.  I didn't knead...just mixed and patted.  I did pat to thin, but now I know for next time.  Will make again.

These were the first biscuits I've  ever made and not only was it a super easy recipe but they turned out wonderfully moist and fluffy. I would definitely recommend this recipe. I made these biscuits with the Super Sausage Gravy by Bob Evans and I've had multiple requests since then, with rave reviews everytime. 

Even my family members who don't like "breakfast" items love it when I make my biscuits and gravy!

YUMMMM!!

I'm a college student living on my own and to be able to make biscuits like my Mom is a true treat!!  Unfortunately, I ran out of salt (yes, I actually had less than a teaspoon!) and I could taste the difference.  Otherwise, they fluffed up very nicely, had a crispy top and bottom, and has a chewy, yummy inside.  Will definitely make again!!

Great buscuit just did not rise as much as the description. I only used 3/4 cup milk per the instructions to eye ball when dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Easy dough to work with . didnt over work it . Good texture , good taste . Just didnt rise to the huge description that the recipe suggested.

My whole family loved these biscuits. There has been a special request to make them for breakfast on Saturday morning.  
They were very easy to make and very delicious.  I was looking for a recipe that was not overly sweet, and this was just that.

Please keep in mind that I have never made biscuits before. 
They were a little lacking in taste. The dough was a little harder to handle than I expected and they did not rise very much. They came out kind of doughy and dense. But I was using them for bisquits and Gravy so it was still good. My kids liked them. I will definatly try this one or two more times. It has potential. Again maybe it was just me.

This is the first time I've made biscuits from scratch and these were definitely good.  They didn't live up to what I hoped for though, and mine definitely didn't look like the ones in the photos - all of that may be my lack of biscuit baking experience though.  I made mine using a food processor, and the dough came together very easily.  I patted the dough out, cut it and wrapped the biscuits in foil.  Then I refrigerated them overnight so we could have fresh baked biscuits for dinner the next night.  I was disappointed that they were pretty flat, not fluffy and tall like I had hoped for.  They were also a little crumbly so I'm thinking I probably either kneaded too much or not enough, though I'm not sure which.  I tried not to handle the dough anymore than I had to, so maybe I didn't knead it enough.  Also, we had leftovers and I thought they were better after they were reheated.

I'll keep trying, and update if I have better luck next time.

I have tried every biscuit recipe that I have ever come across, and this is a great one. The biscuits were very fluffy and light. I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and brush the tops with milk before baking. I will add this to my regulars!

These were very good and easy to make. I do wish they were a bit less dry, but I guess that's what jam is for. :)

These were the biggest biscuits I have ever seen! Very moist and fluffy. The only thing I changed, was I kneaded the dough only about 5 times, per earlier tips to not over handle the dough. My husband (a biscuit and gravy aficionado) loved them. We will definitely keep this recipe in our routine from now on - thank you!!

These turned out excellent!  I also tweaked the recipe by using butter to make them taste a little lighter.  Other than that, yummy and easy biscuits!

Just made these tonight with dinner and they were very tender, and puffed up more than any other homemade biscuit that I have ever made before.  My husband and four children loved these!  I doubled the batch and we have leftovers for breakfast!

This recipe is great. It's perfect for dinner to help soak up the left overs on your plate or for breakfast with some yummy jam or honey. Simple yet perfect for what ever meal you're cooking.

I made these for my English in-laws who were coming over for tea and was told that they were the best "scones" they had ever had, even by grandma! Traditional english scones are closer to biscuits than what Americans consider scones to be.

These were really easy to make.  I used a pastry blender to cut in cubed shortening.  They were pretty good, but a little heavier than what I'm used to.  I think next time I'll use butter instead of shortening; it would lend a better flavor.

Never made biscuits before because I love the frozen ones from the groc store and didn't think it could be easier, I was wrong!!  I used my food processor-quick and a lot cheaper than the frozen ones!  My daughter requested bisq & gravy for her 6 yr b-day dinner (that's my girl!), so I gave these a shot-very impressed!  I rolled thinner to make more biscuits, but next time will follow directions to make 6 large biscuits.  I also used real butter instead of oil.  The leftovers were still delicious this morning-soft and moist!  Thanks!

This recipe turned out well.
For a slightly healthy recipe I used 1 c white flour and 1 cup wheat flour.  I then  used butter and grated it into the dough.
Will make again.

I don't make biscuits well, but this recipe was effortless and they came out suprisingly well.  I brushed butter on them just out of the oven.

This is a great basic biscuit recipe.  I don't hesitate to throw these together for a quick breakfast; just add sausage & some ketchup & my family is very happy!  

They are also great for any meal, with butter, honey or jam & I will make them for company as well.  I have even added some cheddar, made them as drop buscuits & brushed them with butter & garlic powder - like Red Lobsters but BETTER!  
This versatile recipe has replaced my old Betty Crocker one I used forever.  Thank you!

Super easy recipe!!!! Finally, a biscuit recipe that turns out PERFECT!! I didn't change anything......Well, okay, I am not a huge fan of traditional shortening but I found and all vegetable shortening by Spectrum with no hydrogenated oils (only ingredient is Palm oil) and I was quite impressed.  These are so good...but oh so bad for my diet.  I scaled the recipe to make 12 biscuits but it made 20 beautiful ones instead. Very impressed.

These are very good, we just prefer a more buttery flavor so we go with halving the 1/3 c of (butter flavored) shortening, and using butter for the other half. With that minor change these turn out fabulous!

This recipes is awesome.  Great biscuits every single time.  I don't know how to knead very well.  But these still came out good with me folding the dough in half and turning it and folding it again.  Did this about 10 times, like the recipes says.  Yummy and oh so warm and full of layers. I don't need to buy the canned ones, now.

Great biscuits!  Be sparing with the milk, too much and you have very sticky dough.  If this happens, balance out with a little more flour.  Great with butter and jam!

These biscuits are just what I was looking for. Tender, flaky, and delicious. My only problem is that I tend to roll them a little too thin, so they don't get as big as I'd like. I always get about 8-9 instead of the 6. Other than that (which is my mistake every time) they are awesome with anything from strawberry shortcake to sausage gravy and biscuits or just warmed up with a little jam on top.

Easy and quick.  I prefer yeast biscuits for a side for dinner, but would make these for strawberry shortcake, as one user suggested, or when I need to make a quick biscuit.

I never realized that making biscuits could be so easy!  I have made this recipe countless times but I always use margarine instead of shortening. I have also tried substituting the milk for buttermilk and they turned out just as great as with the regular milk.  Awesome recipe!

Pretty good but a bit time consuming.  I usually use the EZ Biscuit recipe from this site but I wanted something a bit more "polished" to impress.  These certainly did.

I had almost given up on making my own biscuits.  I am so glad I found this.

The only thing different I did was put the entire batch of dough into a baking stone.  Then we just scooped it out and put gravy on top.  It had to bake a little longer.

Update:  I've been using this recipe for regular biscuits.  The flavor is much better if you use butter instead of shortening.

This got an unequivocal "best biscuit I've ever eaten" from my family, and we are serious biscuit eaters.  The only change I made was to brush the tops with butter before baking.  Awesome!

The best biscuits ever!  After years of trying to make good homemade biscuits, I have found the key - this recipe!  Fabulous on their own, with jam, with honey, with butter, with sausage gravy............  Yum!

So far this is the best recipe I have found for biscuits.  I didn't get the large high biscuits I had hoped for though.  I think I patted my dough out too thin.  Following the recipe exactly, I only was able to bake I think 7 or 8 biscuits.  The taste was very good.  I will probably try a few more recipes though.

This was my first attempt at home made biscuits.  I thought the flavor was fantastic.  I think I overmixed them because they were sort of chewy.  They also rose funny.  I will try again.  As I have learned, biscuit making is an art.

Being from the South, my Mom makes some great biscuits. This is as close as her recipe. They are really, really good. I always serve them with sausage gravy or honey butter. Thanks so much - these have never failed!

Wonderful! These turned out perfect!  I followed some advice and didn't knead them that much, maybe a minute.  I have been searching for a good biscuit recipe and now I have found it!

Yum!  These were great!  Came out looking like those Grands biscuits, but tasted much better.  Brushed them with melted butter before cooking, but  that's the only change I made.

These turned out really good. I didnt have to use as much milk as the recipe calls for though. I would suggest adding it in slowly to see if you need it all. Other than that they were really easy to make.

Very tasty...but mine fell apart easily...kind of crumbly so we couldn't successfully slice them in half without them falling apart...it was so tasty we ate the crumbs.  
I used whole wheat...and butter...I will have to experiment a little more...

Okay, I had to make these twice.  The first time I made them they were too sticky to contemplate, but after taking the advice of other reviewers the second time and cutting the milk considerably, they came out pretty good.  That and the fact that they didn't produce the promised gargantuan-sized biscuits are the reasons these only get four stars.  Still, I will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks J.P., for the biscuits and the tip about the juice glass--worked great!

these have an excellent taste, but didn't turn out quite as fluffy as i would have liked.  I only mixed the dough until it was 'barely' together, turned out and only kneaded 1 or 2 times then patted out and cut.  wonder if i add a teeny bit more baking powder if that would help.  i'll keep trying on this one.

Yum, Yum, Yum! This was a super easy biscuit to make.  Oh, and did I mention really yummy.  I skipped the kneading and just patted them out and cut.  It was quick. My son said they were better than KFC's. It's a keeper for me!

Nice.

Good, fast, seriously simple biscuits! My spouse and I thank you very much. This was my first successful step in search of perfect "biscuits & gravy." Now I seek gravy.

I give this recipe 5 stars despite my changes to the basic ingredients. I used what I had on hand and they still turned out great. What I changed? 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup bread flour, 1/3 cup unsalted butter, and 1/3 cup buttermilk. Method? Used a fork to cut in butter to course. Required all milk to pull away from bowl. I liberally floured the counter folded over roughly 12 times, then rolled out to about 1/2" (I have a hard time judging). I baked for 15 minutes and they were a nice golden brown. I topped with melted butter. They were light and tender. Most rose nicely despite my overestimate of depth. Reaction? Family and I loved them! I'm keeping this recipe on hand.

I read the other reviews, and was thinking I would only be using about half of the milk called for, but I needed the full cup. I might even try with buttermilk next time. Mine didnt turn out big and fluffy (maybe I mixed the dough too long?) but they werent dense and they were very tasty. I will be making these again soon. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Well, the biscuits are great, but if I'd used a whole cup of milk, I would've had soup. About a half a cup would have been enough. Otherwise, thumbs up.

I have never had good luck with making biscuits until this recipe.  I usually use butter instead of shortening.  I make a double batch, put bacon or sausage patties inside the center, wrap & freeze for breakfast sandwiches.

These are goo-oo-oo-d! And easy. And hard to screw up even if you do have three kids running around your feet. And good. Did I already say that?? Oh well, try them for yourself...

very good!  Going to cut the size down to 1/2 inch tall before baking.  We used butter (5 tablespoons) instead of shortening.  Also going to test with more butter (trying a stick of butter first), as I like them to be buttery before they come out of the oven.

Delicious! I love biscuts and gravy but could never find good recipes for biscuts. So I usually just go down to little resturants around here and order them. I hate biscuts in a can. So we made these tonight and they are wonderful! Thank you so much!

I am giving these 4 stars b/c something about the flavor didn't seem right. Maybe it was b/c there wasn't much flavor. However, these were so easy to throw together. These are perfect for anytime that you are in a bind and need some sort of bread with dinner.

Very nice recipe! Simple and quick. I found you really needed to have a good, sharp cookie/biscuit cutter in order to get the maximum rise out of your biscuits. They were lovely reheated the next day, too, though predictably not as flakey. This recipe is going in the recipe box.

I've never found a biscuit recipe I liked until this one.  I made them exactly as the recipe said and they were very light, soft, and fluffy.  They didn't rise as tall as I expected but that's okay.  I'll definitely make these again!

Love it! Love it! Love it!  These are great biscuits.  The dough was very sticky, but I just added more flour.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great!  Very good, very inexpensive.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is an excellent, simple, fluffy biscuit every time. I use it as the dough for my cinnamon buns and it is amazingly good...butter the bottom of a round cake pan, sprinkle in brown sugar and sliced almonds with a few drops of water. Make and roll out the biscuit dough as usual, then spread mixture of margarine, cinnamon and brown sugar about an inch from one long edge. Roll up jellyroll style, use a piece of thread to slice roll into buns and place into a loose ring around the edge of the buttered pan, last 2 in the middle. The buns will grow together in the oven. I frost them with cream cheese icing and they are always gone before I get a second one... Really yummy at brunch, not overly sweet and this biscuit dough holds the cinnamon butter remarkably well.

These biscuits are very good but not for a breakfast gravy & biscuits meal. I like them by itselfs but for breakfast I like my biscuits more flaky. We will do again for different types of meals. Thanks

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and changed the shortening to butter and decided to just pat/roll out the dough instead of kneading it.  The texture was fluffy and the taste was just what I was looking for.  I loved them!

The biscuits/scones came out perfect!! They were crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I used one full cup of milk, real butter,and added chocolate chips. I don't have a food processor so I used a pastery blender I didn't knead the dough just pat it down and it turned out perfect. Also buttered the tops to give it some extra flavor.

The dough is definitely sticky as noted by other reviewers, but the biscuits come out great.  I added a little flour during the kneading stage, but not much.  Don't be tempted to pat your dough out thinner than 1", your biscuits will not be as fluffy.  Also, another reviewer had a great tip -- don't twist the cutter when you're cutting out the biscuits.  It seals the edges and they don't rise as well.  Kist press it down and lift it back off.  Another reviewer suggested cutting the dough with a sharp knife, which would seem to work well too.

This was my first time making biscuits from scratch and these were wonderful! I took the advice of another reviewer and put everything in my food processor until I hit Step 3. I followed Step 3 as written in the recipe. I used buttermilk instead of milk and butter instead of shortening. I didn't really knead the dough and instead, formed it into a big square and used a knife to cut it into 6 squares. I left it in the oven for about 13 minutes and they fluffed up nicely. The outside is a bit crunchy but the inside is so soft. This reminds me of KFC biscuits. Yum!

I've made this a few times and each time they have turned out perfectly.  I recently used half whole wheat and half white flour and they were even more delish!  I could have just served them for dinner, because that's what everyone wanted seconds of!

Cooked up nicely and quickly, but tasted too much like baking powder. I did have to use skim milk, though, so that might have been the problem.

A really great recipe! I didn't knead them, with the whole cup of milk they were very sticky. Fortunately I didn't add any more flour, just a bit to place them nicely on the oven sheet without having a lot left on my fingers.
They didn't raise very much, I served them hot, with ham and goat cheese: my kids were clamouring for more. My son wanted me to admit there was cheese in the batter, too: he said he could taste it. I bet they are wonderful used like a sweet too. Thanks so much!

The flavor on these were great. Mine didn't get as fluffy as I would have liked, but I am sure with practice it will get better. I think I twisted the glass when I cut the biscuits instead of just pushing down. Some of the biscuits didn't rise a lot while others rose a little lopsided. I used butter instead of shortening and I took another reviews advice and only used 3/4 cup of milk. I will keep trying new cutting methods until I get them to rise right.

These were the best biscuits I've ever made! They were so flaky, warm, and moist. Mine weren't quite as risen as in the picture, but I think after a couple attempts, I will be able to get that down too. Honestly, the best side dish you could even imagine.

YUMMY! I didn't even add all the milk and the dough was very sticky -- quickly absorbed all the floury on my floury surface when kneading, and then was difficult to cleanly cut into circles so I ended up with drop biscuits. That was the only problem I had though. Except for the problem of not being able to stop eating them.

These are now the only biscuits we make. The biggest secret to them is to make ahead of time and let rest in fridge. They get really big and tender.

I'd never tried biscuits before, but these looked too good to miss. However, I found them rather bland, and a bit doughy tasting. Also, I had to add quite a bit of flour because the dough was too liquidy. However, two of my kids loved the biscuits, and when I served them with unflavored yogurt my husband and I managed a few each, so I can't complain.

O Wow.  I made Bill's sausage gravy and these for dinner tonight.  (ya i know, heart attack dinner!) i could barely finish my dinner because I couldn't stop thinking about having one of these biscuits plain.  So I did.  And now I want another one--  fluffy inside with a nice crisp outside, just the right amount of sweet- I will NEVER make bisquick again.  These were sooo easy and turned out great!  Who's my daddy? J.P.! Thank U!

These turned out great. I'm a first time biscuit maker. Be sure when you spread out the dough that it really is an inch thick. I only had half an inch and  so stacked my half inch circles on top of eachother to get the height you need for a biscuit. Served with Super Sausage Gravy from this site.

I tried making biscuits once before and they were hard rocks, I thought it was me but after my 3 year old begged me to make biscuits with him I decided to try once more and with this recipe. Fantastic! I used butter instead of shortening and buttered the tops after they came out of the oven. They are moist on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. I love the taste and they just flake apart when opened! What a wonderful recipe!

I got "these are as good as my grandmother's biscuits" from my husband, so THANK YOU! I used buttermilk per my husband's request and we brushed the tops with butter. I didn't knead these much (mostly because I forgot!) but they were fantastic.

This was my first time making biscuits and they were wonderful.. my kids asked for more and more...Delicious! 
The first time I made them I used 1/2 cup milk and they did not rise much if at all. The next time I used more milk and they rose beautifully! 
I used rapadura sugar instead of white sugar and coconut oil instead of shortening.. still great!

These are absolutely the best biscuits.  We like them even better than Cracker Barrel.  Great with gravy, or homemade apple butter..YUM!  One tip, if your shortening is room temperature the biscuits seem to turn out fluffier. I double the recipe and get about 13 large biscuits.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

These were so awesome!  Just made them exactly according to recipe and they turned out great.  They rose and were flaky.  I just used a regular glass to cut them out and got 12 biscuits.

These are so good and easy.  I used stick "butter" flavor shortening that i had frozen.  Works so much better that way.  Cut it into the flour with a pastry cutter.  Make sure you dont roll them out too thin.  They dont puff much at all.  Brush with soft butter when right outta the oven.  So good with fresh strawberry jam or all natural grape jelly.  Heck good with anything slathered on it.  Great plain too.  Hubby "tested" like 3 right outta the oven.

Used butter instead of shortening but still came out huge, soft and delicious. I'll try it next time with shortening, I'm sure it'll taste even better.

This is THE best biscuit recipe that I've found! SOOOO quick and easy....we loved these!  I used whole wheat flour and doubled the recipe.  It made 15 HUGE, tender, flaky biscuits.  13 minutes was perfect in my oven....they just started to brown and were not dry at all. Will try butter flavored Crisco next time, but these are PERFECT as is :)  Thank you  John!

These are delish! I have tried several biscut recipes in the past, with lackluster results. These were super easy and SO good. One note - probably obvious, but I forgot so... - if you sub regular salted butter for the shortening, make sure you cut back on the salt, or your biscut will be salty. They'll still get gobbled up, but would be better with less salt. These will be featured at my house on a regular, I can guarentee that!

The best I have ever had!! I have been searching for a recipe, this beats any store brand. I had tried others including the new Betty Crocker recipe which I had made and 'tweaked' over a dozen times with no good results.  I made this tonight for the first time, it was awesome!! I have found the ultimate biscuits... thank you John Pickett!! :) My husband was thrilled with these!

it's soft and fluffy and hmmm I like this although my other biscuit recipe still tops it all. That one though, used all purpose and cake flour, also buttermilk which I don't have right now. Afterall, for being quick and easy, this biscuit recipe is really good. ThankS!

My roomates LOVED these biscuits and elected them absolutely amazing, but these are the first 'from scratch' biscuits they've ever had before. I thought they were just ok. A little bland, but flakey and tender nonetheless. I didn't bother kneading them at all, just scooped them from the bowl and made them into 12 drop biscuits.

Delish! Wonderful tasting and super easy to make! I just love the amount of dough this yeilds...so easy to work with. Tonight I even just halved it as we didn't need that many biscuits. I've also added buttermilk instead of regular milk and it was excellent, too! Thanks so much for the keeper! We didn't eat biscuits much because I hate all the horrible ingredients in the one's prepackaged.... so THANK YOU!!!! These are awesome!!!

This recipe was easy to make even with my 4 year old helping.  We made a mess trying to knead the dough. Next time we will just spoon the dough directly onto the cookie sheet after mixing in the milk.  After baking, I brushed the biscuits with melted butter mixed with honey.  Each of my 2 boys ( ages 4 and 7) and my husband ate 3 biscuits with the youngest asking could we bake more in the morning.

Way better than bisquick or pillsbury!
I skipped the kneading step as others suggested, and I used margarine instead of shortening. They came out just right!
I'm not sure if this would make 6 huge ones. I made mine smaller and thinner and got 10. This is definitely my new biscuit recipe!

We really enjoy these. I find 1 cup of milk to be too much - start with 3/4 cup and add more as needed. I get 4 - 6 biscuits out of this recipe.

Will definitely make again and again. So much better than store bought biscuits. After mixing up the batch and putting them out on the pan, I let them sit for about 10 minutes. They were great.

I've made these a few times now, and I've found the recipe calls for too much milk. However, I live in Japan and it's rainy season here now so the humidity may be having some affect on the batter. The last time I actually used just a bit more than 1/2 a cup of milk. Regardless, they rise wonderfully, look great and taste pretty good. They go well with jam or gravy, and don't last too long in our house!

These biscuits were good, but a little dense and sort of bland.

the biscuits were pretty good. they weren't as fluffy and or had the right texture i was looking for, but i'll try again to see if i get desired results. i think refrigerating the biscuits before baking made them taste better though.

These were similar, but better than the Bisquick biscuits I am used to making. I made them a little smaller than HUGE because one of my pet peeves is burned outside and gooey inside. But, I will be making again!

YES!!!!  For the first time in my life I made edible biscuits.  They  weren't as big as the picture but the did rise some.  I made the dough the night before and then semi-rolled and patted them out this morning.  I did brush the tops with butter but even then they barely got brown.  The bottoms were perfectly golden brown.  I will diffently being making these a lot more often and no more store bought bisciuts again.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  My husband even said it was a keeper.

These were good but not as big and fluffy as the recipe states.  In fact I found them to be rather heavy and dense.  I didn't make a single change to the recipe, didn't over handle the dough, and used fresh flour and baking powder.  But they turned out pretty heavy.  They were good but just not super.

Easy recipe.  I used self-rising flour, and they rose up really high.  I used a food processor, which made it so easy to mix.  I needed less than 1 c. of milk, and I had to add about 1/4 cup extra flour b/c the batter was too sticky.  I used big heart shaped cookie cutters and they turned out really cute!

these are wonderful and almost fool proof-the dough was a little too sticky to roll out and knead, so I took chunks of it and kneaded it with my floured hands. Somehow, I burnt the bottom to this...it happens to all my biscuits and I can't figure out why.

I made this recipe some time ago.  They were the fluffiest biscuits I have ever made.  My search for the perfect biscuit recipe ended with this one.  A keeper for my recipe book for sure!  Perfect for biscuits and gravy.

The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because, to me, nothing does it quite like the biscuits I had growing up. Aside from that, this recipe is certainly a keeper.

These biscuits are absolutely fantastic.  They're a real treat for our family on Sunday mornings.  It does take a bit of trial and error to get them to be the right size, but so worth the effort.

I have made and loved the biscuits following the recipe exactly as written, and I have made the recipe substituting shortening with butter, and using buttermilk instead of sweet milk.  Our family has loved the recipe both ways.  (Though I myself tend to like the variation best.)

I've been searching for a biscuit recipe that is consistently good, not dry, and very fluffy.  This on tastes like my Great Grandmother used to make -- we all loved it!

These always turn out excellent.  The only time they didn't was when I added extra flour to get the dough less gooey.  I think it was just extra humid and they ended up tasting like pure flour.  I have learned to use the recipe exactly as stated.  If the dough is sticky I just drop them onto the cookie sheet instead of rolling.  Other than that these make restaurant quality biscuits that are perfect for jellies or sausage gravy.  Thanks J.P.!  This is a staple recipe in our house!

Mine turned out tender, flakey and wonderful.  I cut the recipe in half, added 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 cup of cheddar, and used less milk than stated (somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 cup for my scaled down recipe).  I kept the handling to a minimum and skipped the kneading.  I cut my dough with a knife into 4 wedges and baked on a pizza stone for maybe 20 minutes until I got the crispy golden crust that I like.

Very good. I used butter instead of shortening like others suggested. I think that next time i will do 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.

These were really good. I used butter instead of shortening, Made sure the TBS of baking powder was very full & used a touch less of the sugar & salt. They were not huge, but light, fluffy & crunchy on the outside. I would definately make these again ;-)

I'm giving this 3 stars because I had to change the recipe quite a bit to get what I wanted. The original recipe didn't rise enough for me and tasted alot like shortening even though i used the butter flavored kind. The second time I made it I used 4 tsp of baking powder for a little more lift, 1 stick of butter, & somewhere between 1/4 c and 1/2 c of milk. They came out great.

These were simple to make.I followed recipe exactly but didn't get huge biscuits.  They tasted good though.  However, next time I will let the dough refrigerate to see if I can get them to rise bigger.

With all the great reviews and such a fun name, I couldn't resist making these biscuits.  I served them with a creamed chicken recipe and the results were superb.  Thanks for a great recipe.  My kids are already asking about when I'm going to make those "big daddy" biscuits again...

really great and super easy.  i used butter instead of shortening to omit the hydrogenation and they turned out sooo good.  i actually used them as pizza crust so i could make my son some lunch.  it turned out deeee-lectable.  much better than the store bought variety that have so much junk in them.  i was at a hotel last week that had awesome biscuits on their continental breakfast buffet and these have got to be the same recipe!  i did follow the suggestions from others and tried not to over handle them.  also, i feel like i had to add a little extra flour.

I'm a novice baker.  These biscuits turned out great.  I liked them alot, and I'm a yeast bread fan.  I don't bake much and a bag of flour last me forever.  I keep my flour in the freezer to avoid weevils, so all my ingredients were cold.  I made my biscuits really big.  The recipe for 6 servings only made 4 biscuits for me.  They are delicious, big and beautiful.

I first found this recipe about 5 or 6 years ago, and I have never used another biscuit recipe.  Everyone loves them, so I try to make them at least once a week, for Sunday dinner. I usually make a double batch, and the kids wake up to them cooking in the morning. They are easy, and fast, but it looks like they took you all day to make.  They are a part of our traditions.  Thank you.

Made these today, while they were ok, they didn't have the WOW factor I was hoping for, they were too dense and didn't have that light and fluffy texture I thought they would, They were rather large (due to the thickness you cut them) but very heavy, the taste was kinda bland, actually they tasted alot like the biscuit mix you can buy in the package for .79 cents at the grocery store, not awful...just dull. They tasted ok with strawberry jam and butter but I was wanting the ones like KFC,big fluffy light they are just good all by themselves, I'll keep looking.

The only thing I changed was using buttermilk for milk.  I mixed it just until blended.  The biscuits didn't rise much at all and when I went to split them, they crumbled apart.  Will keep trying other biscuit recipes.  Thanks anyways, John, but it didn't work well for me.

Tried my very first batch of biscuits this morning.  They were great!  Didn't rise up as high as J.P.'s (even using new baking powder), but then again, looks aren't everything.
Wonderful.

They tasted very good. I did not roll and cut the biscuits. Instead I simply dropped them onto the cookie sheet. I did find that they did not rise to the point I expected. I would probably double the recipe next time to be sure there is enough and the size is better. All in all I still think the recipe is awesome for the taste and ease.

These are excellent to have on hand with any meal.  I cut out the shortning (personal preference) and used butter instead. I usually add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and it makes the biscuits very tasty. Thanks JP for a great roll!

I didn't have any shortening and so I used butter instead.  Big mistake.  Biscuits turned out very hard with a very bland flavor.  Thanks, guess I will try with shortening next time.

Easy and good.  Makes 6-7 large biscuits.  I did replace the shortnening with butter and took a previous reviewer's advice and mixed as little as necessary and then kneaded as little as necessary.  The biscuits were fluffy and we ate some with sausage gravy and some strawberries and cream.

I have been trying to make good biscuits for my southern husband for years, but mine are always heavy and taste like paste.  I just made this recipe, and my children and I ate them all!  Will make another batch tonight for dinner.  These biscuits are INCREDIBLE!!!  J.P. is the biscuit master!

I'd never made biscuits before but my hubby has a fixation on biscuits and gravy so I figured it was worth a shot. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out fantastic-hubby wanted to know if I could double it next time so he could snack on the leftovers.

My family loved these biscuits.  I have tried several recipes in the past, but I have never had such a great reaction from my 5 kids and my husband.  I tripled the recipe due to our large family size.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe.

Very good. Used buttermilk instead of milk and margarine not shortening. There was just a touch of a strange flavor....maybe from the baking powder or the buttermilk?  Next time I'll try just milk and see what happens.   I let them sit once I cut them and still did not end up with HUGE biscuits, but they were still quite good, and I will make them again!

These were easy to make and rose to a nice size.  But, we didn't really enjoy the overall flavor.  I'll try it again with the buttermilk and butter substitutions other reviewers recommended.

I was looking for a really good biscuit and figured I couldn't go wrong with this rating but after following the recipe faithfully they came out flat and dense. They tasted really good but weren't big and fluffy as promised.

First I thought these had a wonderful buttery taste! I made 2 batches of this recipe. Both I used buttered flavored crisco. Like alot of people I  was nervous about the sugar, but I cant taste it and it didnt taste bitter. Pretty sure the sugar helps omit the bitternes from the baking powder. But both batches turned out kinda flat. They didnt rise very well. The first batch I used all 1cp of milk and it was way too much! The second I used 3/4 cp much better but again they didnt rise. Im sure Im doing something wrong just dont know what?

These were the best biscuits I've ever made! I sifted the dry ingredients and kneaded as little as possible. You want the dough to be a little sticky so that when you knead it on a floured surface, it turns out perfect. My family ate them so quickly that I had to make another batch so I could try one! I'm making some right now with cheddar cheese and garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

Well they were definitely BIG, but that was it. Completely lacking in any flavor. I am looking for a nice buttery yummy biscuit. This was big but completly tasteless. Bisquick would have been better.

I really loved the light flaky texture, but it was lacking in taste. I think next time I will try half butter and half shortening, or butter flavor crisco.

Very delicious, but I'm wondering if this recipe is using a dry measuring cup or a liquid cup for the milk. It seemed to be too much milk with a liquid measuring cup. But I just added more flour on the kneading surface and they turned out great!

Outstanding, we have made these several times and they are without a doubt the best biscuits. It does take some practice to get the right consistency but when you do look out. Great with gravy or warm with butter and jelly.

Great recipe! Easy, quick, with uncomplicated ingredients. The biscuits turned out perfect. 
Remember- the less you handle the dough, the more tender and fluffy they are!

Really tasty!  Mine didn't rise very well (of course I've never been any good at making biscuits that don't come out of a can).

I've always been disappointed with biscuit recipes in the past, and thought the only way to get a good biscuit was to buy them at the store. This recipe is better then anything at a store or reestraunt, it's the best  biscuit ever.

I am only giving this a 4 star rating because I had to do some tweaking to it.  I don't like sugar in my biscuit dough.  I also used self-rising flour and ommitted the baking powder and salt.  I also used butter and low-fat buttermilk.  My husband thought that I had made them out of a can but I told him that they were home-made.  I took this as a compliment.  Thanks for the idea though.  You helped me get a 5 star rating for mine from my husband.

I just LOVE these biscuits.  I add extra butter and garlic and serve them with hearty soups.  They are so basic, though, that you can add so many different things to them, or just leave them as they are for GREAT biscuits and gravy. :)

Pretty good! Easy to make, although dough is extremely sticky. Because of this, I didn't even try to roll these out, I just sort of spread it out with my hands, cut and then plopped the dough onto the pan. Biscuits were tasty and tender, but did not get as huge as those pictured, nor were they very round - kinda messy looking. I may try again, but will also keep trying other recipes as well.

I kneaded mine 10 times and decided to pat the dough. It made 8 biscuits.They rise very nice and tasted great with stew. I was very pleased and I will use this recipe again.

I used sucanat, butter, and 50/50 whole wheat and white flour. They aren't as light and fluffy as the original, of course, but still a great recipe. Thanks JP!

Great easy recipe!  I couldn't bring myself to buy shortening, so I substituted butter.  It tasted fine.  I also just dropped them onto a baking sheet without bothering to roll them out.  These are great with sausage gravy.

I made these rolls for Christmas dinner and they didnt turn out very well.  They tasted like they had to much flour in them.  My family said they were OK though, but I just wasnt that fond of them.  I probably wont make these rolls again.. Sorry!

These biscuits taste WONDERFUL and I am a Beginner baker.  I think I made a mistake by making like 12 of them instead of the recommended 6. Some of them turned out like hard toast.  I think I know where my mistake lies.   This is a VERY fast and quick recipe and I will make these again.  My son and his cousins loved them (5 yr olds) They even asked for seconds!!

I made these last night and they turned out wonderful!  Simply the best homemade biscuits I ever tasted.  I altered the recipie slightly by adding 1 tbl spoon of sugar and using butter-flavored shortening.  To handle the slightly gooey dough, simply dust your hands with flour before kneading or patting.

I did not like this recipe in the least bit.  Biscuits were chalky & had a bitter taste to them.   I substituted butter for shortening, as many posters suggested, but they still turned out terrible.  Still searching for a great biscuit recipe - sorry Joe!

I am a self-taught cook, so I have very few family recipes and have to search for the "perfect" recipe for all of the basics.  This is the closest to "perfect" biscuits that I've found!  They are super-easy to make, and taste great.  My only complaint was that I did notice the slight bitter aftertaste, but the taste of the biscuits themselves more than make up for it....the biscuits aren't bitter at all.  I did substitute unsalted butter for the shortening, since I like a buttery flavor to my biscuits.  I also noticed that a few people said they used baking soda instead of baking powder...I wonder if this makes a big difference in the finished product???  I highly recommend this recipe.  Yum!

The first biscuits I made that did not turn out like hockey pucks! I followed other reviewers suggestions on biscuit making and patted the dough out instead of rolling it out. Used whole wheat pastry flour, unsalted butter, 1/2 tsp of salt and about 1/2 cup of soymilk.

Totally Awesome!!  The texture was so perfect.  Even after sitting around for 2 days, they were still nice and tender.  Amazing.  Super easy and not at all time consuming.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they didn't quite have the "biscuit" taste I was going for, but I will definately make them again.

My first attempt at homemade biscuits and I have to say they turned out pretty good.  I think I may have patted the dough out too thin on some of them, and they didn't rise quite as much as I thought they would.  But they weren't hockey pucks :-)  Will definitely be using this one again.

Perfect biscuits.  Easy and came out just as I'd hoped.  Served with fried chicken and gravy and then with butter and strawberry jam.  Next time will try the honey as suggested.  Thanks!

These were very good.  I used margarine & non fat milk, cut the recipe in half and baked them in my cheapie toaster oven.  I was careful about the amount of milk I used as suggested by other reviewers, but I could have used less I think because the biscuits were pretty heavy.  They raised wonderfully in the oven, but "deflated" a little when taken out.  But all in all very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Felt like a horrible mom this morning. I desperately need to go grocery shopping!!! I didn't even have milk, but substituted water. Whipped up some eggs and had a WONDERFUL breakfast!! A+ recipe. Just a tad salty for my taste, but wonderful and fluffy. The kids loved them!!!

Oh my!!  This was the first time I've ever made cut out buscuits and was I ever impressed.  They are tall, huge and yummy!  The dough was a bit sticky, but maybe this is the way it's suppose to be.  I used lots of flour to keep it from sticking to the table and the glass that I cut out the dough with.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's one of my favorites!!

Thanks Big Daddy! Those were mighty tasty and no kidding, they are fluffy and light. I didn't have time to let the dough sit but I didn't think it mattered. They were delish! like someone said-brush the tops with butter and they are every bit as good as KFC! Can't wait to try them with cheese and garlic butter!

OH MY GOSH......These biscuits are quite honestly the BEST I have ever tasted!!! My little trick was to 'sift' all the ingredients and it made them really fluffy and light.(I used the Canadian Flour and I know that it is very different in texture from the American Flour)  There are so many variations you can do to enhance this YUMMY recipe!! (Cheese, Herbs, Olives, Pesto, Sundried Tomatoes, Peanut Butter/Jelly, etc.) Way to go "BIG DADDY".....These are a BIG hit in our household!!

I have made these 5 times already and never had a leftover!!  The dough comes together quickly and have never turned out tough.  Be careful not to over bake them!!  I just made a batch and added chopped green chilies from a can that I drained..they are to die for!!

This was the first time I had ever made biscuits, and they were so good that I ended up making 3 batches.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe though.  I just mixed the dough and dropped them by tablespoons (makes 6 biscuits).  Took me less than 5 minutes to prepare.  Also, I made them vegan so I used soymilk and vegan margarine instead.  Still they were excellent and so easy to make!

This is a hard recipe to put together for first timers like me. I gave it four stars because if it were done by someone else that knew what they were doing it probably would turn out better. I ended up with a bland tasting pan full of rocks.

This is the most awesome biscuit recipe I have ever come across.  Quick and easy and wonderful.  This was my first try and they rose like nothing I have ever seen.  Would be great for biscuits and gravy.  I'm thinking about adding a bit more sugar and using these for a strawberry or other fresh fruit shortcake.  Even my picky eaters loved these!

These are by far the best biscuits I have ever made.  My husband and boys LOVED them and asked for more right away.  They're so fast and easy to make that I made more and served them with strawberry shortcake topping.  Delicious!!

First try was tasty, but lacked "something". The second time, I didn't have enough milk. I used half cup evaporated milk and half cup whole milk. To get a better rise, I heated milk in microwave and dissolved one teaspoon of yeast. Do use a buttery shortening mixture.
*** Doing this, made the best biscuits ever !***

these biscuits were very good, they are best when you use buttermilk and also be sure to cut them thick enough, if you cut them out too thin they will not turn out right

This is a good basic biscuit recipe. When I got this recipe there were a few negative reviews so my take is this, use good ingredients, not all milk, shortening and flour are created equal! My family gobbled them up!

These biscuits were delicious and easy to prepare.  They tasted like my grandmother's.  We added a little cheese for fun and they turned out beautifully.  Thanks for the great recipe! (and for not using baking mix! :) )

These biscuits were okay - but didn't rise like I thought they would - they were kind of dense and not fluffy enough.  I followed the recipe and may try again, but bisquick biscuits are better than mine turned out.

These are the best biscuits I have ever made. I love how simple they are. And I always double the batch so my wonderful husband can have biscuits and sausage gravy the next morning and he always needs extra to share with the "guys at work".

I had some trouble with this recipe as the batter was very milky and I had to add some more flour to get it to a consistency which I could knead.  Next time I will add milk only until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl - which is actually what the recipe states.  The biscuits turned out all right in spite of this.  If I had reviewed them right away I would have given them four stars, but they were so good the next day that I decided to give them five instead.

I didn't like these at all.  They raised some, but not to the extent that I was lead to believe they would.  I thought they had a bitter aftertaste, most likely due to the baking soda.  My boyfriend said that they tasted like every other biscuit he's had, so maybe I was just expecting something different, but there was definitely an unpleasant bitter taste.

I have tried to make all kinds of biscuits and these by far are the BESTEST!!!  I have trouble kneeding dough..and this dough was sooo easy to work with!  The biscuits were LARGE..light..fluffy!  I was told on my last batch of biscuits, if I threw one out my window i could knock a squirrel unconscious! NOT ANYMORE!..Big Daddy's are the biscuits I'm sticking with!  Thank you for the recipe.

Not sure if this will sound like a compliment or not.  But these reminded me of the biscuits that you get at KFC (which I love).  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing was that the dough was very sticky when it came time to knead it.  I ended up adding a good amount of flour during the kneading process.  They did turn out huge, next time I might try making 10 or 12 instead of six biscuits that are the size of my head.  Very tasty though, a good recipe (especially if you're low on ingredients like I was).

These were wonderful!  I have been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and last night made them to use with strawberry shortcake.  Yummy!!  I used crisco butter flavored shortening, which just added to their yummy flavor.  I barely got 6 biscuits from the dough (just right with the recipe) ~ the only thing that didn't quite match up is in the recipe it says to roll or pat dough to 1 inch thickness, which I think is wrong, I had my dough at 1/2 inch thickness and that made 6 biscuits perfectly.  Unless you use a smaller than normal biscuit cutter you will not be able to get 6 biscuits out of 1 inch thick dough.  Everyone loved these and I will most definetly make them again, thanks for the best biscuit recipe ever!!! :)

I am not sure what happened, but I have made these twice now. I have followed the recipe, and they barely rose at all. They still tasted good, I just would like them to be fluffier. Any suggestions?

In a word YUM. So fast and simple it is amazing. You should have seen my boyfriends eyes light up. His first question was "Can you make these again?"

I do have one warning for fellow newbies out there. Don't keep them in the oven to keep them warm. It works for a bit but drys them out fast.

These are great.  I add some dried herbs (basil,parsley,oregano..or whatever compliments your meal), and a little chedder cheese and they become WOW. I love these with soups and stews.  I have 4 kids and not one complains when I serve this...most unusual.  Thanks for posting.

Great tasting recipe and easy too! I reduced the baking powder to 2 teaspoons and increased the sugar to 3 1/2 teaspoons. My wife loved them the original recipe, but they had too much of that "biscuit" taste for me. After the alteration, they had a milder taste, and she still loves them.

Not that this recipe needs another rating, but I just have to share. My husband is from the South I am from CA. He LOVES homemade biscuits. Until today I couldn't come close. He was so surprised when I served them for breakfast this morning! I finally made perfect biscuits.  Thank you.

These were awesome!!  Husband LOVED them!  I need to double the recipe next time!!!  The key is to cut them very thick.  I used whole milk.  Butter-flavored shortening or even lard works great.  You can also spray the tops with butter-flavored cooking spray before baking - gives 'em a little extra butter flavor.

These biscuits were excellent!!!  My boyfriend could not get enough of them.  I made 12 medium sized biscuits.  It definitely calls for more milk than needed and I had to add some flour to counteract it, but they still turned out fabulous!  Thanks!

Easy, basic and satisfying biscuit recipe.  This time around, I used whole wheat flour for half the flour portion and half unsalted butter for the shortening portion.  Turned out great!  For an interresting variation, I cut the biscuits using heart shaped cookie cutters.

Very easy and quick to make. Flavor is good too. But mine didn't come out tall and flaky. They looked like big flat rolls - edges "stuck together, center rose a little.

Easy as Bisquick, with 10 times the taste - I've bought my last can of biscuits!  I threw these together in about 15 minutes, substituted butter for the shortening, and made drop buscuits.  They were so delicious, we ate them plain!  I'd read quite a few reviews that stated they were bland, but my family would disagree.  I found they had a sweet buttery taste (maybe due to the substitution?) - truly addictive!  Thanks J.P.!

These were so good and so easy. I mixed up the dough in the morning and put it in the fridge to sit until supper time. I got 6 huge rolls, they could have been a meal in themselves.

I really like these biscuits! My Mom doesn't like shortning, so I used butter instead and they turned out really good! Maybe next time I'll use a little more salt--they still deserve five stars though!

This recipe is so simple and easy, my 7 year old granddaughter (who is a very new baker!) made these for breakfast and they turned out wonderful.  I had her add an additional tsp. of sugar and they came out perfect. She wanted to give this recipe 10 stars!

Quick and easy!  I made them for dinner, but found out that they would make much better biscuts for breakfast.  Leftovers made wonderful sausage & egg biscuts.  Not bursting with flavor, but overall good flavor and texture.  These will be making it back on our breakfast plates for some delicous biscuts and gravy or sandwhiches!

I made these for supper tonight as we were having Chili. I changed the sugar for 1 tbsp cornmeal.
I asked my husband how he liked them,and asked if he had to rate them from one to five stars what would he give them?  He said a 6, with his mouth full. This is deffinately going into my favourites.

These were just OK.  They WERE easy to whip together but there was nothing extraordinary about them.  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of plain shortening.  I will probably keep this in my recipe file.

Was very disappointed. I made the dough the night before and refrigerated, and they just didn't taste that good. Had a chewy, rubbery taste. Will try again, and try to perfect it!!

These were the first homemade biscuits I had ever made and they were delicious!  Make sure, though, that you don't roll or press the dough out too thin, because you'll have thinner biscuits.  Still yummy, though!

For years I have been trying to make a good buscuit and never could, until I made these. They came out great. Infact, my husband said they taste just like what his mother use to make. LOL, for once I can cook something as good as his mother.

I didn't want to have the mess from rolling and cutting out the biscuits so I used this recipe as drop biscuits.  These were very yummy, but they did not rise very much, I would suggest letting the dough sit for 10 mins before putting on the pan.  Thanks J.P.!!!

I thought these were just ok, but my husband really enjoyed them.  I used butter flavored shortening per other reviewers.  I really tasted the baking soda, next time I'll reduce it a bit.  I'll have to try it with strawberries & cream, that sounds very yummy!  Thanks John!

I love these biscuits! They're soft and yummy. Taste great with sausage gravy first thing in the morning. I think I only ended up having to use a half cup of milk or so. The recipe did call for too much.

This made big fluffy biscuits.  They were a little crumbly, but had a fine texture and a good taste.  Will make again.

This is a really great basic recipe for biscuits. I found that adding warm water instead of milk and not use a full cup works well when I don't have milk. I also add the juice from my minced garlic. Gives it a nice flavor and smooth texture. I have made many biscuits before and I think the trick to cooking them is to make sure you take them out early or else you will ruin them. You can always put undercooked ones back in :) Thumbs up J.P. Great recipe!

These were good, but not the best ever, and I'm from Washington, and would call this a breakfast food, not a dinner one.  At breakfast with some honey, they'd probably be fabulous though!

I don't know what went wrong with these, but they were hard.  The flavor of the biscuits were good, but they could have been used as hockey pucks!  People still ate them (of course, most of my friends would eat just about anything), and I enjoyed them.  Overall, a descent recipe.

I am not a rolling pin type of person but this recipe inspired me to try it. I will have to practice more on my techniques but regardless of the shape my biscuits came out, these were so delicious. The flavor is very light and it was great for our Thanksgiving meal. The shortening made the biggest difference and it really was quick to throw together. Thanx.

These make a very good baking powder biscuit, just like my own recipe.  Thanks for sharing they were best when jam, honey or something was added, otherwise quite plain.

This recipe was not only delicious, but healthy. I could eat it without guilt. :) If you use half whole wheat and half white flour, it's even healthier and it still tastes wonderful.

Very good and large.  We also used them for breakfast biscuits the next day.  Be sure not to mix them too much, however.  I did and they were a touch chewy.  Great recipe, though!

This is the best biscuit I have ever made. I like the fact they stay soft after cooling down. My husband is not a biscuit person but ask for these about once or twice a week.

These were really good, tasty and a lot lighter than all the recipes I had used before this. Recipe only made 6 and they were not THAT huge either, maybe I need more practice. But these were definitely the best biscuits I´ve ever made or tasted. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I was expecting some phenomenal biscuits after reading the reviews.  These were pretty good, not a big deal.  I even wrapped the dough and let it rise a while, it did not rise any higher than any other biscuits.  Maybe I goofed somewhere.

I don't know what I did wrong, but my biscuits didn't rise up.  I just opened a new can of baking powder so I don't think that was it.  I'll definitely try this again, though, because it was very easy!

From someone who makes alot of biscuits, these were wonderful!  Much lighter and fluffier than any homemade biscuit I've ever made!

These were pretty good, but if your like me, you might want to cut out the sugar.  Too sweet, but otherwise a good, fluffy biscuit.

The recipe was okay.  Maybe that I did something wrong. I thought the biscuits were a little bland.

I have loved this recipe and I've been able to get better results each time I've used it.  I used to rely on refigerated biscuits but since I've found this recipe I've used it instead. I've made mini pizzas with this dough.  My children thought it was FANTASTIC!!  They are always asking me to make them now.  I'm so glad to find a GREAT biscuit recipe.  Thanks.

My husband has me to make home made biscuits every weekend for breakfast. Each time I would find a better recipe for biscuits, we would make that our recipe. When I found this recipe, we decided this is the biscuits for us. Now my husband has taken over the kitchen and he is the biscuit maker on the weekends. He claims, these are "HIS" biscuits.
