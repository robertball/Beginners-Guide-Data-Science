There are absolutely no fishes, salads, etc. that this doesn't enhance.

This is a good, easy recipe.  I used low-fat mayo, non-fat yogurt, and added dill.  I didn't have tarragon, so I substituted 3/4 t. thyme and 1/4 t. fennel.  I would make this again.

This was awesome! The only thing I changed was to sub 1T fat free sour cream for the mayo.

This sauce is so super yummy!  I think it would be great as a spread for a chicken breast sandwich too.  The only tweeking I did was substituted dried tarrogon leaves for fresh, as my grocery store was out, and added about a tablespoon of dried dill.  We didn't cook the salmon with the sauce on it.  (My husband isn't crazy about cooking salmon in any type of sauce as he prefers his salmon with just a bit of lemon juice and salt and pepper.)  We squeezed a bit of lime juice on the salmon and salted and peppered a bit.  Then we grilled the salmon and served with the sauce on the side.  My hubby loved it and actually spread it on his salmon too!  The kids wouldn't go near it (as there was Tabasco sauce in it) but that just meant more for us!  Will most definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks Joyce T!

This recipe is great!  The second time I substituted reduced fat sour cream for yogurt and add a little dill, it turned out even better.

I cooked the salmon in the oven and added a bit of dill to the sauce. Really good!

If I could give this higher than 5-stars, I would give this 20! YUMMMMM! Tarragon is an acquired taste, but I think if you are past the age of 14, then you should be in the clear. This was unbearably delicious and Joyce Turley, you have officially changed my Salmon lovin life!

This sauce is amazing! We used it with grilled trout. Made recipe as written, then added a bit of dry dill... such a great flavour. This would also be good as a salad dressing or a veggie dip. Will make again (and again and again!).
