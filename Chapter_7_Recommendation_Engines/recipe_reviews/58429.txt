In my search to use up the leftovers in my refrigerator i came across this recipe. I was only making for two people so I scaled this down to suit two servings. I mixed 2 eggs, added to a flat skillet and heated up until it set, flipped it over, then set aside to cool. Once cooled I rolled up the egg omelet into a a burrito like shape and thinly sliced it, set aside for later as a garnish. I had about 1 cup of leftover white rice, chilled in the refrigerator, and some leftover rotisserie chicken that I chopped up, in place of ground chicken. I used 3 links of lup cheong chinese sausages, sliced.  I omitted the shiitake mushrooms. In a pot I used a teeny smidgen of veg oil, heated up, added some chopped garlic, lup cheong, stirred. There is enough oil from the lup cheong plus a little of the veg oil to make almost 2T of oil called for in this recipe. I added some frozen peas and carrots, stirred to combine. Next, I added the chopped up chicken. Once everything was heated I added the cold rice and broke it up while in the pot. I added a little soy sauce, a dash of Lee Kum Kee oyster sauce and mixed well. I added little black pepper and salt to taste, then sprinkled some chopped green onions as a garnish along with the thinly sliced eggs. I must say that is a meal in itself and makes quite a lot for two people, plus leftovers for the next morning or for lunch. I am sure you can add other ingredients but this is usually how I make lup cheong fried rice. A tasty fulfilling dish!

Excellent and easy; my kind of recipe! I totally omitted the chicken but added a chopped green pepper then followed recipe as directed. I used leftover rice from previous nights dinner and it turned out perfect. Hubby (Filipino) suggested using cubed pork in lieu of chicken! I think he's looking at a tasty treat to take to work for his lunch! Thank you for sharing.

My advice is to LEAVE OUT the reserved liquid from the mushrooms. Should'a trusted the little voice in my head screaming "DON'T DO IT!" because I ended up with a mushy porridge NOT fried rice. I used day old rice and subbed cubed leftover pork loin for the Chinese sausage, insignificant changes that could not have affected the outcome so I have to conclude that the recipe author (and other reviewers) like mushy fried rice. Go figure.

Very yummy and easy!  I make my rice the day before and cool over night.  I also use 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock for the liquid in the rice.  We make a lot of Korean here at home, so this is a nice change!

I browned a large onion in 1/2 stick of butter then removed from heat and set aside.  Then I scrambled 2eggs and added it to the onion when finished. then I cooked 3 lengths of the red Chinese sausage. I cut them in slices first but would cook them while again and slice them afterwards. I added in 1/2 cup soy sauce and 2cups cooked rice. I also added in 1/2 pound frozen carrots and peas. combining everything made 4 servings and hubby went back for thirds!
