What a great idea! I used fresh pineapple, and cooled the salad before serving. Refreshing and full of vitamins!

Cutting the watermelon is a challenge to be sure, but the flavor of cold watermelon and the great presentation is so worth it.  Add a little mint and a dash of salt give it a brighter flavor.  I left out the bananas, as they tend to get a little too mushy for my taste. Great, refreshing and delicious fruit bowl. B.J.

Wow, this brings back sooooo many memories! I remember my mom making this for pretty much every summer function. She never added the apples or bananas tho, but she did add honeydew, cantaloupe and strawberries. You really could use any combination of fruit that you like. The watermelon 'basket' makes such a pretty presentation.

If you want a smaller version to sit on many tables, do the same thing with 1/2 of a fresh pineapple.

I used a large watermelon and had asked my husband cut it into a basket for me! He did a wonderful job and it is such a pretty presentation at any summer party. I also used cantaloupe, grapes and honeydew instead of apples/bananas [so easy to adapt to your favorites]. I had shredded coconut next to it as sprinkles. It was a definite hit at our party.
