This was great!! I didn't have the exact seasonings listed so I added my own for taste and it turned out Great. I left everything else the same just added more heavy pint since sauce thickens. I will use this recipe again.

This was wonderful! I did halve the butter (and supplemented a little olive oil instead) and used fat free half & half. Topped with some panko--it was so delicious. I've been looking for something new to make with crawfish tails, and this one is going into the rotation for sure. Thanks!

Oh Ya-Ya yeah!  , this is one good dish.  My only changes are to use another pasta-  bowties, cavatelle-  even linguine (the noodles don't have enough bite for me).  A comfort food from LA, and very welcome here by me!  Rich, yes- but don't skimp trying to make it less, especially on the cheese- but you can use half and half if that salves your conscience a bit.  And you can use the lighter butter there also, the I Can't believe its not butter sticks give pretty decent results.  Try this one out, you will like the mac and cheese creaminess and the veg and the crawfish. And do add the mushrooms, it's worth it- make sure you use fresh.  To tighten up the dish a bit, I put it in the broiler with a dusting of bread crumbs on top, and that really sets it off!  Thanks for posting this good recipe, Janessa.  Love the mudbugs!

Easy to make and quick. I followed recipe exactly as written, but found it to be too salty, wish I had added the Tony's gradually (not sure what I was thinking), we like spicey so that wasn't a problem, just to salty. Worth trying the recipe, just pay attention to the salty factor.

This recipe was quite good but the cheese sauce overwhelms the crawfish. After tasting , I added some imitation crabmeat, 1/2 cup or so. The crab brought out a more pronounced flavor.

Too SALTY! DO NOT use 2 tbl sp of Tony Chachere's...maybe one!  It wouldve been very good w/o all the salt! I used a lb of shrimp instead of crawfish and followed the recipe exactly with everything else!

Husband loved it, will definitely make again. Followed instructions exactly, except I used Zatarrainâ€™s Cajun seasoning rather than TC-was a tad saltier than I would have preferred but was a major hit! The sauce seems to thicken after removing from heat and after mixing with pasta so I would recommend allowing to sit a few minutes and stir well

Doubled onions, added minced pickled jalapeno, doubled fresh ground black pepper, substituted provolone for the cheddar, simmered heavy cream to thicken, added a little Worcestershire and fresh crab claw meat just before serving and finely diced green onion leaves.  Seasoned Cajun seafood lovers asked for my recipe.  Served over garlic buttered fettuccine with lightly garliced french bread with a good white wine and Heineken beer for those that preferred.  Raves from everyone.  A gourmet meal.

This was super tasty!  Used shrimp instead of Crawfish b/c that's what I had on hand.  I reduced the spice to about 2 tsp instead of 2 T and just sprinkled to taste from there.  First time I made with Tony's creole (very good) and the next time, by accident, made with Slap Ya Mama spice - even the little ones asked for seconds.  Second time round, too,  cooked the shrimp in butter separately since not all were shrimp lovers, sprinkled some Slap Ya Mama spice on the shrimp too.  Big hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe, used tri-colored peppers, subbed evaporated milk for the heavy cream (just because that's what I had on hand), added a can of drained mild Rotel, and cut the Tony's in half. It was a little thinner than it should've been. Next time I'd like to try it with the heavy cream. I also used bow tie pasta. This is a comfort food dish & good filling food for my teen boys. Easy to make.

I wish i would have read the review before I followed the recipe. Like others have stated the salt content in the recipe is a bit overwhelming and the amount that's in the recipe makes the dish to salt with  the cheese being adding in as well because of it have salt in it as well. So i would season to taste instead of using the measurements of Tony Seasoning.  Other wise awesome dish..
