I found it to be very bland but looked up other recipes and doctored it with these changes: 1/4 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp powdered ginger, 1/4 cup dry sherry. Also, replace the black pepper with white pepper if you have it in the house.  I will definitely make this again with those additions. Lots of flavor.

This was a very quick recipe and made for a filling dinner. After I tasted it at the end of the given directions, I thought it could use more flavor. I decided to add several more ingredients including a dash of garlic powder, tarragon, pumpkin pie spice (!) plus a generous amount of ground ginger, brown sugar and curry powder.  It was very good.

I thought this was a great recipe! Didn't have any almonds, or almond milk, but otherwise, made it as instructed. Would be a 1st course to Thanksgiving dinner :)
