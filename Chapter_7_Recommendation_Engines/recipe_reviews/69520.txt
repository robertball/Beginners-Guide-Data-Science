I have made this multiple times, and its amazing, although I don't use the wheat germ or sunflower seeds. I wouldn't bake for 60-90 minutes, I bake it for about 8-10 minutes at 325, and it comes out lightly browned, any more and it burns & is very hard to get off the pan.

Tasty, and not too sweet (which I like!). I divided the recipe between two cookie sheets, and I always bake my granola at a very low temperature, which gets it nice and crispy without burning. I baked this at 225 degrees for 1 hour 45 minutes, switching racks every 30 minutes. At this temperature, there is no need to stir with each switch.

This is an awesome recipe. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and the coconut takes on a toasted flavor that just makes this recipe better than anything you will buy in the store. I added some flax seed and some cranberry/raisins. This recipe is great just the way it is but also leaves room for you to personalize it to your own taste. Thank you for this recipe!!!

great recipe with a few 'tweaks' to suit your tastes: like the other reviewers, I cut down the cooking time/temperature significantly (I cook it at 300 degrees for about 30-40 minutes, checking and stirring at 15-20 minute intervals, then I turn the oven off and let it sit in the oven as the oven cools off), skipped the sesame seeds and upped the sunflower seeds to 1/2 cup, sprinkled a little cinnamon and nutmeg, added some minced orange zest, and some dried cranberries.  I found it's best to add the dried fruit AFTER I turn the oven off, because if it's in there from the beginning it gets a burnt smell/taste.  I've been making batches of this about once a month for the past year!

My batch was over-cooked after 20 mins of cooking.  Since I have a new oven (see other reviewer's comments), I think the time and temperature has to be adjusted. Also, I added cinnamon and used less sugar for more flavor and less sweetness.

I added dry roasted edemame and dried cranberries to give this color.  Also I listened to other members and baked this @ 275 degrees for about 40-45 mins. Yummy, thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I have been looking for a good granola recipe, and this is it!  I did, however, have problems cooking it--mine was done in about 30 minutes.  My oven is from 1962 or something, so it probably doesn't heat properly.  After cooking the granola, this recipe is HIGHLY customizable.  All in all, a delightful recipe and I will definately be making it again (and again and again!).

I followed all the directions.  Preheated the oven to 325 and in the first 1/2 hour everything was burnt.  I was very disaapointed.

Fabulous base recipe- add what you like or have on hand. Makes a good batch of granola at a fraction of the cost of prepackaged kind. Tastes much better too. I did decrease the bake time and added blueberries (yum). THANK YOU!

As many others have found this is best  baked at 225 degrees for 1 hour 30-45 minutes, switching racks every 30 minutes or so. I also omit the brown sugar (honey is plenty of sweetness for me!) and coconut, and add walnuts and pecans only. After removing from the oven I add whatever fruit I want (raisins, cranberries, dates, cherries, etc) as I've found adding them before baking makes the fruit dry and rock hard. Great basic recipe to add your own person touches too!

I love this granola. It was crunchy and just perfectly sweet. I added flax seed and dried fruit during the last 10 minutes of baking. What a treat! Will definitely make again and again.

I'm giving thus recipe five stars because it is really a great flexible recipe. After making this several times I have personalized it by adding fruits such as sultanas, dried cherries, currants, and/or cranberries. I have also substituted speltflakes for a cup of the oats, and pecans for the almonds, and added pumkin seeds. You can use whatever you have on hand. Most importantly, I cut the temperature to 300 degrees and stir twice after 20 minutes, and then after about another 20 minutes, then give it another 10 if needed.

Next time I'll halve the recipe. This makes a lot of granola, which made it hard to mix and cook evenly.

I made this granola and really loved it.  I omitted the sesame seeds. I think baking it for an hour is quite long, my first batch was burned.  I cut it down to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and it was perfect. I used dried cherries..yummy!

I am giving this 5 stars...the recipe itself is wonderful....however...it does NOT take 60-90 minutes to cook.  
I cut the salt in half due to the fact I used salted sunflower seeds...I didn't find sesame seeds so I couldn't use them...no big.
I have made granola MANY times and know from experience to check it and STIR it every 15 minutes...go every 30 and it may burn and be ruined.  
I also used extra coconut because I LOVE it...and after it was done baking and cool I added dried cherries chopped in half to quarter pieces. 
**any fruit can be used..dates, raisins anything really**
So...I can say I will keep this one in my book and use many times. 
THANK YOU for the excellent recipe!

This recipe is very good.  I like it because you can add what you like and it is not too sweet.  Like many of the other reviewers, I didn't cook it for the 60-90 minutes.  I cooked it at 325 for 15 minutes and then just turned the oven off.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks

Best Granola ever. I have added flax seeds and walnuts. I measure generously. I used a full cup of hot water. Honey, brown sugar, vanilla, water and oil, the 2 cup measure filled to the brim. I stir the mixture to syrup, prevents crystallizing while cooking. Ten minutes between stirring in the oven, the last is only about five minutes.
Kids come home and beg for a quart ziplock full to take with them. I had tried for years to get my family to make granola a regular part of the household diet. This is the only recipe that they love.

This turned out alright, I baked it for about an hour, and it was a little overdone...it also didn't form into nice clumps at all, it think there may have been too may dry ingredients....although it does taste quite good...even overdone!  I'm going to try it again.

i also turned down the temp to 220 and stirred every 15 min.  i had to leave so i just turned the oven of and let it toast till it was cool.  oh and instead of water i substituted with orange juice and added orange craisins.  i think next time i will try doubling the liquid portion... i like it a little clumpier.  But over all it had good flavor.

A great starting off place to make your own signature granola. I gave 4 stars vs 5 as the cooking directions call for baking way to long in my opinion. Mine was nearly over done after 45 minutes and stirring / checking every 15. I added dried cranberries and blueberries after it cooled. Great as cereal with milk or as topping for yogurt for breakfast or snacks.

Super easy recipe and ingredients you have on hand.  I did use a 300 degree oven and it worked great.  It's a dry granola recipe, just like we like it.  I will definitely use this one again.

Excellent granola- light, flavorful, and everything that I'd hoped it would be! The boiling water threw me, at first, but now I see that it helps to spread out the sweeteners, so that you can use less fat and sugars than other recipes. I baked it at 300F, stirring every 20 minutes, for an hour, and it turned out fantastic. This is going to be my go-to from now on. Thanks so much, IAMJENNIE!

This was a decent granola, but not amazing. It's fairly bland; if you do make it, add spices (I used cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves), and add some fruit after it's baked (I added craisins, apricots, dried apples, and raisins). And do NOT bake it for nearly as long or high as stated. Half an hour in a 275 over is plenty. If you want to try something more flavorful, we enjoyed the Fruit n' Honey Granola on this site.
