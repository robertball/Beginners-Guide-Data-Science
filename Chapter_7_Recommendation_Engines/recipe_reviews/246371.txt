I buy ground beef in bulk and freeze it by the 1/2 pound, so instead of 1/3 lb. for 3 burgers, I made 4 burgers using 1/2 lb. I left the rest of the ingredients as written. I used what I already had, but I wish I had had a not-so-sweet bbq sauce. The sweet factor was a little too much with the sweet sauce and the sweet Hawaiian Roll. Next time I make these, they would be nice with a hickory smoked bbq sauce. I also think I would prefer the onions cooked in rings rather than diced, but that is just personal preference. The one thing missing from the recipe is salt. That is a needed ingredient.

Side note to my earlier review: I used Veterans Sweet Heat BBQ sauce. It complimented the burgers very well.
