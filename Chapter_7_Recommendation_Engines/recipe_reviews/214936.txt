My kids thought this was great. I used a frozen banana along with the frozen blueberries, "lite" raspberry yogurt and white grape juice (that was all I had....if you have clumsy kids like me, you'd understand....). Gone, baby, gone. They inhaled it. Thanks, CC.

Icy cold, creamy, and just plain delicious! Not to mention a great way to use up the last of the buttermilk! I subbed vanilla yogurt for the raspberry and wheat germ for the flaxseed meal as that's what I had on hand. Freezing the fruit first is a great idea. This had a nice sweetness and it's something you can definitely feel good about having for breakfast. Thanks for another great recipe CC!

Rather than tossing those uneaten, overripe bananas, just peel and pop into the freezer in a freezer bag. Taking one out for a smoothie becomes quick & easy. The banana adds natural sweetness (if it's overripe) & creaminess. The buttermilk also adds creaminess and a bit of tang. Low/fat free yogurt works in this recipe. This smoothie is more like 'breakfast in a glass' compared to a typical smoothie, so if you want it less filling/lower calorie, you can leave out the almonds and oats. Makes 3 8 oz. smoothies.

I'll admit I was skeptical about the combination of grape juice and buttermilk, but I was pleasantly surprised! Neither of the flavors were overpowering, but you could still taste them! :) I left out the almonds due to an allergy and I subbed fat free vanilla yogurt for the raspberry yogurt. 
Update: I made it today using 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt, 1 Tbsp. sugar, and tossing in a few raspberries. Delicious! Thanks again for a wonderful smoothie recipe!

Healthy, and definitely very filling! Great for breakfast on-the-go. For the yogurt I used three 100g cups of Astro's Fat-Free Zero acai-raspberry. I had a white grape-peach juice blend on hand and used a 1/3 cup of it instead of the 1/4 cup of concord grape juice. Also substituted 2% milk for the 1% buttermilk. My banana was already frozen prior to making the recipe (as I always do when I've got overly ripe ones lying around). Can't wait for the hubby-to-be and the little one to try this when they get home! YUM.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was much too thick to even pour, so I added a little milk. The taste is great. Love the nutiness. Will be making this one again!

For my boys I left out the oats and flax - but it was very yummy!  They really loved it and will be making it again!

Very good, very filling! I omitted the banana because I'm not a fan of the flavor in smoothies (and reduced the yogurt and buttermilk just slightly because of this), and added a little honey as sweetener instead. (I also used vanilla yogurt instead of raspberry because it is what I had. I'd like to try it with the raspberry, but I thought the vanilla worked well.) I love the nutty flavor imparted by the almonds, oats, and flax; it goes so well with the blueberries! I would never have thought to add buttermilk to a smoothie, but it gives it a wonderful zing! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Terrific recipe!  Now I have a good use for the ripe bananas.  I used strawberry yougurt and apple juice since that is what I had.  It was very flavorful and crunchy.  We had bran flax muffins with it for breakfast and it was a delightful change.

Mmmmmm, so good!  Only change was I used almond milk.  Delicious "breakfast on the go" for my girls.   Now they ask me to make it so they can take it on their walk to their bus stop.  :)

The first time I tried this recipe it was simply wonderful. The 2nd and 3rd time, however, I was a bit dissapointed. Here is what I did different the first time: I used Yoplait light raspberry cheese cake yogurt, and since I didn't have grape jucie, I used Minite Made Lemon Aide. Wow - did that turn a very good recipe and make like 10% better.

This was very good.  My husband said it could have been sweeter, so next time I will use soy milk.  Loved the oats and almonds though, yum!

Very enjoyable and keeps your hunger satisfied for hours. The recipe is easily adaptable. I've changed the nuts, added tofu, a touch of cinnamon, a few strawberries in lieu of banana -- whatever you've got on hand, it still tastes great!

I didn't have flax meal so used flax seed; also used French vanilla yogurt as I didn't have raspberry on hand.  I thought this was rather bland.  Reading the ingredients, it seemed there were too many competing flavors--almond, banana, grape, raspberry, blueberry--for any one to stand out.

I used a cup of real grapes and light soymilk to make it healthier. This was pretty good but it was too thick for my taste. Next time I will double the amount of milk.

Pretty good, but I like the berry/grape smoothie better.  This was a bit too much raspberry for me, surprisingly since there's only so many pieces of fruit in a yogurt.  It was also difficult to get it good and cold, despite that my fruit was (already) frozen and I even put the liquids in the freezer for a while ahead of time.  I did leave out the almonds (preference and I'm not attempting a protein-punch) and the flaxseed (since my flax is actually in a gel cap :-)).  But I did include the oats as that usually makes them more filling.  It'll go in my line-up, but I probably just won't make this one quite as often.

Used lemon juice and normal milk instead of buttermilk, strawberry yogurt instead of raspberry yogurt and didn't freeze the banana (otherwise followed the recipe).  Good consistency, but I felt like the banana flavor overpowered that of the blueberry.  Next time I would use less banana and more blueberry
