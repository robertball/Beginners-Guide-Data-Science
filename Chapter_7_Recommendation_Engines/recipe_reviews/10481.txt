I admit I changed a few things, I omitted the coffe and added a lot more oats and about 1/2 cup of peanut butter, but the cookies are AMAZING and I can't stop eating them.

I made this with my Brownie troop ... six-year olds. They all were able to roll these cookies after making the recipe with no modifications ... except for substituting water for coffee, just because they'd all say, "Ewww!" To make rolling easier, wash your hands every time the batter builds up on your fingers. I made them in January and had absolutely no problems with stickiness. I made the recipe with the coffee at home and it barely registered anyway. I have also done this adding a third of a cup of peanut butter and it is fabulous! The first time I used "Old fashioned" oats. It was fine, but the oats stick in your teeth. Now I only use 'Quick" oats and the texture is much finer. The 5-star is from the Brownies. They loved it!

Amazing! I've re-named these my "Christmas mocha snowballs" I used VERY strong coffee and rolled some in cocoanut, but it's a bit more tricky. I tried them for a friend of mine 3 days ago, and have made them 4 times already. Thanks for the great recipe, I think it will become a classic around here!

This recipe was really easy no bake was right!  I had everything in my cupboard for this yummy snack!  I omitted the coffee in this recipe.  I also only dipped half of my cookies in confectioner's sugar for variety.

These were good, and easy too.  They were a bit boring, so next time I might add some extra goodies like nuts, or chocolate pieces to the mix.  I wasn't going to roll them in sugar, but I had to or else they would have melted in your hands!

I halved the amount of butter and it was still pretty difficult to roll, so I ended up refrigerating the batter, and it was a lot easier.  I then refrigerated the balls overnight, and it was a hit with my friends the next day.

These were fantastic tasting. The reason why i only gave it four stars though - they were really really hard to roll. I don't think I did anything wrong. They just weren't very stuff. Maybe chill them first before rolling? I'll try that next and maybe use stiffer butter/margarine

ok and easy.  VERY difficult to roll.  Suggest refrigerating before rolling or adding something to make it easier (PB, confectioner's sugar, etc.)

Great - have made these a couple of times now.  Turned out the best with Godiva hot chocolate (used milk choc, not dark)  I tried adding peanut butter once and thought it was too sweet and too sticky.  The directions don't mention it, but if the butter is melted, you need to let them firm up a bit after mixing.  Then set them on wax paper for a couple of hours.  This lets them set up, so they don't fall apart.  I omit the coffer as well and add a tablespoon of water instead.

Made these while we were camping. The butter made them really soft and did not want to stick together. Per the reviews I read here, will add peanut butter next time. Giving a '4' for the consistency/peanut butter substitution. Otherwise, these were great - our family loved them (even a couple days later when we realized there were some left!). Thanks for sharing.

I HAVE MADE THESE 3 TIMES LATELY. DO NOT CHANGE RECIPE TO HIGHER SERVINGS LIKE I DID. 
I USE AN ICE CREAM SCOOP FOR ALL MY COOKIES, & THEY ALWAYS COME OUT BEAUTIFUL. I USED BETTER FLAVORED CRISCO & STILL WAS GOOD.

After reading previous comments I made minor adjustments. I doubled the recipe for a start. Added 1cup coconut. 1tsp. instant coffee (just because I had no brewed coffee ready)to help bring out the chocolate flavour. Used a coffee scoop to measure for ball size squeezing against bowl to create the ball. Placed on parchment covered baking sheet and refrigerated. Did not use confectioner's sugar. They held together just fine and tasted incredible. With the extra coconut it made 48 balls. Will definitely make these again.

These were great, and perfect for the children's group I was working with. Based on some other comments, I took a leap and substituted peanut butter for the regular butter, which meant that I did not have to worry about refrigeration at all, making them the perfect camping cookie!

The taste is great- we added 1/3 cup peanut butter as well, but they are so sticky and hard to roll. We ended up adding 2/3 cups more oats to try to make up for the PB and they were still really hard to roll.

I did increase the oats to 2 Cups and used 1 Tbs of water and a 1/2 tsp of instant coffee-- and I took someone-elses advice about using the cup of my palm and a spoon to make the balls.  Oh and I also refrigerated the dough before rolling and put my powdered sugar in a small bowl that I could just toss about until the cookie was covered-- then back into the fridge again.   Just a bit grainy but perhaps that will go away as they set longer.

The best thing about these is that they are quick and easy!  I wanted a no-bake cookie, but I didn't have peanut butter, like most of the recipes called for, so I went with this recipe.  I left out the coffee and added just a tad of honey.  Filling and yummy!

From the ingredients these look delicious, but I made the recipe for one of my Thanksgiving desserts and no one was overly impressed. They tasted too much like cocoa and coffee and were missing something.  If there were peanut butter in the cookie it would be much better I think.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I made the first batch exactly as the recipe says, and they are great!  The second batch, I added extra coffee (stronger too), and some coconut.  I also rolled them in coconut.  They were difficult to roll, but being June and in Arizona, everything melts.

These were easy to make while camping. I brought all the dry ingredients measured out in one mixing bowl. The sun melted my frozen butter just enough to work with and the cool air in the morning was great for preventing too much sticking (I read several reviews about problems with sticking). I liked them best coated with coconut instead of powdered sugar.

Wow! Really good! I too added extra, extra strong coffee flavor by using reconstituted espresso powder. My regular no-bake cookie recipe calls for peanut butter but I didn't miss it one bit in this recipe. To roll the balls just a bit easier I used a deep, round tablespoon and formed the rest of the ball in my palm. I've also found that rolling the balls in powdered sugar is a little easier and less messy if I put the powdered sugar in a round bowl and gently circle the bowl. The ball just rolls around and covers itself! This one will be great for the holidays!

Made these with my Girl Scout troop last night and they came out great. Used water for the coffee and added 1/2c peanut butter. No problem at all rolling them. The girls all thought they were very yummy!!

For how the easy they were, they were relatively good. I doubled the amount of coffee. However, the cocoa powder and butter flavor was still too prominent to me, so I probably wouldn't try these again.

This is a great "springboard" recipe.  I made the following changes:  2 T. coffee instead of 1, added 1 c. coconut, and added 1/3 c. peanut butter.  Even with the extra dry ingredients, the cookies were still pretty messy when rolling.  With two small children, almost any baking project is messy, though! ;o)  The flavor of these cookies is amazing - I'm definitely planning on making these & passing them out at Christmas time.

They were ok.  Really hard to roll until I put them into the freezer for a couple of minutes.  We are going to try them again when we go camping.

This recipe is actually for Swedish Cocoanut Balls. My recipe includes two squares of unsweetened chocolate.   For those who said they were hard to roll, part of the problem may be not enough butter.   Also, you have to really work the ingredients together to get them to the rolling point.  Also, refrigerating them solidifies them so they do not become too soft.  However, do not refrigerate them too long, they will be hard.

These set up beautifully.  I'm not sure if it's because I added a 1/3 c of whey protein powder or not, but they came out great.

Love these just the way they are.  I took them to a church dinner, and people asked for the recipe.

Very good! I did add a 1/4 c. of peanut butter and increased the oats to 2 cups to make rolling easier.

I made this having only read a few reviews, all of which were positive.  I needed a recipe with no peanut butter to serve to a child who was allergic.  I had the same problem with inability to roll them into balls, even after putting the batter in the fridge to get it to set a little.  I was afraid the T of coffee might have melted the butter too much.  We ended up having it as an ice cream topping (which was a big hit) and I used Starbucks Via in 1 1/2 oz of water as the coffee (which made the taster really stand out!).  I will make these again and probably add a little honey to help them stick together and also use cooled coffee.

tried these after reading the reviews, and loved them. i took other people's advice and rolled them in coconut and they were fabulous! Like a chocolate mocha ball. I even decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and I thought they were still wonderful.

The dough was difficult to roll, but not impossible. It was very similar to making macaroons.  I was trying to save time (and heat) by choosing a "no-bake" recipe, but the rolling time made up for it. Enjoyed the flavor, but my best rule of thumb is when my husband doesn't come back into the kitchen for another handful...

They have a slightly granuly texture since you don't melt the sugar, but they are really yummy. I omitted the coffee and also added 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Definitely add peanut butter. These are great to make in a classroom or anywhere else you don't have access to the stove top. I stuck them in the freezer for 15 minutes after making them and they were perfect!

I am not a "professional", but I am a pretty experienced cook, and I love to bake and try new recipes. Finishing up my christmas baking, I thought I'd try one last easy recipe. Boy am I dissapointed! I had to throw the whole batch in the garbage - There is absolutely nothing in this recipe that makes it set up, and when other reviewers said "messy" and "sticky" to roll, what an understatement! There is no way to roll these in balls! Sorry to say but this recipe gets my first bad rating.

I really loved the flavor of this recipe!  I definitely will make again, but I too had trouble rolling the cookies.  I plan to add some peanut butter and maybe more oats next time.
