Spoiler Alert: This takes longer than three minutes. ;)
If you're pressed for time, can't find or don't have a candy thermometer, it's a great no-fail fudge recipe to have on hand. I've been making a version of this for years with excellent results.
You don't have to stick to just chocolate either - this will work with any "chip" flavor you have. Today I made peanut butter and dark chocolate, and I was about to make a pan of white chocolate when disaster struck and I dropped my last can of condensed milk on the floor. Bummer. That must have been the Universe intervening to save my poor thighs! 
If you want this to feel extra fancy, use a higher quality chocolate chip, like Ghiradelli to give a better depth of flavor. You can also top with chopped nuts, festive candies or sprinkles, or some unmelted chocolate chips. Get creative.
ProTip: Skip the step where you grease the pan. Just line with a single piece of aluminum foil instead (grease it with cooking spray if you want this to be extra simple.) and when it's time to serve the fudge, just lift the entire thing out of the pan, peel off the foil and cut into squares. Voila! Clean up is easier now too. 
I skip the 1 oz square and just use extra chips.
Remember to work quickly once you've removed your mixture from the microwave. It's going to thicken up & get ooey-gooey very fast, so you need to get it smooth & spread it into the pan immediately. 
The last thing I've found is that this fudge does best when kept in the fridge.

I was hesitant to try the recipe at first but was super surprised.  I waited a couple of hours and then put the pan into the fridge to cool ~ used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan so it was easy to remove.  Cut it into 1" squares and have to say, not a single person said they didn't like it.  In fact, one of the ladies works in a chocolate store and she even said it was awesome.  I'm just heading to make a second batch now.  This will be on my list of goodies for Christmas time.  Thanks a bunch for submitting a super easy and really yummy recipe!!!

This was super easy and very tasty.  I made 3 different versions, using different chips as another reviewer suggested: Chocolate, Dark Chocolate (for Mom), and Mint Chocolate.  All were excellent!!

I have a 1000 watt microwave. I put it on for 5 minutes at 30%. I used Reese's pieces. I added one teaspoon of vanilla. I licked the spatula and it tasted great. I will definitely experiment around with this recipe with different flavors.

Very good!  I have made many times. You can add walnuts,
peanuts and even add mini peanut butter cups to the mixture right
before pouring fudge into pan!!   I am going to add some
chopped candy canes to the fudge I make for Christmas.

I added 2 1/2 cups of a mixture of walnuts and pecans.  And put in frig - it set in no time.  I used  Ghirardelli 60% Cacao bittersweet chocolate chips.  I love dark chocolate especially with nuts and a glass of  red wine!  It was perfect for my taste.

I've been making this fudge for years.  I do add a tsp of vanilla and, since I'm into instant gratification, I simply spread it out on a piece of waxed paper on a cutting board and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to harden (or on the back porch in the winter d;^)).

This recipe sounds good but I have never tried to make and I wish it didn't take 3 hours to set.

This is a pretty good tasting quick fudge to make. My only criticism is that I didn't like the fact the ingredients didn't list adding some kind of flavoring  lessing the condensed milk flavor taste. Nonetheless,  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and I also added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I prefer the taste and texture of traditional fudge with sugar,and marshmallow fluff,but when you are pressed for time to make fudge this is pretty good.

Super easy.  I messed up and bought Caramel Eagle Brand milk and didnâ€™t have any bar chocolate.  Used just chips and the Caramel Eagle Brand.  It set up fine and tasted great.

Very easy recipe. I used semisweet chips and added walnuts and dried cranberries. This made a great addition to a chocolate-loving friend's gift. Beware it's tasty and moreish!

Too chewy/rubbery, not at all like "real" fudge.
