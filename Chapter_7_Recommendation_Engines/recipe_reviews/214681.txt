Well They Are certainly Treats! You Could try using dark or brown chocolate! The flag colored sprinkles are for a french Flag! So they work good with any Country-celebration thing! You could also make the rectangles at any shape you would like(Triangles,Squares,Circles)! I would use butter instead of margarine for a less-fat-treat! you could also cook cereal with Chocolate for cocoa-cocoa-Yankee Doodle Dandy Treats! Amazingly Amazing!

These are OK. But I think that the icing is a bit overkill. The basic recipe is really all you need.  If you want to make it patriotic, just use the red, white and blue sprinkles. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup on top of your already panned mixture, press them in and refrigerate. They look just as festive without worrying about the summer elements  messing with the icing.

Amazing treats!  I ended up adding more butter (1/2 stick more).  Also, instead of cutting the crispie in half for the frosting, I just pressed the crispie mixture into 2 seperate pans.  That just made it a whole lot easier.

If you love sweet you will really enjoy these.  A bit over the top for me but the kids loved them. And a few grown ups that are RKT lovers couldn't get enough of them.  I will definately make again.
