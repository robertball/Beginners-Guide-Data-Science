Overall, this recipie was very good. I used fresh cauliflower and strongly suggest cooking the califlower a bit before combining with the other ingredients and putting in the oven. Additionally, I used bacon bits and would strong suggest using crumbled real bacon. I think it would make all the difference in the world. A pretty easy recipie to pull together.

This was very good!  Was looking for a new recipe for cauliflower and had all the ingredients on hand.  I had bacon bits, and still thought it was teriffic, but I'll try again with crumbled bacon.  Took another reviewer's advice and pre-cooked the cauliflower 3 minutes in the microwave before mixing with everything else and putting in the oven, and it came out perfectly.  Will make again.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this.  Super easy to throw together. Used this recipe as a jump point and used ingredients we had on hand...fresh cauliflower (steamed it a bit first), cream of asparagus soup (rather than mushroom), cheddar cheese (rather than swiss), leeks (because they needed to be used) and bread crumbs on top.  Next time I'd like to actually try the swiss/mushroom combo, but the asparagus/cheddar combo was really good.  I think just about any cream soup would work in this.

This tasted amazing!  I didn't have swiss cheese so I replaced it with Aged 2yr Balderson Royal Canadian Cheddar cheese.  Also I took the advice and used blanched a head of cauliflower and pan fried a third pkg of bacon.

Great I Cooked the Cauliflower in the microwave for 2mins on high, and then sprinkled breadcrumbs over it at the end before cooking, so it had a crunchy texture on top.  It has become a family favourite!

I'm not a fan of cauliflower, and this was a great way to dress it up! It actually tasted very similar to potatoes au gratin. I had to sub mozzarella for the Swiss and bacon bits for real bacon; I hope to try it sometime with the right ingredients.

I had to make some substitutions based on what I had so that's why I rated it four stars.  Instead of all cauliflower, I used a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower, and substituted canned fried onion rings instead of the bacon.  Usually my husband doesn't like anything made with canned soups but he did like this one and so did I.  I had some really good local swiss cheese too so that made it special.  I will make it again, next time without all the substitutions.  It's a good recipe.

Delicious! I followed this closely - but used fresh cauliflower - and microwaved it for about 4 min. in a large bowl with a little water in the base. I sprinkled garlic salt into the soup and milk mixture in place of a garlic clove. After mixing the cauliflower and soup mixture, I sprinkled with bread crumbs, bacon crumbles and grated white cheddar cheese (didn't have swiss on hand). The family members that like cauliflower, couldn't get enough! It was so good.

Great recipe that can be altered to suit any taste by changing the soup, or adding chives, or changing the cheese.  This will be a go to from now on.

I took the recommendation from some of the previous reviews and cooked up the veggies ahead of time. I added broccoli, onion and cauliflower to a bit of oil and cooked for a few minutes. I used an Italian blend of cheeses, mixed with the cream of mushroom, milk, and garlic salt. I also added mushroom pieces, and a can of great northern beans. Mixed in with the veggies, and baked for 40 minutes. Topped with crumbled bacon, and more cheese and cooked for the remaining 10 minutes. Delicious!

Great recipe!  I used freshly crumbled bacon and a swiss/gruyere shredded cheese mix.  I steamed fresh cauliflower for about 10 minutes so it was still a little hard/crunchy before putting it in the oven.  The texture was PERFECT!  My whole family loved it.  It's surprising what you can make with a can of mushroom soup.  This will definitely be made again.

Oh my, I am in Heaven when I eat this recipe.  I was looking for a new recipe that could be used at every holiday gathering!  This is it! I would give it 20 stars if I could! I did add a can of cheddar cheese soup, salt, and pepper.  That was just to give it a little taste and make it a bit more kid friendly (with the soup). Every time I make a plate of leftovers this is on my dish!  Thank you so much for sharing.  Words can't express my thanks enough, truly PERFECT!

Made this with great success last night - even my picky young teens loved it! I used raw fresh cauliflower and didn't steam prior to using. It cooked nicely, perhaps due to the small size I cut. I used half and half along with some milk to make it creamier. I didn't have enough swiss cheese so added in some shredded colby and monteray. My daughter asked for the leftovers in her school lunch today !!!!

Not fabulous. Even after adding a couple of fresh sliced mushrooms and extra bacon there was really no saving this dish. This recipe with additions could have potential, but I don't feel it's worth the effort.

I'm not usually a huge cauliflower fan, but I loved this. We used fresh cauliflower (steamed for ~5 min before putting it in the mix), and turkey bacon. Yum!!

Sorry, I thought this had a strong, unappealing flavor. I would change the soup to something else next time, and leave out the garlic and bacon bits. I followed it exactly, but just didn't care for it.

This is excellent.  The kids LOVED it. Definitely steam fresh cauliflower for about 6 mins prior to baking instead of using frozen.  Also, cook some bacon versus using the bits.  Also, season with black pepper, but be careful on adding salt since the soup and bacon already bring ample salt.

I didn't have swiss cheese or bacon bits so I substitued with 1 1/2 cups motzarell cheese. I Mixed 1/8 cup italian bread crumbs with 1/8 cup japanese panko crumbs and 1 1/2 tbs of melted butter then sprinkled that over the cheese to give it more flavor and crispiness. It came out pretty good. I also used fresh cauliflower cooked in water in the microwave for 5 minutes and drained to soften before baking. I will make again to try it with the fresh bacon and swiss cheese to compare flavors. thanks for the recipe.

I tried this as a direct result of an AR All Star "assignment", but, rest assured, my opinions are my very own.  In fact, I was prepared to NOT like this, as canned/cream of soups just aren't my thing.  I managed to only minimally *tweak* the recipe (forgot to thaw the frozen cauliflower) and we both really enjoyed this.  Due to a timing snafu that was NOT my fault (I'd planned to be super lazy and pair this with Barber Foods Broccoli & Cheese stuffed chicken and when I googled the bake time/temp this am, I found 350...when I got the box home, IT said 400...), I baked this at 400 for 32-35 minutes w/no issues.  With pantry/freezer staples, this will definately see some future table time at the LTH house.

Fairly easy and tasty.  I also nuked fresh cauliflower for a couple minutes before baking and forgot to add the bacon, but was still pretty tasty, and guests loved it.

I used cheddar cheese because it's what I had, and also used some prosciutto that I had leftover, instead of crumbled bacon.  During the last 5 minutes of cooking, I poured some bread crumbs over the top.  Will make again.

Made this according to directions and I thought it was delicious.  The swiss and bacon go really well together!  Next time I think I'll try precooking the cauliflower a little and throwing crumbled crackers on top.  Thanks for the tasty recipe!

This is a great starting point for making this your own.  I cooked the cauliflower per directions before mixing everything together.  I also used cream of chicken soup and 2 c. sharp cheddar. Also added salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Being on a lo-carb diet, this fits the bill nicely.

This was an easy and great tasting dish. I had to make 2 changes based on what I had on hand. I used mozzarella cheese and chopped up pieces of pepperoni, both were good alternatives. I also used fresh cauliflower and started it in the microwave for 4 minutes before adding the other ingredients and putting it in the oven.

A good recipe for cauliflower! I made mine with cream of chicken soup and diced ham with excellent results. I think that it would also be tasty with halved cherry tomatoes mixed in as well.

Didn't add the bacon (though I wish I had it on hand) but added scallions and French's fried onions. Also added paprika on the top to add a little more color.

This was truely great.  I admit to being skeptical just because cauliflower isn't a veggie that is a crowd pleaser for our fam but this one won over everyone. I will be making this again and again and am greatful to see the kids adding a new veggie to their request list. Thanks for this one!

This was really good. We arent fans of swiss so I used muenster and mozarella. I also added 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard and a few dashes of worchestershire sauce. Like another reviewer, I topped it with French's onions. Thank you.

Pretty good way to make califlower better.  I did use real bacon instead of the bacon bits and fresh califlower versus the frozen.  I did have to cook the fresh califlower for a couple of minutes to soften a little prior to putting in the oven and I'm glad I did.  I feel like this made alot considering it was a side dish.  Maybe next time I will cut the recipe in half.

Fantastic flavor! Used fresh cauliflower and nuked it for 5 minutes first. Also used skim milk and 98% Fat Free cream of mushroom soup. The Swiss cheese and bacon add a really nice flavor to the usually bland cauliflower. Thanks for a real keeper!

Like others did, I used the recipe as a starting point. Used gluten free mushroom soup, substituted chopped hard sausage (precooked) for the bacon, and cheddar for Swiss, as it was on hand. Three cloves of garlic. Very tasty, I will make this again.

I've made this for several years now. You can also you fresh cauli, and I did not even pre-steam the cauliflower. This is definitely not health food,  but for a tasty side dish, it works. I take it for Thanksgiving dinner.

Then I poured the mixture over the cauliflower with a few french fried onions  and backed it for 30 minutes.  DELICIOUS !!!!

Absolutely delicious!!
This is how I altered the recipe:
- used fresh cauliflower, partially steamed
- saute an onion until golden brown, add to the soup.
- sprinkle bread crumbs, prior to the cheese, for added texture
- use cheddar instead of swiss (personal preference).   
We loved it and will make it again.

The flavors in this dish are delicious!  I used fresh cauliflower and added a bit of cream cheese and green onion.  Plus I used mostly a blend of cheddar & mozza with a little swiss (just because it was what I had on hand).  It was a bit runny so next time I think I will eliminate the milk altogether.  But a delicious dish overall!

How many 2 year olds do you know that eat cauliflower?! My granddaughter ate 5 servings (granted, each serving was a serving-spoon size, but still)!! I used fresh cauliflower that I steamed before baking, and Cheddar-Gruyere for the Swiss cheese, but oh, so yummy!! We'll make this over & over again.

I often regret making casseroles with cream of mushroom soup, and this was no exception. Had a processed creamy mushroomy aftertaste.
