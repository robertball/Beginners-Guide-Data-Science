Great little recipe. Much easier to make than others I've tried. Looks and tastes good. Very glad I found it.

I've made some before, and it was delish! I added a couple of drops of peppermint extract, and it worked great.

I made this recipe twice for a school project and it didn't set right either time.  The first time I made it I thought that it was just me, but the second time that it didn't turn out right I looked back at the reviews and realized that it isn't just me.  This recipe is not right.  The ingredient amounts are wrong and it doesn't set.  I would NOT recommend this recipe.

I actually doubled the sweetened condensed milk because it just looked too watery as I started to heat it. I also missed the part about letting it cool for five minutes. I started to beat it right out of the pan. It is great, just like I remember from my honeymoon in Scotland. (And better than the stuff I occasionally buy at the British import store.)

My son needed a Scottish dish for school, so we tried this. I could not get it to set. It turned out like melty fudge! It may have been something I did wrong, I am not sure! I just couldn't get it to the right color or consitency.
