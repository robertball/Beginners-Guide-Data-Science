I make these all the time, I use splenda and half of the flour I use whole wheat, and I prefer to use rasberry jelly. They are always a hit!

These were a little time consuming so be prepared for that, but my kids loved them and I thought they were great aswell. I did add extra sugar to the batter instead of adding so much to the tops of the cookies. I will definitely be making them for the kids again!!
