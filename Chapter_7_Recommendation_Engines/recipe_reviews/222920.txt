Yummy! My whole family really enjoyed this pie. I used a large box of chocolate pudding instead of a small box of vanilla and chocolate (since I didn't have the small boxes). I also didn't use nearly the full amount of chocolate and peanuts for the topping - just enough for a light coating. Creamy, just the right amount of sweet and delicious!

This was an easy pie to make.  It was a very good balance between chocolate and peanut butter, not too sweet, just enough. I liked the light and creamy texture. The pie also looked very professional.  My 14 year old daughter had no problem making this recipe.

I normally don't like changing recipes even the slightest bit, but when I made this I was only using stuff I had on hand. First off I used a pre-made store brand 10 inch graham cracker crust, but the pie was still near overflowing, so no problems there. Second, I'm very impatient when it comes to cooking, so my mom taught me this trick where for every hour something needs to sit in the refrigerator, you can put it in the freezer for ten minutes instead. It doesn't always work but thankfully it did for this recipe. Lastly, in the filling I had to use some crunchy peanut butter along with creamy, but it didn't change much. Also, I replaced the chocolate shavings with mini chocolate chips, and I didn't have any peanuts to use so I left those out. Overall no major changes and it turned out well, just make sure your whipped topping is softened before spreading it on top or you'll mess up the layers. It tastes wonderful, I love the taste of each layer.
