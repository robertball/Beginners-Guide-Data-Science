I thought this was OK but nothing exciting.  I did not use the optional avocado since I don't like them.  It was OK for one go-round, but I doubt I would make again because I just didn't think this was worth it.

Quick and easy. I had an extra avocado, so I gave this a try. Didn't use salsa, and it was still good.
