This recipe was a bit of a let down.  The taste is okay but it's just not my kind of cookie.

I used lemon zest and extract instead of orange. Delicious!!! Be sure to let them cool and harden a bit before removing from the pan!

These cookies are amazing.  I have made them many times now.  I love the crunch the cornmeal brings to them.  If you want to try an adventurous version omit the orange zest and finely chop fresh rosemary  to equal 1 tablespoon.  So good if you are a rosemary fan. Very pretty too.

Very good easy to make.   I did the refrig method.   Loved the orange in it.
