Awesome! I didn't have any grenadine and didn't want to make a special trip to get some, so I just used a few tablespoons of strawberry jello powder.

Wow. This is a great tasting easy pie, and I can't wait to adapt it to other berries later in the season! 
 
Like other reviewers, I used an 8 oz. package of cream cheese instead of 3 oz. and a graham cracker crust. Next time, I will have to try chocolate crust for a bit of rich variety. It seems that cookie based crusts don't get nearly as soggy as a traditional dough crust would. (I learned this by accident, as I arranged the berries on the pie, assuming we were going to eat it rather quickly, but we ended up having to leave the house, so the pie wasn't actually served or cut into until the next day. The glazed berry topping firmed up beautifully and the pie wasn't soggy at all. (I had it on the coldest shelf on my fridge, so the cream layer stayed firm as well) Other additions/thoughts: When whipping heavy cream, ensure your bowl and beaters are cold. (I pop mine in the freezer for a few minutes before whipping) For those who prefer their cream a little sweeter, add a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup of sugar to the whip cream while it's whipping up. 
The cream filling will stay together if you whip the heavy cream just until stiff peaks form and the cream holds its shape when the beaters move through it. Instead of using Cool Whip or flavored cream cheese, I added a splash of grenadine to the cream cheese mixture, as well as the whip cream. Later on, I made just the glaze recipe, warmed it up with the remaining berries to top a pound cake. Yummy!

Everyone loved this pie!  I did have  to make a couple changes. I did not have the grenadine so I substituted red wine (sangria - but any would work I've found) and added more sugar (I used half a cup instead of 1/3) and I also put the strawberries in the sauce right before I took it off the heat so that some of the juices were cooked into the sauce. I make this every summer and the requests for the recipe never end.

WOW!!!  This pie was awesome.  I took it to work and shared with co-workers.  It was gone in no time.  I had never heard of grenadine syrup before.  It really added a great taste to the strawberry topping.  I failed to make sure I had all the ingredients before I started.  I didn't have any heavy cream.  I substituted it with about 3/4 of a small container cool whip.  It turned out great.  The other thing I did - I melted some semi-sweet chocolate and brushed it on the pie crust then refrigerated until chocolate was set.  After that I put the cream cheese filling in the pie shell.  (I read about someone doing that in another recipe so I thought it would be a great touch to this pie and it definitely did.)  It kind of gave you the feeling you were eating chocolate dipped strawberries.  I will share this with many and probably be making it soon again.  I wish I could put more than 5 stars because to me it should have 10 stars.  Thank you Julie for sharing.

This pie is fantastic... I didn't make a single change, except that I doubled the recipe for a larger crust. I also made my own grenadine syrup (which is very easy to make... Equal amounts of 100% pomegranate juice and sugar, bring the juice to a boil and add sugar, stir until sugar is completely dissolved and then chill).  In addition, I also put blueberries on the pie with the strawberries and as suggested by someone else, I lined the crust with melted semi-sweet chocolate.  This pie was fantastic, I will definitely make it again and give the recipe to some friends and family.

Good flavour.  Glad I read the reviews.

I used a graham crust, and reduced the whipping cream by about a third.  I also added 1/4C cocoa to the cream cheese mixture, along with a pinch of salt.  I combined strawberries and raspberries for the topping.

The cornstarch mixture really thickens a lot on chilling.  I suggest beating it up with a whisk or spoon before trying to use it.  If I'd added fruit and tried to mix it right away the fruit would have turned to mush from the effort of trying to get the cooled gelled mixture to soften to a usable state.

Fabulous!!! With only one change...used a whole package of cream cheese & 1 cup of confectioners sugar replacer(Ideal brand) And whipped the snot out of my heavy cream before folding in everything else. But will say. I'm going to omit the almond extract next time, it was fine, but rather it didn't over power the other flavors that were trying to come threw. I could see adding strawberry extract in it's place. But My favor part about the whole recipe was making the glaze....it was outstanding. And quick. Very flavorful...no more will I buy what I thought was a decent strawberry glaze from the produced department..now is on my ugh nasty list. It was always ok..BUT this glaze...by far hands down...AWESOME! It totally made the whole pie for us. The pie feed my hubby & 5 kids. Just hmmm! Thank God for premade pie crust. TY Julie, It's going to be a staple for summer desserts.

This was great but I made subtle changes which wouldn't really affect anything.  I didn't have almond extract so I used Amaretto.  Used a 8 oz block of cream cheese because if 3oz is good 5 more ozs would be killer.  I used frozen fresh strawberries from earlier this season.  They are fine, just don't have the crunch that fresh would.
 This is a keeper.

This pie was amazing! I actually made a second one a few days later since I gave all of the first one away. I did read a bunch of the reviews beforehand and made a few changes to the original. Graham cracker crust is definitely the way to go. Sogginess factor aside, it adds a really great flavor that normal pie crust wouldn't.  I also used 8oz. of cream cheese instead of three. It ended up being quite a bit of the cream layer, but it was delicious, so no complaints from me.  I used arrowroot starch instead of cornstarch for the sauce. Cornstarch probably would have worked fine, but if you have arrowroot I would recommend that. Not only is it flavorless, but it thickens quickly and evenly and stayed semi fluid for me, so I didn't have the problem of the cornstarch mixture being too thick after cooling. Arrowroot also has a beautiful shiny, clear appearance that works great with fruit desserts. As for the strawberries, I didn't measure the exact amount I used, but it was probably closer to three cups.  That made my topping more strawberry and less sauce dominant.  I also sliced the strawberries using an egg slicer and threw them into the sauce mixture right after it had thickened.  That way I didn't have to worry about stirring them in later, they cooked a little which softened them, and having them sliced made the pie much easier to cut later since I didn't have to navigate my knife around big chunks of strawberry. Not too difficult to make and delicious. Five stars!

What a wonderful recipe!  I made this for our Easter dinner yesterday and everyone raved about it.  The only changes I would recommend would be to use whipping cream instead of the heavy cream for the filling, as I have a VERY sweet tooth.  But it is tasty as the recipe is also. I used extra water and red food coloring as well as I didn't feel 1/3 cup of grenadine was worth the purchase.  I added a few Tbsp of sugar extra too, since my strawberries were on the sour side. (I wish I had had an excuse to make this in Feb when all of the sweet, Florida strawberries were making their way north versus the hard, unripe, sour California ones I find in my Hershey, Pennsylvania grocery store now!!!)  Hope you enjoy this as much as my guests did!  Thank you for sharing your recipe with everyone!!!!

Fabulous pie!  My 21-year old son said it is the best strawberry he ever tasted.  I used strawberry cream cheese instead of plain and the outcome was almost like a strawberry mousse.  I didn't have any grenadine so I used more water and added red food coloring.  My berries were huge so I cut them into quarters or eighths before mixing them into the thickening.  I also used a graham cracker crust this time but will probably try it with a regular pie crust the next time.  Either way, it was a hit at our house.

I thought the strawberries part was sinfully good, but I take exception to the filling. 3oz cream cheese won't keep whipped cream from melting in the fridge over time (not enough to stabilize it, use 8 oz and up the sugar to taste); and use your beaters to WHIP the cream cheese into the whipped cream. It won't take more than about 15 seconds to accomplish, and if just fold it in as the recipe states, you can stir til you turn blue in the face & still have cheese chunk areas. Tasty areas, but the unflavored whipped cream is not so good if the cheese is left in chunks, bleh. I WILL make this again, but I'll omit the whipping cream entirely and just put a layer of sugared cream cheese (with this recipe's extracts, because I really liked the addition of almond). Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Mmmmm...very good!  I like that this pie doesn't use gelatin (as I'm a vegetarian).  I used 8 oz. cream cheese but found that was too much.  I'd go with 5 oz.  Also, the whipped cream didn't really "fold into" the cream cheese.  Next time, I'm not going to whip the cream cheese - just cream it with 1/2 and 1/2.  I'm not a huge almond extract fan, so next time I'll cut it to 1/4 teaspoon.  I'll also decrease the lemon juice to 1 tablespoon - I thought it made the strawberries too lemony.

I made a version of this pie for a garden party today, and I brought home a clean plate! Here were my tweaks: like many others, I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and a full teaspoon of vanilla (omitting the almond extract). I also swapped out 2/3 cup pomegranate juice for the water and grenadine, and for a fresh twist, I infused the glaze with a bundle of thyme as it was cooking. Finally, I used TWICE as many strawberries--four cups--and there was still plenty of glaze to cover them! I will post a pic. --Gina (http:lindseysluscious.blogspot.com)

This was Yumazing! I used a graham cracker crust, an 8oz. pkg. of Cream Cheese and doubled up the vanilla. We will definately be making this one over and over. If you have access to a Strawberry Farm and can pick your own, they make it all the more sweeter, as well.

I made a shortbread crust for this pie, then brushed it with white chocolate which I then cooled.  For the filling I used 8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup regular sugar.  For the sauce/topping, instead of grenadine, i used a red juice i had (happened to be raspberry), added 1 cup fresh strawberry puree, and 1 additional tablespoon cornstarch.  This made it even more amazing.  Next time I might even add a tsp of plain gelatin to get the sauce/topping to be a little more stable.  
EXCELLENT pie

This is pure perfection.  I love this dessert as is, it is very refreshing light and ever so tasty.  I have made it with grenadine and it is just fine but I prefer it with strawberry liqueur (Fragoli).

Very nice, and so much better with the grenadine than the jello (I tried it both ways).  Probably my new favorite way to enjoy strawberries!

Very good and refreshing pie!  As others suggested, double the cream cheese, use low fat Greek yogurt instead of  heavy whipping cream, and no grenadine.  Added extra water, lemon, a few smashed strawberries, and a tablespoon of any red jelly to add extra sweetener and color to the cornstarch mixture.  Drizzle melted chocolate morsels on the bottom crust and put the crust in the fridge to set the chocolate -- this was good and also prevents the crust from getting soggy !

Julie, thank you for a wonderful recipe.  It is my family's favorite strawberry pie.  I too did not have grenadine - so added a couple tablespoons of dry strawberry jello.

Very good!  Everyone in my family loved it!  Just a tip:  I washed my strawberries right before stirring in and didn't allow them to dry completely; the extra water made the sauce too runny... so make sure your berries are really dry before adding in :)

I made this recipe for a group of friends and they loved it. My husband ate two pieces :}. I had read several of the reviews and made quite a few changes. I didn't have grenadine, so I use 1/3 cup more water and 2 tblsp. of strawberry jello. I also didn't use the whipping cream, used light cool whip. I also used the lighter version of cream cheese. Then I used a graham cracker crust and melted 1/4 cup chocolate chips and spread it on the crust before I added the cream cheese filling. It was a hit.

This pie is amazing.  I used strawberry cream cheese instead of plain, that was the only change I made.  For those of you who didn't use the grenadine syrup, go back and try it again with it!  It makes such a difference.  No one can figure out why the strawberries are so good!

Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I didn't like the top tier to this pie.  The texture was not what I was hoping for.  I will keep looking for a better homemade glaze to use as a topper to this otherwise tasty pie.  And can't imagine it with anything but a graham cracker crust.

I made two of these pies for a graduation party.  They were a hit.  All I brought home were the two empty pie pans.  I had no grenadine on hand and ultimately used 1/3 cup of merlot  in its place.  Additional water made up the balance.  The end result was very good.  I highly recommend this recipe and will certainly use it again in the near future.

I began making this pie last summer for a few picnics I went to and now people ask me to make this all the time. I love it. A friend who doesn't even like cream cheese devours this pie.

This pie was pretty tasty. I did a couple of things different. I used a grahm cracker crust, and I used the whole 8 oz of cream cheese. The cream chhese filling came out really delicous! The only complaint I had with this recipe was the topping. I thought it was way too sweet, and when I added my strawberries to my cooled topping, it became too runny. If I make this again, I'll probably use strawberry jelatin mixed with my strawberries and call it a day!

Very good but my glaze kinda turned into more of a solid...maybe I did something wrong or let it cool too long. I will make this again but I will go the easy route and use Cool Whip and a store bought strawberry glaze, call me lazy :)

Mine was tasty, but the cream cheese layer was very runny.  Next time I'll use more cream cheese.  I also had more than enough of the goo for the strawberries.

This was really good.  I did a search for a pie using cream cheese and strawberries and this was the best one that came up.  I was a bit iffy about the grenadine, but once the whole pie was done, you couldn't even taste the sickly sweet cherry grenadine flavor.  Its more lends to making the strawberry layer thicker.  I didn't have a pie crust, so I layered multiple sheets of phyllo dough in a tart pan and pre=baked them to create a nice shell for the filling.  We finished the whole thing in two days.

I get compliments every time I make this - with one small adjustment (I use 8 oz of cream cheese).  Everytime my husband has a pot luck at work, the employees request that I make this pie.  Of course, when I make two for him, I have to make two for my office as well.  There is never any left over and people are sad when they miss it!  Thank you so much!!!!

Awesome strawberry pie!  I've made it several times now and everyone loves it!  I do make one change however.  I use about twice the cream cheese called for and half the whipped topping...I think this makes it better.

I didnt have much time, so I used canned strawberry pie filling and whipped up the cream cheese filling for the bottom. I have used Phyllo dough for crusts as well as freezer crusts in a pinch as well, overall using those time cutting methods this is a super fast recipe.

This was "okay", but I'm not gonna make again.  The grenadine was too much for me & overtook the whole flavor.  Not good as a leftover, it separated & the strawberries looked mushy.  I liked the idea of this, but did not care for the result.

My in law family just loved this pie, I added brushed melted chocolate to the bottom crust like someone suggested.  I didn't like the way it set up, it seemed to soft, but it didn't run at least.  Next time I will forget the chocolate (I never liked chocolate covered strawberries so I don't know why I would like it in a pie, but I tried)  I give it 3 stars for the family

This was my first attempt at making a fruit pie.Thinking we'd make a day of it, we headed to a u-pick it strawberry farm only to find that they only had Olallieberries available. We made a game time decision to go with it and I'm so glad we did. The slight tartness of the olallieberries cut the sweetness of other elements of the pie. I really liked the homemade "syrup" for glazing the berries as opposed to other recipes which call for jello. The glaze was gorgeous on the berries and flavor was just right.

The cream and cheese layer was really really nice. In fact, I might make that combo again to serve with fresh berries. It was light and yet had substance against the berries without being overly sweet.

I also out a graham cracker crust for the traditional. Not only was this a supremely delicious pie, it was really stunning. My friend and I agreed that this would be an impressive dessert to bring to a dinner party or to a new neighbor.

In terms of execution of the recipe, there about 4 major steps or segments of combining ingredients and letting things cool. This definitely took a while 3-1/2 hours or so but it wasn't difficult baking. I don't think you need any special skills. We had a 4 year old helping us and the ingredient combos didn't involve any risky ingredients so she was able to taste test, learn and help right with us.

I highly recommend this recipe when you have the time.

The cream cheese layer was fantastic!  The almond extract gave it great flavor.  However, the glaze for the strawberries was way to sweet.  I just made it without and it was really good.  I used a Nilla Wafer pie crust which worked really well with it.

I thought this was really good - however, maybe I did something wrong, but the cream cheese whipped cream mixture was not dense enough to support the berries. I think I will reverse the order next time, and put the berries in the base and top with the cream. The taste was excellent!

OH SO GOOD! I don't usually modify recipes but made this as an afterthought, so I used 4oz cream cheese, an extra drop or two of both extracts, and two ladles of cool whip instead of cream (we're moving, measuring cups are packed ;))I also used a cinnamon graham cracker crust. The filling held up just fine overnight. I didn't have grenadine and follwed another reviewers suggestion of water and food coloring. Beautiful and delicious, this will definitely become a staple in our house!

This was a yummy combination but I had to improvise.  I used a premade sponge cake shell because I had it handy.  I also didn't have any heavy cream so I folded in approx. 2 cups of Ready Whip and used lowfat cream cheese!  I would definately make it again!

This pie is fantastic.  My husband declared it the best pie he's ever eaten.  Like others I used a gram cracker crust and slightly more cream cheese.  I happened to have grenadine which added a nice twist.

I added my strawberries as soon as the grenadine mixture was cooled, instead of just before serving as instructed. It made the mixture runny. I'll pay better attention to the steps next time. Bright red and pretty to serve. I too used graham wafer crust. Im so envious of US bakers with strawberry flavoured Cool Whip! We dont have that here in Canada.

This turned out very nicely.  I used a graham cracker crust, but otherwise made it according to the recipe.  My pie pan was a little shallow, I think a deeper one would better suit this pie next time, but it still looked and tasted great.  It was eaten in one sitting (with company).  It was a little more work than an ordinary strawberry pie but it was worth it.

WOW!  This pie was fanastic.  I made it for guests (without any changes to original recipe) and they absolutely loved it.  Just make sure you plan on finishing within the same day.  We had a couple slices left over that weren't as pretty the next morning.

Made this in two days (refrigerated separately overnight...i was tired and I started it late).  Got absolutely rave reviews last night at a family dinner party.  Very pretty!  Extremely simple.  Used strawberry flavored cream cheese as suggested by another happy customer.  Am making again this evening as requested by my significant other.  Thanks so much!

This was my first attempt at pie. Got a crust recipe off another site, and watched a lady named Hilah on Youtube making one. Pie turned out excellent! Wife and kids loved it. I made some more whipped cream to put on top. You can never have too much whipped cream!

Super easy to make, love it and my family (who is picky) also loved it. My dad HATES cheese cake and he went up for seconds. I also used a full 8oz cream cheese, which is 250 g.

This is delicious & was nary a crumb leftover even after doubling recipe.  I did not have grenadine so substituted marachino cherry juice.

I was looking for a strawberry pie recipe that used cream cheese filling underneath and THIS IS IT!  I will definately use it again, and will most likely use blue berries mixed in at some point. It is a sweet, satisfying berry pie!

Very easy & delicious recipe, with some of the suggested modifications. I didn't have grenadine or cream, so I replaced cream with 3/4 container of light cool whip and used an extra 1/3 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of strawberry jello in the topping. Boiling the jello topping for 5 minutes, then chilling for 1/2 hour made it a little too hard set to mix in the strawberries - so I microwaved it for 30 seconds and it worked perfectly! Probably will mix in the strawberries right away next time I make this, which will be soon!

I doubled the filling, used a full block of cream cheese, and used 4 tbsp of strawberry jello mix instead of the grenadine.  It firmed up quickly.  I actually had to use 4X as many berries to fill my 2 pies and 6 tarts.

I used less cream and more cream cheese due to what I had on hand. I used a cookie type crust and it worked well. Held together better then the other three strawberry pies I made this week. Two cups of fruit is not near enough, four cups would be better! Thanks for the great recipe Julie! I will be making this one again

soooooooo good!  Next time I probably will not use as much of the strawberry glaze & maybe add additional fresh strawberries on top of the glazed part (it was really sweet!).  I also used the whole 8 oz. block of cream cheese, like others did.  The cheese part with a graham cracker crust would be soooo good with fresh blueberries (or any berry, for that matter) on it--I may have to try it that way next time.  Anyways, it was DELICIOUS!!!  Thanks!

I was looking for something that was like cheesecake without having to make a cheesecake.  I just didn't have time to get it done.  This was perfect.  The longet part of the prep was the time it took me to cut up the strawberries.  I made the first layer the night before as well as the cornstarch/grenadine mixutre.  I chilled them both overnight and then mixed the strawberries and grenadine together in the morning topped the pie with them.  I brought it to work for a coworkers birthday and it was a hit.  Everyone really enjoyed it! I also used a graham cracker crust and would do so again!

Amazing! Everyone loved this pie. It was even good the second day, unlike others have said on here.  I used homemade traditional pie crust.  I did use 8 oz of cream cheese as some people had suggested.  It is great the way it is but I think next time I make it I am going skip making the "gelatin" sauce.  Instead I will half or quarter 2 lbs. of strawberries and mix with approx. 1/8 c. sugar and approx. 1-2 Tbs of balsimic vinegar.  Let them sit for a few hours (this gives them a sweet but slightly tangy taste) then spoon on top of the cream cheese mixture.  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

I used a shortbread crust and doubled the glaze, I could have tripled it even!  I did use strawberry jello instead of grenadine and it tasted just fine.  This pie is so yummy, light and fluffy and not too rich.

Have made this recipe twice now and it have yet to have any left after about 10 mins.  Even after having 2 pies ready to go the last time.  The only change i made was to cut back grenadine as the flavor was a touch much for my taste the first time. Thank you for a great pie will make this again and again.

this is great, i did use a whole 8oz brick of cream cheese and doubled the sugar. Used 3/4 of a small cool whip. It was wonderful! I thought I wouldn't have enough room on top for the strawberries but it worked out fine. I also cheated and used some store bought glaze and it tasted great. One last thing: if you want it to taste like a PIE use pie crust. A graham cracker crust tastes good too but then it is basically a no bake cheesecake. This is just like what I had at Bob Evans last week and I was trying to duplicate it so thank you!!!

Great Pie!  Since I love cream cheese, I increased the amount to 6oz.  And I didn't have any grenadine, I added half of a small box of strawberry jello.  I served it at a summer cookout and took one to our neighbors and everyone wanted the recipe.

Imake a pie very similar but instead of the syrup on top I place the strawberries over the cream cheese mixture then melt 1/2 c choc chips with 2 T shortening then dizzle over the strawberries.  It combines the choc dipped strawberries with the strawberry pie.

This was an very easy recipe - but I do recommend eating it fairly soon after making it.  The crust gets soggy over night and the filling won't keep its shape.  Its still very good - just not as pretty.

This is a fun, easy pie to make.  My 2-year-old daughter sat on the counter and helped me pour and mix the ingredients.  I was a little put off at first by the color and consistency of the glaze as it sat cooling in the pan.  I started the pie the day before by making the separate parts and refrigerating them overnight and actually considered scrapping it because it didn't look right to me.  But once I mixed the glaze with the strawberries and pulled the whole pie together, it looked very pretty - and tasted delicious!  I used non-fat cream cheese because that's what I had on hand and it turned out fine.  I also used a store-bought frozen pie crust, but next time I think I'll make my own crust so I have more control over the consistency.  This was the perfect finish for our Easter dinner this year!

This pie was easy to make and had a delicious flavor.  My only complaint is that is the cream filling was too runny.  Perhaps I didn't whip the cream enough.  Next time I will use Cool Whip, as suggested by other reviewers, and use a graham cracker crust.  But I agree it is a good base recipe.

I was having some problems with my computer, so my last review of this recipe was just a test to see if it would go thru. Now I can actually review the pie. I'm glad I read all of the reviews because had I not, I don't think I would have been happy with the result. I too used strawberry cream cheese and then took it a step further and instead of whipped cream, I decided to sub strawberry Cool Whip. The filling was sensational, however, I'll without a doubt use a graham cracker or Oreo crust next time. The pie crust got soggy and the flavor certainly did not engage. Julie, I still thank you for a GREAT start!!!!

I have made this several times. I use a full 8 ounce package of cream cheese. I use Amaretto instead of Almond juice. I make it for nearly all events and, always have requests for more.

I just made this wonderful pie.  I did follow some others advice and made a few changes.  I used 6 oz of cream cheese to make more of a cheesecakey texture.  I was short on time so I made a graham cracker crust but didn't bake it.  I also didn't use grenadine and used about 2 Tbsp of dry strawberry jello mix.  The scent and color were spectacular!  What a hit this pie was.  My husband was so excited to try it and he now wants me to make the same pie but use bananas instead of strawberries.  I will use banana pudding mix instead of strawberry and will line the bottom with banana slices along with maybe mixing in 1/2 cup mashed banana into the filling.  Of course, I will use mashed banana in the topping.  Sounds good already!  This was a great recipe.  Even better the second day after sitting in the fridge and firming up.

This is my go to Strawberry pie- I found this recipe on All recipes over 10 yrs ago and have made it ever since. I’m asked to bring it to all the summer events. Definitely best same day, will get mushy if it sits over 24 hrs, but my family takes that challenge on eating leftovers for breakfast. I have modified the amount of strawberries I’ve used, I’ve switched up the type of berries, added peaches, but my favorite is always the original.

Loved this dessert as well as everyone else at our dinner party.  I only added the extra cream cheese as recommended by others.  I waited to top with strawberries until ready to serve.  Soooooo good!  Will make this again; great summer dessert.

Perfection. Very good way to use strawberries. Anyone that loves strawberry cheesecake will enjoy this. It’s like a cross between strawberry cream pie and cheesecake. I am so happy to have found this recipe especially for the jelly part. I hate buying those bags of strawberry jelly pie filling. This seems better for us because there are no preservatives when you make it yourself. :)

Awesome pie!  I've been making this cream cheese/whipped cream filling for many years but somehow never thought of putting fresh strawberries on it.  DUH!  I usually just use canned cherry or blueberry pie filling on top but the strawberries are better.  I cream my softened cream cheese until there is no lumps then add powdered sugar little at a time (1/3 cup at a time) and add about 1 tsp. lemon juice and vanilla extract to taste adding sugar until it's to our taste.  I also didn't have any grenadine syrup so I took the advice of another reviewer and added a couple of Tbs. of strawberry jello and a little bit more water to my gel.  Gave my gel an awesome taste.  I added my sliced strawberries (sliced with my egg slicer) after my gel cooled to room temperature then chilled pie in fridge before serving.  Oh yeah, and I love the pie shell better then the graham cracker or cookie crusts but that's just my personal choice.  This pie will forever be equal to my favorite pie (chocolate meringue) from now on.  Thanks for sharing, you can bet I'll be making this pie often from now on.  Love it!

This was amazing! I made it for a BBQ w neighbors and got rave reviews. The only problem that I had was my glaze didn't quite get solid enough but it was still ok and very yummy! I did take the advice of other reviews and use 8 oz of cream cheese which made the cream amazing!!! I also added my strawberries when the glaze was still a little warm so that the flavor could cook into them slightly. Really good!!! Will make again!!

needed some minor changes. I didn't let the sauce thicken up enough. I also used to much whip cream and over filled the pie but that's on me. the grenadine taste great with the pie but the mixture by itself taste strange. I might go for a different strawberry flavor next time. I did the same recipe using pineapples and it looks better and maybe taste better. can't wait to make more pies for my friends. this is a keeper.

I made the recipe as stated. But I really didn't care for the sauce, it was just a little lackluster and flavorless.  So I ditched it and just whipped up a batch of Danish Dessert gelatin real quick.  I definitely preferred that flavor.  With that improvement I'd give it 5 stars.

I've made this a few times and have found I like it better with modifications, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  The filling needs way more than 3 ounces of cream cheese if you actually want it to taste like it has cream cheese in it, and helps to fill the crust.  Use a whole 8 ounce brick.  Do not think it's necessary to whip your own heavy cream - much easier to just beat in 8 oz of cool whip.  Do not know where to buy grenadine syrup - used reviewers' suggestions to use water and strawberry jello powder, but do not do this.  It gels to a jello consistency, and then it's impossible to mix in the strawberries when it's time.  Now, I use a different recipe for a strawberry or cherry glaze.

I made this pie exactly as the recipe reads.  I bought grenadine because I didn't have any.  I won't make this pie again but if I did, I wouldn't use it (grenadine).  Check out the ingredients.  It is mostly preservatives.  I suggest using strawberry jello as others have used.  The pie was good but there are much better recipes out there.  It was a 3 out of 5 for me.

A big hit!  Made for 3 different occasions in last week.  After first pie, I made two at a time since pie shells come in 2pack.   I double recipe and actually use the whole 8 oz cream cheese bar.  Doubling works just fine.  Chose to top with just the fresh strawberries.  Have made with low fat cream cheese and regular.  Thanks so much!

I doubled the powdered sugar and cream cheese (assuming that the "package" really meant 8 oz), and kept the amounts of the rest of the filling the same in order to fill a deep-dish pie crust. My family fought over who got to lick the beater and bowl.

I didn't bother to wait until just before serving to add the strawberries, and I also drizzled some melted chocolate chips over the top.  Very good pie!
