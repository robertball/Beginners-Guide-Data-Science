Followed the directions mostly as instructed, except I did not have half and half so I used light cream. I also only had dry linguine, so I parboiled it for 5 minutes, then added it to the recipe to finish cooking. Overall it was good, though it is not a great dish to reheat. Best eaten fresh.

I loved this recipe!  Full of flavor, simple to make - the most difficult thing is making sure you pick up everything you need from the store.  I did not change anything, used the ingredients and quantities as instructed.

This was quite tasty. I used the spinach and chive pasta from Trader Joe's so it was not fresh pasta, probably should have cut the liquid back a bit. But I turned up the heat and cooked some of it off. It was quite tasty will make it again.
