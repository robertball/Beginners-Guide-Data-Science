12.18.18  Very, VERY interesting flavor for an omelet  Was curious about whether it would be too sweet, and the eggnog flavor is right up front, but we really enjoyed this.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to skip the pepper, simply not a good partner to the eggnog.  A sprinkle of powdered sugar or a grind of fresh nutmeg on top might be good additions.  It did take closer to 10 minutes to cook this, but thatâ€™s still not a whole lot of time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
