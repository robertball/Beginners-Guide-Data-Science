I loved this.  I made two small changed, though I would have given it a "5" rating even without the changes.  First, I omitted the bacon, as I follow a pescetarian diet.   I also added mixed, sliced mushrooms (cremini, shittake, oyster, portabello) during the step where you add the celery, then cooked for 5 minutes before the next step.  I love mushrooms, as they help to add earthiness when you have to omit meat from a recipe.   ***Advice to those wondering about reheating:  this worked AMAZING for me, as  I was cooking it only for myself and knew I'd be eating it over several days: Make the chowder, but stop right before adding the scallops.  Portion out the amount you aren't eating that day, Cool and refrigerate. Finish the recipe for the part you want to eat right then. When you want to eat the remainder of the chowder, heat the scallop-less chowder on the stovetop. When it starts to simmer, add your scallops, cook for 2 minutes, and done! Finish off with your lemon zest and tarragon.  It actually tasted better in subsequent days, as most soups do.

This was delicious! It has a pretty good "kick" with the red Fresno pepper, so if a little heat is a problem, use only half of the pepper.  The red flecks are really pretty, though, so don't cut back too much. I like a little heat, and my DH loves heat, so we are happy. I just keep cooling milk handy...Oh--do take some of the potatoes and mash them, as Chef John suggests. It makes the soup much creamier--the way we New Englanders like it.

Followed recipe as written and shown - except there were no bay scallops at the store!  So I substituted the large ones and cut them into small pieces.  I think I loved this more than my husband but he really liked it too.  I didn't like the taste of tarragon - it was my 1st experience with this herb and it has a licorice flavor which I wasn't fond of and don't feel it enhanced the chowder.  I think I will use fresh thyme the next time - which I keep in the frig.  I also used a cherry red pepper - about 3/4 of it and the heat was just fine.  Thank you for a great recipe - I will make again soon - only with the cheaper bay scallops!

Fantastic as usual Chef John. I made it with 2 cups of  canned clams instead of scallops and 1/2 tsp black pepper.

I made this chowder to the letter, EXCEPT I doubled the bacon (cuz who doesn't want more bacon?) and since I couldn't find a Fresno pepper, I used a hot chili pepper.   I took Chef John's advice and mashed the potatoes once they were soft enough.  I have NO IDEA why he thinks it doesn't look good?!?  It looks fantastic and tastes even better!  I will definitely make this again and again.  My only question now is how do I reheat it without overcooking the scallops?

I was looking for a five star clam chowder recipe so I thought I'd sub some delicious clams, fresh from the sound. I made it exactly as Chef John prescribed until I got to the end and tasted it. I thought it had no counterpoint to the heat so I put in one teaspoon of sugar. It was outstanding, colorful and plentiful. I served it with homemade beer bread and got rave reviews. Thanks, Chef.

I used 8 oz of bacon.  I would recommend omitting the oil if you do.  There was a lot of extra oil that wasn’t needed.  I also used seafood stock instead of chicken broth.  Other than that, it was amazing.

I liked the flavor of this and it was really easy a quick to make. The soup/broth looked a little strange almost a buttery appearance of oil/water trying to separate. But the flavor made it well worth to try again. I may modify to some creamier chowder ingredients.

Stuck to the recipe, except for the chili pepper, didn't have it on hand.  So I just added more cayenne pepper for the heat.  I love bacon and garlic so of course I had to add a little extra of each.  My daughter gave it a 5, but I say a 4.  Let me explain. I felt that the scollops didn't pick up the flavors enough so I had to cook much longer, luckily they didn't get overcooked.  At the end I had to add more seasoning than called for, but in the end it did taste good!

Amazing!!! I was looking for a "brothier" clam chowder recipe to use for horseneck clams and this was beyond delicious!  The tarragon was a very nice addition.

It was ok. I will try it again, but won’t include the lemon or only a very small amount.  It was too predominant.

It’s Amazing! Made as directed except used only a minuscule amount of cayenne and omitted the red chili pepper. I’m sensitive to spicy food. Served with some crusty bread.  Next time I will add lobster, crab and shrimp.  

As a side note; I typically believe recipes are only general guidelines/suggestions and change them to suit my tastes. I have made quite a few of Chef John’s recipes and rarely change them. Love his recipes!

Delicious! I'll make it again. The tarragon and lemon zest add a unique touch. I added paprika which made the color of the chowder a bit rosier. My elderly dad, for whom I made it and who loves clam chowder type dishes, scallops, and seafood in general, loved it! Thanks.

This was rated a “Holy sh*t, this is one of the best soups I’ve ever had!” from my husband.  Did this cost $40 for one pot of soup?  Sure.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely.  I was a little surprised at just how much heat the Fresno peppers added, and my youngest kid found it just a little too spicy.  Next time (there will be a next time) I’ll just swap out a regular red pepper for his batch.  Thanks Chef John!

Perfect recipe.  Don't leave out the tarragon, it brought all the flavors together.  I used dried.   If you want, you can thicken it a bit by adding one or two tsps. of cornstarch.

Chef John never disappoints! Very delicious. It’s not thick like I think of when I think of a chowder, but that doesn’t take away from the amazing flavors. Loved by my significant other as well. A keeper for sure!

I made just as recipe indicates, except I doubled the chicken broth, because I didn’t have the clam juice on hand. Next time, I’ll get the clam juice, and mash the potatoes a bit.  Still delicious as made!

This is a great chowder recipe. I did not use bacon due to this being a Lenten meal for us. I also left out the diced pepper. I think a little heat would be nice here though. Definitely use the suggestion to mash some of the potatoes. I like my chowders thick so I added a little extra cream. It came together well and the times were accurate.

Excellent recipe! I substituted fresh thyme for the tarragon and perhaps put in a bit too much lemon zest. Next time I will limit it to no more than 1 tsp. Also added a full cup of heavy whipping cream and honestly without it I don't think there would be enough liquid.

Perfect chowder.  Will have this on the Christmas menu for sure.  If you want to take a little of the heat out of your peppers, clean and soak in 7-Up (not diet) for about 45 min.  The longer you soak the more the heat is removed.  This process maxes out after about 2 hrs.  A word to the wise, don't drink the 7-Up afterward.  ha ha
