The cream cheese mixture was delicious, and I think this recipe would have been fine with some other more crab friendly sauce other than the chili it calls for. The chili was too overwhelming for the delecate crab taste. needs work.

I have this 4 stars only because I didn't make it exactly as suggested.
I used spicy cocktail sauce and a mix of imitation crab and shrimp and a handful of finely chopped green and red pepper for added crunch and flavor, put a large shrimp in the middle for decoration. served with crackers- everyone loved it- the plate was scraped!

I don't know exactly what the "chili" sauce is supposed to be.  I use Salsa...same thing?

Instead of chili sauce (which is really just spicy ketchup) I used cocktail sauce.  I also prefer the "tamer" taste of imitation crab.  This is always a hit.

I added less mayo and cream cheese to it because I like it less creamy
