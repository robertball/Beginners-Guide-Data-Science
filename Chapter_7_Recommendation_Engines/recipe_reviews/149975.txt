Why boil out the flavor?  Try this, low and slow on the grill (I prefer charcoal or wood chunks), indirect heat is best for about 30-45 minutes.  While the brats are cooking take 3-4 cans of beer and 1/2 to 1 stick of butter, thin sliced onion, salt, pepper and other seasonings to taste.  Heat on the grill in foil pan.  More or less beer depending on pan size, # of brats and thurst of the cook!  Put brats in beer sauce and let simmer. Brats will stay juicy and flavorful for 2-3 hours.  great for picnics, ball games, camping, etc...

I made this as a try out run to see if I'd want to serve it for guests this weekend.  I halved the recipe since it was for just 3 of us.  It was all gone and I only had one.  I could have eaten at least 3 easily and that says a lot!   Great recipe!  I followed the recipe and did not change a thing.  The spiciness was very good.  I may take it up a notch when I serve it to my guests who happen to like spicy food.  Just an f.y.i. though... without the sauce it isn't very hot for those who may not like heat.  Thank you Zach!

I used this recipe to feed a very large group of patrons at my husbands bar/resturant for super bowl Sunday and let me tell you, Holy Cow. I prepared a total of 100 brats, following this recipe. They were the most delicious brats we have ever served!! This is the first year I have made them for our party, (6th year in a row, always doing brats for super bowl) and everyone RAVED! I was so happy and my husband so proud! I will nover make brats any other way!

Perfect!  We pricked the brats a bunch of times with a fork to allow the beer and seasoning to really soak in.  And instead of hovering over a hot stove, we let them simmer in the crockpot for a few hours.  PERFECT with sauerkraut, the beer-y onions grilled, dijon mustard, and a hit of hot sauce.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

I have used this for small and large parties.  It has also become the recipie for my son's Boy Scoup Troop's court of honor.  I just cooked 72 brats for the troop and they turned out great.  Only difference is I add all ingredients to the pot with the brats and let them soak for 24 hours.  I use the cheapest drinkable beer I can find.  I have used Guiness and Killians Red and you could not taste much difference from the Miller High Life.

Just to clarify..you don't want to BOIL your brats, because you'll wind up with flavorless , tough brats.  You want to PAR-boil your brats and just finish them off on the grill to get a nice crisp brat with beautiful grill marks.  I have been preparing brats this way for many years with awesome results..and the beer-braised onions are perfection!  And I only use Johnsonville brats, they are the BEST.  And I consider myself a pretty good judge of brats..I'm German..who would know better? LOL

I am brat lover...grew up eating them.  In my opinion the best way to preserve the flavor is NOT to par boil them. Grill slowly and then place in beer mixture and soak slowly on low heat as long as you have. Par boiling only takes what flavor and moisture that the fat provides out.

This was good, but the beer flavor was not quite as strong as I'd hoped. Next time, I will try a stronger beer, like Guiness, and cook it on the stove for a longer time to really give it time to simmer and for the flavors to soak in. I pricked the brats all over with a fork to allow the beer to get in there. Some of it could be the beer... all I had was Beck's, which is pretty light. Great idea, though, I will keep tweaking to get more beer flavor. I used a couple cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.

We loved these.  Bought store brand brats, boiled in beer and grilled until nice, dark grill marks appeared.  Served with corn on the cob.  Perfect summer meal!

Great basic recipe. I learned some tricks from Packer tailgaters. First blanch the brats in ice water for about 15 minutes before putting in the previously heated slow cooker mix. I also add 1/2 stick of butter to the recipe. Cook for 2hrs on high, then shift to low. Grill and then return to cooker til ready to serve. Comes out great and is convenient to hold til guests are ready to eat.

Great & simple! Used two cans of fosters. Subed chili powder for the flakes and it worked just perfectly. The outside was crisp from the grill and the inside was nice and juicey. I'll definitely be using this one again.

Simple recipe with great results.  They will melt in your mouth!  I like mine with the beer boiled onions, some sauerkraut, and some spicy deli mustard.  I'm getting ready to make this again tonight.  Even my wife loves them.  Cheers Zach.  Thanks for sharing.

Good but we could not really tell a difference from how I usually make mine which is boiling them in beer before transfering them to the grill.  Still good though.

Okay, first of all way too much beer.  You need to do this in 9x13 baking dish with the onions at the bottom, the brats over the top and about a can to can and a half of beer (you drink the other half and the other two you wasted boiling the brats) and then covered with foil.  You cook until the brats are gray on the outside and then grill them.  This way lthe flavor you were putting into the beer goes into the onions.  And what's up with turning the brats only once?  Really?

I also fed this to big groups. I would boil the day before and put the whole pot in the fridge and grill the next day.  They are delicious!!

Thought this was really good. Only changes I made were using 22oz of beer instead of 4 cans, and only a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes. Once the brats were cooked in the beer and place on the grill, I reduced the beer completely and carmelized the onions. Super good!

Being from Wisconsin, I've used this recipe (or one very similar) for 45 years. The only way to provide perfectly browned and juicy brats for your guests. I only simmer them for ~ 20 minutes-just enough to get rid of the excess grease. This prevents not only splitting (poor presentation), but also severe mouth trauma from squirting juices on those first, dangerous bites! Grill on low or to the side with charcoal, and saute the onions for use in the bun!

I used Yuengling Black & Tan and an extra onion. I also pan fried them instead of grilling them because I don't have a grill! They turned out delicious.

Awesome, tasty and sure to pack in in the raves!
I only use the freshest bratwurst and I simmer everything but the brats on the lowest setting for at least and hour before adding the bratwurst. Then I continue to simmer for at least two hours before putting them on a sizzling grill. Rave reviews from people who don't even like bratwurst! Great beer flavor, moist, tender and if you're lucky enough to have a few left over, they're double good the next day nukes for a few seconds in the microwave:-) 
Kudos on this recipe!!!!!!

THIS is how brats should be done!  So simple yet so perfect!  Didn't change a thing about this recipe, the kicked-up onions were absolutely delicious, and the brats grilled up fat & juicy & packed with flavor.  We don't have an outdoor grill (city dwellers) so I grilled these on my cast iron stove-top griddle/grill & it worked great.  We love brats & these are the best BY FAR!  Thank you SO  much for sharing this awesome recipe!  :)

I've made this several times and love it.  It is the only way I'll make brats now.  If I have time, I'll let them soak overnight or at least a couple of hours.  I don't bring them to a boil just a small simmer so that it doesn't take them as long to grill.  I poke some holes in the brats so they really soak up the flavor.  Yum!

I took my inspiration from this recipe & combined it in my slowcooker. I used some great garlic brats from our local butcher & combined them with lots of chopped garlic, two bottles of ale, and sliced onion. I cooked them for about 5 hours and served them with sauted cabbage & carrot & mashed ptatoes. They turned out so tender and the ale really added lots of flavor. Everyone really enjoyed this dish!

This is one of our favorite ways to make brats--although we usually only use one beer and add water--we also use a foil pan to cook them in a foil pan as having it a little more shallow allows the onions to carmelize a bit more, and also the foil makes for quick clean up.  We've never noticed a change in the flavor with more or less beer in the mix--and that way there are more beers to drink. ;o)  My favorite part about this is that you don't end up with over done/burned brats.

I recommend using a hoppy beer for this (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale works well, as do any IPA's) and, if serving on buns, mixing ketchup and curry powder for the sauce.

This was extremely easy to make, and adds a LOT of flavor to the onions! The first time I made it I used a dark stout beer and the taste was too strong for the onions. The second time I used a Heffeweisen and it turned out great. That is the the beer we will be using from now on. Thanks!

i agree with the people that don't boil the brats first.  boil out all the fat if you wish but lose the fat that creates the juicy fun filled flavor.  i also don't add any other spices or anything, they already have enough seasonings.  grill them, simmer them with onions (not boil) put on the buns top with sauerkraut if you wish and enjoy.  i'm from wisconsin, this is how most of us roll with them.  i gave the low rating because of the added spices.

Sounds good.  However, one may not want to add salt because of the salt content of the brats.

Yummy!  We like it spicy and it is spicy!  The perfect way to prepare brats, although I did not try the beer mixture as a topping. Get a good bun that will hold up to this manly feast.  Sauerkraut, raw or grilled onions, grilled peppers and a variety of mustards complete this dog.

Excellent! I made brats and italians and they were both amazing! I also made burgers on the grill and then put them in the beer mixture too and they were so moist and delicous! I had a party so mixed the brats, italians and burgers in the beer sauce in a nesco cooker and it worked great!

Good! I did not prick mine and they did not burst.  Put them on the grill for just enough time to brown and crisp up a bit.  They were juicy and tasty with onion mixture on top as condiment.

Excellent!!  I used 3 bottles of beer for the 10 brats, 2 large onions sliced in rings, and 1 sliced bell pepper.  Like others, I love it that you can cook the brats in the beer ahead of time.  Then just heat them on the grill when you're ready to eat.  I also cooked the onion/pepper mixture down and let them caramelize.  Everyone raved about them.

Love them but I made some changes:  i only used 2 bottles of beer with 10 brats and I used 2 large onions sliced in rings.  I boiled them uncovered until the beer was gone and all that remained were the brats and fully cooked onions that were starting to carmelize.  I moved the brats to the grill and browned them up....then topped them with the carmelized onions.  Great reviews from my guests!

I will try this again using only one beer because the seasonings were just too diluted.  I also will probably use 3 onions cut into half rings to have plenty to put on the sandwich; I will sweat the onions in a little butter before adding the remaining ingredients.

I had not made brats before. I like Italian sausage. after consulting advice on the buzz I chose this method as well as "just grill" the dang things. it was a split decision. wife like her's no boil, no poke just grill... better. I like these more. I gave a poke and followed directions. tasted candied to me as well. very nice.

I'm not a fan of beer or brats but holy smokes these are super good. Used two 25 oz cans of the cheapest beer I could find, two onions and sliced 5 garlic cloves in place of the garlic powder. Hubby and our friends loved, loved, loved them.  This is the first time I've had a brat and really enjoyed it.

We love beer brats and they have become a staple for our cookouts!  I recommend boiling the brats in the beer longer for stronger flavoring, and then just 'browning & crisping' them on the grill.  5 stars any day of the week!

Not bad...not bad at all. I'm not usually a huge fan of brauts but these turned out pretty darn good. I used the cheapest beer I had on hand, 2 cans of Coors Light and used a jumbo pack of 12 Johnsonville beer brats. I also doubled the onions. Tossed everything in a slow cooker and let it sit for about 4 hours. I took the brats out of the "beer bath" and cooked them on low on the grill. This gave them better color, if not they don't look very appetizing. The grilling also gave it a little sweetness. I also took the onions out of the "beer bath" and sauteed a little to carmelized. Hubby liked them pretty well, but to my surprise my picky eater gobbled it up.

I live in germany and was looking for a basic bratwurst recipe-this one worked great, even without a grill. I made them twice (half each time)-the second time I only added half the red pepper flakes and I was still crying as I ate :P since we don't have a grill, we just heated some butter in a cast iron pan on the stove while the brats were boiling, then put them in the pan, turning once-they needed less time than a grill would. delicious, but spicy!

I would give these 4 1/2 stars if I could! I made these for a family cookout and everyone loved them. They do have a little kick to them so if you don't like spicy I would cut back or elimate the red pepper! We will be making these again!

Beer doesn't make saussages any different. I didn't descover any new taste with this recipe. Onion resulted really bitter after being cooked in beer. I added some sugar and caramelized it. At the end, it was OK. I do not recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe. As a person from the brat state of Wisconsin. Do all the above except cook on the grill first than in the beer mixture. It will come out less dry & more moist and adds flavor.

Great recipe!  I have to substitute hard cider for beer.  That is one of the few times when gluten free improves on the original.  Applewood smoke on the grill also enhances.

Made these for our Super Bowl Gathering and they were a huge hit! Simple and easy, they came out perfectly tender on the inside with a crispy outside... Just the way we like our Brats! I have to say that these are better sans the bell peppers most recipes call for which IMHO can sometimes overpower the delicate taste of a Brat Sausage.

I love beer brats, but I always just use one beer for simmering and turn the sausages in the pot. Why use four perfectly good beers when one will do?

These were good. I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the beer onion mix served over the top of the brat though.   Next time I'll use the same cooking method for the brats, but either cook down the beer (or pour it out)  so the onions can carmelize.  I'm also curious to try another suggested method where you grill first, then follow up with beer bath last.  This was fun to try, and what an easy mid-week meal.

These are excellent! I used a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale and a can of Bud Light (it's all I had on hand) and it turned out fantastic. I served these with sauerkraut and the carmelized onions and it was sooooo tasty. They grill up so beautifully and could easily be made ahead in the beer and then grilled later. Perfect for Super Bowl parties, casual get-togethers, Oktoberfests, etc. A keeper! Update: my husband sliced the left over brats and put them on a frozen pizza--Hello? Very tasty!

These were amazing. I used newcastle brown ales and added an orange bell pepper in with the onions. I also used minced garlic instead of powder. I boiled the brats for about 30 min and this gave the beer more time to cook into the brats and reduce. I grilled the brats on low and kept reducing the beer on high until I had a wonderful chuttney. Wonderful dish. I will definitly do these again.

Guess there's always somebody who isn't pleased with ANY recipe.  That being said:  DH liked this dish and I didn't.  I'm going to blame the sausage maker cuz there was some seasoning/spice that I just didn't like.

Made these for a bbq I threw recently and people loved them.  Used generic brand sausages and cream ale. Even my dad, who is extremely picky about his grilled sausages said they were "excellent."  The solitary leftover bratwurst was yummy chopped up in cheesy cheddar scrambled eggs.

I didn't eat any of these but the 3 guys I did make them for just couldn't stop saying how good they were.  I was asked a couple of times what brand they were because they wanted to be sure to buy them for themselves. 

Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely make them again.

I always try things twice before I rate them.  For this recipe, I did it one time about a month ago, and I did it again today.  Both times I have been very impressed with the way it turned out.  

The brats always come out juicy, and perfectly cooked.  The pepper adds a nice flavor to the brat and the onions that I top my brat with after they soak in the beer mixture a while.  I omitted the red pepper flakes due to a personal dislike with them - and the brats were still great!

I served this for my family for the 4th of July today, and they all loved them.  There was 12 that I made and there are zero left.  We each had 2 and everyone gave a thumbs up.

Strongly recommend this recipe.  The brats STAY JUICY and FLAVORFUL even though they are boiled.  It is the BEST recipe for brats I have tried, and will continue to use it.

Very good and so easy for a large crowd. I took the tip of another reviewer who kept the brats warm in the crockpot as it freed up the grill for other barbecue items and it kept the brats warm during the entire cookout. I also added a some butter as suggested by another reviewer.  This was really good. The recipe mentioned sauerkraut; but didn't provide instructions on how that was cooked? Any ideas from anyone if it would work out if you added it to the beer broth?

Followed the recipe, added green peppers to the pan.  Turned out great.  Good flavor!!!!  Drained the beer and then fried the onions and peppers in a little bit of butter & oil while the Brat's were grilling.  Made into sandwichs with a little provolone cheese.  Yum!!!

Delicious!   Followed the recipe as stated, but I followed another review and continued to reduce the onion and beer mixture.  I also added olive oil  (about 1-2 tablespoons) to the beer reduction.

This is a good recipe as is. The over the top version is to use Guinness, cover the brats in it and cook it completely away. Halfway through turn them over in the pan. This will leave a caramelized coating on the brats, try it. And do use Guinness.

I have used this recipe in the past. I use a foil pan on back corner of grill on medium heat to simmer the brats. In other reviews I see that people are saying they didn't get a good beer flavor due to brand they used. I prefer Pabst Blur Ribbon. It is inexpensive and gave a GREAT beer flavor to the brats.

Just  like they make'm in Wisconsin where the Brat is King and you know it. I wouldn't bring it to a boil, though. A nice simmer so it's heated through then put it on the grill. Cold Brats or even plump Dogs are better if pre-warmed rather than burnt to death on the BBQ. They can be " scored" over the flame then set off the fire to finish in the BBQ.

The bratwurst turned out great.  However the onion-beer mixture was inedible.  If I were to make it again, I'd strain the onions after I removed the brats and saute them.

This recipe turned out awesome.  I love the combination of beer and bratwurst; using different types of beer also infuse their own unique flavors.  Using a dark Porter will give the bratwursts a more robust malty flavor.  Using a lighter lager like most commercial beers will have a softer flavor that's slightly more hoppy and sweet.  I've recommended it to friends!  Thanks for the post!  If you like beer bratwursts you should check out my malt liquor bratwursts at www.eatinginbed.com

Wow!  These were very good!!  I followed the recipe exactly, using 3 - 15ounce cans of Guiness.  I don't even like brats and my husband isn't fond of them either, however, he did request them for Memorial Day.  So I thought I would give these a try and we both thought they were very good! This will be the only way we prepare brats from now on!! Thanks for sharing your recipe Zach!!

Very good. Boiling beer likes to foam up, so be careful that it doesn't over flow from the pot.

I made this for my husband and 15 year old son a couple of weeks ago. Since then, they each request this at least once a week. Tonight I'm having guests and this is what I'll be making. I'm going to add peppers with the onions tonight. GREAT recipe!

As I am currently living in Holland, finding recipes that suit the ingredients I have at hand can be challenging.  I bought some Brats the other day and decided to give this recipe a try.  They were AMAZING!  The only tweaking to the recipe was the use of fresh garlic.  I am very much looking forward to this evenings leftovers!  Thanks for a great and EASY recipe!!

These were very good. I didn't add the pepper flakes as I'm not a fan. It was sure hard not to go for seconds. A super easy supper or lunch. Will make again.

The brats were fabulous.  We didn't eat the brats on a bun and I wasn't crazy about the onions on their own.  Maybe on a bun I would've liked them better.  I used a darker beer and let the brats boil for about 20 minutes.  We cooked them on an indoor grill and they turned out great.  Super easy for a weeknight dinner or a cookout.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are phenomenal!!!  Living in MN, I get to taste quite a few different brat recipes, and have made beer brats myself also.  These are hands-down the best I've ever had and I am definitely going to keep making them this way.

Growing up in a German household I'm "brat-ed" out, but my gang loves them and thought this recipe was awesome. They used the rest of the "juice" for dipping and thought they were in heaven. Thanks Zach!

I loved these brats! My hubby liked them and said he would give them 4 stars. That's great for him because he's not crazy for brats in the first place. I though the flavor was great and I loved the spicy onions on top. I used Coors Light for the beer and it worked out well.

These did not disappoint. Very flavorful. I only had one bottle of beer left, so mixed with 1 bottle full of water and cut the recipe to 5. Still good.

This was very good, although they seemed to just taste like brats to me.  My husband really enjoyed them, although after eating his first two he said that something didn't taste quite right.  When he got his third, he left off the onions and said they tasted much better.  The only change I made was not grilling them, as winters in Maine are not condusive to grilling.  Instead I finished cooking them on the stove.  I will be making this again, probably with a few changes.

Loved it. Followed directions as listed and was the tastiest bunch of Brats I ever had. Very easy and delicious.  Might try a different beer next time but wouldn't change anything else.

I've made this dish a few times and the alterations I've settled on are #1 flip the order, grill first until you get the preferred level of grill marks, then simmer in the mixture for like a half hour or longer to absorb the flavor. And #2 my family aren't big beer drinkers so we decided to swap it with Angry Orchard Hard Cider and the apple flavor works with the brat perfectly. If you want beer flavor pick a strong dark, but I prefer the apple myself.

As a transplanted Yooper...who's been making Brats like this for most of my life...I'll also put in a plug for Johnsonville...they are the best!  Spent lots of time in Germany in the service, and never encountered a Brautwurst there that came close.  As for the recipe, I like the touch of adding the garlic powder and crushed red pepper flakes.  It added just the right amount of kick and flavor to make it interesting, but not too much mind you.  We wouldn't want anyone to mistake our Brats for Italian Sausage would we.  I'll be changing my football season traditions and incorporating this recipe into my routine.  As for boiling out the flavor...as the guy said earlier, you don't boil them...just give them a nice warm bath in the beer, butter and onions (and now garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper).  In fact, I usually take mine out of the freezer and let them defrost in this wonderful bath.  You want it hot, but not boiling.

Delicious! This is recipe is wonderful. The only modification I made was to use half of the red peppers because I wasn't sure if it would be too spicy with the full amount. It was perfect. I cut the onions in circular slices and then drained and sauteed them in butter while the brats were grilling to serve as a topping. We served the brats with sauerkraut, relish, the grilled onions, horseradish mustard, and pickled pepperoncinis slices. Mmmm! Will definitely make again. Easy to make for a summer dinner party, and tasty/impressive enough that it doesn't seem like a lazy meal (even though they are).

Followed the recipe as instructed. No edits. In reviewing many of the other reviews, I noticed a distinct difference between the par-boil and grill only sides of the camp. I have to say that par-boiling them helped cook the brats through without overdoing it. I would probably over cook them if grilling only. The seasonings add a nice touch to the flavor. I served it with corn on the cob as  another reviewer indicated and a salad and it was a very good meal. I found the “beer mixture” leftover not suitable as a side or topping, but have saved it for a cheese soup, which I think will be fantastic. Props to the recipe owner - this is sure a good recipe! Thanks.

I made as written, but cut amounts  in half for one 5 pack of brats -   turned out so good - my husband said they were better than his. I used an IPA beer and Johnsonville beer brats.  Will keep this as a new family recipe. Thank you for sharing this Zach!

Awesome brats! Slight modification using 2 packages (total of 14 brats)...
- used 6 bottles of Yuengling Black & Tan beer (adds great flavor) and 1 cup water
- poked slight holes in each brat before boiling (flavor of beer seeps inside brats)
- after finished boiling, throw on grill on low heat to brown the brats
- after removing from grill, put right back into the pot of beer...that way, the skin on brats don't start shriveling and drying up...keeps the brats nice and juicy!
Family and friends love these...always request to keep making them!!

I've made this recipe several times and my family all thought they turned out great. I  am not a grill master, so these are perfect for average cooks like me. Just make sure you use a tall enough pot so when the beer boils that it doesn't go over the top.

Cooked half recipe using Fosters ale and a diced whole onion. The brats were frozen. I put them in the pot, added the rest of the ingredients, brought them to a boil and simmered 25 minutes. While my husband browned the brats on the grill, I brought the onions and broth to a boil, lowering the heat to reduce and simmer. We served the brats on toasted potato hot dog buns, mustard, the onion "jam" reduction and pickled banana and jalapeño peppers. BEST BRATS EVER!

Born, raised, and living in Wisconsin- I grew up eating brats and I would say this is an excellent recipe. For those who said it didn't have enough flavor- try buying the Johnsonville BEER brats. Makes a big difference!

Holy smokes!  These were excellent!  I used to marinate in beer then grill, but never again.  I did slow cook the brats in beer/spices for about 10 minutes then simmered on low for about 20 minutes then grilled. I see no need for the salt so I omitted that-too much sodium as it is in most foods.

These brats were so yummy!  We didn't top the brats with the beer mixture.  I caramelized several onions and served the brats on hoagie rolls--yum!

As a Wisconsinite I would rate this 3 only because you have the right idea.  I've tried them both ways, but this is the way my local butcher recommends you prepare his homemade Brats.  The brats are grilled first then put in beer and onion in a crockpot.  I use a can of beer and a can of water, one sliced onion (same ratio to cover brats).  Let em simmer 1-2 hours, yummy and the most tender brat you will ever enjoy.  The process is all about the tenderness and of course flavor.  I  've even done this and refrigerated over nite.   Skimmed massive amounts of fat off, and reheated.  Then you can spend time enjoying your guests, instead of cooking.   Great.

I thought this recipe was very good.  However, we reversed the process by cooking the brats on the grill first, then boiling them in the beer mixture.  It left the brats juicier and had more of the beer taste everyone likes.

This is pretty much the way I have always made brats. The only thing that I do different is when I take the brats out of the beer I also take the onions out and grill them in aluminum foil.

The leftover beer mixture went perfectly with the brats. I needed no other condiments what so ever. Will definitely be using this recipe again in the near future.

Best brats I've ever made. I used one bottle Modelo Negra and one bottle O'Doule's because that's all I had on hand. I cut back the pepper flakes to just a dash or two as we like to have our brats with spicy mustard so I knew we'd be getting enough of a kick from that. I cooked them the specified time (omitted grilling though) and it did not cook the flavor away as someone else suggested. We made open faced sandwiches using hoagies and sauteed onions and peppers .... to die for!

Made these with uncooked bratwurst and followed the recipe exactly as written. They were spicy beyond belief. 3 hrs later our lips and tongues were still numb, you couldn't taste the meat it was so overpowered by spice. Will not make again.

I read the reveiws about a lot of folks having them come out dry boiling them first. I think the key here is the difference between "par boil" and "boil to death". Using pork sausage I do want them well done and without par boiling it is hard to do that without getting the sausage overdone on the grill. I do par boil...but just enough to partially cook and finish on the grill. I was starting with frozen sausages so I simmered them long enough to defrost before I left for work in am, tossed them in the dish in the fridge to sit for the day to stew and finished on the grill when I got home from work. Simmering them for 12 min first might be a bit more than a par  boil though.

Very good! Excellent flavor. I, too, used Newcastle brown ale, fresh garlic and sliced up 3 onions vs only 1 (we like lots of onion on our brats). I thought the 2 tsp red pepper flakes was a tad too much heat so next time I will use only 1 tsp. I also simmered the brats for 30 minutes instead of only 15 min. I will definitely make again!

Great table-fare.  Boiled as said but only used 1 tsp. red pepper flakes and then grilled to perfection.  Returned to the beer broth to keep warm until all the guest arrived.

Very tasty.  We are not big meat eaters, but wanted something to do on the grill for a camping trip.  These brats were perfect!  The boiling in beer helped cook the fat out of them first, then they browned up really nicely on the grill.  The onions had a great flavor.  We'll make these again.

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe. I've never seen brats disappear so quickly. The only change I made was to use Guiness, which gave it a more beery flavor. The onions cooked in the beer were so delicious that next time I make this recipe I'm going to double the amount called for.

These were soooo good! I'm from Texas and knew nothing about bratworst.  I'd never eaten them much less cooked them. My husband loved them, too. Of course we have nothing to compare but none-the-less, they're great.  We want to know what to eat with them.

YUM! These were really good! I did boil mine a little longer, because I wanted to make sure that they would cook quick on the grill.They turned out so juicy and flavorful. Delicious recipe that I know I will make a lot! Thanks for posting :)

I used turkey brats (as my husband doesn't eat pork).  And I think we determined that we just don't really like brats in general.  The flavor was pretty good, and I cooked the whole meal outside using the side burner on our grill, while grilling some hot dogs for the kids.

The spices in this recipe are spot on. I changed it a bit. I browned the brats in butter and sautéed onions with them. I added semi cooked carrots and Brussels sprouts with sauerkraut during the simmer stage. Since the brats were already browned, I didn’t need to go out in the cold to grill them. It was delicious! Even my daughter ate the sauerkraut! This is definitely a recipe I’ll use again!

I followed the recipe ingredients and directions but halved the recipe. I also poked holes in the brats prior to simmering to allow in more flavor and prevent splitting.  It was a big hit and I will make it again.

These are awesome brats!  The only thing I changed was after I remove the brats from the beer and onions, I drain off the beer, throw in a little butter and a tad of sugar and cook the onions until carmalized.  Perfection!!

I made this recipe as is except that I had to use what I had on hand. First I used Swiss cheese stuffed German sausages. Also, I did not use the pepper flakes as spicy hot upsets our stomachs horribly. With that said, I prepared them per the instructions. I cooked the onions until pretty soft and glossy and most of the liquid was gone. I served the sausages on pretzel buns that I spread with a bit of grain mustard from France I happen to find at the kitchen store. It was delicious! Next time I get beef brats or any good German style pork or beef sausage I will make it this way again. Really, it is an easy recipe that is downright good. Also, make sure you get a really good beer. I used a Belgian wheat beer I found at the grocery store and it came out excellent. The recipe is open to experimentation with either the type of sausage or the type of beer. Will make this again definitely to go out of the beaten path of bbq sausages of any kind. BTW, don't get deterred if you don't have a BBQ, use your broiler for the final browning

Tried it a couple of times. Doesn't improve the flavor of the Brats. Also, the onions have nothing left in them so there's no reason to add them back to the meat. The _only_ good thing to come out of this recipe is the broth, strained, is delicious.

Very tasty brats!  I cooked a dozen and used 3 cans of beer, keeping other measurements the same.
This is a particularly handy recipe for a large group because you can keep them warm easily.

I used Ionia78 suggestion and they turned out great.  Still used the same basic ingredients, just heated in an aluminum throw-away pan, and cooked the brats over indirect heat for about 20 minutes before placing in the 'sauce'.  I've made these several times for parties, and continue to add additional brats each time - and I still don't have leftovers, and usually I don't even get one before their gone (made 21 last time).  Lots of compliments on the flavor and juiciness.

Best recipe I've ever used. If you reduce the serving size it still comes out great!

Make these maybe twice a year and always soak them in Miller High Life which my army vet brother swears is the best for brats-it’s very good so I trust him and always use it- as today. Wanted something to change it up a bit, see what I could do with a brat-this looked perfect; looked super good!

I added about 2 tsp of dry rub, such as Plowboy BBQ Rub.  I also added all of my dry ingredients to the beer before bringing to a boil.  Brats were very good!

Had beer brats and didn't want to lose any of that flavor boiling them before the grill. I will do this again with regular brats!

I added additional onions.  I also simmered all of the beer out of the onions and used them as a spicy topping on my brats.

Been using this recipe for 2 years now.. It's my go to for parties.
Only thing i do different is i slow cook the brats on indirect heat while the beer and onions cook.  
I cook out half of the beer/liquid or untill it becomes a bit thicker.
Then i toss in the brats for another 15-20 mins or until most of the beer/liquid is gone and becomes more of a "sauce" 
This dish wont last longer than 5 minutes at a bbq. 
I've been using this for 2 years. Tasty and very simple!

Never boil. It causes the skins to break, and the flavor leaks out. Besides, you don't really get any of the beer flavor by boiling anyway. Use a crock pot, turn the setting to high, and cook for 4-6 hours before grilling.

This recipe makes great brats! Had a barbecue with the guys and they all loved it so much we ended up running out. However, it doesn't work  on Italian sausages which I cooked in the same batch. They turned out cooked but rather dry. Overall,  fantastic.  I'll be making these again!

All I did was add slices of red and green bell peppers to the mix but otherwise cooked exactly to the recipe. Simple and delicious, full of flavor! The little kick of pepper flakes sure adds zest, and if you're not a fan of that sort of spice it's just as flavorful without. I didn't have any the first time I made this and loved it. The next time I added the pepper flakes and got raves! You can't really mess this up! Thanks for sharing!

AWESOME Recipe!!!  Made these for a group of hungry men who couldn't say enough of how these tasted.  Followed the recipe but expanded for 20 "brats"...After grilling I dipped them back into the "juices" before placing them on a roll.....AWESOME!!!!

My husband loved it!  He also loved the Beer/Cheese soup I made using the beer and seasonings I boiled the brats in. I did everything according to the recipe except that I used 1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes (it was plenty hot) and two bottles of dark beer rather than four.

I simply halved the recipe because I was just cooking for 3 people and sliced the onions instead of dicing.  Otherwise, I followed to a T.  It was incredibly tasty and I'm making it again this weekend.  I didn't eat the cooked down onion mixture simply because I'm not a fan of the texture of onions.  However, my husband ate them and said they had a kick.  (We're from Texas and not wimpy when it comes to spiciness)

The added flavor comes from the beer and onions. Grill the thawed brats hot and fast until the are brown and just start to split. Then put them in beer and onions. Do not use a miller product! They stink when they boil and they don't taste as good. Budweiser or Old Mil work best. This is also easier for serving  over periods of time to a crowd. 

On Wisconsin!

This recipe was delicious!  I made this for my family last night and they were a huge hit. I followed directions exactly with the exception of not having any garlic powder on hand. I used a tsp of minced fresh garlic instead.

I have to replace my gas grill so I needed a recipe for preparing brats indoors on my electric griddle/grill. Thanks to this recipe and some very helpful reviews, my dinner was a success! I boiled the brats in the given sauce recipe but reduced the heat and let them slow boil for 10 additional minutes while piercing them with a fork to allow the brats to soak up the sauce. I then grilled them on the grill plate of my electric griddle/grill for 15 minutes turning several times to brown them evenly. Everyone loved them! Thanks for the great recipe and reviews, I absolutely love Allrecipes.com!

You just can't go wrong with this. The has become a staple quick weekend meal. It's perfect with some grilled corn on the cob in summer.

I'be now made this 5-6 times, and I'be found the secret. Instead of regular beer, go with pork brats and Redd's Apple Ale (I prefer the cans of Wicked). Because I have non-pork eaters in my house, I split a 12-pack between 2 pots: one for the pork brats, and another for Aidell's Chicken & Apple Sausages. I also pour off a little of the remaining broth in each and reduce them into a glaze.

Great combination of the onions and "brawts sauce" to top off the whole thing!! Nice spice (with the topping) and great flavor!! Make sure to let the beer and onions to cook down to a nice thick consistency. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe is AMAZING!!
I have made beer brats before using my family recipe and they were good, but this was awesome!
Only changes were I only used 2 beers, I let the brats soak in the beer, onions & seasoning before putting heat to it & I used a large skillet, not pot to simmer them in for about 30 min flipping constantly.
I've never had better brats, I can't wait to make these for my family!

Made for ice fishing trip. Completed to boil part of recipe, then packed brats and onion sludge for later cooking. We completed the "grilling" part on a large cast iron skillet along side marinated venison chops. The onion sludge was also reheated in the skillet. Arrangement made for easier clean up and turned out exceptional. My fish/hunt partner typically goes with Italians because brats can be rather bland. I tried this and all comments were very positive in the group. Delicious and easy to prepare in the field as well. Thx for the great recipe!

I fell in love with this recipe!  It will be my go-to for Brats from now on.  Tonight I am going to attempt to use it on a turkey brat for my "we don't eat red meat" friends.  If I think of it, I'll post the result.  I'm not holding my breath for this one but it may half to do with the fact that I'm not a turkey brat fan!  Thank you for this recipe, Zach!!!!

Wow.  I had never made beer brats before...these were excellent!  Definitely a huge step above just buying pre-cooked "beer brats."  We put the beer-boiled onions and some sauerkraut on them.  I scarfed my first one down without any other condiments.  The second one I tried with barbecue sauce just for fun, but it really didn't need it.
I used the cheapest beer I could find, which was Milwaukee's Best Ice.  I will definitely save this recipe and make these again.
As my father-in-law commented afterward, "This was one of those meals that makes you feel it's a shame you have to ever get full."

I used a microbrew lager and onion seasoning and peppers instead of onions and the wife loved it. I also toasted the buns in the oven with butter and bacon grape oil. I started with the boiler then as I don't have a grill (yet...) I used a frying pan with some of the spices and beer in the pan. Once the brats broke open, I transferred them back to the boiler for about 3-5 more minutes.

These came out pretty  good! I used Space Cowboy IIPA from People's Brewing Company.  I kind of got ahead of my self and boiled all the ingredients at the same time.  I put some of the beer that was boiled in a cup and added sauerkraut to it as a side.  Everybody loved it.

Did it right on an indoor grill using pork sausages. Grilled boiled onion as well, slowly adding the beer mixture to the grill to keep everything moist and flavorful.

I tried this recipe for our downtown Gilroy's Beer Crawl and sold them from my hot dog cart I have in front of our store.  Used a dark lager beer in with the purple sautéed onions and let them simmer.  Served a curry sauce with it.  Oh man were they good!!!

Absolutely phenomenal....just the way the recipe states. I use a good German beer like Warsteiner and make sure you get some real German mustard otherwise known as "Senf". A few notes: don't prick the brats with a fork, the flavor of the beer and onions will definitely penetrate deeper but all that goodness and all the moisture will run out as soon as you put them on the grill. They taste AMAZING just the way the recipe says. I have no idea why the author says to save the beer-boiled onions as a side, I honestly think it's a joke and a funny one at that - they are the most bitter thing I have ever tasted lol.

Followed the recipe to the T and was really disappointed.  The fats and juices boiled out and I ended up with drier than normal brats.  That wasn't the end of the world...but the bitter onions really were a waste of something good.

This was in preparation for a big tailgate...I'll be grilling the brats slow and low and cooking my onions on the side next time.

You must need a pretty stout beer in order to even taste it in this recipe. I followed this recipe as directed and could not taste beer at all but could definitely taste the spiciness, which I didn't care for. If I made again, which is a big IF, I would be sure to get a stronger beer and I would take the advice of another Allrecipeep and soak the brats in the beer for awhile, possibly overnight, before grilling. The recipe as is was not impressive to us - felt I wasted my husband's favorite beer.

I've always liked bratwurst in beer and these were fine BUT the onions were very bitter and everyone left them on the sides of their plates.  Maybe they weren't "necessary", but I expected to serve them as a nice accompaniment; instead they were unappealing. I agree with other reviewers that they could have been carmelized to improve flavour, but in the end, I'll just use a more reliable and crowd-pleasing recipe.

We ALWAYS boil our brats in beer before grilling (I find brats taste completely different and wrong when not boiled in beer first). And before this recipe, I never thought to add anything to the pot besides beer..this is soooo good! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These are pretty good.  I made the recipe a while back and forgot to review it.  I made it as stated because I had never cooked brats before.  They turned out pretty good.  No complaints.  I'm trying another recipe tomorrow, so I'll see if we like it better!  Thanks!

Great recipe, easy! Didn't care so much for using the leftover beer/onions for "sauce," (a bit spicy for us) but the brats were great!
