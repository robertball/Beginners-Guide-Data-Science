We loved it! Used half of a red cabbage and one fennel bulb but kept everything else the same. Delicious! Will make this again!

This is a nice option to your standard cole slaw.  It's really light with a mild flavor.  All ingredients are harmonious, not one dominating.  I did toast the pine nuts to maximize their flavor, and you can enjoy this guilt free.
