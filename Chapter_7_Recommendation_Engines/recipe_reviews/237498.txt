As a native Spaniard, (from Madrid), I give this recipe a 4 because is a pretty close one to be authentic. We do NOT use ham or cayenne. There is a misconception about Spanish food, we do not have that many spicy dishes at all, far from Mexican food, where they like it hot. A variation is to cut the bread in cubes instead of leaving it whole, and to stir in the egg beaten, like you do with Chinese egg drop soup.

Fantastic soup, easy, quick and cheap! I tried it also with just regular slices of bread: it is not the same of course, but still very tasty!! We also substituted paprika with smoked paprika and it was great!

What a great recipe! I liked to use a little less paprika not to overpower the garlic flavour. The garlic flavour is subtle, kind of like onions in a French onion soup. This brought me right back to this Spanish restaurant I went with my family a long time ago. I'm happy to have found this little gem, it really brings me back. Thanks Chef John! Love all your recipes, you have great taste.

I am a chef here in Montreal, working for a private yacht club,, we had a dinner just the other night, I took this opportunity to show case this recipe for this soup..
They all loved it !! the smoky paprika, I used a spicy  choriso sausage because it was on sale, but followed all the rest of ingredients, Cooking with you is fun.. enjoy all your demonstrations, Chef John!  Cheers !!!

This was a rare Chef John miss for me. Made this per the recipe, with one exception, left the ham out  and added some smoked sausage instead. ( I am not a big fan of ham and the wife has stomach problems after eating it).  First off though, the flavor is amazing. the garlic, paprika and sausage go really well together. What bothered both of us was the texture of bread in the soup.  It was ok, but  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat this again.

I don't usually care for soup but we LOVE this one. We've modified it a bit for our tastes like using about 1 lb of cubed ham steak to  4 cartons of stock  and using a combo of sweet, smoked and spicy paprikas.  If you toast your paprika in the oil a bit before adding the stock, it really brings out the flavors. We add a lot of paprika because it's delicious. When we poach the eggs, they always seem to sink to the bottom, but we can still fish them out when serving.  This is also one that gets better as it sits. The bread makes the leftovers almost creamy.  So tasty!

Not sure what went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't turn out red, like the photo shown. (i used Penzey's paprika, so it shouldn't be a problem there)  Flavor: tasted a lot like ramen noodles, minus the noodles. Disappointed. Giving it 2 starts because the eggs on top of soup were good.

It's flavorful. The eggs do not stay nicely in the liitle indentations. They all sunk to the bottom of the pan so I had to fish them out and ended up breaking two of them.

Well, this knocked my socks off!  Had to replace ham with diced portuguese sausage.  also didn't have parsley, so put in some cilantro.and skipped the egg on the first round; delicious!  Second round poached egg on top and was another level of OMG drool-worthy.  Definitely making again.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is soooooooo good. I made it exactly as written, adjusting the paprika to my liking (i added more). It was a bit spicy with the cayenne, so i think next time ill just omit that. Otherwise, perfection!

This tasted excellent, but I had some problems with the preparation. I did make a few alterations: used a loaf of Italian bread and didn't measure the amount. Didn't have EVOO so just used regular olive oil. I also just used up my remaining ham and thus didn't measure. The biggest changes resulted from my not having a large enough pot: I ended up having to use two, which was rather chaotic. Also, this was probably due to my imperfect measurements, but my eggs didn't really poach properly; rather, they sort of poached but mostly just seeped into the soup dish. Anyway, it was still totally delicious, and I'm now in love with the taste of savory smoked paprika.

I wanted to make something different and I saw this video.  Although I always love Chef John's recipes, I was a bit skeptical about this one but it’s definitely different so I had to try it.  I sure loved that it’s cheap and quick to make. It’s super garlic-y and tasted “fine.” My husband liked it more than I did. I don’t think this will be my go-to recipe for soup but now I know what to make when there’s nothing in the house!

This is a great weeknight recipe. Completely delicious and very quick to make. One thing: definitely use French bread. I used a sub roll instead and that bread couldn’t stand up to the liquid.

This was absolutely delicious, though I left out the ham and cayenne.  I made it a bit heavy on the garlic and a generous with the smoked paprika (how I love that flavor).  I bought a $0.70 loaf of day old "crusty white bread", and it held up perfectly in the soup.  Will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as written, and it's a very flavorful soup with a good texture. Unfortunately, my bread mostly fell apart once I added the chicken stock. I tried to gently float an egg on top to poach it, but the egg slid through the top layer and disappeared. The egg cooked like it was egg drop soup and added a bit of richness, but it's now not the most appealing soup in existence. I'm not sure what I did wrong since, in the YouTube video, the bread holds its shape and supports the eggs.

This is SO delicious.  Especially with the egg.  I would just recommend watching the video.  Mine did not look exactly like his (I'm not sure he always gets the measurements right when he translates them into the "non-chef" world) but watching the video helps you get the idea. But you can't do much to screw up this great soup. It's a great soup for people like me who aren't great cooks!

Next time I think I'll add more bread so the eggs stay up better, but it tasted great! Husband loved it.

Made it without ham. Good textures of bread balanced with eggs. I prefer to fully cook the yoke to bring back some chew.

After modifying this soup for vegetarian consumption (sautéed mushrooms and veggie broth for ham and chicken broth) I found this soup to be very salty. Perhaps it was the broth I used, but it overpowered the garlic flavor that I was looking forward to. I will try it again without adding any salt,  using a less salty broth, and adding more paprika and garlic.

I've made this twice and it's absolutely delicious. Almost gave it 4 stars because I couldn't stop the eggs from sinking (which is maddening) and can't watch them cook so they're usually over done. It must be my technique since according to the video it can be done!

Reminds me a bit of a French onion soup but without the onions and cheese. The eggs give it a wicked twist, definitely one to keep.

This has become a favorite in my house! This soup is so flavorful and satisfying. I eat this year round. I love it without the ham but my partner absolutely loves the ham dynamic.
