Billy Sunday Pudding, which originated in west central Illinois in the early 1900s according to legend, is a family favorite. Although it is a Christmas tradition in our family, it is very good any time of the year. I have dozens of versions of this recipe, with various ingredients and ingredient amounts, but pearl tapioca, brown sugar, dates and nuts are the consistent ingredients. In fact, I have not previously seen this exact submitted version. I will add a couple directions, which may answer the other reviewer's complaints. One, the pudding can be baked or cooked on top of the stove. If you bake it, you need to stir the mixture regularly in order for the pearl tapioca to become clear and the pudding to cook evenly. On top of the stove, you must stir the pudding frequently until the tapioca becomes clear. Two, all of my recipe versions call for you to serve Billy Sunday Pudding with a topping of Cool Whip or whipped cream. It is a very rich pudding, but well worth the effort to make it correctly.

I wanted to make this because I love dates and tapioca.  I waited until reviews appeared so I was aware of problems and pitfalls others were experiencing. I made this pudding today, and even though the ingredient list led me to believe that I would love this, I don't.  A little sweeter than I like, and a bit rubbery.  However, it was a fun experiment for a Sunday morning.

This recipe was delicious! I made the recipe as is, except I did place my baking dish into a water bath before placing in the oven. This is a recipe I will make regularly for a wonderful treat. Thank you for this recipe!

This is very similar to a holiday desert dish which my mother used to make back in the 50's and 60's.  But after it was cooled she folded it into whipped cream which made it softer and less sweet and rich.

I did not care for this recipe.  We did use a water bath and did stir frequently -- but the taste was sorely lacking, very bland and flat, and the texture was really rubbery.  Next time I'd just make real tapioca with brown sugar and milk and at least be able to enjoy it.  Even my kids wouldn't touch this.
