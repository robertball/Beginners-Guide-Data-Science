I made it exactly as Chef John advised but I did add extra vanilla flavoring.  I knew CJ would not steer me wrong, so I went ahead and doubled the recipe.  It was fantastic and so  light and fluffy and I love anything lemon.   I even added some  fresh blueberries in some of the pancakes and it was a great combination.   It yielded 18 large pancakes.  Had four for breakfast and froze the rest individually.  They will be amazing thawed and zapped in the toaster for week day breakfast.  Loved them even without any syrup.  Thank you Chef John.

These were amazing! I am always looking for shortcuts so I subbed Bisquick for the self rising flour and oil, but otherwise didn't change a thing and they were great! The perfect amount of lemon flavor as is. I topped with home made lemon curd and they blew my family away. :)

I have made several of Chef John's recipes.  Today I made these pancakes.  They turned out absolutely delicious, light yet creamy, with a nice lemony flavor (although I admit I used Chef John's Lighter Lemon Curd on mine).  I especially was grateful to see how to make self-rising flour so I didn't have to go out and buy some because most of it would expire.

Just made these for my family, since I had all the ingredients on hand. Like all of Chef John's recipes, this one did not disappoint. I made it exactly as written, choosing milk over water. After cooking one as a test, I noticed the lemon flavor was a little less than I had hoped for. Easy fix... I squeezed a little more lemon juice into the remaining batter, mixed it together, and problem solved. The texture of these pancakes is light and fluffy. I'll certainly make them again!

Chef John does it again!   These are absolutely fabulous!!   The whole family devoured them.   I doubled the recipe to feed 5 people.   I also added extra lemon zest, lemon juice, and pinch of salt.   Thank you Chef John!!

Delicious! I was out of milk so I was looking for a ricotta pancake recipe that didn’t need it and this fit the bill. I ended up using the zest of a whole Meyer lemon, which was perfect, and King Arthur’s recipe for self-rising flour (1 cup flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt). I got impatient and didn’t let them rest which was a mistake — after letting the batter rest they were noticeably lighter and fluffier.

My wife and I usually like thinner pancakes, but these were absolutely delicious. I used homemade ricotta, and the whey from making the cheese as the liquid instead of milk or water.

Amazing! Love these so much and will definitely make again. I made with 2% milk but now after watching his video, I want to try them with water & will help save a little on carbs.  Love they are low in sugar & fewer carbs than other pancakes for my type 1 diabetic son.  Thank you Chef John!

These are delicious! I followed the recipe the first time I made them and wanted a stronger lemon flavor. I added more zest the second time, and they’re perfect! Super yummy with blueberry sauce!

These are phenomenal. Light and citrus, fluffy and moist. Made a blueberry vanilla sauce rather than syrup, outstanding.

Oh so good! Light and fluffy, packed with flavor. The lemon shines in this recipe and gives the pancakes an almost cheesecake like flavor. A keeper for sure!

Made these several times now...I followed the recipe to the letter, except I used King Arthur's 1 to 1 GF flour,  made the self-rising flour as per Chef John's direction, topped off each stack with fresh blueberries and a little extra lemon zest--these are the BEST pancakes I've ever eaten.  My family agrees.

I loved the pancakes and they were easy to make. I even made my own self rising flour from another AllRecipes posting. Mom & Hubby raved about these too. I changed the milk to cashew milk and added fresh blueberries.  I will definitely be making these again! Maybe with raspberries... I'll take a picture next time. They didn't stand a chance this time around ;)

Made (almost) as directed and these were WONDERFUL!!  I used all-purpose four plus 1-1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and a rounded 1/4 teaspoon of coarse salt, and added blueberries.  Only one tablespoon of added sugar and these tasted like dessert, perfect for my husband’s birthday breakfast!  Thanks for posting.  :).   ps- made (7) 4” round pancakes.

These pancakes are the best I have ever tasted. I can't stop craving them. I used the same proportions but I combined all the wet ingredients and whipped them together until fully blended. Then combined the dry ingredients and added them to the wet stirring until just blended. The batter was quite thick so I added 1 or 2 tablespoons milk to thin. Delicious!

These are great pancakes and a nice change from the ordinary. I added the zest of the lemon to the batter in addition to the lemon juice. Not difficult to make just pay attention to the recipe especially the self rising flour.

Delicious!  I just had these for breakfast.  Light and fluffy, and none of the flavoring is overpowering.  The lemon was just right.  I had them with butter, maple syrup, and bacon.  I did have a glass of skin milk, so there's some sacrifice involved lol.  I hope they freeze well, as I'd like to enjoy them for a few breakfasts.  One note: The first few  melded while cooking.  I used my usual pancake batter dipper, and this batter bloomed! Try these.  You'll not be disappointed.

Just remembered: I used skim milk.

These pancakes are wonderful!  I made them for dinner and doubled the recipe to feed three with leftovers.  I sent some home with my son's girlfriend for their later consumption, plus I had a few left for the following day's breakfast!   A keeper!

I made this recipe vegan with Tofutti Ricotta, flax meal as an egg sub (1tbs flax 3tbs water and let it sit for five minutes) and vegan butter melted in. They weren’t all that fluffy but I didn’t use self rising flour so that may have been why. I saved it and I’ll be making it again!

Very good even with my changes due to what I had on hand! I used kefir cream cheese instead of ricotta, tangerine rind and a little lemon juice, added a bit of flax with flour and threw in some huckleberries. Cooked up great on a cast iron skillet in a little oil. I will make again and again!

wow, these did not disappoint. Chef John’s video said they would be like diner style fluffiness. They were. One of my kids who said I don’t like anything with lemon, typical kid who said he doesn’t like it if he hasn’t tried it, gobble two down and had leftovers the next day. Easy recipe. I followed it exactly as per the recipe using water  instead of milk. I did make my own self rising flour. I’d like to try this with orange to see if you could make a delicious orange ricotta pancake. Anyway delicious I will definitely be making numerous times.

Very good with a hint of lemon. Lite & fluffy. Definitely let them rest. I would not change a thing and I only made these to use up an open container of ricotta. So glad I did! Thank you Chef John!

These are the best pancakes I have ever made...and among the best I have ever had. My pancakes did not rise and get fluffy like the photos, but I have never been able to achieve risen pancakes, so not so bothered by that. The taste was just amazing...can't wait to make these again. Thanks, Chef John!

Great recipe!  I only use whole wheat flour so reduced amount to 1 cup and added 1 tsp of baking powder.  Used zest from whole lemon and squeezed half of it for juice.  Used lactic milk that had soured.  This is a keeper!

I made this for the first time, and I'm not usually very good at making pancakes! Well, this recipe is so easy, simple and the pancakes come out tasting amazing! I love the lemon zest and juice, it adds an extra something. I made them for my bf who normally doesn't like pancakes, but he demolished them! This is now my go to pancake recipe!

I used coconut oil vs vegetable oil, used it to cook with too!  I didn't use much zest  maybe 1/4 tsp. and the flavor was very delicate!!! and I use 1/4 vanilla.. These are REALLY  wonderful!! I too as surprised at the texture even though using water!

These were delicious pancakes!  I'm a cook that loves short cuts and so I used a box complete pancake mix and then added an egg, the ricotta, lemon juice and lemon zest and then because I love blueberries I also thawed frozen wild blueberries and added them to the batter.  Most everyone was thoroughly delighted with them and we will be making them often.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I don't really like pancakes so I rarely make them, but I wanted to serve something different with my other brunch dishes.  Chef John never fails me and he certainly didn't this time.  I made it as directed (using water as he suggests) and my guests loved them.  The lemony flavor in the pancakes was perfect and the texture was silky on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly except for the sugar--I only had raw sugar, not white. I didn't adjust the amount of sugar but it came out fine. They had just the right amount of lemon flavor. They were excellent plain, but I also ate them with some thinned homemade strawberry rhubarb margarita jam drizzled on top.

Very good and very fluffy. 4 stars only because the lemon taste is so mild. I would have liked more. I ate with blueberry jam and enjoyed them.

Made this exactly as Chef John recommended.  These are fabulous pancakes.  Thought I had a good recipe but CJ’s blows  mine away..  I would never had made these pancakes but I was  looking for recipes using my leftover ricotta cheese.  I’m so glad I  decided on this one.  Chef John never lets you down.  Thanks CJ.

We really liked these pancakes; they were very moist and tender and rose nicely. Very easy to make. Ours didn't have much lemon flavor. We used Meyer lemons from the tree in our yard, and since they have a more subtle lemon flavor I'd either increase the zest or use regular lemons the next time we make these. We topped ours with blueberry syrup, and they went together very well.  Will definitely make this one again.

So fluffy and light. I was afraid the lemon would not be detected because I couldn't smell or taste it in the batter. But once cooked in the pan, a lovely aroma wafted and the taste lemon light and airy.  Served with a home-made blueberry sauce.....Delightful.

My family loves these light, fluffy, lemon pancakes! I add a little extra lemon zest just because “why not?” Easy to make, easier to eat! I serve mine with warm blueberry compote (or, in a pinch, Trader Joe’s Organic Blueberry preserves. Add a shake of confection sugar and a dollop of whipped cream and you are in lemony heaven!

Made these using water and skim milk ricotta since that's what I had on hand.  After waiting 15 min for the batter to set, mine unfortunately didn't and was very loose.  Added more SR flour but still not as thick as in the video. Didn't rise very much at all, but the flavor was very good.

Loved these pancakes. I served with Blueberry Sauce (found on allrecipes.com) and loved them but I will try them with maple syrup next time - just to see.

Wow these were great. I doubled the recipe for 4 people and had a few pancakes left over which I will have for breakfast. I added a little more flour than called for because it seems too thin and I’m glad I did. They still didn’t cook up quite as fluffy looking as Chef Johns but they were light and delicious. I served these with fresh blueberries on the side as well as blueberry and lingonberry jams.

This is a great pancake, definitely will be making again. I did not add the sugar or lemon zest and doubled the vanilla. Decided to make a waffle with the left over batter (I made 6 small pancakes which were enough for 2 of us) and it was a delicious moist and crisp waffle.

I'm never using boxed pancake mix again.  

I might experiment by using mascarpone instead of ricotta and maybe even "health" it up by substituting some flour with oatmeal ?

These were excellent and better than the fancy restaurant version - even when made at high altitude!  I think the cheese may help with this.  I used Trader Joe's Lemon Curd for syrup.  The best brand IMHO

All in all, these were good.  I think next time I would add more lemon to the batter, maybe a bit of lemon oil to kick up the lemon flavor.

I topped them with a lemon vanilla whipped cream and wild blueberries.

Whip:
1 cup whipping cream
5 drops high-quality lemon oil
1/4 cup granulated sugar
whip to desired consistency.

Direction followed exactly. I doubled it.  I used the milk rather than water.  The batter was very thick so I cooked them on a medium heat rather than a med/high heat.  They didn't rise perfectly however the family raved about them.  I wasn't as excited by them.  I was hoping for more lemony/cheesey flavour.  Next time I'll try it with the water instead of milk and see if that makes a difference in rising and cooking time.

Delicious!  They are light and fluffy. I doubled the amount of vanilla as per another reviewer. My husband who is difficult loved them. He did use maple syrup, just butter. 
Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the recipe which yielded 16 pancakes using my #50 scoop. I did thin the batter with more milk as it was really thick and my son has texture issues. Served blueberry lemon sauce over them. My family really enjoyed these pancakes, would definitely make again.

My family wasn't crazy about these pancakes.  They looked nice, but they thought it had too much of a lemon taste.
