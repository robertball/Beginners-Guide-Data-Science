I have been making this for over a year now. My family loves it. For all those people who give it less than 3 stars, try again with these instructions I learned from past reviewers. Use 1/3 cup butter, cook for only about 25 mins (do not let over cook, 40 mins too long), spoon juices all over the chicken 2 times while cooking. Perfect every time!

I really think that Heather meant a 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) of butter. 

I marinated my 6 chicken breasts in a cup of lemonade prior to making this. I omitted the egg wash, as the lemonade marinade made the crumbs adhere well. I crushed my crackers up in a zipper type bag, added seasonings (LOTS of garlic powder, lemon pepper, paprika and onion powder), then added the chicken pieces two at a time. I also lightly coated a glass baking dish with vegetable spray. I added the coated chicken, sprinkled parmasen cheese evenly over the chicken, I melted 1/4 cup of butter and drizzled that over the top. Cooked it at 375 for 30 minutes. My whole family loved this! I served it with buttered parsley noodles n green peas. No leftovers at all! Think next time I'll have to double the recipe. This was a moist and very tender dish, very flavorful and was not greasy or extreme butter tasting either. Very easy to make too. I think I'll make up crushed crackers/seasoning baggies and have them ready to roll in my pantry on very busy nights! Thanks Heather!!! :o)

Wow! I'd give this 10 stars if I could! Hands down THE juiciest chicken I’ve ever eaten. I generally hate white meat but decided to stick to the recipe here and used boneless breast filets, and I’m glad I did because it wouldn’t have been as pretty with dark meat. After reading myriad reviews here, I made a couple changes: I used an 8X8 Pyrex dish so the juices would stay put, I used only 1/2 of the required butter which was plenty, and I added about 1/4 cup of flour to the cracker crumbs so they’d adhere to the chicken better. The end result looked like KFC extra crispy chicken but tasted like pure heaven on a plate! Even my picky 2 year old loved it (when he saw his cubed portions, he exclaimed "nuggets!" and promptly devoured them.) This is definitely going into the regular rotation!

Just made this recipe for dinner and it was a hit! I made the preparation easier by crushing the crackers in a gallon-size zip-lock bag and using my rolling pin on them -- my kids had fun helping--then adding spices (garlic and onion powder, a bit of salt and paprika)& shaking. After coating the chicken in the beaten egg, I put a few pieces at a time into the bag "shake 'n bake" style, shaking and pressing the crackers into the chicken, then pressing in more crumbs after I put the chicken in the baking dish. After cutting and adding the butter, on a whim I poured in a bit of white wine I had in the fridge and placed about 6 large cloves of garlic, sliced in half, around the chicken. The chicken smelled sooo good while baking and the garlicky butter sauce was delicous over noodles. I cut my chicken breasts in half, so next time will reduce the cooking time to 30-35 mins. Will definitely made it again, family loved it and is good enough (not to mention easy!) for company.

I tried this recipe tonight because I wanted something quick and both me and my husband were impressed.  As others suggested, I cut the amount of butter in half, which turned out just perfect.  I also added 2 tsp. italian seasoning and 2 tsp. grated parmesan cheese to the cracker crumbs and sprinkled just a little garlic salt on top of the chicken before I put it in the oven.  This is one I will be making again.  Thanks for the quick, easy and DELICIOUS recipe!

This was absolutely the best chicken recipe I've ever tried!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 2 tsp. Italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs, cut the butter to 1/4 cup and baked in a glass dish.  I also flipped the chicken over about halfway through the cooking time.  I used 3 very large boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut each in half.  My husband and I both loved this recipe!  The chicken came out so moist and juicy, I can't wait to make this one again.  I am planning on serving this at a slumber party for 8-10 year old girls also, I will use chicken tenders and various dipping sauces like honey mustard and BBQ.  Excellent recipe Heather, Thanks!

Wow...good stuff.  True not a light meal, but it the taste is awesome. I did take other's advice and add seasonings to the cracker crumbs for more flavor.  It was great.  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the butter and just a dash of wine (as another reviewer suggested).  The extra butter sauce went over egg noodles.  This was definately a keeper.  Thanks for posting.

This was very bland. I dip mine in melted butter, sprinkle with garlic and coat with corn flake crumbs. tastes so much better and is nice and crunchy on the outside - juicy on the inside with flavor.

Used egg whites instead. Tip:  You take a stick of 
frozen butter and grate over the chickent etc. instead of cutting it pieces. Works well and  probably uses less butter but gets the job done.

Oh my gosh, this is the best.  I did decrease the baking time to about 30 minutes.  But my chicken came out perfect, tender, juicy and with so much flavor.  The chicken has a rich buttery taste and the crackers make a really crispy crust.  
My eight year old neice how is a notoriously picky eater even loved it.  It is a little rich, so I probably won't make it often.  I will keep it in mind for those days I want something fast however.

Great and easy recipe. I had enough eggs/crumbs for 6 chicken breasts. I didn't change a thing and the meal was really enjoyed by all...and the chicken really moist! Will make again, esspecially when I have little time to spare!

I love this recipe!!! But... I adapted it a bit and it turned out even better and more crispy. I made a garlic butter by putting four smashed garlic cloves into a low heat pan with 1/4 stick of butter, and a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Once the butter/oil was infused with the garlic, I removed the garlic and let the liquid become room temperature. I then coated the chicken (I used strips...three per large chicken breast) in the garlic butter and then into the cracker crumbs. The crumbs really stick just make sure the crumbs are small. I cooked them at 375 for 45 minutes, halfway through spooning a little of the leftover butter over each chicken tender. They were unbelievably moist, and crispy on the bottom and the top without turning. They also freeze very well. The garlic butter helped infuse great flavor throughout.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thats basically all it takes to summarize this chicken. It was WONDERFUL! I am only 15 years old and I made this..I think it was the first time I actually had to cook meat..not including like ground beef for spaghetti or something like that. And it couldn't have been easier! Even for me! I made a few changes as suggested: Used a little italian seasoning, flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt..stuff like that for the breading. Added a little garlic into the baking pan before I stuck it into the oven. Turned over the chickens half way  though cooking time. Poured juice half way through cooking time. And YUM! It was so delicious. Probably the most delicious chicken I have ever tasted..seriously.

Delicious. My husband is very picky, and he LOVED this. I was very surprised at how good this came out, as I have tried it with cereal before, and did not like it at all. This is definitely a keeper for my family. Mmmmm

4 Stars after modifications- used one egg with a little milk for the egg wash, crushed up my ritz in a bag and added some Tony Chachere's, garlic powder and some parm cheese - Followed other reviews and used 4 Tbsp butter melted and poured in the pan and cooked for 25 mins turning twice and spooning the butter over the chicken- Also let this rest for 10 mins to really hold in the moisture and the result was 4 spotless plates!  Even my picky 5 year old gobbled it up. Thanks!

this was really good, i went a little over board with the garlic salt and it was too salty but that was completely my fault.  chicken came out tender and juicy, had a nice garlic buttery flavor.  served it with mashed potatos and made gravy out of the drippings in the baking dish.

Really good, moist chicken.  Didn't have to use a knife to cut it and husband and kids kept asking when dinner would be ready.  Was crispy and golden brown and batter stayed on chicken...plus in my book.  I did add more seasoning (garlic powder, seasoning salt, onion powder & italian seasoning).  I just added about a tablespoon of each to cracker crumbs along with salt and pepper.  My 7 yr old ate almost two good size pieces of this...a rarity.  Thanks!

Absolutely love it!  
Although, to be honest, I took the advice of other reviewers before trying it as is like I normally do - it just sounded so good with all the other stuff in it too.  I do intend on trying as is and will update when I do.  So here's the changes I made:
I used 1/2 stick of butter (1/4 cup)
1 tube of Ritz crackers
3 breasts because they were HUGE and I cut them into strips
1 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp italian seasoning (might try less next time)
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp grated parmesan cheese
all mashed up in a bag like shake-n-bake
I did use the egg then put it in the bag, had no problem with the crackers sticking.  Took about 35-40 minutes to bake at 375, but again, the breasts were huge, even cut up.
It was delicious and my husband doesn't want me to change anything... except maybe make more next time.

This was SO delicious!  I followed the recipe, the only change I made was to the cracker crumbs. I used Ritz crackers with garlic powder, onion powder, fresh ground pepper, a pinch or two of chicken bouillon (which wasn't necessary, but I figured why not?) and a small handful of shredded cheddar cheese (just because I had some in the fridge and someone else had suggested it).  The first 2 pieces didn't really have a lot of breading on them, it wouldn't stick, so I double dipped the last 2 pieces and sprinkled the remainder of the crumb mixture over the top.  I used the amount of butter listed, putting a little bit on each piece of chicken and the rest in the bottom of the pan.  I flipped the chicken about halfway through the baking, and it came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!  Not at all mushy as someone suggested, it was a good texture.  We both loved it, I can't wait to try the leftover piece for lunch tomorrow.  I served this with mashed potatoes, gravy (I made a packet of McCormick chicken gravy) and steamed veggies...will absolutely be making this again!!

I make a similar version of this using legs and thighs.  I rub the chicken first (with or without skin) with 1-2 packages of dry Italian Good Seasons Dressing and then dip in egg and then crackers.  One of our favorites.

First, let me say thanks to Heather for a great recipe, it's one you can tweak to your own personal preferences. I did tweak this a little...I used Perdue boneless skinless chicken tenders...used buttery Club crackers...seasoned the cracker crumbs with old bay and some paprika...marinated the chicken for a few hours in buttermilk, skipped the egg entirely...and it still came out great! I will definitely use this recipe again!

This works nicely, but one trick I learned long ago is to season the meat, not the coating.  When adding the garlic salt, black pepper of whatever, you do not want it randomly showing up on some of the meat during the coating process.  It's better to always season the meat directly, then go thru your dredging process

Could not believe how good this was! Needed something easy and this fit the bill. Husband said was the best chicken he had ever eaten. I agree - super moist - made the recipe exactly as suggested. Can't wait to make again!

40 minutes is NOT too long to cook this. I did buy some very thick boneless chicken breasts,but they weren't done until they had cooked an hour. I like my chicken DONE though. 
Overall this recipe is great.

Incredible. In the past year my family has decided that this is their favorite meal! I always add parmesan cheese into the cracker mix, as well as minced garlic. I often mix up the crackers,cheese and minced garlic - throw it into a ziploc bag and store in the fridge - very handy. We make chicken tenders with this, and have also topped the chicken at the very end with warm marinara or spaghetti sauce for a little something different! Thank you very much for this recipe!!!

This chicken is wonderful, the first time I made it I used Ritz "round crackers" and it was ok - next time I used Club crackers and it was GREAT!

One of the best breaded chicken recipes out there. Really delicious. My husband loves it. I add a bit more seasong to it and cut the butter in half, but that's it.

I made this last night and my husband and kids loved it!  I have a 2yr old son that eats like a bird and hates meat.  He ate 1 1/2 chicken breasts for dinner.  My husband and I were shocked!  It has already been requested by everyone for dinner again.  I want to say thank you to Heather for this recipe.  I actually heard my son say "more, more, more" for the first time!

Tried this last night and my husband raved about it.  We both really enjoyed this recipe and it's a definite keeper.  Easy to fix, flavorful, tender and juicy.  I cooked it for 30 minutes at 375 and it was perfect!

This recipe is wonderful!  I used roasted vegetable crackers to add a little extra flavor and the whole family LOVES this chicken...even my picky 6 year old son.  The best part....it is so easy.

What else can I add that hasn't been said about this recipe. Reduce the butter but otherwise this is the best baked chicken I have ever eaten. Will definitely make again.

The chicken was a big hit with my family.  I used low sodium cracker, egg beaters and I can't beleive it's not butter.  At the end of the cooking time I turn my broiler on to crisp it up some more.  Great chicken.

I make this often, though I generally cut the chicken into strips and do it that way. I also add a packet of powdered ranch dressing mix instead of salt and pepper and it gives it amazing flavor. I've also used saltines when I haven't had butter crackers. Also, I melt the butter first then drizzle it over the chicken before it goes into the oven instead of putting the cubes in the pan.

This one is a keeper for sure! I'm 22 years old and a struggling cook in the kitchen. This dish turned out perfectly! I think a big trick to cooking any kind of meat is not to overcook. I took the chicken out 5 minutes early and it was perfectly cooked - plump and juicy.

I made this just as written and it was wonderful.  My family said it was the best chicken they have ever had.  It was very moist and tender.  I have made it several times now with fantastic results every time.  I have gone a step further and used this recipe but substituted cod for chicken and baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and it was fantastic.

I make this exact dish all the time- the Ritz crackers give it a delicious flavor! I also add shredded cheddar to the cracker crumb mixture. The cheddar and buttery crackers are NOT like your typical breaded chicken taste!!

Tried this recipe twice so far. I took the suggestion of others and added some extra seasoning (Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute). The chicken was pretty tasty, but I only cook it for about 25-30 minutes (half the time on one side, half the time on the other). 

Here's the dilemma: cooking for 25 minutes produces perfectly cooked and moist chicken, but the breading is a little mushy. I've noticed other reviewers complaining of dried-out chicken. Next time I'll try 35 minutes, and hopefully it'll be just right.

It was ok. There's a huge lack of flavor. If I ever make these again must remember to add more seasoning.

I cut down on the butter as others mentioned.  I didn't really measure it, so I may have cut it by more than half.  I sort of went overboard on the seasonings, so next time I think I'll stick closer to the recipe.  But I really liked this, the chicken stayed juicy and tender and it really was easy!

I tweaked the recipe to meet our needs, but the chicken turned out perfectly tender and crispy (thanks for the clue about halving the chicken breasts - they didn't cook unevenly this way). I used crushed Club crackers and 3 tsp. of Wildtree Garlic and Herb blend along with 1/2 tsp. of salt (this particular Wildtree blend doesn't include any salt). Put all of the dry ingredients in a large, plastic Ziploc bag, dipped each piece of chicken in the eggs, dropped the chicken in the bag, and shook to my heart's content. Thanks for this recipe!

SO GOOD!  I used the thin cutlets (not a thick breast) and just used little flicks and flakes of butter here and there and they were perfect!   Cooked up so fast too - love those thin sliced cutlets!

I used Ritz crackers, 1 egg and cut back on the butter. Also added powdered garlic (no garlic salt). Next time I want to add italian seasoning. It was tender and tasty.

This was...okay.  I think it would be better if you were to use less butter, melt it, and drizzle it over the chicken instead of just setting it in the pan around the chicken.  I did that (and only used about 3 tablespoons of butter total) and my chicken got very soggy.

VERY good chicken! I did modify it a bit..but the base idea I think was very good. I used 3 chicken breast. (Note that it will most definitally cook in less time if you use tenderloins because they are thinner pieces of chicken) I put buttery crackers into my kitchen aid chopped and chopped it fine.I then added the ingredients called for but also added cayenne pepper powder, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, basil, paprika, and parmesian cheese.. I just did a few shakes of each. I then used 2 eggs beaten with a couple drops of milk...breaded my chicken and arranged in the pan. Now, I only used 2 tablespoons of stick butter cut into thin slices and arranged around and on top of the pan.. to make it lighter but still have the butter flavor. I cooked for 20 minutes on each side. Was very moist wihtout being over done and definitally a keeper!

This is a great recipe!! We had none left and my family asks for it all the time.  For the last 20 min. of baking, I have added some very well drained frozen broccli on top of each chicken breast and then after I take out of the oven,I lay a slice of american or cheddar cheese over the top of that to melt.  It is just like the Cheddar, Broccli Chicken at Cracker Barrell.  Great!!!!

What an adaptable recipe!  I only had one egg, so I used a splash of milk to make up for the missing egg.  No garlic salt, so I used garlic powder with a little salt.  I also used chicken tenders.  They cooked up in only 20 minutes.  Oh, they now have Wheat Ritz crackers...don't know if they're much healthier but they sure tasted good. Both my kids cleaned their plates, and my husband had seconds!  I will definitely make this again!

I made the mistake of listening to a reviewer and gave this recipe a chance! Can’t understand where all the five stars came from. In my opinion, it was a waste of good chicken. There was NO taste to the chicken other than melted butter and buttered crackers. Yuck! I substituted garlic salt for real garlic and cooked breasts entire 40 minutes. (They were thick breasts from the butcher). Am really disappointed and will never make again.

This recipe is good, but I really don't understand all the 5 star ratings.  40 minutes at 375 is about right if you like dry chicken.   I might try it one more time but I think i'll fry it in a mixture of half butter and half canola oil next time.  I think it will be much juicier and turn out better.

I make this recipe quite often. I love it! I can change up the seasonings to suite the rest of my meal plan. I have made the corn flake recipe and find the flakes get soggy, not crispy! I'm afraid "COOT" leads a bland life.

I've made this a few times now and it always goes over great!  I pound my chicken a little with a mallet to make sure it comes out tender. works like a charm.

I have made this dish many, many times.  I've used it as a base recipe to try some variations as well.  For example, instead of dipping the chicken breasts in egg, I have tried ranch dressing as well as plain old mayo.  Both keep the chicken breast very moist and tender, and it helps create some variety to the recipe if you make it often.    To ensure that both sides stay crispy, I usually put the chicken on a greased Pampered Chef cooling rack that is then on top of a rectangular Pampered Chef baking stone (the cooling rack balances perfectly on top of it). This allows the air to circulate under the chicken and avoids one side getting soggy.  Great recipe!

Always looking for a good chicken recipe.  This one was good-a hit with the kids.  A little to much butter to have on a weekly basis but good flavor.

This is yummy! The only change I made was to add about 1/2 tsp. Lawry's season salt to the cracker crumbs and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. It was great, nice crunchy coating and moist inside. There was a lot of butter left in the pan, so I made a milk gravy from the drippings. Served this with mashed potatoes. Sinfully good!

I went back and read the reviews to see if there were any other experiences such as mine, and there were a few scattered throughout.  I hate to say it, but this was boring and tasteless, and the chicken was tough on top of that.  I followed the recipe exactly.  If you are on a bland diet, this one's for you.  Very disappointing!

I thought that the chicken was very moist and yummy. I little too buttery for my taste, but my husband(who adds butter to EVERYTHING imaginable) :) absolutely loved it. I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!
Oh yeah, I am a calorie counter, so I used reduced fat crackers, blue bonnet light margarine, and I dipped the eggs in egg beaters. They came out great. Thank you SO much for this recipe :)

I loved it! I followed all the suggestions here and used a smaller glass baking dish and cut down on the butter. I jazzed up the spices and used the juices, chicken stock and a little cornstarch and made some gravy to serve on rice. Along with some steamed asparagus and a crisp salad it was a great meal!

5 stars for ease and overall taste. Most people probably already have what the recipe calls for on hand. This is one of the few chicken dishes where I will use the really large boneless chx breasts because they will not dry out or become tough. They were so large I did use the 13x9 pan and all the butter. Flip halfway thru cooking so both sides get nice and brown and crispy. Very simple weekday meal that everyone enjoyed. Served with poppy seed broccoli from this site.

I am giving this 5 stars.... I followed the recipe but did cut the butter to 1/2 stick.  My kids loved it, said it was the best yet.  They loved the coating better than normal bread crumbs.  A definite keeper.

Unbelievable moist, flavourful and delicious.  I try to make this at least once a week.  Also, I find flipping the chicken half way thru cooking time lets both sides get that dark juicy texture and look.

This is our FAVORITE way to make chicken.  We use the garlic butter ritz crackers and only half the butter.  That's more than enough.  We also double coat it.  Super easy recipe and the chicken is very tender!

A very simple and good recipe.  If you like a little spice in your food, you definitely have to add your own, as the garlic powder and pepper just don't do it alone.  I added seasoned salt, and next time I will try it with an italian herb seasoning, just to give it some more flavour.

I found out at the last minute that I didn't have any garlic salt, so I substituted onion salt.  It was delicious!  It is almost like Chicken Kiev without the hassel!  The kitchen smelled wonderful and we had NO LEFTOVERS!  Next time I will have to double the recipe.  Delicious, thank you!

I thought that this recipe was very good. My husband really enjoyed it also. I am on weight watchers, so I used reduced fat crackers, blue bonnet "light" margerine, and "Better N Eggs" egg substitute. It turned out great though :)

Fabulous, fast easy chicken!  Knowing our families want for spices, I did pound the chicken breasts, and added some seasoned salt and additional pepper to the crumb mix.

This cooking method does nothing kind for crackers or chicken. Omit the egg, dip the chicken in melted butter, and bake on a rack above your cookie sheet (so that the bottom doesn't get wet). I believe the beautiful picture that is luring everyone to make this recipe is actually crushed cornflake crumbs, which is a valid choice as well -- but not if you also use the egg wash. Note: I did not find the chicken bland or tasteless, I rather like the flavor of buttered, baked Ritz crackers personally. If you are unsure, by all means add whatever seasonings strike your tastebuds.

This was ok.  Definitely quick and easy, just not quite as yummy as I was expecting.  Everyone in the family was ok with it, but no one seems to think it is a dish they would request or care to have again.

A-MA-ZING! I only used probably 1/4 cup butter, melted it, and drizzled it over the top before baking. I flipped them half way through the cooking time, and they turned out beautifully!

Loved this!! Hubby (who is  super picky) and kids loved it as well. I reccomend covering the chicken with aluminum foil to really lock the moisture in!!

Very good!  As soon as I took it out of the oven and served it, I went "This is my Mom's Chicken Parmesan!"  I used some advice of other reviewers: Added paprika and onion powder, sprinkled parmesan on top of the chicken, added 1/4c flour to cracker crumbs, and also put the crackers in a ziploc to crush with a rolling pin!  The bag broke though (cheaper plastic bag I found in italy- they don't really have "ziploc").  Also I don't think margarine exists here so i cut a few slices of butter and stuck them around the chicken and on top, along with another reviewer's idea of putting sliced garlic around the chicken! Delicious!

This was really simple and delicious. It gives you the great feel and comfort as fried chicken with the health of baked chicken. The flavor of the seasons are really packed into the cracker crumbs!

Very Good...I made these as directed and added flour, and add'l seasoning as per other reviews.  Also, baked for 25 minutes turning twice during the cooking time, and since they didn't brown I turned on the broiler for an add'l 2-3 minutes a side.  Easy,  easy recipe!  Will be making this again.

I read the other reviews and used less butter. I used about 1/3 it was more than plenty. Next time though, I will use flour to help stick the crumbs onto the chicken better. Also, I used Ritz crackers. The worked great flavor wise, just didn't really stick. I will definitely do this again and use flour. Everyone loved it!

Excellent! I used Buttery Garlic Club Crackers and omitted the Garlic salt since the crackers were already made with garlic.  I made double so I could freeze it and have it on hand throughout the month.

I have made this several times and it is always tender and delicious.  I cut boneles chicken breasts in half to have a bigger ratio of breading to chicken.  Looks good and tastes good.

We enjoyed this recipe. My batter was 1 egg and 1/4c buttermilk. For easy coating, I smashed my cracker crumbs in a large plastic bag. Added 2 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp seasoning salt, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp salt and shook the chicken in the bag to coat evenly. I only used 2 tbsp of butter in my Pyrex pan and it was plenty.

Excellent recipe! I made this tonight for my husband and I and we both loved it! I didn't have the 'Buttery Round Crackers' on hand, so I substituted regular Saltine cracker crumbs.. it tasted great! Also I agree with others who said 40 min is a bit long, 30 min is just right. Also, flipping it half way through helps the crumbs on both sides to get browned and tasty.

Very moist chicken.  Good flavor.  Even the picky "littles" liked it.  I would probably give it more like a 4 1/2, but that wasn't an option.  After reading several reviews, I did use only 1/2 stick of butter and it turned out just fine.

This chicken tastes better everytime I make it! The only changes I make to the recipe are with the breading. I use the crackers, but I add some grated parmesan cheese, a bit of parsley (you can eyeball it), and a bit of garlic powder for extra flavor. I love this recipe! The crackers are such a simple yet brilliant idea!

THANK YOU HEATHER! seriously. my 5 year old would only eat frozen chicken fingers....WELL...he made this with me...we watched him slowly devour it...bite after bite...and we were secretly cheering as we saw it disappear! (probably did not hurt that we used dinosaur shaped ritz crackers)...so thank you for saving our son from a life of frozen meats! advice to other moms: try it!

Really good and easy to make. I used half the butter, melted it, then drizzled it on top of the chicken, not around the chicken like the recipe states. Do it this way and your chicken will be cripsy, not mushy.

Very bland and soggy.  Maybe add a lot more spices and some Panko breadcrumbs (Japanese Breadcrumbs) to the crackers, spray the baking dish with Pam and add the butter the last 10 minutes with a couple of tablespoons of sherry.

I have very picky eaters and they both gobble this up!  Othe reveiws indicated that this recipe was a little bland, but that's what my kids like, which it is why I tried it.  I used a row of Club crackers and the shake-n-bake method.  VERY EASY to make.  I also used about half the butter called for and that was plenty.

Was okay... not much flavor, but very easy to make.  Used flavored ritz crackers.  Used leftover breasts to make a "play it by ear" spaghetti bake.  Probably won't make again, sorry.

This recipe is really good.  I was in the mood for chicken fingers one night and this was pretty close!  The crackers and butter gave the chicken a good taste.  I made this for my brother one night and he loved it. I would just like to find a substitute for the "buttery round" crackers, something with a little less fat in them.  Have made this several times.  Served with four cheese mashed potatoes!

This was quite good and super easy.  I cut the butter by about 1/3 and they were still buttery and moist.  This will go into "the rotation" in our house.  (Thanks to AllRecipe.com, recipes don't come around again the the rotation anywhere near as often as they did before.)  Thanks for sharing.

Didn't even need a knife to cut the chicken. So moist, tender and delicious! My husband asked if this can be part of our weekly menu. Made it for company (somewhat picky eaters) and they raved about it. Can't wait to have it again.

This is a great recipe--I threw some grated parmasean cheese on top of the chicken on the last 5 minutes of cooking it, and it added even more flavor!

This was so easy. I followed a few suggestions in the reviews. I put a little flour in with cracker crumbs. Baked for 35 mins. The taste is just nothing but good. I will be making this a lot.

We've made this several times over the last year, and we absolutely LOVE it. It's not a healthy meal with the heavy butter, but it's delicious and very filling. We use Ritz crackers for the coating and as much butter as we feel like, enough to cover the chicken. The first couple of times the chicken came out a bit bland - this is because we used margarine, so make sure to use BUTTER. Also, as other reviewers have said, spoon the melted butter onto the chicken a few times as it bakes in the oven. DON'T FLIP THE CHICKEN OVER OR IT WILL BE SOGGY. It doesn't have time to crisp up again if you flip it over, but if you spoon the melted butter on top of the chicken, it sinks into the meat and leaves plenty of time for the top to crisp again! Delicious recipe, love it!

The extra butter made the chicken soggy, not very appetizing. Also a pretty bland dish.

So moist! Want to have even less carbs? Instead of using the buttery crackers crush up pork rinds and use them instead! They add a wonderful flavor and have no carbs!

I love this chicken recipe, I call this my basic bake chicken. I believe we all know how much fats we care to use when preparing a meal. We know if we like things spice, salty, or savory. If I see a recipe that has a lot of salt I cut it down to my taste or if it doesn't look like it have enough spices I add more. There is never going to be a recipe out there that is a blue print to the way one cook.

My husband works nights and this has become my go-to chicken recipe when I want to make something tasty but easy for him to eat when he gets home.  I've made it as written, and also made variations based on what I have on hand.  One favorite version is to pound the chicken flat and cut it into strips to make chicken fingers.  They don't take as long to cook as full breasts.  My husband is lactose intolerant, so I try to go easy on the butter.  Instead of placing it all around the chicken, I cut butter into small chunks and place a couple chunks on each piece of chicken which melt and coat the chicken, keeping it moist.  One time I substituted bread crumbs for crackers and it turned out just as good.  Another time I substituted coating the chicken in mayonnaise instead of egg before breading and it gave a slightly different flavor.  It's hard to screw this recipe up.

Super easy.  I followed the suggestion of adding 1/2 cup of flour to the cracker crumbs.  I don't know how much of a difference that makes since this was the first time I made it, but with the way the chicken turned out, I'll keep adding the flour.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for dinner last night making a few changes.  I had nearly a pound of chicken (14 oz.) and I used one egg and only needed about half of it.  I used 1/2 cup crushed crackers and didn't need quite all of that.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper, then dredged it in flour, then dipped in egg, then in crumbs.  I was concerned the bottom would be soggy, so I only coated the top side of the chicken.  I melted the butter, cutting it back to just 2 T. and drizzled it over the top of the chicken.  For me, this was done after baking for only about 28 minutes.  The 40 minutes suggested in the recipe would have been too long.  This was good, but needed some pizzazz.  Next time I might try using half parmesan cheese and half the cracker crumbs for the crumb mixture.

This was a huge hit, even for my picky 8 year old.  I used 1 sleeve of reduced fat Townhouse crackers, 1/8 cup flower and 1/8 cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I used a plastic bag to "shake and bake" a couple at a time.  I used boneless breasts, each cut into 3 pieces so they'd be pick-up-able for the little one (cooked about 35 min total).  They were very moist and delicious!  I turned them twice during baking and amp'd up the heat to 425 for the last 5 or so minutes to get them a little crunchier. I served these with cauliflouwer mash and the Chicken Gravy from this site. Even though I didn't feel healthy eating this, I know I will make again!  Worth it :)

I gave this 4 stars due to changes needed to the original recipe.  As suggested by others I cut the butter and the time.  I will add more pepper next time, maybe play with some other spices too, but there WILL be a next time in our house.  This was a very good starter recipe for just about any combination of spices one might want to add.  I cooked it for a birthday dinner and everyone liked it, well almost everyone.  I made some nuggets for my great nephew but being the VERY picky eater he is he didn't want to try them, so I took them for lunch the next day....his loss!  Very tender and juicy and they look so crunchy even though they are actually soft breaded.

Delicious!  My husband even had seconds and my daughter just loved it.  I thought it was going to be bland and dry but thought to give it a try to do something different with chicken.  It was very moist and crunchy.  I read some of the reviews and thought to add a little here and there as well.  First of all, I seasoned my chicken beforehand(pepper, seasoning salt and onion power) and I also cut the breasts in halves.   I also added 1/4 cup of flour to crumb mixture to help the crumbs stick to the chicken plus onion power, garlic powder and paprika to the crumb mixture - all in a large ziplock bag.  After dipping in the eggs, I placed about 3 pieces of chicken in the bag with the crumb mix and shook until each was fully coated and placed in glass 9x13 pan - repeat until all chicken pieces are coated.  Any crumbs left over, I pressed it onto the chicken for extra crispyness.  Then I followed the recipe in regards to butter, temp and cooking time.  Can't wait for tonight's leftovers per my daughter!

CAME OUT SO TENDER! Yum :) Husband and two kids under 5 enjoyed it! I did as others suggested and added more spices (seasoning salt, italian seasoning, garlic powder). Put it in a ziploc baggy with Club crackers and did the "shake". I used 1/2 cup melted butter and poured it over the chicken after putting it in the baking dish. I also topped the chicken with parmesan cheese. Cooked for 30 min, no cover and used ranch for dipping sauce. Will make again!

This is amazing !  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and spiced it up with garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper.  The chicken was so tender, juicy and flavorful !!  Will be making this again.

This is Awesome!!! I added parmesan cheese to the crushed crackers. And the minced garlic to abt 2 tablespoon of butter while heating the oven... (WARNING: Do not add too much butter as it will turn soggy or takes longer time to turn crispy which will result in dry chicken~) I baked it for 35 mins. it was perfect! The chicken breast was so tender and moist that I dun even need a knife..

I made this last night and it was amazing!  My husband commented that it was the most tender chicken he had ever eaten.  I followed some of the suggestions and threw in some fresh Parmesan cheese and extra spices in with the crackers.  I'm adding this to my recipe collection.

This was delicious!! Even my boy who doesn't like chicken gobbled it up. I used Club crackers (it's what I had) and it tasted great with them. Will definitely make this easy recipe again.

EVERYONE WILL LOVE THESE! 

Great base recipe. I crumbled ritz crackers (about a cup) and added some italian seasoning and garlic salt to the mix. Next, I dipped the chicken tenderloins in the beaten eggs and rolled it around in the crumb mixture. Lastly, I put the tenderloins on a foil covered baking sheet and drizzled a mixture of melted butter (2tbs), white wine vinegar (tsp), and canned minced garlic(dash) over the tenderloins. I baked for 25 minutes @ 350 and flipped them half way. 

My goal was a delicious snack for movie night with my husband. We absolutely loved them...GREAT FLAVOR!, but they were a bit greasy to the touch. We wanted something we could pick up and dip in bbq, honey mustard, etc...though these didn't need any dipping sauce..maybe next time I will just try putting the broiler on for a bit to make them more crispy.

Good but wouldn't make again. Cooked my chicken only 35 min. and thought it was kind of dry. Added italian seasoning, black pepper and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I've had better. Sorry.

Good but VERY buttery.  Not the healthiest way to prepare chicken, but the boyfriend loves this recipe.   I reduce the butter to about 1/2 stick.

GREAT FLAVOR!! I used a whole package of club crackers which i crushed and then used a hand held blender to make the crumbs more even sized.  I also used onion powder and garlic powder since the butter I used was salted.  Instead of using whole eggs I used egg whites, it turned out perfect.  I served the chicken with country style mashed potatoes and some scalloped corn what a great meal !! :0)

My only problem was that I followed the other reviews and shortened the baking time. The result was way underdone. Next time I'm sticking to the recipe!

Simply amazing!!  The most delicious chicken I've had.  It practically melts in your mouth!  The only change I made was that I added some seasoning salt, Italian seasoning, and parmesan to the crumb mixture and put it in a ziplock back instead of a shallow bowl so that I could coat the chicken "shake & bake" style.  Even my kids loved it!

this was pretty good, but i had hoped the breading would have been more crisp, instead was kind of butter logged- perhaps i will try again, but pound my chicken thinner, use less butter and turn a couple of times so it does not get soggy

I'm glad so many others here liked this recipe, but it just didn't do it for my family. I did try to jazz it up with extra garlic and herbs for seasoning, as others had suggested, and it certainly did smell wonderful while cooking... but the end result was just kind of ordinary. Yes, the chicken was moist... just not very tasty. I must be missing something, I guess!

cut chicken into pieces (and adjust cook time) for more breading to chicken ratio.  watch the salt...crackers have a lot so i suggest garlic powder instead.

Pretty good, quick to prep and serve.  I omitted all but 2 TBs of butter and just used the Buttery Seasoning to add flavor.  It was still very moist

Easy to make on a busy week night. Took other's advice and added 1 tablespoon flour to the crumbs, some italian seasoning, basil, and paparika. I baked it for about 35 minutes and it was delicious. Served well with angel hair pasta and crescent rolls. Will definetly make again!

Amazing, perfect chicken!  I pounded the chicken breasts so they were an even thickness.  I used only about 5 Tbsp. butter, cut it into little pieces and placed it on top of the chicken.  It came out crispy, and the chicken tender and juicy.  The only other change I would recommend is only using 1 egg, I found that 2 eggs weren't necessary.

This was very easy and tasted great!  We used breast tenderloins and Club crackers instead, and added extra seasoning to the mix.  My fiance loved it!  The only change would be to used less butter next time, but it was still good!  An excellent base recipe!

This was an easy and delicious way to make chicken. Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder as we aren't big on salty foods. I also baked on a low rack on top of a cookie sheet so that both sides were crispy and brown. The family loved it. Served with fried potatoes and green beans for a quick week day meal. Thanks.

I have made this over and over - husband loves it! Always says the chicken is moist. One tip is that (in my over at least), the chicken tends to be done 5 minutes before the suggested cooking time. Also, I tried cooking this using "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter - Light" and it was not as good. Use the real stuff!

Well, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with this recipe.  The chicken was certainly edible, but not great by any means.  The coating ended up being quite gummy. I definitely won't add this to my list of recipes I'd make again.

We really enjoyed this.  Agree with all the other reviewers that the chicken is tender, the flavor is great and it couldn't be easier.  BTW read another review that said it was bland, but the reviewer substituted whole grain crackers for the Ritz type crackers.   If you don't have "buttery round crackers", make something else.  It's kind of a key ingredient.

This was a excelent chicken recipe. I have to admit I couldn't bake it like the recipe calls for, but instead I pan fried it. It still kept its nice and crispy outer coating and was nice and tender. So if you're little on time you can pan fry it. Also, this is a recipe with subtle seasonings, so you can add some more spices to your liking if you prefer a more flavorfull chicken, and still if it seems a little bland you can try adding a sauce like a creamy mushroom sauce or even some gravy.

I LOVE the cracker crumb coating!! I have been doing my chicken this way for a while now. I just add a little garlic powder and sometimes a little parmesan.  I like to use the thin boneless breasts and you can do them in a pan on the stove too.  If you don't want all the fat of the butter, try using olive oil!  Bye-bye breadcrumbs!!!!

Wonderful recipe all around! Thank You so much! I sprinkled some of the extra crumb mixture on top of the chiken and I used a full stick of butter, sliced and put some of the slices on top of the chicken.

Very good! I used chicken tenderloins and baked for 25 minutes, turning over the last 5 minutes. I only used 1/2 stick of butter and it came out perfect. I did sprinkle a little Lawrey's seasoned salt over top. This is a keeper!

I love this recipe and have made it multiple times.  Those of you who say it is lacking flavor, what I suggest is to brine the chicken.  I always brine my chicken, for every chicken dish I make, and it really helps keep the chicken moist and it's always flavorful. That way you can enjoy the buttery taste more instead of focusing on the blandness of the chicken.

I cooked this for the first time today.  I was skeptical at first because the recipe seemed to basic.  I used garlic and herb seasoning on the chicken and mixed it in with the cracker crumbs.  I also included parmesan cheese and italian bread crumbs in the cracker crumb mixture. I used thin sliced chicken (I think you taste the flavor of the spices on thinner cuts of meat. I reduced the butter amount to half of what the recipe calls for and this chicken was still awesome!!

I made this last night for a quick supper, and Husband, whom is normally picky about baked chicken because it can get dry, loved it.  He especially liked the cracker crumb crust (I used whole wheat Ritz).  I used only half the butter.  This will become a part of our regular basic chicken rotation.

This was SOOO incredible.  I absolutely loved it, and the chicken came out so tender!  I will make this a part of my repertoire!

I did add some seasonings - parsley, pepper, a little garlic, etc.

I found these to be bit soggy from all the butter.  Did not enjoy and will not make again.  Maybe it was something I did, but I followed the recipe to a "T".

Ok, I was skeptical... This recipe sounded bland to me, but easy enough to at least try it out for the kids.  Wow! What a surprise.  My only changes: Adding "multi season" season salt to the crumb mixture (No, it wasn't salty)  Spray the bottom of the pan with non-stick spray, reduce the butter to 1/4 cup, use thin slices of chicken breast, lightly spray the chicken with spray butter once in the pan, turn the chicken over half way through and cook on 400 degrees for less time to get a crispier coating. (The chicken was still very moist) My picky 8 year old and her friends loved it (and so did I)!  Another tip, put your cracker crumbs and other seasoning in a large zip lock bag and use a rolling pin to get a finer crumb mixture - better for coating).

I just made this recipe last night. My entire family loved it. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. I did make a few changes to the recipe. I used garlic and herb crackers. I also seasoned the chicken to give it extra flavor. I used only 2 table spoons of butter. I sprayed the pan with olive oil and the chicken and put  butter spray (0 calories) on the chicken to give it more of a butter taste. I also included parmesean cheese in the cracker bowl. It taste great cold also and I took some left over to work so will see how it will taste heated up.
thanks for the recipe.

I have used this recipe ever since I found it on this site and it continues to be one of our favorites! I even use it for company and everyone loves it. It is so easy and the buttery crackers make it so tasty. It is moist and never dry. If you are looking for a great easy chicken dish this is it!

This was pretty good. I may cut back to 1/4 cup butter next time as I ended up with a lot of liquid butter at the end, or I'll plan a side dish that can utilize the chicken-flavored butter.  Over all though the chicken was decently crispy (used less time to cook than the recipe called for because my chicken breasts were fairly thin) and flavorful. I patted  garlic powder and ground black pepper on the chicken before coating and also added some Tony Chachere's to the cracker crumbs (with the garlic salt and ground pepper). Wonderfully flavorful. My boyfriend doesn't usually like breaded items unless they have a gravy, but this time he ate all he was given and finished off the leftovers!

I used a lot less butter than what was called for. I melted the butter and poured it over the chicken. I cooked the chicken for 45 min. instead of just 40min. so it was a little crispy brown on the top.

Very good and very easy! You can adapt this recipe to suit your family's personal preferences.  I used crushed Ritz crackers seasoned with dry ranch dressing mix, garlic powder and black pepper.  I melted the butter and poured all over the chicken. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better!
Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I can imagine this recipe would have been bland without the use of some additional spices. I used Garlic Butter Ritz crackers and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and salt. Came out tender and tasty. I'd make it again, my four yr old really enjoyed it.

Fantastic chicken recipe!  Super easy, too!  My husband and children loved it.  I chuckle at all of you worried about the fat content.  At our house we have carb issues, not fat issues.  This actually fits in nicely with my diabetic diet and my husband's low carb diet.  The only carbs are in the crackers, and I think that works about to about 10 g. of carbs per serving.  I made it exactly as printed, and it turned out perfect--very moist.  This is a keeper!  It would be easy to double to feed dinner guests.

I thought that this recipe was a good alternative to other chicken breadings that I have tried. It tasted like fried chicken, but was much easier. I also added extra spices, which made it quite tasty in my opinion. My husband really liked it as well, and he is not a very bug chicken fan. So, all in all a pretty good recipe. I would recommend not using as much butter, I used a little less than the recipe called for, and in my opinion it was still a little bit too much.

Well, this recipe gave me a GREAT starting point - that's why I only rated it 4 stars - I didn't really follow the recipe.  I'm in Switzerland so many ingredients are not available here.  I used Sesame Crackers for the breading.  I used Pampered Chef Lemon Pepper that I brought from the States for seasoning.  I marinated the chicken in an egg mixture (egg, milk, fresh garlic, Lemon Pepper Seasoning, and some milk) for about 2 hours.  Then, I slit open the breasts and put in some Gruyere cheese.  Then I breaded chicken with the crushed sesame crackers (also added some of the Lemon Pepper seasoning and onion salt to the cracker coating) and baked with maybe a Tablespoon of butter for about 30 - 40 minutes.  It was wonderful.  My fiance loved it and said that it should definitely go in the "make again" category.  I'd still like to see some more spice in it.  Perhaps some Italian Seasoning or spicy pepper as some others have suggested.  Overall - this recipe was a great starter for me - I just took the advice of some others and made it a little differently.  The chicken was extremely moist.

This was a great recipe, very tasty. Instead of buttery rounds I used Ritz cheese flavoured crackers and I didn't use as much butter, I also thought it worked best if you turned the chicken half-way through for even distribution of the butter.

Quick and easy, but best of all delicious! I've made this several times using Panko crumbs and, on occasion, crushed cornflakes. All three breadings are very good with chicken. Thanks Heather. Its a keeper at my house!

OHMYGOSH!  What a terrific recipe!  I was very skeptical that this would be anything great, but was limited on time and ingredients and decided to take the word of all the other reviewers.  I'm so glad I did - this goes into my "make it again and again" recipe file.  We like spicy food, so I added the following to the cracker crumbs: 2 tablespoons cajun seasoning, extra pepper, itialian seasoning, garlic powder.  My husband and I both fell for it -- juicy, easy, fast.  It didn't look like cracker-coated chicken, rather it seemed more like upper-end restaurant fare.  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!

I added Pampered Chef's Lemon Pepper where the recipe called for black pepper.  It gave the chicken a little lemon kick!

I continue to use this great recipe, thank you!!!! and several friends (even one who doesn't cook at all) now make it as well, and it is univerally loved by all, especially kids.  After 7? years of making it, these are the tricks I use... first, I put 2 pats of butter in the bottom of the pan and melt it in the oven before I put the raw, battered chicken in...second, I sprinkle Lowry's after placing the pats of butter around it.  The non-cook's husband loves it and he owns about 20 great restaurants. She makes it using chicken tenders.  One last note, if I don't use good chicken, it's not so good.  If I use the local "safeway-esque" frozen/thawed chicken, it's usually gummy and unpleasant, the better the chicken you use, the better it tastes (i.e. never frozen) most recipes I use aren't like this, but this one really tastes better with fresh chicken.  Also, if it is slightly overcooked, it's not so good, I take it out when the juices just run clear and the pink has just gone away...if it's right on the edge, I'll turn off the oven and just let it sit for a couple of minutes in the oven, then it's done and not overcooked.  Lastly, it cools quickly and is better warm, so it's best pretty much oven-to-table.  Really, thanks for a favorite.

EXCELLENT! My husband loved it, and went back for seconds. I made it with Italian crumbs, but next time will use garlic powder, and maybe a little less butter. But it was GREAT and I will definately make this one again.

I've been making this recipe for years except I was using flour to coat the chicken. Not anymore, the crushed cracker crumbs are perfect for the coating. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. This recipe is a must try. You will enjoy it.

We all loved this and it's  so easy to  make.  I added garlic, garlic-salt, pepper, onion  powder, and   Italian  seasoning  to crumb mixture before  adding  chicken  to  it.  I tripled the recipe  and baked 3 pans of it for 25 minutes. Other reviwers mentioned that the bake time should be for about that long, so I attempted to heed the advice.  However, When I  removed  it  from  the  oven, I discovered  that  I  forgot  to  add  the  butter!!   So, I added the butter, and baked  it for 10 more minutes.  Apparently  this  recipe  is  a no-fail one.  My chicken  came  out  perfect.  Everyone  loved  it , and there  wasn't  one  piece  left!

Made this twice in one week, the second time as sandwiches. My variation was to slice the chicken horizontally so I had two thinner pieces, and to flip them over and run them under the broiler for about 2-3 minutes at the end so both sides were crispy.  Served on buttered, toasted sesame seed buns with shredded lettuce, mayo and onion -- awesome dinner! 5/5 loved it  - can't ask for more than that!

I have never written a recipe review before, but I had to for this one. It is the BEST. My husband said it was the best chicken he has ever tasted. I did change a  few things. I used 2 breast because it was just for the two of us, dipped them in seasoned flour (garlic powder, onion powder, Kickin Chicken, salt and pepper), then in the egg, and then in the crackers. I used one sleeve of Town House Crackers. This is on our "favorite" menu list.

Made this tonight. I added 1T milk to the egg mixture and added my spices to the egg wash.  I put my cracker crumbs in a ziplock bag.  I dipped my chicken breasts in flour before dipping them in the egg wash, then put them in the ziplock bag to coat with crumbs.  I sprayed my baking dish with non-stick cooking spray and placed breaded chicken breasts in the dish.  I froze 1/2 stick of butter, then grated it over the breasts, as recommended by another reviewer.  I used only 3T of butter to cover my breasts.  I baked them for 30 minutes and they were perfectly done -- crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Easy, delicious and much lower in fat than the original recipe!

Good but I have a question.  Every time I make boneless chicken breasts my husband complains that he hates the grizzle that runs through them.  I've tried cutting it out, a big task, but it's not the same.  Can anyone tell me a trick to make the chicken breasts without the lines running through them?  Tip I use: I like to marinate chicken in buttermilk for several hours before making any recipe with them.  Buttermilk makes them juicy, tender and tasty.

great recipe!  I used garlic granules instead of the garlic salt.  Also, put chicken in a brine for a few hours prior to baking--didn't need the egg when I coated the chicken in crumbs.

For people making a significant change to the recipe and then give it 2 or 3 stars STOP!  you're reviewing your own freaking recipe.  this called for butter crackers not corn flakes--big difference!

This was wonderful. I followed the original recipe only changing garlic powder for garlic salt. It was so moist and juicy and I loved the crunchy skin. I will definitely make again.

I make this all the time and we always love it.  I have a tendency to add extra everything when it comes to seasoning but other than that this recipe is perfect as it is.  I just wish I kept "buttery round" crackers in the house so I could have it more!

Best chicken ever! My family loves it.  My son after not being able to eat much all wrestling season put this on his top three things to eat when he was done. Very juicy.  I have tried it with Town House and Ritz crackers and for some reason  it is better with Ritz.

I marinated the chicken in olive oil, garlic, parsley, and lemon juice.  I also used egg substitute to dredge the chicken.  My husband gave this a 10!

HAULBUR, Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! I made this recently mainly because I didn't have a lot of time nor did I have many ingredients to work with. Wow! So tasty and moist. It seemed like it would be bland so I added: fresh, crushed garlic with the butter, No Salt seasoning and some Hungarian hot paprika. This will be one of our go to recipes for sure.

I've had trouble trying new chicken recipes since making the Parmesan chicken breast.  I decided to try this tonight and it is a new favorite.  This was some of the best chicken I have ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is so easy, and oh so good! It's moist, tender and just what my husband likes. I haven't made any changes except for a small sprinkle of red pepper since we like spicey food. I serve it with yellow rice and a green vegetable. Try it you will love it.

I thought at first this would be too bland (even with the extra garlic powder, Cajun seasoning and cayenne I added), but the boyfriend loved it. He commented that it was very rich, buttery (obviously) and called it comfort food, and said he would definitely eat it again ("all day long", even). Like other reviewers, I shortened the cook time to 30 minutes and it came out perfectly cooked and incredibly moist and juicy. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

That amount of butter isn't necessary, so I drastically reduced.  Prepared according to directions otherwise.  I made three chicken breasts, utlizing about 2-3 tbsp of butter total.  My husband said this was better even days afterward.  Will make again.

This is an old family favorite. We have it at family functions several times a year. Every once in a while, I'll use veggie flavored ritz crackers for variety. The only thing we do differently is melt the butter and pour over the chicken, and bake covered with foil at 350 for 1/2 hour, then 350 uncovered for 1/2 hour. Always a hit!

This came out very moist & good.  I anticipated it being kid-friendly so added blackening seasoning from "blackened chicken" in the crumbs.  I had six pieces so used 1c crumbs & 1/2c plain bread crumbs.  I melted 6T butter over them after refrigerating.  Baked at 375, but lost track of time.  As it is, good for kids or those sensitive to spices.  Anyone else would appreciate spices added.  If I make again, I'll double the spices.  Girl, 14, liked it & said so without being asked first. Wow.

Excellent.  Chicken was moist and breading was flavorful.  It didn't just taste like cracker crumbs over chicken which is what I was afraid it might taste like.  The kids ate every bite!

Love the coating texture and flavor.  I think it needs an herb or maybe more garlic.  (Which others have said, but I make and rate the recipe as posted, then adjust if needed)  Wife liked it more than I did, but I will be making it again with a personal touch.
(Review 2)  Added more garlic and made it with the new bacon Ritz crackers.  This was way better. (Won't change the stars because I believe in rating the real recipe)

This was kind of disgusting, especially when leftovers were re-heated.  When it was fresh out of the oven, it was just okay.  The crust was a bit soggy even when it first came out of the oven.   Once leftovers were reheated, it was disgusting.  It was extremely mushy.  A similar, much better recipe is to marinate in Italian-style salad dressing, and coat in crushed cornflakes.

This is a fantastic, quick, easy recipe.  I made it tonight and my whole family loved it...including two picky eaters.  I used only half a stick of butter - a whole stick would have been too much for my taste.  I added a bit of onion powder, paprika parmesan, and seasoned salt in with the garlic salt and pepper.  Baked it for about 35 minutes, let it rest for a few and served it with buttered noodles and veggies.  It was delish!  Definitely going into my rotation.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I love this recipe but I'm rating it 4 stars because I make a lot of modifications to it. I add paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper to the mix. I also decrease the cooking time substantially. 

I've found the recipe works fine if you take cold butter, cut it into small pieces and place it on top of the chicken so it melts while it cooks. Turns out great. 

Definitely one of my favorite chicken dishes to serve with some mashed potatoes, corn and/or salad!

Oh...such an awesome, indulgent recipe!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has so much butter.  Makes it to die for, but also very unhealthy.

FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY!!! I've been looking for a recipe on this site that makes both my husband and I extremely happy. My husband has an amazing palette so if he says that something is reeeeaaalllyyy good then it most certainly is. Thank you for posting this. It's wonderful. Though I did add a little paprika, basil and oregano to the dry mix.

OMG this is a GREAT recipe!  Hubs took a package of chicken tenders from the freezer instead of breasts, so decided to try this.  The only change I made was instead of an egg wash, I "marinated" the tenders in buttermilk I had to use up for about an hour.  I used all of the butter and cut it into pats and put one between each tender.  I even baked it longer than the indicated time....about another 30 minutes.....and it was still not dry, and no knife required it was so so tender.  Thanks for a really great recipe that I know I'll use often.  It's surely fit for company!!

My family loves this recipe, especially the kids. I do add more garlic powder to the crackers but other then that I don't make any changes. My kids wish I would make it more but all that butter makes it a once in awhile treat rather then a regular meal.

This was great!  I added a little bit of garlic to it and turned the breasts twice while cooking.  At the end, I put the broiler on for a few minutes to brown them.  

Believe it or not, I made chicken salad with the leftovers.  The coating was so light and flavorful, it was perfect.  Added celery and light mayo and the kids loved it.

Wow! All I can say is, this is going to be one of our family favorites! I used lemon pepper with th bread crumbs. And I occasionally spooned butter over the tops of the chicken. I cooked two thick breasts for 35 min at 375. Totally delicious!

Yummy and easy did use less butter and extra garlic. Also, pounded chicken a little to get more uniform thickness and cooked about 30 min.

soo good! i hate breast meat as a general rule b/c it's so dry, but the butter made the chicken so juicy, and the crackers added flavor. i used flavored crackers b/c that's what i had on hand. i will definitely make this again!

I made this for my boyfriend for dinner and it was beyond awesome!!  I used crushed buttery Townhouse Crackers - the chicken turned out SO juicy and flavorful. Did everything according to the recipe. He raved about it through the whole meal - highly recommend!

Excellent and easy recipe!  I made this in the same oven as the Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes by CathyM.  Since the potatoes needed to be at 400, I only baked the chicken for 30 minutes and kept a close eye on it.  I also used 1/3 cup butter and marinated twice as suggested.  I didn't have quite enough juice to baste the first time I opened the oven, so I put a thin pat of butter on top of each chicken breast. The second basting I just enough to cover each piece of chicken.  Turned out fabulous, my husband and 3 year old loved it.  Thanks!

Very, very nice.  I followed the reviewer who said "splash some white wine" over the breaded portions of chicken.  I used some aluminum foil to line the dish and placed each portion on top of one tsp.of butter.   Easy clean-up!   P.S.:  being a southerner, I used buttermilk instead of beaten eggs! ;o)

My picky fiance said "This is good...this is really good....this is probably the best chicken I've ever had"!! I followed the advice of another review, I used 1/3 cup of real butter (salted) and spooned the juices over the chicken x2 during cooking. My over is off so I cooked for 35 mins on 375 and they were perfect! Thanks so much for this recipe, I'm kicking myself for waiting so ling to try it.

It was tasty, but I would definitely just do 1/3 of a cup of butter and spoon over the juices at least twice during the baking process. I double coated the chicken to try and use up the egg and crackers, but before I did that I dabbed the chicken with a paper towel to make it a little dryer and rolled it in some white flour before I dipped it in the egg. It helps to secure the egg onto the chicken so when rolled in the crackers, it all adheres well without falling off. 
Let chicken sit a little while like 10 minutes before serving so the juices can build up in the breasts. 
I also used a Pampered Chef stoneware, so I cooked my 3 breasts for about 35 minutes.

I have made this twice now...First time as directed and the second changed it up a bit. The second time I used chicken tenderloins, dipped it once in egg and crackers, and then again in eggs and crackers and sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper. This gave the chicken a little bit more of a coating. This recipe is amazing!!!! Family loved it and we will definitely make this on a regular basis. Thank you for sharing!!

This chicken was pretty good, simple.  It was cooked too long and dried out, 15 minutes should be enough and needed more spice for flavor.

This was good but salty.  I cut the butter way down to less than 1/4 cup.  I use salted butter so next time I will use garlic powder or fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.

This is fantastic. I added white wine to the pan and McCormick Montreal Seasoning to the cracker crumbs. I used thinly cut chicken breasts and baked them for 20 minutes instead of 40. Insanely juicy and flavorful!!!!!!

this is so good it is ridiculous. I flip my chicken over half way through to get the yummy goodness of butter on both sides. and also, mine is organic. organic chicken, eggs, butter crackers and butter. lol

Thought this recipe was bland.  Chicken did come out nice and moist, but thought it lacked flavor.

This just didn't work well for us.  It was kind of dry.  Our chicken didn't turn out nice and golden brown, like in the picture.  We wondered if perhaps living in high altitude had anything to do with it, because we have had this kind of thing happen before.  I really wanted to like this chicken, but it just didn't work for any of us.

I really, really enjoyed this. If your chicken breasts are thicker, be sure to pound them thinner. The chicken was very moist and delicious. Next time, I might use simply regular salt and pepper.  I believe the plain taste might actually add to the flavor!  Also, you might want to drizzle a little melted butter over the top of the breasts as some of my cracker crumbs were still dry after cooking.  (Note, one tube of crackers is 1 cup.)

Awesome!! Loved it, my picky kids even ate it. I never knew that buttery crackers with chicken can taste so awesome.
I did a half stick of butter and added a little oil in the pan. Very moist.

My kids and I liked this very much. I used the whole wheat version of the butter cracker (to make it a little healthier.) It was still VERY tasty!!!!

This was only OK. I pounded the chicken breasts; used about half the butter. I really prefer another recipe "Chicken with Lemon Sauce" that you can find on this site. (No, I didn't submit it). :) Anyhow, I didn't find it flavorful or enticing.

My wife LOVES chicken so I tried this recipe for her. She loved it and so did I! 
I took advice from some of the other reviewers and seasoned the cracker crumbs with Italian seasoning and garlic and dredged the chicken in flour before dipping in egg and cracker crumbs. I also reduced the temperature to 350 degrees and cooked it for 30 minutes. The chicken was moist and the crust not soggy. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. I made it with tilapia filets and they were yummy - just cook for 10-12 minutes instead of 40. Can't wait to try it with chicken.

First I butterflied my chicken breasts so they wouldn't be too thick and dry out. Made this using store brand whole wheat ritz like crackers. Double breaded the chicken with eggs and cracker crumbs. Added a little garlic powder to the top and cooked in skillet with some olive oil. Came out with a nice crispy crust. Chicken was nice and moist and not dry, probably because the chicken was not too thick. Worked well in the pan instead of the oven. Was good and will defiantly make again.

Oh my, I just made this and it is so tender it melts in your mouth.  I made it according to recipe and only added some garlic salt and small amount of Parmesan, and some parsley to cracker crumbs.  This will be a recipe I use all the time. It is wonderful.

I made a gluten free version with crushed up Rice Chex instead of crackers. I used the amount of butter called for in the recipe and it was great, I don't know why people are cutting it in half. A lot of it stays in the pan anyway. I used a blend of Italian seasonings and put it in a bag shake and bake style as someone else here had done and it worked great. Very moist with a crunchy coating.

Highly disappointed in this recipe. I had such high hopes for it too. My husband and step-son wouldn't eat it. It was way too salty. I used Ritz vegetable crackers to try to add more flavor, and cut the butter down to 1/4 c as others suggested, but it had no flavor.

So easy and so good!  I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Since the butter was salted I just added pepper and garlic powder to the crumbs.  I placed the chicken in a dish just large enough to fit both pieces of chicken in.  Then I placed very thin butter pats on top before baking at 350 (instead of 375).  Halfway through cooking I flipped the chicken over and put butter pats on the other side.  The total baking time was about 30 minutes.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful!  Served with angel hair.

Loved it - I have tried it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe completely the second time I used panko and it was just as yummy. It is very good in the summer with fresh off the cob corn and cherry tomatoes.

This was so yummy! Flavorful and juicy! I threw tons of butter in the casserole pan to cook in, although delicious I will have to limit my intake of this chicken due to caloric reasons!! But aside from that i  enjoyed this.

Good, not great. This is virtually identical to Famous Pork Chops (same submitter), but for some reason, I think that one works better than this one. The Ritz cracker breading can be customized any number of ways to change the character, e.g. adding 1-2 tsp Old Bay. Will probably make again, but with some alterations. (I think Garlic Chicken on this site is better than this chicken dish.)

I followed the recipe for the most part.  Only difference is that instead of using garlic salt, I used garlic powder.  I like a lot of garlic, and not so much salt.  Plus I the crackers I used were already salted.  The cut of chicken I used was really thick, so I did end up having to cook it for 40 minutes.  I know a lot of people said 40 was too long, but it all depends on how much chicken you're using.  Overall, this came out awesome - and my husband loved it, which is why I'm giving it the 5 stars!

this recipe was awesome! i seasoned the chicken before i dipped and breaded it. i also flattened the chicken breasts so they wernt so thick. i didnt have any butter flavored crackers, so i used a combo of regular crackers and rice krispies! there were no left overs and i couldnt stop eating the remaining butter soaked crumbs in the bottom of the pan! hehehe... i will definitely make this again!

Super easy and yet super good!  I added about 4 Tbs of flour to my cracker crumbs along with my fav spices. I only used 1 egg with a little milk for the wash.  I sprayed the coated chicken with butter and only used a little butter with some olive oil in the pan. I baked them at 350 for 30 min and they were perfect. I think next time I will serve with a gravy though. It was needing some kind of sauce for it.  Also, I used whole wheat crackers and it tasted great!

Just ok for us, not much flavor but it was very tender and moist.  I did use only about 2 T of butter instead of a whole cube.  The coating seemed to be a little soggy so I broiled it at the end to give it a bit of a crisp.  There are better recipes for blsl boobs so I'll probably pass on this one.  Thank you for the recipe though!

I've had this to make in my recipe box since I became a member, I'm glad that I finally made it. I liked the cracker coating better than I thought I would. The kids liked this. I made "Garlic Cheddar Chicken" also from this site tonight. They were both good, but this was a little better. The kids liked both, I gave them each half of each one. Will make this again! Thanks.

AWESOME! 10 stars if you had it! This is truly a keeper! Made this today for dinner tonight. Followed to a T, but as I usually do, added a little extra seasonings. Most important part for me is to pound the chicken flat...seems to make it extra tender. Some recommended cut the butter (I didn't end up doing this as I discovered it needed more, due to the amt of chicken I had), I added Grill Mates Chicken rub directly to chicken (I almost always use that on all chicken recipes), + salt, onion powder, extra garlic salt & parm cheese to cracker crumbs, and flour per suggestion of others. Added cloves of garlic to pan w/butter per suggestion and spooned juices over as suggested by others too. I timed it for 25min, but needed a little extra time, due to the # of pcs I had to cook. Tasted a small pc and I can't wait for dinner! My husband came out of his office because it smelled so good! Hope kids like it! Thanks for this YUMMY recipe!

Very easy, quick, and very tasty!! I used 3 decent sized chicken breasts with the same measurements of the spices and still worked out well. My husband and I like stronger flavored things, so I added garlic powder to it and a sprinkle more of garlic salt. I didn't use the full 1/2 cup of butter. I think it's just as tasty with about 1/3 cup.

I tried this out Sunday and DH and I agreed that it was very good.  I mostly went by the original recipe except that I only used 1/4 cup butter and I added several spices - seasoned salt, fresh ground Garlic Salt,  steak house seasoning, onion powder.  I think you could use whatever you like or have on hand.  You need to watch the cooking time.  I used boneless skinless chicken tenders.  They only took about 25 minutes to cook.  It would be easy to overcook and have dried out chicken.  This will go into my every day dinners rotation.

This was really, really bland. I made it according to the recipe (using 1/4 cup butter and the optional wine) and it was just... chicken. No sauce, no garlic or wine flavor.

Not exactly 5 star but it was very easy and tasty. The chicken was VERY moist, but not as crispy as I had hoped. Next time, less butter and maybe some more spices into the cracker mixture. Flipped it half way through. Hubby liked it a lot. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Definite 5-star rating based both on ease and the fact that all three kids love this dish.  That's hard to find!  I also appreciate the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand.  I do increase the seasonings a little and add a dash of cayenne pepper just because we like alot of flavor.  I also decrease the amount of butter.  AWESOME!

I have made this recipe for the last 25-30 years.  I call it oven fried chicken.  It is absolutely fantastic.  You will never have left overs.  I don't use eggs and I dredge chicken in bisquick instead of cracker crumbs.  Flavor will be much better and then bake in melted butter until crispy. Increase oven temp to 400 degrees

This was really good and a nice change to our normal shake n bake chicken! I do think it needs a tad bit more spice but other than that it was good! I will make again and add a little more seasonings for our taste.

Delicious!!  I had to cook it in my electric skillet as our kitchen is torn out, but it was very, very good.  I did add about two teaspoons of flour to the cracker crumbs since I was frying it and thought that might help hold the crumbs together when I turned it - and it did!  Will use the remaining two breasts tonight w/ spaghetti sauce and cheese for chicken parm!

This was such an easy recipe to cook.  It was by far one of the best chicken recipes out there!  I only used 1 stick of butter and it was plenty.  About half way thru cooking time I spooned the melted butter all over the chicken.  I also used partially frozen chicken breasts (only outside defrosted so that cracker crumbs would stick) and cooking time was perfect.  Entire family loved it!

First time making this it was just "eh", second time it was a greasy mess because I used too much butter, used thighs and therefore the breading stuck to the pan.  But the THIRD time making this it came out much better!  Whew, lol.  I think it's because I used corn flake crumbs and decreased the amount of butter.  I'll continue to tweak until I find a winner.

Very good, easy and quick recipe.  I made a variation of this last night with items that I had on hand and it turned out very well.  The butter definitely helped the breading "stick" to the chicken.

This was good, but very rich. I used other reviewers' recommendations-- pounded the chicken to 1/4" thickness, added garlic salt and pepper, decreased butter to 1/4 cup, and sprayed pans with PAM. Will make again.

This is one of our family's faves now! I follow the recipe exactly except we use the thinner breasts from the grocery. Ritz crackers, garlic seasoning mix, and viola, easy and quick dinner!

I used roasted vegetable ritz and cut up the chicken into nuggets. I also only used 1/2 the butter that was called for and used a 8x8 dish. Was delicious.

Nice basic chicken dish which can be dressed up as needed.  Would recommend either increasing cooking time or temp if the breasts are thick.

It was ok, but not as moist and tender as I had hoped.  The bottom of the chicken that was sitting in the butter was very good, but the top just tasted like breaded baked chicken.  Next time I'm going to try flipping the chicken half way through baking time.

Good, but not exceptional.  I think my problem was the size of my chicken breasts.  They were pretty thick.  As a result, didn't get the fried chicken feel that I was looking for.  Mine took the full 40 minutes the recipe called for-again, I believe I had too thick of meat. I will look at the picture next times and try to correct size.

LOVED this recipe. I had a touch of garlic powder with the crushed ritz crackers, and then also add the flour from a previous suggestion. Wonderful every time!

I have been making this for about a year now and have modified it a bit to our taste.  I use italian bread crumbs for the coating.  We like our food with extra spices, so I season with salt before the dipping and with garlic after being rolled in the crumbs.  The chicken gets crispier and more flavor if you melt the butter first and then poor it evenly over the chicken before baking.  Super recipe, especially with chicken breast tenders.

I was really excited to try this, after reading great reviews.  This was good, but a little disappointing.  Very juicy, but not a whole lot of flavor.  But, I will make it again.  Easy and good.

wow this reciped is way overrated.  I ended up adding 1/2 teaspoon each of dried parsley, onion powder and garlic powder and it was still pretty bland and tasteless.  Couldn't imagine how bland it would've been had I not added it.  For something with such a high fat content, you'd think it would taste alittle better, sorry!

Very good. I coated the chicken with garlic salt and white pepper before dipping it in the egg, but I kept everything else the same. It took about 1/2 sleeve of butter-flavored crackers to coat the chicken, BTW. I followed a reviewer's suggestion and baked the breasts for only 25 minutes or so and they turned out perfectly. I basted them with the juices twice during the cooking time, too. Fabulous comfort food when served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans. I had no leftovers!

This was really good!  My all time favorite chicken recipe is Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken though (check it out!).  For this buttered chicken, I made as suggested with some additions.  I ADDED cayenne pepper, onion powder, seasoned bread crumbs, and a few panko (more coarse) bread crumbs to the cracker mix.  I also EGGED AND DREDGED A SECOND TIME  to get more of the crumb mixture on the chicken.  As suggested in another review I PUT A FEW THIN SLICES OF BUTTER ON TOP of the chicken.  As I said before, it was good.  I would definitely make it again.  I only made 2 chicken breasts and I put them into a pie pan for cooking so that the butter would stay close to the chicken. Not good. It wasn't enough space so the bottom got soggy. So, next time I'm make them in a slightly larger pan. HAPPY COOKING!

I love the chicken from this recipe !!! Omg, the chicken turned out so tender and juicy. Made this for dinner last night and I can't stop thinking about the flavor until now. I used Ritz crackers and added some spices in the batter and baked for 30 mins on a Pyrex dish. I'll be making this again and again, my husband and I really love it. Thanks loads !!!!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight.  I took the suggestion of adding 1/2 a packet of dry ranch dressing to the egg mixture. I also put a slice of butter on each chicken breast and the remainder on the bottom of the dish. The chicken was tender, juicy and had great flavor. I would make this again!

This dish is very good.  I used garlic powder because I didn't have garlic salt, and it worked fine (although I did add a bit more).   The recipe states that the butter should be placed around the chicken.  Perhaps this is to help the coating get crunchy?  Next time, I'll put the butter right on top of the chicken pieces.  It's definitely a keeper!

Delicious and moist chicken!  I added garlic powder and paprika to the cracker crumbs and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top.  I also used less butter than it called for.

This is by far my husband's favorite chicken recipe! The recipe turns out right every time, and we can always count on a great meal when I make this. 
We love how tender and moist the chicken is, combined with the heavenly baked-in flavor of butter. The crunchy buttery-cracker topping is awesome, too. I get lots of requests for this dish, and it has become a comfort food dish around our house.
We always like to pair this chicken with either lightly buttered noodles with a little garlic salt, or pre-packaged butter flavor noodles.

My family LOVES this chicken!! My son prefers it when I make it with chicken breast tenderloins because he loves to dip them in bbq sauce.  I don't add any salt to it and instead add garlic powder and black pepper to the cracker crumbs.  The leftovers reheat very well in the toaster oven too. **UPDATE** To make this a little healthier, I've started using the Smart Balance 50/50 Blend instead of the butter.  No one noticed.  :O)

Great recipe. I followed the recipe as shown with the exception of adding a mixture of spices (paprika, chicken seasoning, black and cayenne pepper) to the crushed crackers. I also added 2 tsp of refrigerated garlic to the butter in the pan. The coating was crisp and the meat was very tender. It turned out perfect :o)

I may have left feedback for this recipe before, but I made it again last night for the first time in a while and had forgotten how tasty it was.  Something else to give the chicken extra 'moisture' and rich flavor...soak it overnight in a bowl of buttermilk.  If your crackers are ground well enough you won't even need to dip the chicken in the eggs. I also just use regular dried garlic rather than garlic salt so I can adjust the sodium more eassily.

I've updated my review as I've learned a few things after making this several times. I have a family of 5 so I use the whole box of crackers (I try to buy reduced fat/sodium to make it healthier).  It is sufficient enough to coat 5 to 6 thick chicken breasts (I don't scale up the rest of the recipe though).  I still use the 9x13 pan (have to squish them in but it works out fine).  I don't bother with placing the butter pieces - I just melt the butter and spoon it on - much quicker and easier.  Personally I don't feel it needs extra seasoning - the original recipe is sufficient for our family. Tip:  all chicken breasts are not created equal - the ones I use are from our local meat shop are quite thick - they take the full 40 min and are not dry at all.  If I were using grocery store breasts (they tend to be thinner) I probably would check them at 30 minutes.  Thanks again for the recipe - it is one of the most requested by my kids.

This is the best recipe!  I have taken this to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  It's so easy.  I make it just the way the recipe says, except I like the crust so I put all the leftover crushed crackers on top of the chicken.

I was very hopeful about this recipe, but found it to be a little soggy and very bland. Nothing special, won't make it again. I feel like the negative reviews I read are right on for this one.

Very tender...but also very bland.  If you want to make it better use white cheddar cheezits and skip the garlic salt.  This will add so much flavor.  The butter is excessive even for a butter lover like me!  Use half the amount and it will come out just as nice.

Really good recipe!! I made a few changes like adding fresh herbs to add to the flavor. I love fresh basil. I also use I can't belive it's not butter so I feel better about using this recipe. Italin breadcrumbs also work well to make this recipe even easier.

This is my favorite chicken recipe and a hit every time I serve it to guests. I prefer to dip the chicken in buttermilk, instead of eggs. Also, to the cracker crumbs, I add 1 TBSP garlic powder, 1 TBSP Italian seasoning and 1 TBSP grated Parmesan. I melt my butter and drizzle it on before baking, rather than placing chunks around the chicken. A fabulous recipe. I love it!

I have never ever wanted to repeat a recipe using chicken breasts until now. This is so moist, flavorful and delicious! I didn't use garlic salt, just plenty of powdered garlic. I am serving this with Holuski (a Czech cabbage and noodle dish from this site) and steamed broccoli. Outstanding way to improve plain old chicken breasts. I MAY cut down on the butter next time, we'll see.

This chicken was delicious!  Very tender and juicy.  I gave the recipe to my husband and asked him to make it while I went to the grocery store.  When I got home the aroma in the house was awesome!  My six and three year olds had thirds.  I will be making this again.

It is excellent hot out of the oven or cold for a snack but I don't suggest reheating, it was soggy and not nearly as good.  Thank you for a great recipe - a nice change from breadcrumbs!

If I could give this a ten I would. Added grated parm and italian seasoning to the crumbs. Full of flavor and juicy! I was told this is the best chicken people have ever had. Will make again and again. Thanks for sharing!

absolutely fantastic.  this recipe has restored my faith in chicken.  I'm working on making it less fattening.  so far, I used reduced fat club crackers and vegetable oil margarine in place of "buttery crackers" and "butter".  I'm definitely going to keep working on it, loved it!

A great basic recipe. Although a bit bland as is, try adding some ingredients to your taste. The chicken comes out tender and moist and I love the chunks of cracker. This would be so much better with a sauce.

Even my hubby, who's not much of a chicken lover, adores this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly (doubled of course, 5 kids!) except I added some Hidden Valley Ranch powder...mmm mmm mmmm!! I just can't say enough! :o) Thanks for the recipe!!!

Didn't feel good today but still needed to get dinner on the table.   I was looking for something simple and quick.  This certainly fit the bill.  Added a packet of garlic and herb soup mix instead of the garlic salt, and a few tsps of italian seasoning.  The chicken stayed very moist, tasted good and was very, very simple to prepare.  It was also easy on my stomach which wasn't feeling too hot.  Two thumbs up!  Served with a bake potato which cooked at the same temp, only started it 20 mins earlier, and broccoli.

I used parmesan-garlic flavored crackers for a little extra kick.  Then about 10 minutes before taking them out of the oven, put a little freshly shaven parmesan on top.

I've never heard my husband say "Can we have this tomorrow night?  And the night after that?"

WONDERFUL recipe.

This turned out much better than I expected. I used Whole Foods Buttery Sticks- & did use the whole stick. Might try half next time. I used Town House crackers- a whole sleeve was a bit much- I would recommend about 3/4 of a sleeve. Used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken breasts- cut into 6 pieces & put in a 13x9. Placed the butter pieces AROUND & in between the chicken- not on top. This way you get a beautifully tender yet crunchy top crust! I love this the way it is- the flavor is wonderful & delicate. Don't add extra spices unless you've given it a go as written first. A low carb treat!!! P.S.- WHY do people like the Purple Chef TOTALLY change a recipe & then rate how THEY made it??? It's just not right.......

Oh So Good!!!  I used Panko breadcrumbs mixed with some parmesan cheese instead of crackers and used chicken tenders rather than breasts.  I also melted the butter and added some fresh minced garlic and poured it all over the chicken.  I will definitely be making this again.  2 thumbs up Heather.

This recipe was awesome!! My husband is a picky eater and he absolutely loved it. The chicken was really tender and had the best flavor. I used half the butter and found that to be plenty. I also added some cayan pepper to the crumbs and sprinkled some extra garlic salt over the chicken before I put it in the oven. By far one of the best recipes I've ever tried. Thanks!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. First time it was great! Second time, I lost the recipe and it added milk to my egg and it came out super super soggy, Third time , it again came out sort of soggy even though i followed the directions perfectly. Not sure why the problem with this recipe , although i will try it one more time to see if its me or the recipe thats messed up.

This was very good, my boyfriend said it was the best "fried chicken" he'd ever had, and I had to remind him it was baked. But, it was so fattening that it gave some of us stomach aches later. Although it was good, if I do make it again, I will decrease the amount of butter.

Great recipe and super easy. I did not have buttery rounds on hand, so I used club crackers as a tasty alternative. It worked out great! Boyfriend loved it! Will try again and again and again!

This was a good recipe.  For my taste it would be more like 4 star but my husband liked it so much I had to give it a 5.  I did spice it up a little by adding cayenne pepper and celery salt, and a little more garlic to the crackers, and adding a little tabasco and worchestershire to the eggs.  I also used 1/2 the butter and that was plenty.  This is a very basic recipe that I think kids and people that like less favorful foods would prefer.  I dipped mine in Horseradish Sauce (from this site...AWESOME dip for anything from onion rings and breaded chicken to roasts) and that was really good.  My husband said "this is the best chicken I have ever had" so that summed it up for me.  This will be in my normal; rotation now.  Thanks for posting!

Very juicy, with a nice crispy coating.  Very easy to make.  This is a nice "blank canvas" recipe - you can add any herbs, spices, or flavors you like to give it some more pizazz.  My fiance and I like it with some fresh lemon squeezed on top.  It's also pretty darn good all by itself.

You definitly have to be a fan of Ritz Crackers to like this one.. A little heavy on the stomach but Very filling!! I have to give it 5*'s because it is so tasty. I took the advice of another reviewer and used Parmesan cheese with the cracker mixture, also garlic poweder (hate garlic salt). Great with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes!!

The best baked/breaded chicken! I made half as the recipe said and half low fat, and the low fat were pretty darn good, just didn't have the same nice texture of the reg. Do this for lower fat: Use reduced fat Ritz crackers, dip in egg beaters, and spray the pan down and the top of the chicken with butter flavored cooking spray.

This was Ok.  The butter made it really really moist which was good.  But it lacked flavor.  Really easy to make, but next time I will try adding different spices and more garlic powder.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. I have made it many times and it is alway's tender and moist .
It has good flavor too. Try it also with Ritz cheddar or Ritz garlic and herb. My family keeps asking me to make it again and again.Thank you.

Sadly to say I didn't have the awesome results everyone else did. I thought that the coating didn't hold up very well and that the flavor was pretty bland. I will say this, they were very moist though.

I was a little surprised at how much my husband liked this chicken.  He's a pretty picky eater, but he ate all of his chicken when I used this recipe.  I only gave 4 stars b/c I spice up the recipe a little.  I added some cajun seasoning for some spice. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is GROSSLY OVERATED! It has a the same taste as unseasoned chicken. It was moist but that is rarely the single criteria I use to judge the quality of a five star meal. I was laughed out of the firehouse with this recipe.

This was so simple!! I used cheddar crackers instead of butter crackers. My husband loved it (and he is hard to impress) My favourite part is that it is so easy to make! This will be a regular meal in our house! Thanks!

This was a great recipe for that typical mid-week dinner.  You know the kind, mum and dad come in from a long hard day at work, kiddies running around asking what's for dinner.  This dish was *so* easy to prepare and smelled great in the oven!  We're very please with how this turned out, and it went well just with noodles and veggies.

This was OK, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I'm not a big fan of garlic salt, besides all that salt drowns out the great buttery flavor of this dish.

Yum!  The crackers gave the chicken a nice crunch, and the butter kept it very moist, even after 40 minutes in the oven.  It was also the simplest chicken recipe I've ever followed.  I'll definitely make this one again.

This recipe is ridiculously great. Something that simple shouldn't be that yummy. My very picky 5 year old takes nuggets I make using this recipe for lunch to school to be reheated!!

As a novice in the kitchen, I found myself drawn to this because of its ease of preparation and lack of complicated ingredients.  I made the recipe as written and found the chicken to be moist, but VERY bland.  I even added extra garlic salt and black pepper.  I can't imagine anybody giving this five stars.  I won't make this again.

I was disappointed in this recipe after having read so many good reviews. It was buttery, yes, but not very flavorful. The leftovers (there were a lot) were better cold from the fridge the next day than piping hot. Won't make this one again.

A true winner.  This was so moist and flavorful.  I did double the crumb mixture and was glad I did.  I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and that was perfect. I used the Honey Mustard Sauce along with this and it was really good, but that is not neccesary since the chicken itself is fantastic. I think I safely say this was the best baked chicken breast recipe I now have.

I used this recipe with boneless thighs and my husband loves it!  I personally like the breasts, so I've frozen packets containing both so we can both have what we like.  The kids like it too!

What a nice, quick,easy recipe.  Took suggestions from other reviews and seasoned a little more, and used half the butter (only b/c that's all I had) but very moist with a distinct, subtle taste.  Husband loved it... WILL make again.

Loved it!  I sliced my breasts lengthwise to make chicken strips.  I also added a bit of olive oil along with the butter to keep the butter from browning too much.  Taking a cue from the other reviewers I added more spice, cayenne, garlic and sage.  I also added a little flour and grated parmesan cheese to my cracker crumbs.  It was wonderful.  Can't wait to try it with pork!  Jeanne Bean

YUUUMMMM! I believe that my husband will be a little upset that I have a new love, This recipe!
I took this to a Pot Luck a work so I made it the night before and we had to "sample" it before I took it, and we at 4 strips that night! This dish was gone in 60-seconds and I had many people ask for the recipe- so I told them, go to Allrecipes!
 This recipe will be a great help to working moms, 5 minutes is all it takes and then you pop it in the oven and you can do other things while it watches itself. Be sure to serve it with the Honey Mustard recipe found on this site! The kids will flip over this one and MEN if you want to cook to impress- GO WITH THIS ONE, you can't go wrong! (I used half Ritz crackers, and half Chicken in a biskit crackers for a more flavorful taste) Try sprinkling Parmesan cheese on it and serving over Speghetti! SO MANY WAYS, SO LITTLE TIME!

This was great.  I added some parmesan and garlic (as per previous comment) to the crumbs, and the result smelled HEAVENLY.  If only the taste would carry throughout the bland chicken!  Anyways I am going to make this often, thanks!

We loved this.  The only thing I did wrong was that I used 10 pieces of chicken and tried to fit it all in one pan.  It was fine, but I am sure that it would have been more buttery if I had split it into 2 pans.  My kids loved this recipe too.  Thanks!

VERY GOOD!!  My husband was rather skeptical at how good it would be, with the only flavor coming from butter, crackers, and a bit of garlic salt and pepper.  It turned out to be very flavorful, and all that butter keeps it so moist!  Definatly a keeper!  I'm going to play around with it a bit, trying different spices, breadcrumbs, etc, just for variety!

This was incredibly quick and easy, but a little bland.  I would add a little more spice to the breading, perhaps.

I cut the chicken breasts into strips and made "Chicken strips" and my family gobbled them up.  I also used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs to make "nuggets" and they came out very flavorful.  This recipe is easy and uses ingredients we always have on hand.

Delicious! My family really enjoyed it. Next time though, I think I'll try it with 1/4 Cup of butter instead of the 1/2 Cup---tasted great but not so great for one's heart.

This truly was a great quick chicken dish.  My whole family loved it - even a visiting very picky eater!  I did reduce the butter by half and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I will definitely make it again.

This was really delicious.  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  I sprinkled some garlic powder on top before putting them in to bake to give it a bit more garlic taste. I think this would also work well for chicken that has been pounded the into cutlets. Definitely a keeper!

This is the BEST oven baked chicken we've ever had. It was so tender and juicy. My husband and son doused their pieces in ranch dressing, but I ate mine plain and it was FANTASTIC. I even had the remaining piece for lunch today and it was just as tasty.

I made this because I already had all the ingredients at home.  I substituted wheat Ritz crackers for the butter crackers and the result was very good.

Very easy and tender.  Everyone liked it.  My husband and son thought I should try some cayenne pepper instead of the black pepper.  Maybe next time.

The crumbs Are a great alternative to flour!  We love this recipe so much I experimented with the idea of it.  I cut the breasts in strips, and slowly pan fried them in the butter and then used the remains to make a gravy, and served that and the chicken over rice.  It was fantastic!

I loved this chicken recipe! It's a great way to spice up regular chicken-easily. I did top mine with Mozzarella cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking (hubby loves cheese). 
I served mine with cheesey garlic bread, and a vegetable for the sides.

This is super easy to make and very good.  I would use aluminum foil next time for easier clean up.  Great , quick week night dinner.  Not as heavy and greasy as I thought it would be.  Kids loved it too!

Oh man, this is the real deal.  Following the comments of other reviewers, I added Italian seasoning, onion powder, Parmesan cheese, and a bit of flour to the crumb mix.  I also reduced the butter to 1/3 cup.  With the thin-sliced breast filets I was using, 30 minutes (turning halfway through) was the ticket.  Both of my boys wanted more of the chicken and asked "Can we have this every time we do chicken?"  It's simple, relatively foolproof, and tastes amazing.  Definitely a keeper!

UPDATE: Cooked it again, same result.  Great go-to simple recipe!

Have made this recipe twice.  Instead of breasts I used thighs because my husband prefers them.  One of my favorite chicken recipes.  I took the left over crumbs and sprinkled them on the chicken pieces.  I used cold butter, using my grater I grated the butter right on the chicken.  You get better coverage that way.

This is a staple at our house. My entire family loves it!  Might be the most requested meal I make. Don't be afraid to pour the remaining cracker crumbs over the chicken, just make sure they don't burn.   Everyone gets a piece of chicken with "extra crumbs."

I've made this twice. First time, I followed the recipe exactly.  it was good, although as other reviewers stated it took less time to cook than indicated. The second time I melted the butter, then dipped the chicken in the melted butter, then rolled in the crumbs .  I much preferred it that way.  Beautifully moist, delicious and less butter required.  Served it to 120 people who all agreed.  Had so many ask for the recipe

This recipe is very easy, and it's great for a last minute supper, given that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand. Since chicken breasts are now so large, I sliced each one in half, and pounded it to a uniform thickness, before dipping it into the egg and dredging in the crumb mixture.  In addition, I sliced 2 tablespoons of the butter very thinly, and dotted the tops of the chicken with it, and put  the remainder of the butter around the chicken, as directed. My fiancé and his roommate practically licked the platter!

look, you can change this all you want.  I've used less butter, real garlic, a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and crackers.  None of the changes make it taste any better than the original recipe.   Its simple, easy chicken made with ingredients you most likely have on hand.  It will always be a dinner option for us just as its written.

This is a great quick fix for dinner.  I cut my chicken breasts in half (which means less cooking time, maybe 30 minutes).  I coat in egg, then bread with crushed Ritz crackers that has garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper in it as well.  Be careful with adding too many spices that have salt in them due to the Rtiz crackers already having salt on them.  I melt butter and drizzle it over the chicken after I put them in the pan (I also add some to the bottom of the 9x13 before I place the chicken so they don't stick).  I sprinkle some shaved garlic in the pan so it can marinate w/the butter.  I increase the butter a little b/c I use the sauce at the end for rice or noodles.  This is the type of recipe that you can play with quite a bit and suit to taste - but this one is a winner for me and my family.  Have fun!

delish!  Here are some more helpful hints. 1. mix melted butter and your spices like garlic, onion salt, italian seasonings etc all together and use a marinade injector to infuse the flavor into the chicken before cooking. makes it extra juicy and flavorful. 2. butterfly the chicken breast almost all the way, leaving a small portion in tact and stuff with butter, cheeses, bacon etc of your choice place the top layer back down on the chicken then dip in egg wash and crumbs before cooking and you get amazing flavor as well!  3. marinade over night in a mixture of olive oil, butter, garlic and italian seasonings ( reserve some for basting while cooking or for infusion with a marinade injector.    a quick tip is use feta cheese to stuff the chicken: it melts well and is extremely flavorful in the chicken!

Tried this recipe tonight ...got rave reviews.  I did add a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and probably 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese to the cracker crumbs. Upon removal from the oven before serving I spooned the butter sauce mixed with the cracker crumbs on the chicken breasts...

The meal was delicious.

We eat a lot of chicken and it tends to be chicken breasts this recipe is a welcome addition...  Actually it was declared a new favorite... Best of all it is one of the simplest recipes I use for chicken.

The recipe was delicious!!!! I used 1.5-1.8 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken thighs as we prefer dark meat. As others recommended I used less butter - specifically 3 tbsp and that I think was plenty. I ended up using 1 sleeve of Ritz crackers plus an additional 10 more crackers. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I can't put my finger on it, but I just didn't like the coating texture on this chicken.  The flavor was good, so maybe I did something wrong. I might give it another whirl and see if I like it any better.  Chicken was very moist and flavorful, but the coating turned me off.  I made the recipe exactly as written.

This was a great recipe with easy ingredients I had on hand. My son never eats a lot of meat but had 2 pieces of chicken. 

I think this will be a new family favorite.

Loved it !! But with any recipe I never just follow the directions. I always tweek it, to the cracker crumb mixture I added Mrs. Dash seasoning Parmesan cheese both grated and shredded, Italian bread crumbs and salt and pepper. It was to die for!!! Only thing I will do next time is to use Reynolds nonstick foil just for easier cleaning. That way after cooking you just fold up the foil and toss it! wa-la! done!!

LOVE IT!!! this recipe is not only so darn good but very easy and flavorful. i made this yesterday for my husband (who loves chicken) & he loved it. What we like about it is that its baked not fried and its so juicy and crisp, I used Ritz crackers for the crumbles but everything else i followed. Highly recommend you give it a shot

Followed recipe as is and mine was excellent the first time I tried it. I did cook it in a baking stone, though, which worked really for the 40 minutes suggested.

Needed a lot more garlic and some more salt to have enough flavor.  Like others suggested, I also halved the butter, and that turned out fine.  I garlic salted them before dredging (but still used the garlic salt as suggested.).  But I first dredged in flour, and THEN eggs, and then the cracker crumbs.  Generally, if I dip in flour first, they will be moister after cooking.  Next time, I would add a loit more garlic without adding more much more salt.

WOW! #1: I don't like chicken breasts and am very picky about my chicken. #2: This was amazing, juicy, tasty, and other yummy adjectives. #3: I've changed my mind about disliking chicken breasts -- I'll cook em this way forever! I had 6 medium chicken breasts and had to use 2 sleeves of coarsley crushed Ritz crackers (baked 30 minutes - they were perfect). I really patted the crackers into the chicken, and topped the breasts with the leftovers from the dredging plate. I did not baste, but I will next time. I was afraid the butter would make the tops soggy, not thinking the butter will crisp up the crackers! Advice: add extra broken up crackers around the chicken in the dish, the butter frys them up and they're buttery, crispy & delicious on top of the chicken! Hubby said to add extra butter next time too. I don't think you can mess this one up, Ritz crackers, eggs for dredging, a bunch of butter and sprinkles of garlic salt. Surprisingly amazing and very simple!!

I followed the recipe to a T (maybe slightly less butter out of convenience) and it was delicious! Cooked for 30 instead of 45 and it turned out well flavored and so tender! I crushed my Ritz crackers up until they were tiny pieces, but a couple pieces somehow remained larger (thumbnail size). The bites with those larger pieces were the best!! Next time I will add in a mix of tiny and bigger pieces. :) Yum!

This dish is good so long as there's at least as much butter as this recipe calls for, preferably a bit more, making it one of the less wholesome chicken meals.

Followed the directions, except used my own garlic seasoning on the chicken, after the egg wash. Used approx. 1/3 cup of butter and sprayed the 13X9 with Cooking spray. It was delish and something different from my usual chicken dishes. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make this again. Cooked in in my convection oven at 375 for 25 minutes and then turned it up to 400 for an additional 7 minutes. Perfect texture!

Wonderful and juicy chicken! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and I only cooked this in the oven for 25 minutes and spooned the melted butter over the chicken twice during the cook time. It was more than enought time and it came out perfect. 

Also, I loved the breading you make for this. I used Ritz crackers, garlic salt, and black pepper and it tasted wonderful. Next time, I'm going to try making this with chicken tenders instead of breasts and see how it turns out.

Came out delicious! Next time I will use a little more butter (I used less than suggested) and I may have cooked it for a little long. But I'm a new cook, and it still turned out pretty yummy. I would appreciate any advice on faster ways to finely crush crackers into crumbs.

I found the butter taste to be too overwhelming and the seasoning wasn't enough. Next time I will try with less butter and different seasonings.

Very very good!!!  The pats of butter give a nice "fried" chicken taste.  I added onion and garlic power and a bit of parley.  Everyone in the family LOVED it.  Will be making this again for sure!!

The best chicken I have ever made. Added a lot of spices to the crackers, though because I like it hot! My husband said it was moist and delicious. Definitely will make again.

Love this recipe!  Substituted heated coconut oil in place of the butter and it was amazing!  I feel like it helped make it a little less rich tasting.  Heated about a scoop of coconut oil and drizzled it on the chicken.  Loved it and will be making again soon!

This recipe far exceeded my expectations. I made as directed except that I didn't measure the butter - just eyeballed it, putting large slices on top of and around the chicken - and I only cooked this for 25 minutes instead of 40. Delicious served with sautéed snow peas and brown rice!

Great! added some ground red pepper to Ritz breading and marinated chicken in lemon juice. I used chicken tenderloins so only needed 25 minutes to cook and made rice pilaf for side dish. Great meal! I wish it was lowfat.

I made this last evening. I had some egg coating left over, so I poured it over the chicken. I added cracker coating over the chicken also. I only cooked it for 30 minutes and it was very tender and tasty with the Parmasen cheese on top! Family loved it and I will fix it again.

Tasted terrific, but made some minor changes - in quantities, not ingredients. I was cooking 3 large half breasts, and 1 cup of crumbs was not enough - it barely covered the chicken. I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, and I also reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes. Came out moist and flavorful. Make sure you really crush your cracker crumbs with a rolling pin. You can also toss in extra spices for fun ... the second time I made this, I added a 1/2 t of sage and a 1/2 t of paprika. Yummy either way.

I tried this recipe not long ago and it was one of my favorite ways to prepare chicken! I did have a little trouble keeping the cracker crumbs on the chicken, so next time I will see what the problem was! But the chicken was moist and had a great flavor! I will cook this again!!! I give this a rating of five!!

This is similar to an old oven fried chicken I used to make, only this coating is different.  The rating is for Haulbur's version and mine too.  I took some suggestions of adding some flour to the coating.  Also it only took 1 egg for me to coat my boneless chick breasts.  I melted the butter in the dish before adding the chicken and turned it over halfway.  Watch for doneness according to thickness of the chicken, I don't think it took quite 40 min. to finish.  Thanks, Haulbur, from Susie

Amazing recipe! I have been making it for a few years now, but never got around to writing a review on it. My husband is a super picky eater but when I make this chicken, he always wants seconds and there are hardly ever leftovers. Leftovers, however, do taste great the next day too. I have found that using a cookie sheet rather than a baking dish makes the chicken come out a little crispier, which I like.

Great recipe! I tried it out tonight and doubted that it could be as easy as it looked, but it was! Great oven fried look. My sons, who love to eat, but only if it's good, gave this a definite 2 thumbs up. I made slight adjustments by using about a 1/2 c. flour in the cracker crumb mixture to ensure that the crumbs stuck and I cut the butter in 1/2 as others suggested. I topped it with a bit of parsley and it was outstanding!

This was really good!  I think the key is using chicken breasts that are on the thinner side. This tastes very similar to the Sweet Cracker Chicken that a local diner makes - I may have to experiment a little to come up with the lemon butter sauce that they serve theirs with!

My family loved it! It was flavorful and they actually asked for more. My dinner meat is usually bland and my family complains, but this they enjoyed and want me to make more often. I used N/S saltine crackers and N/S butter, 1 egg and 1 egg white, though I did use garlic salt vs. garlic powder (which is what I usually use). It turned out crispy and moist.  It's in my dinner rotation.

This was great! Even my picky four year old wanted more! We will make this again. I did add a few more seasonings and cooked for 30min as opposed to 40mim since my chicken was very thin.

My whole family loved this chicken!  They said it tastes similar to Chick Filet, which is awesome!  I made it with chicken breast tenders and it still turned out very moist.

I made this last night and it was awesome.  Can't wait to make it again. My chicken breast were very thin so I only used 1/4 cup butter, only cooked it for 20 min. I will use thicker breast next time. Every one was singing the HMMMM song.

Simple, easy to make. I had to use regular crackers and it was still good. For a very basic recipe the kids will like, this is great!

well this recipe is sooo what i've been looking for, still soooo easy but oh so delicious!!!! this is one recipe i will never lose!!
by the way i've made it 2x already and i've tried both CLUB crackers and TOWN HOUSE... TOWN HOUSE to me tastes the best!!! theyre so flakier and buttery... perfection!!

This was very tasty and super moist.  I used Townhouse crackers (a personal favorite of mine) and added some Mrs. Dash and parmesan cheese to the crumb coating.  It was yummy!

I fixed this after a super busy weekend. I wanted something fast & easy, while providing my daughter a full meal after being gone all weekend. This was a hit! I crumbled the crackers in a ziplock and sprinkled a dab of poultry seasoning, basil, oregano & garlic salt in it. I took others advice and used a bit less butter. Served it with Garlic Red Lobster Cheese Biscuits, mashed potatoes & veggies! Great meal & prep time was no longer than 15 minutes or so!

I've made something similar to this for years.  Instead of cracker crumbs I used flour mixed with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little paprika.  I find it is easier and the chicken browns better if you just melt the butter in the casserole dish before adding the chicken.  I put the casserole dish in the oven to melt the butter, then add the chicken.  I always bake my chicken on 350 for about 40 - 45 minutes for bone in and 30 minutes for boneless.  Having said that I really like the difference the cracker crumb gives it. I always use about 1/3 cup of butter which is all that's needed.  My family has already requested this again.  Thanks for sharing.

As others said, this chicken is very moist. I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper beforehand and used garlic butter Ritz crackers for more flavor. Used melted butter and poured over the meat, and used pieces of butter around the meat. Probably not the most healthy dish, but it smelled and tasted delicious!

Tried this pretty much as written because I'm terrible at changing without trying first.  I did change from garlic salt to garlic powder it was still really good.  I didn't think it was heavy at all.  I will turn the chicken half way so it gets crispy all around.  I used a glass dish because I only used 2 breasts then cut them in half.  My husband lost his taste for chicken but liked this.  I will use this again - Yummy!

This recipe was so easy and yummy!!! I used vegetable thins instead of Ritz crackers. It was all I had.I added garlic salt and pepper and parmesan cheese to the crackers. I baked at 400 for 15 minutes uncovered. Then spooned the melted butter on top. I layed foil on top of dish for an additional ten minutes because the crackers were browning. Did not want them to burn.
The chicken turned out perfect. Super moist and flavorful!

I made this last night for the first time and everyone wound up with an empty plate. That's major in this house of a very picky woman (me!), a doesn't-ever-finish-a-meal husband, a 3.5 year old who eats like a bird, and a 1.5 year old. Two thumbs up!

I changed this recipe a bit - I seasoned the chicken with paprika. garlic powder, salt, and pepper first. Next, I coated the chicken with mayo (not the healthiest option, but darn tasty) instead of an egg before adding the cracker crumbs. I placed 2 tbsp of butter, in pieces, on top of the chicken, it comes out much better. Baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees instead of at 375 degrees. Came out really good.

My family just had this for lunch and it was a definite hit! The chicken was super juicy and tender. My 3-year old who usually takes a long time to finish her meal gobbled this one up quickly! We will certainly have this again in the future - I could see it fast becoming a family favorite. :)

Followed the instructions and followed some helpful suggestions and i'm sorry but it was bland. it had little flavor. i would say it needed more than the garlic salt to help it.

I changed it a little - not because I thought it needed it but my husband has it in his head that he hates crab.  I've made it before without him knowing it but I have to wait until he's not around to get it ready.  I had it mixed and was looking for a recipe for chicken to stuff it with.  This was it.  I took the lazy way and mixed the canned crab with Litehouse Garden Veggie dip, sprayed the kitchen with Fabreze so he wouldn't get the fish smell and other than that, I changed nothing. He asked what was in it and I said "do you like it?"  "Yes".  "Then what does it matter".  Now he knows he wasn't supposed to like it but he still doesn't know what it was.  That's what keeps a marriage together - deception!  --only on this scale!  Anyway, mmmmm mmmmm good !

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I had to make a few changes. First I added a few dashes of hot sauce to the eggs to add flavor. Instead of garlic salt I used poultry seasoning. Lastly, I cut the amount of butter down to 1/4 of a stick. My (super picky) brother's LOVED this!

This didn't quite turn out as crispy as I'd hope, but I'm willing to bet it was a cook error (me) and not a problem with the recipe.  Even though it wasn't super crispy, it was still delicious and worthy of five stars.  Super easy to make on a weeknight.  I took others advice and added italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs along with some onion powder.  I followed other  suggestions and baked at 375 for 35 minutes with perfect results.  Super moist chicken. I also let is rest for 10 minutes as others had suggested.  I had very large breasts so I sliced each down the center to create two thinner breast pieces out of each.  Worked great.  Served with mashed potatoes and ceasar salad because it's the family's favorite salad.  I ate my chicken just as it was cooked, but my teenage daughter dipped hers in ranch and loved it.  Great recipe.  Thanks for the post and the suggestions of so many others.  Will keep this in my binder as a go to on a busy night.

I made this with gluten free crackers that I bought to snack on but they were gross and flavorless - but when crushed and seasoned they made the perfect gluten free breading for this dish! My boyfriend and I ate every single piece. This is good with any style gravy or dip you want!

So easy and so delicious! Even my picky eaters loved it. The recipe tastes like chicken Kiev but is so much easier to make. I didn't have butter crackers so I used a combination of cheese crackers and seasoned bread crumbs. Like the other reviewers recommended I cut the butter in half.

Yummy & easy.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the crust wasn't as crunchy as I'd like; the bottom was especially soggy.  It was very tender & delicious.  Now I just need to figure out how to make it crunchier because I will be making it again.

I fixed this last night and it was WONDERFUL! Everyone of my kids loved it. We stuffed our selves until we could not fit anymore in LOL. (Only thing I done different was added flour with cracker crumbs like many had suggested.) I encourage everyone to try it, its the bomb diggity!

Delicious! Followed the other reviews and baked it in an 8x8 pan with 1/2 stick of sliced butter all around.  Will be making again!

This recipe is amazing! Love to pair it with mashed potatoes and veggies. the chicken is juicy, crispy on the outside and buttery... i made no changes to the recipe and it was perfect, every now and then i add a little extra butter and let it crisp a little longer... just love it!

Pretty tasty dish. I used bigger chicken breast which helped keep them juicy. The smaller breasts got a bit dry. Very flavorful and easy to do.

this was so incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious.  surrounding the chicken with the butter pieces definitely did a lot for the flavor. for someone big on flavor, i am always dipping my chicken in some type of sauce...but with this recipe, it needed no extra, so good!

Wow, Haulbur, way to go! I do agree, however, that the cooking time should be decreased for maximum tender and juicyness. This is a 'casual' recipe that I can whip up quickly for unexpected company, leaving them thinking that I just have a natural knack for cooking. - I rate recipes by how they taste - not their 'health attributes' - I do know not to overdue it with the higher cholesteral dishes. So, as far as taste accounts, this recipe is a real winner, and I would proudly serve it to family and friends alike! Thanks for pointing out that simple additions can make a BIG difference!

So amazingly easy.  I like this  better than another version that calls for using cream of chicken soup in the recipe.  There's no need for the extra fat and calories and the topping (crackers) stay crisp this way.

Yummy! Next time I will trim the salt. When you are watching your salt you can really taste it. Use low salt crackers, garlic powder instead of garlic salt. You could also use un-salted butter.

I have made this recipe numerous times.  When I don't have the cracker crumbs I have substituted with mashed potato flakes.  I have also used pork chops instead of chicken breasts.  My kids ask for this at least once a week.

This was fantastic! My very very very picky-eater husband gobbled it up. I also cut down on the butter a bit. 40 minutes was perfect. And I'm probably the worst cook ever, so if I can make this (a huge hit) you can make this fabulous chicken!!!

This dish was very tasty.  I used 1/4 cup butter and added dried onion, basil, grated Parmesan and garlic powder.  It was full of flavor and the aroma in the house while cooking made it hard to wait for the chicken to be cooked.  Will make again.

YUM!!!  This was so good, I was so surprised.  I dredged my chicken in flour first, then egg, then the cracker mixture.  I used a few tablespoons of butter, but there wasn't much to drizzle over the top, which was ok because I flipped them halfway through and then sprinkled the top with shredded parmesan cheese.  The chicken is so amazingly moist, but the coating is not crispy (if that is something you are going for).

Very tasty dish!  The garlic adds a very nice touch.  Make sure not to overcook the chicken so as to keep the juiciness of the meat, and don't put the butter on top of the chicken, just around the sides.  The crackers are delicious and I was surprised at how crispy this came out.  A definite keeper!

Very good taste.  The chicken was wonderfully moist.  Husband doesn't like breast meat because it is often dry, and he was pleasantly surprised with this one.  I did double the garlic salt per suggestions, but that was the only change I made.

Chicken was very moist.  I ommitted the half cup of butter.  Chicken was delicious without it!  Thx for sharing!!

It was a really good recipe. I added a few things (paprika and parmesean cheese both in the mix and on top) and used only 1/4 cup of butter.

I'm rating this as 4 stars because I think the original recipe is quite bland. I read reviews before making and took everyone's advice: I cut down on the butter and added much more seasoning to the cracker mix. I added onion powder, paprika, lemon pepper and garlic powder. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and dipped in lemon juice instead of egg. Came out very lemony and everyone loved it :) I'll try dipping in egg next time.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS! Only change I made was that I melted the butter and poured it over the chicken pieces before baking (rather than dotting the butter around the chicken).

Very good!  Instead of putting butter around the chicken, I drizzled some over and then sprayed it with butter-flavored cooking spray.  I also used reduced-fat butter crackers and added some garlic powder to them.  This was incredibly easy to make and tasted so good!

I was really disappointed with this recipe after seeing all the great reviews.  The chicken was tender and quite moist, but also very bland.  This recipe has potential but I won't make it again as is.

Turned out really good.  I used less cracker crumbs than it called for because I added grated parmesan cheese.  I also used less butter than the recipe called for.

This is a great and easy basic recipe.  I do season the chicken prior to dipping in the egg as it does turn out bland if I don't.  I can see that this is a great jumping off point for the lemon herbed chicken, an Italian chicken, etc.

Awesome! My family now calls this da bomb chicken cause it is sooooo good.  One time I didn't have crackers to use for batter so I put a few wheat thins, tostitos, sun chips, basically whatever I had in the pantry and it turned out great. The butter makes the chicken so moist.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The chicken came out very moist. The crackers give it a nice flavor. Next time I will double the recipe so I will have leftovers, because there wasn't any.

The only problem I had with this was my on doing, I used boneless thighs instead of breast. Don't do that, it's entirely too greasy. Next time I will use breast.

Very easy! Very good, moist and juicy! I used saltine crackers (just because I had those on hand) and this dish looked great.  I cooked mine a little longer just to get the "crust" browner but a new family staple. :) thanks for posting!

Amazing chicken recipe!!!! I had the chicken in the oven in 8 min, can't beat that.  My husband is not a fan of chicken breast (prefers chicken on the bone) and he loved it.  Full of flavor and moist.  Love it.

Cooked this yesterday for my husband and myself.  Delicious!  Did not use the garlic as my husband doesn't like it.  But was so tender.  No knife needed.  Thanks for sharing recipe.  Can't wait to cook it again!

This recipe was great! Its was very quick and easy to make, and with four children, I need quick and easy. It came out perfect. All of my kids loved it and had seconds!! It's going in my rotation! The only things changed was decreasing the baking time to 30 to 35 minutes.  I also added tyme, garlic and onion powder to my cracker cumbs. It came out great!

This is one FANTASTIC! recipe!  The chicken was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it, a fork worked just fine.  I did pound the chicken breast before I dredged in milk and crumb mixture. I sprinkled olive oil across chicken along with the pats of butter over each chicken breast.  Baked for 50 min. depending on size of chicken breast one uses. Mine were bigger than normal. This is a KEEPER!

Had to modify it because of time but still turned out good. Guess I know what is going in the lunch box in the morning.  Used chicken fingers instead of breast and pan fried it with butter flavored Crisco.

Excellent!  Quick & easy.  I added some onion powder & a little basil to the cracker mixture, used about 1/3 c. butter & only baked for 30ish minutes.  Served it with loaded mashed potatoes & asparagus with hollandaise sauce.  Was delicious! My company loved it!

Maybe I used too much butter, but mine turned out soggy and not crispy at all.  Also, a little over done and dry per the time given.  I prefer to use Oven Baked Crispy Chicken mix - very flavorful and always crispy and moist.  Only 20 min. at 450.

Did this recipe with regular saltines, as I did not have the round butter crackers on hand. Still came out incredible. You don't need salt as the crackers add enough of it. But I was so surprised how juicy the chicken remained!!!

My mom used to make a variation of this recipe.  Instead of using eggs to dip, and placing butter on top .... I just dip the chicken in melted butter before dredging in the crumbs.  Also, I add parmesan cheese to the crumbs and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Absolutely Delicious! I did omit the garlic salt and used garlic powder instead. And I melted my butter and dipped the chicken in the butter and then the crumbs without cracking an egg. Really, really good.
Tahnk You!

I was looking for something quick to make last night and this fit the bill. After reading a some reviews I shortened the baking time, otherwise, I followed the recipe to a 't'. This was a huge family hit and I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Haulbur!

Great base recipe!! The few changes i made were to dredge the chicken breasts in flour seasoned with ground mustard, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and chipotle spice. Then I dipped them in an eggwash with about 1 tsp honey, 1 tbsp of sriracha sauce, garlic powder, onion powder and a little lemon zest. I then breaded the chicken with crushed ritz crackers seasoned with chipotle spice, ground mustard, onion powder and garlic powder. I placed the breasts in a baking dish and placed a little bit of butter around them with some minced garlic, and a larger pat of butter on each breast with the juice from a jar of minced garlic on top of the butter (in case you couldn't tell, i love garlic). I cooked the breasts @ 350 for 15 minutes, flipped them over and baked for another 10 minutes....came out FANTASTIC!! served with chipotle mac and cheese from this site

This was one of the very first recipes I made from this site, years ago, and I am still making it today. We love it! I add some parsley in with the crackers, and have found that I can cut back on the butter a little without compromising taste. Its so good every time. Thanks for one of our favorite meals!

I made this last week and my husband couldn't stop singing my praises. My 2 year old ate as much as we did. It's super easy and I always have these ingredients. The chicken practically melts in your mouth! I'm making it again tonight.

This one's a keeper in our house!  I used my blender to crush the Ritz crackers.  Chicken came out really golden brown and crunchy.  Really good flavor.  I added generous amounts of greek seasoning, paprika and black pepper in addition to the garlic salt.  Thanks for a new addition to our rotation!

I made this for dinner last night as it had very high reviews. I have to admit, I was a little bit disappointed. We found the chicken to be a little bland for our tastes. The chicken was good, but I think as the recipe is written, it's 3 stars. I think it's a good foundation though, and that with a little tweaking, it could easily be 5 stars.   I'm rating the recipe as it's written. I don't think that I could fairly rate the recipe if I've completely changed it...after all, then I'm rating MY version of the recipe and not the recipe itself.  I think kids would really enjoy this, and again, I think with a little tweaking, it could easily be a 5 star dish!

I made this recipes yesterday. DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly as written. The chicken was moist and tender with a crunchy outside coating. Even my little three year old grandson loved it! Today I reheated one of the cooked breasts, sliced it and served it over a salad. Wonderful reheated!!!!!

Wonderful and very tasty.  My whole family loves this recipe.  It is important to use buttery crackers!  I also add poppy seeds to the crackers.  It adds a great flavor.

I LOVED this recipe. I cooked two batches, one sticking to the recipe and one I added plain yogurt to the egg wash. I preferred the yogurt one, as it helped keep the chicken more moist. Excellent recipe!

It's an easy recipe, and it was pretty good, but it wasn't great.  It needed more flavor.  I dipped the chicken in buttermilk instead of eggs, I don't think that changed anything though.  The mistake I made though was to omit the butter.  I will try this again, and use the melted butter next time, hopefully that will help crisp the breading more and give a little more flavor.

This recipe is excellent.  It was easy and quick to put together and the chicken came out moist, the breading crisp and the flavor unique.  My husband loved it and said it was a "keeper".

Great recipe... I used less butter, cooked for 30 minutes, and used garlic powder with everything else. 4 stars because it tastes a little bland... but I like things that have a stronger taste to them.

Simple, but awesome. It can taste a little plain depending on what you're having it with and your tastes, so don't be afraid to add some more seasoning to your cracker crumbs.

I really liked this recipe, as did the rest of the family.  For me it was a little bland - next time i'll probably add some seasoned salt or something like that - but great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Very easy and very good.  I made mine into chicken fingers, baked for about 25-30 minutes and chicken turned out very tender and moist.  I did follow another reviewers advice and turned chicken twice while baking.  Will be making again.

I did what other reviewers said and only used 1/4 cup of butter. I cooked it for only 25 minutes in a pyrex dish and spooned some of the melted butter over the top of the chicken. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. It came out great, I'll definitely make this again.

Wonderful!! Great flavor and very juicy! I only baked mine for 30 minutes however I had smaller chicked breasts so that may make a difference.  I didn't have any "Juices" to spoon over like another rater did, at least not enough to even get in a spoon. I always put my chicken breasts in salt water for minimum of 30 minutes and that helps with tenderizing. Served with cheezy peas and fried potatoes.  Definitely will do this again!

I just love Allrecipes, I had some chicken breasts thawing and was hoping I would find a different way to cook them...Wow did I ever!  This was delicious and everyone liked the chicken in my family!  I even followed the photo´s tip of having mashed potatoes with sweet corn on the side.  For me this is midwestern cooking.  I  am an American living  in Germany and often crave some nice country  cooking, this hit the spot ;)  Thank you Haulbur.

Although the recipe was easy as can be, the chicken tasted extremely bland. Needs to be "doctored up."

I just made this for dinner and everyone was pleased... especially my mother.  I didn't have any crackers so I used parmesan bread crumbs instead.  I used 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup.  I cooked for the full 40 min.  Next time I will use the crackers, 1/2 cup butter and cook for 30 minutes.  Then it will be perfect for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes on here. I love the coating on this chicken and I have even tried it on pork chops and it was good. Thank you for submitting such an easy and good recipe. Oh yea and cut the butter down a little or it won't get crispy!

This was fantastic.  My husband said this was the most tender chicken he has ever ate...And he usually has a minor complaint about everything!  I melted the butter in a baking dish in the oven first.  Next time I will use slightly less butter, I ended up pouring some of the butter out before it was done so that it would "crisp" up.  I also added minced onion and paprika to the garlic, salt, and pepper mixture.  I also flipped the chicken once about halfway through.  Overall, it was probably the best chicken I've ever eaten.

Very good as written, but even better with a few changes.  I did make the recipe as written the first time but since then I've made a few changes.  First, I cut the amount of butter in half.  Also, I do add more seasonings to the crumb mixture (paprika, onion powder, garlic powder in place of the garlic salt).

This is a great recipe!  Our new favorite way to eat chicken!!!  We're a gluten free family so I crushed up some gluten free crackers and breaded the chicken that way.  SO GOOD!!!!

Great taste.  Very moist.  Made recipe as is.  With the amount of butter used don't expect to find the recipe on cooking light too, but it's yummy.

Simply put this is the best breaded chicken I have ever made.  So simple, and fast.  We just love it.  Add whatever kind of spices that you want to the crackers, and I cook it at 350 for 45 minutes, just perfect.....:)

I found this one somewhat difficult to rate.  I wasn't really a fan but my very picky 3 yr old ate it and my husband really liked it as well.  I felt it was too plain and mine came out a bit soggy (which might just be the cook's fault).  But I also had a very bad cold when I ate this so the blame might lie in my damaged taste buds.  I will try again and if I decide it really was due to my tastebuds I will update my review.

My husband and I fell in LOVE with this recipe! Oh so good! I added a little garlic cloves instead of the salt and a table spoon of Lowery's seasoning salt as well. EXCELLENT! Don't forget the pieces of butter around the chicken. It adds a great flavor!

This came out really good.  The chicken was moist and tender but the bottoms were soggy.  I turned them over and broiled them for a couple of minutes to try and crisp them up.  I also added some garlic powder in addition to the garlic salt because we like our food garlicky.  I only needed one egg.

It was "okay"....  I made this recipie last night, making no changes to the original.  It was simply "okay" - not nearly as good as the oven fried chicken I've been making from this site (which is more work, but worth it).

This was absolutely amazing.  I actually used Keebler Club Crackers specifically the buttery garlic brand and that added a sublime flavor to this dish.  The chicken was moist and extremely tasty and this is officially my go to baked chicken dish. So long bread crumbs!

Marinated in balsamic vinegrette for about an hour then dipped chicken breasts into italian style panko with 2T flour. I then sprayed my baking pan with cooking spray and placed butter around the chicken breasts. I ended up using less than 1/2 stick of butter. Crunchy and moist...very good and simple.

This is so simple. Crushed the crackers in a big bag and then threw the chicken in to shake. Amazing flavor with only a few ingredients.

Pretty good.  I just like the coating on chicken to get crunchy, and the bottom of this one was soggy.  I should have turned it half way through.  I followed the advice of adding 1/4 c. flour to the cracker crumbs, so I put 1 t. garlic salt in thinking it would need more flavor.  It ended up a little too salty.  I wouldn't do that again.  I didn't factor that into my rating.  I might try this one again.

Great taste!  Used only about a 1/4 cup of butter, if it was even that ... I wouldn't go less than that or else it turns out dry.  Loved the crunchy crust; better than fried, in my opinion!  Thanks! :)

This was really good, even my picky 9 year old ate it!  The only changes that I made was I added parmesan cheese to the cracker mix and I didn't have garlic salt so I added salt and garlic power.  We only had chicken tenderloins so I adjusted the baking time.

Wow this is now my favorite chicken dish!!  I didn't have the crackers that the recipe called for so I used multi-grain Vegetable Thins and it turned out amazing!  One warning:  do not make this while you're starving...the aroma coming from the oven is enough to drive you mad!

I made this for my very picky seven year old. I had him crush the crackers in a bag. I left out the garlic salt but added chicken seasoning, salt and pepper. I also melted the butter and added it to the egg. I dipped the chicken in the butter/egg mix and tossed it in the bag and let him shake it. We all loved this recipe! Very moist and flavorful!

This was delicious.  Did not have to use all of the butter, but used most of it.  Added 1 tsp onion powder, used 1 tsp garlic powder, and salted separately.  Baked for 25 minutes because I used tenders instead of breast halves.  Loved it.  I live alone, so I was able to freeze the unused portions which is handy.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is probably the moistest chicken that I have cooked. Other reviews are helpful with this recipe: use 1/4 c of butter and place the cooling rack inside the baking dish in order to prevent the chicken from tasting soggy. Chicken breasts usually take 30 minutes to bake evenly (using the cooling rack required 35-38 minutes for my chicken to cook though).  Using fresh rosemary is an easy way to add great flavor and aroma. I chopped two sprigs of fresh rosemary and garlic (2 cloves), and combined them with the cracker crumbs (easy as pie in a zip lock bag).  I used the remaining rosemary on red bliss potatoes, which were a nice complement to the chicken. This website has a great and easy recipe for red bliss potatoes.

Maybe it is just me, but it was toooo sweet. Ritz crackers are really sweet & then add all that butter.... It was edible, but I wouldn't fix it again. There are better ways of cooking chicken for it to come out moist.

I followed the recipe and had high hopes for this chicken, but we were just not very impressed. It was moist but we felt it was really lacking in flavor. My kids and I only had a few bites and my husband only had a small amount. I won't be making this again.

I LOVE this recipe! It's by far my favorite recipe for breaded, baked chicken that I've ever used. I used chicken breast tenderloins (about 7 small pieces), and for my crumb mixture I used a sleeve of Ritz crackers, Italian seasonings, flour, pepper onion powder and Parmesan cheese. I sprayed the bottom of the dish with cooking spray, and only used about 2 tablespoons of butter pieces around the chicken. I sprayed the tops of my chicken to give them that extra crispiness. I only had to cook mine for about 27 minutes and it was so tender I didnt even need a knife! My chicken didn't get soggy and i didn't have problems with the breading falling off or sticking to the bottom of the pan like I usually do-must be the buttery crackers. Anyway, this will be a staple in my recipe box for crispy breaded chicken from now on! Thanks!

I LOVE this chicken! It's so buttery and moist. I cut my chicken in smaller pieces so it would cook faster and do my daughter would eat it, she ate almost 4 pieces by the way and she is the pickiest eater ever. I also added more butter than called, and added some garlic. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

super good...only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the bottom does get soggy - I would suggest putting the chicken on a rack in the 9x13 pan to get all sides crispy. This will definitely go into the rotation!

Great recipe- I will definitely make this again!  The chicken was so moist and almost flaky!  I only baked for about 22 minutes though- 40 would have been way too long.  Next time I might add some herbs to the cracker mixture to give it more flavor.

Mediocre recipe.  The chicken was tender but it did not have much taste besides that of the butter and buttery crackers.  Not a recipe that either my husband or I really wish to keep for later.

A small twist on this recipe that kids will love! Out of crackers one time, so I used crushed cheddar cheese fish crackers with parmesan cheese. The kids named the dish "Fish Chicken."

I used half the butter this recipe called for and completely forgot the garlic.  Just salt and pepper worked very well.  This seems like it will be a good recipe to try with different spices.

Our family loves this!  My teenage daughter can make it easily on those days when I can't make it home in time to get dinner together.  We use a "Ritz" type cracker and cut the chicken breasts into more manageable pieces.  It makes it sort of like chicken nuggets without the frying.  Yum!

This recipe is very Juicy, Moist, and Easy. I was confused on what buttery crackers to use so I used Club crackers. I'm curious as to what other people used. I took some advice and cooked it for only 30 min and only added 1/3 cup butter. I also added onion powder. I cut my breasts into long stripes. I love the way its moist where the butter is and kind of crunchy on top b/c the cracker crumbs. I will make this for a family get together.

This is such a great recipe!  Even my daughter, who does not like chicken unless it is a McNugget, loved it.  I used chicken strips instead of the chicken breast and it was really good.  It took less time to cook as well which is a wonderful thing when you have 3 kids going in different directions.  Thanks for sharing this one!!!

Was really good but was disappointed with the top not being crispy at all, it just turned out soggy for some reason.  I even followed other reviews too. Great with mashed potatoes!!  Will make again and do something different with the topping!

Great recipe but if you want to make it more interesting add some meat tenderizer, lots of garlic salt, and chicken seasoning to the bread crumbs and add a little steak sauce and worcestor sauce to the eggs. mix the breadcrumb seasoning and beat the egg dip. sprinkle chunks of butter all over the tray and chicken not just the sides, add a thin layer of the breadcrumb left overs on top of the tray, over the chicken and butter and it will taste incredible  Or dont change the recipe, either way its great.

Easy, delicious, tender, and moist.   I will never use the "Shake and Bake" product again.  There is no comparision.  Followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 stick butter and baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.(Baking time was appropriate for the size of boneless, skinless breast I had on hand - larger breast will take more time) No other changes were necessary.  However, I wish the coating was a bit crisper.  I will experiment next time.   Thanks.

Used a little olive oil and cut back on the butter for health reasons, one egg with skim milk and used low-fat crackers. Good, quick and easy! Reducing one star because mine were done in 25 minutes - 40 min will give you dry chicken breasts.

Very good recipe. My picky husband commented on how moist the chicken was and called it a keeper. We are very much spice people, so I did add some Italian Seasoning and Onion Powder, but that was my only modification. Will definitely make again.

I used whole chicken legs that I dipped in a margarine/Worcestershire mixture, then coated in a garlic powder/pepper/chili powder/crushed corn flakes crust. They came out okay, except that when you cut into the meat the whole coating pulls off; perhaps this is because I didn't use eggs as the "glue".  The chicken itself was moist, but lacked flavour.

Awesome chicken.  I don't use garlic salt. I use garlic powder and salt seperately. Sometimes things need more garlic seasoning and I don't want to add additional salt to the dish.  I mixed the garlic powder in with the crumbs and I also added it to the egg mixture.  I sprinkled in some paprika for a bit of color and I added some minced onion to give it a little bit more flavor.  I had to set 2 cutlets aside for my daughter who was working late and I was afraid that they would be mushy when I put them in the oven when she got home but they turned out just as crispy and delicious as the ones I made earlier in the evening. So this is a recipe you can put together quickly and easily and pop in the oven when you want to eat.  Next time I might coat the chicken with lite mayo and then in the cracker crumbs. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe made no changes...(you can't really give a good review if you don't follow the recipe)and thought it was ok. The chicken was very moist, but bland. My 6 year old son loved it, and if I can get him to eat anything I'm lucky. I would make it again, maybe season the chicken next time.

This was good. I crushed up the crackers a bit coarsely, which carried the cracker flavour well. I used a bit less butter and only one egg beaten with a splash of milk instead of 2 eggs. Everyone here enjoyed it. I served it with macaroni and cheese and with broccoli.

This was very tasty. I did add 1/4 cup of flour to the cracker crumbs, after the chicken was well coated I then seasoned them with garlic/onion powder and pepper. I poured 1/2 stick of melted butter over the chicken breasts. I cooked them in a 8&8 dish, I only had 3 breasts but they were in there pretty tight. Unfortunately mine didn't turn out pretty. They tasted great though! The next day I reheated them in the oven on a pan, at 400 degrees, for about 10 min each side. They tasted great reheated, do not reheat in the microwave -- that would not be pretty! (yuck)

I've always had trouble with baked chicken sticking to the pan,but the butter kept it from sticking at all and kept it moist.I used 4 chicken breast halves,but they were 1 1/3 lbs.I recommend adding some extra seasoning if you have more than 1 pound of chicken.Good recipe(:

Instead of dipping in eggs, coat chicken pieces (generously) in sour cream that's been mixed with 1 tablespoon of Lawry's seasoning salt, then coat in the crackers. Bake at 275 for 1 hr 15 minutes, do not skimp on the butter and do not cover with foil. It cooks slow and uncovered so that the coating does not melt off the chicken. This is an old church recipe that is so popular with everyone, they serve it when they want a big turnout.

With a little more garlic salt this is really good. It doesn't need all that butter. I only used 1/4 cup. It came out a little bland but so juicy. I will be making again.

This a a real winner. I was out of eggs so I coated the chicken in mayo then dipped in crumbs, it was the absolute juiciest chicken I have ever prepared. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli for a easy yummy meal. Definately a keeper.

I have been resisting this recipe for a long time because it seems so unhealthy and so plain. I made it last night when there was literally nothing left int he house to cook - I was surprised at how good it was! I did add some basil and garlic to the egg wash. I also cut the butter in half, but drizzled some olive oil on the chicken as well. The time/temps were perfect, the chicken was juicy and very flavorful. I'm sorry I waited so long to cook this one!

I doubled this and used chicken thighs. I've been cutting back on our salt intake so I used garlic powder. I also added a tsp. of italian seasoning. Even doubling it, I thought that a cup of butter might be a little excessive. I melted half of a stick of butter and that was more than enough to drizzle over eight chicken thighs. I think if I would have done more, it would have been too much. I'll update this once we've tried this at dinner. EDITED: Excellent. I'm really glad I didn't overdo it on the butter. What I used was just enough. I think if I make this again, I'd add more spices to jazz it up more.

I followed this recipe to a T. I have to say I am a bit disappointed. The crust was a bit soggy and didn't turn out as the original photo. The flavor was only in the crust, beyond that was just plain flavorless chicken. It was juicy, but I cut the time down to 30 minutes, any longer would have dried it out.

Wow! Excellent recipe.  Like others, I made a few changes.  I lightly sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with cooking spray, and skipped the butter.  I added 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning and 1-2 tbsp or parmesan cheese to the crushed crackers.  Instead of using garlic salt, I used 1 tsp of Garlic Plus (Club House).  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was simple and delicious. I only used 1/4 cup butter because a whole stick seemed like too much.  Also I cooked it for the whole 40 mins because it was still pink after 25.  I made this before work and when I got home it was all gone, devoured by my husband and his friend who said it tasted like KFC chicken.

I love this recipe but am only giving it 4 stars due to the fat content of the dish.  I have made using 1/2 cup butter and it is delicious, but will try with 1/4 cup next time as others have suggested and see how the flavor holds up.

This recipe was delicious! The chicken was moist and tender. As written, the coating sounded bland to me, so I used seasoning salt and other spices in the cracker mixture. Also, this was WAY too much butter for the four large chicken breasts I used. The top browned perfectly, but the bottom was soggy from the melted butter. Other than that, one of the best chicken recipes I have tried!

I also include cheese flavored chip crumbs, such as Cheddar Cheese Pringles, to the cracker mix to add a cheesy flavor to the chicken. The amount of chips depends on your taste.

This was very tasty and easy - I will make again. I dredged the chicken in flour before dipping it in the egg and cracker crumbs, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. 1/4 cup of butter would definitely have been enough. The crust was crisp, not soggy, and the chicken is moist and has a great flavor.

Not sure how anyone could rate this lower than a 5? This was SO quick and easy and the end result was DELICIOUS!!! I made with 7 split chicken breasts and should have stuck with 2 eggs, I didn't measure the crackers I used a whole roll of Ritz and probably could have just used 1/2. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN FOR SURE!

I made this for dinner tonight using a few of the other reviews suggestions. I used chicken tenders because thats what I had and coated them in flour before the egg and then cracker mixture. I used satines and added about a 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the mix. I even had some unexpected company show up while these were baking and everyone loved them too. I love that it uses stuff we all already have on hand. Try it you'll love it too.

I used an 8x8 dish with 3 chicken breasts and put about 1/3 cup of butter cut up in the open spaces.  I also added 1/4 cup flour to the cracker mix as another reviewer suggested.  I baked for 30 minutes and it was great!  I wouldn't leave it in any longer.

So I was online all day yesterday trying to find the perfect NO FRY Fried chicken recipe & I found this one that seemed the easiest. So I went home last night & made it... OH MY!!! It was soo good, I did take several notes from other people, I added flour to the crackers & seasoned everything (chicken, flour, crackers, eggs...thats just me) It was perfect. I did cut back on the butter & I think it would have been better in a smaller pan 8x8 (someone else also noted that but I didnt listen. It was soo moist & crispy at the same time... I would definitely reccommend this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I took others suggestions and added a half a packet of dry ranch dressing mix to the cracker crumbs for some added flavor and a little flour to help it stick better.  We always seem to make too much but the leftovers are gone the next day!  Gave it four stars just because we did add a few little things.

Great baked chicken breast recipe!  FAST & EASY.  I did make some modifications. After marniating chicken breasts in 1 1/2 C Buttermilk I dreadged in breading mixture.  I pumped up the mixture by  garlic salt 1 tsp, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp Cajun seasoning and added apx 1/2 C corse shredded romano cheese. Lots of course black pepper (no salt).  Baked as directed...apx. 35 min. for med sized breasts.  Let rest before serving.  VERY juciey and just delicious!!

This is such a great recipe. I Tried the pork chops made with the same coating first and loved it. It never dawned on me to use the same thing on chicken.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was really really good...but it will only be really good if you add more spices to it...just garlic will not cut it!

Wow - we loved this recipe...however - way too much butter - I drizzled 1/4 Cup of melted butter over the chicken and it was plenty for flavor and adding some crispness.  Definately season the cracker crumbs well.  I cooked for the 40 min. and mine were so moist.  Just depends on the size of the breasts - mine were big and I did not pound them flat.

Absolutely delicious!!!  My entire family LOVED this.  I make mine with steamed green beans, garlic and chive mashed potatoes, & the cheddar bay biscuits recipe on this site.

Tried it and what a hit.  The only change I made was I added more butter when cooking it.  I do not advise you do that though.  It was a tad bit greasy then.  Great reicipe!

This was soooo yummy.  I had to use bread crumbs instead of crackers since I didn't have any and it was great.

Very tasty!  I swapped garlic powder for the garlic salt, added a little lemon pepper to the crackers.  One sleeve of Ritz crackers was just perfect.  I like that you could dress up or down this chicken just by switching up your sides.

OMG this was so good!!!  How can something so simple be so dang good!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all.  I did melt the butter because I thought that was what I was supposed to do until I read thru the entire recipe.  But I just poured it all over and it still turned out wonderful.  I used chicken tenders because that is what I had on hand.  This is so good.  Did I say that all ready?

Yum!  This is the first time my husband has rated one at 5 stars!  I used chicken tenders (or cutlets) since it was what I thawed :)  Like another reviewer suggested I crused the crackers in a large ziplock bag and added the spices, I also added some Tony Chachere's (creole seasoning) probably about 1 1/2 T.  Added a dash of white wine to the baking dish (just enough to moisten) and baked for 30 minutes.  This was so good.  The butter kept the chicken moist but the crackers stayed crispy.  THANK YOU!

My Sister actually told me how great this recipe was and I tried it once at her house  but she had made it with pork chops that time and I thought they were extremely tasty, so I finally bit the bullet and tried the recipe.  Man was this great and boy do I wish I had tried it sooner.  My Husband kept saying during dinner how good the chicken was, and how moist it was.  Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of I also added lemon pepper seasoning.  Again, Thank you for a recipe that I will definitely put in my Must make file.

this should be rated with twenty 
***** ***** ***** *****.  there, i did it.  and the healthy part is-you drink more water.  i have shared this recipe with friends and family.  my aunt has used with chicken wings.  my taste buds have done dances with this and tripped over one another.  that's alright-they'll get over it.  my alternate version is with pork chops with the ritz cracker crumbs and pork chops with stove top stuffing crumbs

My husband loves this. Every time I make it he raves. I like it but I’m not over the moon about it. I use about a fourth of the amount called for. I also add an Italian spice mix to the bread crumb mixture.

I love this recipe! Quick, and so yummy! I agree with other reviewers that the chicken should be flipped halfway through cooking, or at least basted with the butter.

I'm always on the lookout for toddler friendly food and with a little variation, this recipe was perfect!  I cut the breasts into strips, then dipped them in egg and coated them with cracker crumbs.  Also, I used my coffee grinder to grind the crackers very fine so I could get a good, even coating.  Whip up a little dipping sauce (or open a jar like I did) and you've got tasty chicken fingers any toddler will love!  The best part was that they cooked in only 13 minutes!  Quick and easy!  Kuddos!

Excellent recipe! This was made by my 11 year old daughter. It was easy and the outcome...tasty! This was the first meal (besides breakfast) she ever cooked alone. According to her, the directions are easy to follow. I recommend this meal for everyone...beginning cooks to old. The only thing we did different was reduce the amount of butter...still tasty!

Super moist ! I used 1/2 the butter and it still turned out great - added a little cheese to the top of the chicken right before it was done and turned the temperature up to get the top extra crispy. Will make again !!!

I added some seasoned breadcrumbs to the cracker mixture and took the advice of other users to cook it for only 25 minutes. This came out soooo good, just like my mother used to make it for me when I was a kid.

Wow!! This was awesome! I forgot to add the butter, but it made no difference because it was wonderful! I will try it as written next time, because I'm curious to know how much better it will be with the butter!  We're going to start making this on a regular basis now! Thanks for the great recipe!

My kids loved this chicken. I did cut back on the butter, I used about 3T. A whole stick of butter would definitely make it 'butter chicken', but I try not to clog my arteries to that extent. I served with the 'orzo and rice' and 'buttery cooked carrot' recipes from this site, and it made a nice kid friendly meal.

No wonder this recipe has so many great reviews. It was delicious. I pounded and fileted the chicken breast. The amount of garlic salt was just enough to add flavor, without tasting like GARLIC. It was easy and turned out moist, tender, and flavorful. My husband and I both loved it. Will make again.

I also cut back on the butter and melted it, drizzling it over before cooking.  I had chicken tenders and they were cooked just right in 30 minutes.  I turned them over in the last 6 minutes.

This was the most tender chicken I have ever made in the oven. Both my husband and I loved it. I used smoked paparika for added flavor.

Use a lot less butter than what is called for--next time, I'll probably use 1/2 the amount called--it was bathing in butter when I took it out. Other than that, it was very moist and delicious.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and never fails to draw raves from family and friends. Recently, I began adding adobo (the powder version, not the sauce) to the bread crumbs instead of the garlic powder and it has enhanced the flavour quite well. You can find adobo in some supermarkets and most definitely in a Latin store. Enjoy!

This recipe is as simple as it gets.  I added the fab four of chicken seasonings (Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme); you can really season it how you like it and the flavor was GREAT.  It was tender, too.  But I don't know if I did something wrong, but I expected a nice crisp crust that just didn't happen.  The crackers formed a pastey white goo on the bottom, so I thought I'd flip it over and give it an additional 5-7 minutes.  Bad idea.  When I took it up, all the breading stayed in the pan.  Still in all, it was flavorful and there were no leftovers.

I’ve always had trouble with dried baked chicken, this recipe solved that problem, I like to experiment with recipes to see what works and what doesn’t, while I was crushing the crackers I soaked the pierced chicken in the beaten egg, then added coconut flakes to the cracker crumbs, I know it sounds wired but it came out really good..  It was semi sweet with a buttery flavor, everyone loved them and the chicken came out really moist, I baked them for about 25 min. covered then broiled them for about 3 minutes uncovered to toast the coconut.. Fabulous.. This is a keeper.. Thanks for sharing

Excellent, excellent dish. Just made it again for the second time and in fact My boyfriend Mike asked for it . If he asks for something a second time it has to be good. The crumbs make this so buttery and very , very moist. I would give it ten stars!!!!

Truly Wonderful & in the words of my 8 year old daughter:, "Great crunch taste on the outside and moist on the inside", In fact it was so easy to make that I let her prepare it - what great mommy/daughter time. :-). We will definitely be making this again and again and again!!! I've already emailed it to several family members and friends. This is a must for any busy parent. GRRREEEAAAATTTT!!!

Didn't have crackers on hand so used crushed Rice Krispies instead (I was hesitant but, they worked fine!).  Also used thighs and baked for the full 40 minutes--skin side down for first half, then turned for last half for crispy brown skins. Used half the butter. Yummy results that my finicky 4 yr old loved too!

Great recipe!! Very easy to make. Definitely will make again. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added a 1/2 pack of the dry ranch dressing mix and it definitely makes a difference.

Everyone in my family loved this. I cut the chicken into strips, used whole wheat Ritz crackers, and seasoned the crumbs with extra garlic salt and poultry seasoning, and baked for about 20 minutes. Great, quick recipe and a nice departure from my regular grilled chicken breasts. Well worth the extra calories as an occasional splurge.

I am giving this 5 stars because I think this would ahve been awesome IF I had not messed it up. I found some boneless skinless chicken thighs on sale at Sam
s cluba nd decided to use those instead of chicken breasts. I am warning all of you, DO NOT DO THAT! The texture of the chicken thighs was gross. I have never even eaten a boneless chicken thigh before and neither had my husband and we thought it was SICK. I could tell that if I had not used that choice of meat that this would have been SO good. I am going to try this again and use the chicken breasts. I am telling you you evidently get what you pay for, I wish I had paid full price and got the chicken breasts instead. The flavor of the crust was good, it was the meat that just killed it. Dont make the mistake I did!!!

Amazing!  I avoided this recipe for a while because it seemed kind of boring in comparison to those exotic breadings that involve cheeses and crackers and bread crumbs, etc.  However, I followed the recipe exactly and the husband claimed it was his favorite chicken dish EVER.  The moistness of the chicken is delish and the cracker coating is soooo yummy!!!  I'm so glad I gave it a shot!

I've made this several times over the last year or so.  It turns out fantastic every time!  Chicken is moist and breading is crispy.  The breading does get a bit soggy when leftovers are refrigerated, but I don't have much leftover!

Great recipe!  However I changed it a little.  Instead of using garlic salt I added roasted garlic bread crumbs because I did not have enough crackers.  It turned out great.  Plus I cut the chicken into strips so my kids could pick it up with there fingers and eat it.  I had to double the cracker crumbs. Overall a good and easy recipe. Thanks!

This was AN INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS dish! It was very simple to make and my family will definitely be adding this recipe to our 'favorites' list! I did use herb flavored Ritz crackers (rather than just plain) as some other users recommended. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Although the concept is a good one (using the crackers as coating), I also thought this was extremely bland.  I even added extra garlic salt.  If I attempt this again, I will add more spices to the coating before baking.

YUM!  The only thing I did differently was I used the food processor on the cracker so they were good and crumby because I don't like bigger hunks of cracker.

Wonderful. A friend recommended using garlic ritz. I use whole wheat and it comes out very tasty.

Great recipe.  I also sprayed breaded chicken breasts with some spray butter and then only used 1/4 cup of butter for remainder of recipe.  I always bake my chicken at 400 degrees for 26 minutes.  Turned out wonderful.  If you don't like a lot of butter this is not the recipe for you!

This was a decent meal. Easy and fast to prep and bakes in the oven so very little effort required. I did spoon the melted butter over the chicken while it was cooking though. I used the whole stick of butter even though it seemed like a lot and probably could have gotten by with half that much. The Hungry Teen ate two pieces, so it was a hit with him. I thought it was a little bland and needed more seasoning. Thanks.

I've made this a few times now, once with chicken breasts and once with tenders. Both times it came out wonderful. Fantastic flavor. My husband, who normally dosen't care for any kind of chicken loves this recipe. The only changes I made was using Roasted Vegetable Ritz crackers.Thanks for the post!

Despite my great hopes for this dish, it didn't turn out too well. It was pretty bland, and while it was moist on the inside, ours was quite tough on the outside. I liked the crushed crackers, however, so I may try a version of this recipe again.

This is a great easy chicken recipe. I baked it in a glass pan for 35 minutes and it was done perfectly.  The first words out of my husband's mouth were "this chicken is awesome!"  He liked the leftovers heated in the microwave too.

Very moist chicken.  It wasn't the most flavorful, but it wasn't dry at all.  I used low sodium ritz, and probably should have added some extra salt.  I think this would be good with a side dish with a very strong flavor.  I served this with a plain pasta, and I think both dishes suffered from the pairing.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am surprised at those who say this is bland - I have made it several times, and it is always perfect.  I use bread crumbs (plain or italian) instead of crackers.  I have even made this with pork chops and they were delicious - I cooked these a little longer just to be sure.  My husband (who is very picky!) always asks for this chicken.

Absolutely love this chicken recipe, even my 2 year-old granddaughter liked it (that was the real test). I did follow some others advice and added parmesean cheese and Italian seasonings. Chicken breast can sometimes be dry but not when it's prepared this way. I'm making it for dinner tonight. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have been making this dish for the past 4 years and have never changed anything about it.  Everyone always raves over the chicken and there are never leftovers.  In college I would make big batches for all of my friends.  It's a great dish to make when you are short on time but want to make a good impression.

After all the rave reviews I had to try this dish and I am glad that I did!  I used a combination of ritz crackers and cheese nips for the breading which worked very well.  I also added some cayenne pepper and parmesan cheese for added flavor.  My family loved it and asked that I double the recipe next time.

The chicken turned out very moist and tender. I changed the directions just a little by seasoning the chicken prior to dredging in the egg and cracker crumbs. After I put the chicken in the baking dish, I sprinkled crushed dried rosemary on top. It added a nice flavor. Will certainly make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I agree, it was great!  I flattenned the breasts a bit so they cooked longer, and I did need a bit more crumbs than called for.  Kids and I devoured it!  Actually, i've discovered that we like it better when we leave out the butter, and use half cheese crackers

This chicken is a fabulous dish to serve company.  It's quick and easy, yet very impressive.  I never used the full 1/2 cup butter -- sounds way too greasy for me.  Instead, I probably use about three tablespoons with great results.

I thought the chicken was good, but not five-star-worthy, when prepared as the recipe is written.  The chicken was very moist, but there just wasn't enough flavor for me.  I prepared the dish a second time, but I added Italian seasoning, poultry seasoning, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes; and I found the dish to be much more flavorful.

This was a very quick, simple and suprisingly delicious. Considering the amount of effort needed to make this dish, it's surprising how moist the chicken was. I substituted chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and reduce the time to 25 minutes. My family loved it, therefore it will a regular meal at our dinner table.

This is a great quick easy recipe. My daughter couldn't stop talking about how good it was and she had seconds! I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results, however next time I will add more spices/parmesan to the cracker crumbs and perhaps this recipe could be made even better with a cream sauce since there is not enough melted butter left over to pour over the chicken.

When my husband came home to this chicken, he said "ew, I don't like breaded chicken."  After he ate it, he said how great it was and he wants me to make it again tonight.  Very quick and easy.

This was excellent!  I added some more spices to give it more flavor...  I served it with broc/cheese rice and vegetables on the side.  I'd definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.  (Like other reviews mentioned, I reduced the cooking time to about 30 mins)

The chicken came out very tender--didn't even need a knife. The flaver was pretty good but some additional spices would make it even better.  I will make again.

This is an AWESOME recipe. Everyone will love this.  The chicken comes out flavorful, crispy on the outside and moist and tender. I suggest pounding your breasts if they are too thick. This is one of my favorites. I make it at least twice a month.

excellent chicken.  I cut mine into strips  so they didn't take as long to cook.  They were similar to chicken fingers that way.  They stayed very moist and my family really like it.  the only thing is, they did stick to the bottom of the dish a little, so next time I might use a little cooking spray before I put the chicken in the dish.

FABULOUS! This chicken is soooo yummy and juicy! My husband said it was some of the best chicken he's ever had. I added onion salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the eggs. Then I added paprika and a little bit of ground cayenne pepper to the crumb mixture. It gives it nice kick and wonderful flavor! This one is a keeper!

This was soooo good!  We made a few minor modifications though.  We used 2 chicken breasts (as opposed to 4), but kept the rest of the ingredients as is and we found that we had barely enough cracker crumbs to coat two breats.  We also did not use garlic salt as I'm not a fan - but instead we crushed two cloves of garlic into the egg mixture.  As well, we followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and we didn't put 1/2 cup of butter around the chicken, instead, we melted about 1/4 cup and drizzled it over the top of the chicken.  This made the cracker crumbs toasted and crunchy.  Very good dish - we will definitely make again.

I have been using recipes off this site for a couple years and have not been compelled to write a review until now. This is the only recipe where my young kids actually ask for more!! The only change I made was using real garlic (crushed) instead of garlic salt (and used regular salt).
Fabulous!

This chicken was quick and easy.  It tasted good and my family liked it, but I thought it needed something extra, just too buttery in my opinion.  Maybe some honey mustard sauce or some seasonings.

this recipe was very tasty!  i used ritz crackers & added a little garlic powder, 1 clove chopped garlic, a little paprika, salt & pepper, & a few shakes of grated romano cheese.  i also melted a couple of tablespoons of butter & drizzled it on top of each piece like some have suggested instead of putting the butter in the baking dish.  it came out crispy & delicious!  everyone liked it...even my hard to please nephew!  it was super easy to prepare!  i will make this again for sure!

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. He thought it was friend chicken! He had no idea it was crackers on top. It gives it such a lovely flavor and a great texture that contrasts with the chicken very well. I followed the recipe exactly but sometimes experiment with half a package of Onion soup mix or Ranch dip mix. I make this all the time. If there are any leftovers the next day I put them on a bun. Delicious!

I have to give this 5 stars because it really is so versatile! I didn't have enough crackers so I added about 1/3 of a cup of parmesan cheese and a little sprinkle of salad seasoning from McCormick to what crackers I did have, which was probably about 1/2 cup. Turned out Heavenly! I think when I do it again next week I will try to cut back on the butter! Every one loved it, my kids said it was like eating chicken nuggets. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great and has turned into my favorite. Instead of the Ritz crackers I use Chicken in a Biscuit crakers and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. This turns out so tender and juicy and full of flavor.  I made a big batch of the coating mixture and keep it on hand in pantry. I just scoop out what I need and it makes it such a fast dish to prepare.

I was looking for a quick to prepare, easy and tasty chicken breast recipe and have definitely found it!  My husband and mother-in-law raved about how good and tender the chicken was.  My almost 2 yr old had her share too!  I didn't have any Ritz crackers, but used Reduced Fat Town House crackers instead and it still came out great.  I also melted half of the butter, poured it over the chicken and cut up pieces of the remaining solid butter and put around the chicken.  I'm definitely going to put this in my rotation of dinner recipes!

This dish was okay.  It was definitely moist and juicy.  But the flavor was not mouth-watering.  I seasoned my chicken with garlic salt and pepper in addition to what the recipe called for.

My whole family LOVED this chicken.  We even got into an argument over the leftovers!  I did not have any garlic salt so I used garlic powder plus salt.  I had enough crumb mixture to do 5 chicken breasts, so I threw in the extra one.  Very, very good and flavorful.

Juicy, but not too much flavor; used half the butter and substituted pancko crumbs instead of crackers. Will add more flavoring next time.

This is our family's favorite Allrecipe.com recipe!  I make it at least once or twice a month.  It is incredibly easy and remarkably delicious.  We use a meat thermometer to ensure that the chicken turns out extra moist and delicious.  Outstanding!

I thought this was very good.  My sister came over for supper and took the recipe with her.  I ate it the next day, and it was still very good.

DELICIOUS!  A great basic recipe that can be altered to fit (sprinkled with paprika or Emeril's Essence or served with a dijon dipping sauce)  Thanks!

This was sooooo good.  I used Pappys seasoning with low fat saltines (no hydroginated oils).  I didnt use all the butter either and it went fast in our house!

Super awesome and sooo easy  For a twist...use Goldfish crackers instead.  Fun for kids to help with as well, they like crushing the crackers (in a heavy bag with a rolling pin or mallet!)

Absolutely terrific.  This is definitely a keeper.  However, since my husband and I are doing the "low-carb" thing, I used less crackers but mixed in macadamia nuts and parmesan cheese.  Yummy.

I make this when I need a last minute meal.  It's easy, tasty and you don't have the grease mess that you get with fried chicken.  I'm not sure where the butter goes so I place it under the chicken and spray the top with butter flavored cooking spray.

Awesome recipe!  I made it for a VERY picky houseguest and she just raved about it!  I cut the butter in half though, to cut down on fat.  A family favorite!

DH said it was the best chicken ever. Definitely a 5 star dish. I followed directions exactly except I added Emeril's southwest spice in addition to the garlic salt. Fabulous, quick and easy!

We enjoyed this prepared just as the recipe stated. Hubby suggested you could vary by spicing it up with , for example, Emeril's Bayou Blend. This was easy to prepare, and I will definately make again.

Good. Would probably have been a five star review if I had pounded the chicken to equal thickness (for even cooking), and if I'd added the total amount of butter suggested ... there I went trying to be healthy!!

This recipe is a favorite in my house!  We put the crackers and seasoning in the food processer to crush them up and mix them together.  After we have dipped the chicken in the egg and crackers we sprinkle more garlic salt on top.  Also, we only use half the butter.

Very easy recipe.  I decreased the butter to 1/4 cup as suggested and it worked out perfect. Instead of a whole chicken breast, I cut the breasts up in chunks so I could have more coating.  ***tip: place crackers in a brown lunch bag and pound - it makes a better, more consistent coating.

Chicken was moist, coating was crispy.  It was easy to prepare. I only used 1/2 of the butter and used an 8x8 pan.  I dredged the chicken in flour, then egg, then the crackers and had no trouble with the coating falling off.  I think the flavor might have been better if the seasoning was added to the flour or sprinkled right on the chicken before coating.  That's how I'll do it next time.  This one is a keeper :-)

I NEVER KNEW THAT SOMETHING SO EASY COULD BE SOOO GOOD! MY FAMILY AND I ARE PICKY EATERS, AND WE JUST LOVED IT. I LOVED THE FACT THAT THIS RECIPE WAS SO EASY TO MAKE AND PREPARE. THE CHICKEN CAME OUT REALLY JUICY AND TENDER...AND THE CRUST WAS CRISPY. I CANT BELIEVE THAT I EVER USED "SHAKE N BAKE" I ALSO LIKED THE FACT THAT I DIDNT HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY "EXTRA" INGREDIENTS, I WAS ABLE TO USE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS KEEP IN MY KITCHEN. I AM ALSO A MOTHER OF A TODDLER AND VERY BUSY, BUT THIS RECIPE DIDNT TAKE UP A LOT OF MY TIME. MY FAMILY REALLY LIKES CHICKEN AND I HAVE TRIED LOTS OF CHICKEN RECIPES BUT HAVE NOT BEEN TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH THEM. BUT THIS ONE WAS A REAL WINNER! I AM SENDING THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS. THANKS A LOT!

Not the healthiest chicken but it can be a good change from shake-n-bake.  I put all the crumbs garlic salt and pepper in a large zip lock bag the tossed the chicken in the bag.  I used Market Day Chickensteaks and baked them in a 8x8 baking dish.  I did not use all that butter.  I only used about 2 tablespoons and placed them around the chicken not on top, placing the butter on top tends to "wash" away the crumb coating.  I will make again next time I will add a little more spice to the cracker crumbs.

It's probably my own fault I'm giving this only 3 stars.  I didn't find this to be very flavorful.  I was waiting to bite in to really buttery chicken.  I had a coating with a hint of butter taste.  This is where my fault comes in.  I didn't use boneless skinless breasts.  I used bone-in leg quarters, figuring it was the coating that gave the chicken the butter flavor.  I will try it again with boneless skinless breasts next time and hope for tastier results.  Thanks for the recipe!

This didn't sound good to me, but my family wanted me to make it, and it turned out to be great!  I used low fat margarine, egg whites, and garlic powder in place of garlic salt, so it wasn't too unhealthy.  I also only needed 2 egg whites (the recipe calls for 2 whole eggs, meaning I should have needed 4 egg whites).  I will definitely make it again.

MMMMMM...very good!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used only 1/3 cup of butter and also added some romano cheese, italian seasoning, and garlic powders to the crumb mixture.  Very moist and flavorful! Thanks!

I was sceptical about this.  I have often been disappointed by highly rated recipes.  However, this chicken had an excellent flavor and was very moist.  I added extra seasonings (paprika, onion powder, etc.) to the cracker crumbs, skipped the egg (rinse your chicken breast with water to help hold the coating), and used less butter.  I served with some sauteed vegetables (onion, peppers, mushrooms, zucchini in a little olive oil...and a couple of large spoonfuls of my homemade salsa at the end), and crusty rolls.  Husband loved it.  He commented that in cooler weather it would be great with a side of alfredo pasta or mashed potatoes.  The bonus for me was that this was so easy.  I will keep this in mind for those times that I have a million things demanding my attention...I will burn off the calories, then.

This chicken was GREAT!! They were so moist and yet had a little crisp to them!  Whenever I cook chicken I always get a groan from my Husband.  But this time he asked for more!!  He loved it!!  Although I did use less butter and added some paprika for a little spice.  It was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!

Thanks Heather!! Hubby and little one loved this one! I did add a little spicy mustard, a shot of worcestershire, and a few shakes of garlic salt to the eggs. Only because a few of the reviews said it was a little bland. Will have to make for friends, we know this will be a hit!! Thanks again... Lisa

Picky husband liked it!  I thought it was pretty good, not a 5 star, although being pregnant could be hampering my taste buds.  My 7 and 4 yr old liked it to.  Will definately make again.  (I only did half the butter though).

Yummy!  I live with two other girl roommates, and I didn't think they would eat it... well let's just say that was no leftovers!  They loved it, this recipe definately made me look like a good cook!  Next time I'm going to add alittle bit more spice too it.  I did turn the chicken halfway through like others did, I don't know if it made a difference.  Other then that, I served it with rice and it was delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.  THANKS!

great! easy! quick at 30-35 min! Not bland but not highly flavorful...you can easily add some pizzazz. I added fresh sage, some Italian seasoning. Served with fresh green beans and twice baked potatoes. Hubby loves it. Thank you!

This was okay. Quick and easy to prepare.  Something I might make again if I'm in a pinch for some type of batter or chicken coating.

Very good!  After reading other reviews I was afraid it would be too bland so I served it with Sweet and Sour Sauce from this site.  It was a nice (and needed) addition.  I cut the amount of butter in half and the butter flavor was still great.  My chicken didn't come out soggy at all.

This chicken was good, but after the rave reviews it got, I guess I was expecting more.  I added so much spice to the cracker crumbs, and it STILL needed more.  Be generous, it will only help.  The butter flavor was good, though.  To make things easier, I threw the crumbs and seasonings into a ziploc and after egging the chicken, shook it up in there - worked well.  I also put alittle tin foil on the bottom of the dish which helped considerably with the clean up.  The cooking time definately needs to be less than 40 minutes - I cooked mine for 25 and they were perfect and juicy.  Served with the Honey Mustard Sauce from this site.  Will try again for sure, however I will add much more seasoning!

Truly fantastic dish! I added more cracker crumbs and some flour for a thicker breading. I also used quite a bit more garlic than the recipe called for and added some poultry seasoning to the mix. I almost couldn't wait for this dish to cool enough for me to eat because it smelled so wonderful! This will definately be made again!

**Updated Review 7/10/04:  A year ago, I couldn't quite enjoy it without the butter on it.  But since then, my family decided that putting butter on the chicken to cookjust made it too greasy!  We use Chicken Drumsticks and cut out the butter.  If I could change my rating to 6 or more stars after that, I would!

**Original Review:  Absolutely delicious!  I tried to cut down on the butter once, but it just wasn't the same...

I  knew it would be bland with the few spices listed so I added 1 tsp. italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp.pepper. Also added salt and pepper to beaten eggs. I slightly pounded my chicken to about 1/2 inch thick.I used all the crumb mixture. Checked baking progress every 15 min. After 30 min. crust wasn't brown so left in 5 min more. The flavor was good from seasonings but we weren't that impressed with the overall outcome. Son said it was o.k.and daughter said it was good but not great. I am a perfectionist when I cook and it is my passion and I just wasn't overly thrilled with this.I think boneless chicken breast is tricky to bake. You want to make sure it's cooked through,but you don't want to over cook because it becomes dry very easily. I may try to make again,only I would try frying it instead. Thanks Heather for sharing!

This is a wonderful dinner recipe!  We absolutely loved it.  The chicken turned out so moist and it was so easy to prepare.  There was excess butter, so maybe next time I will reduce it a little bit.  I HIGHLY recommend this!  Thanks Heather for sharing.

Wonderful even for someone who "can't" cook.  I have made this twice since I found it.  I cut 4 chicken breasts in half lengthwise and bake them 20-25 minutes with the crumbs to perfection.  Thanks Heather!

I was really disapointed in this recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added a little garlic powder to spice it up, but it was still a little bland.  It was incredibly greasy because of all the butter.  The bottom of the chicken pieces were greasy and the tops was dry.  If you want it to be uniformly greasy, then I suggest turning the pieces.  Maybe it would have been better had I used half as much butter as the recipe called for.

This was SUPER chicken and such a great change. Very moist! We added Cavender's greek seasoning and parsley just for more flavor but it seems like you could add anything you want to this dish and it would still be great. It is EXCELLENT - even my kids said so!

I'm really unsure of all the 5 star ratings, and why it is "famous" But, even so, it was decent- especially in a crunch. I think I'd skip this recipe though...

I was looking forward to this dish because it got such high ratings but I was disappointed with the outcome. I found it to be very very plain.(Shake and Bake is better than this!) If I was going to make this a second time, I would add more spices and less butter.

This recipe is delicious, and so easy to make! I cut my chicken breast into tenders, to make cooking and baking a little bit faster.  For a dipping sauce, I use the honey mustard dressing that is listed with the Aussie Chicken recipe on this site, minus the onion flakes.

It was good, but not as mouth-watering as everyone else made it sound.  I think next time I'll leave out the garlic salt and try using cajun or italian seasoning instead.

this recipe would have produced a moister chicken breast.

Excellent recipe.  Highly recommended to all.  I did add the non stick cooking spray to the bottom of the dish before I put everything in so that the butter would not burn.  My fiance' absolutely loved this recipe.  Will make it again and again!

I made this last night for my husband and he said it was "ok." We both agreed though that the chicken was very tender and moist. I also added more seasonings to the cracker crumb mixture like seasoned salt and Tony Chachere's and it had good flavor-- it was just nothing extraordinary. I'm sure to make this another night though because it's so easy and it uses ingredients I always have-- so thank you for the recipe!

This was fairly easy to prepare and smelled great while cooking. I added a little extra garlic powder to the mixture and more pepper but it still could have used a little extra Umpf. The chicken breast were also a little on the dry side. If I make this again I might butterfly it first and then cook it. Overall it was okay.

This was a very easy and good recipe. I would add a little something to it. Not sure but it needs a little kick. I also added a little olive oil to  the pan so my butter would not burn.

This chicken was so moist and it definitely goes best with the honey mustard sauce on this website by Nanci Renn. I will definitley make this again. For the butter crackers I used Keebler Club Cracker and it was delicious!

WOW! Can you say good chicken?! It was great on it's own, but the "honey mustard sauce"(also found on all recipes)took the chicken to a whole other level. The flavors balanced each other out very nicely. Definitely something my husband and I will be making again.

This recipie was very quick and easy.  I enjoyed it as did my 2 year old, but my 4 year old wouldn't touch it (he doesn't eat much but ziti) and my 14 year old seemed to like it.  The only thing I would do differently is to add the amount of butter it called for.  I used "I can't believe it's not butter light" which worked fine because we personally like it, but I reduced the amount of butter by half and although it was still moist, I think I would have liked it much more with the full amount.  Also, it does need to be seasoned a little more than the recipie calls for.  I added some garlic powder and season salt and it was pretty good. All in all, I would definitely make it again.

My Grandfather is 85 years old and cannot chew very well or eat food that is not very moist.  This recipe did the trick for him AND my 3 year old food critic.  Amazing!

I found it average.  Soft, but I expected more, given the ingredients.  I would probably do it again, but not soon.

This was okay, made the chicken tender but taste was overall the same as garlic chicken tastes. If I made it again, I would definately cut the butter in half.

Very yummy chicken! Although next time I think I will season the chicken a little. The cracker crumbs didn't have enough flavor for me. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was easy to make and delicious too.
I used boneless chicken tenderloins and it made the recipe easier and also quicker to cook. These have a wonderful flavor.  I also added a little bit of parmesian cheese to the cracker mixture.
Thanks for the recipe!!!

This chicken was great...I always add extra spices like Season All, paprika, and an extra pinch of garlic powder..I used the store brand "Ritz" cracker and it was great.. I would like to experiment and maybe try the Chicken in a Bisket crackers next time..I also didnt use all the butter it really didnt need it and only used 1 egg for 4 chicken breasts.. Cant wait to try it again..

I couldn't believe how moist this chicken turned out -- it was fabulous.  Kids (and me, too!) would love this recipe made with chicken tenders, and dipping in the honey mustard sauce made in the "Aussie Chicken" recipe on this site.  You'll never go back to jarred honey mustard again! Yum!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so easy to fix!  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts, which I thought enhanced the flavor of the breading.  I also used a tad less butter than was called for and am glad I did.  We will definitely fix this again!

Very good dish.  Followed the previous advice and melted butter first.  I over-cooked it slightly the first time so I cooked it less 5 minutes or so the next time and it came out much more tender!

I needed something easy to make one Sunday so I decided to try the butter chicken.  It was really easy and it smelled delicious in the oven.  Needless to say, it was a big hit!  My husband and my kids loved it!  We WILL make it again!

I didnt think I would like this recipe because Im not a very big fan of chicken, but to my surprise I really liked it alot.  I baked it at 350 for 30 min. and the last 10 min. at 400 to give it more of a crispness.  Definately recommend!

The chicken was really moist to my surprise b/c my chicken normally turns out a little tough.  It does need a little more seasoning in the crumbs.  Overall it was really good!!

We thought it was kinda bland.  I only used half the butter, added seasoned salt, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers.  If there's a next time, I will have to add more spices.

Was a bit dry the first time I made this. I doubled the butter the following time. It was better, but still not good enough. Will triple the butter next time. Served with fettuccine alfredo, salad with hot bacon dressing, bread with garlic butter, and a chocolate mousse cheesecake for dessert. Nutritious, and delicious. Snap, Crackle, POP!

This is a really, really tasty alternative for chicken breast.  We kicked it up a notch with the garlic tho, and like everyone else, cut down a bit on the butter.  Overall, it was excellent!  I just wish the little cracker covering was a bit more crispy.  We'll definatly be making this again!

I scaled this recipe for a serving of 8.  I only used half the butter and cooked it at 350 instead of 375.  They were WONDERFUL!  Very moist and very tasty.  I definetly will be making this recipe a lot!

The first time I made this it was a little too buttery.  I tried it again using less butter and now this is my husband's favorite recipe.  If it were up to him we would be eating "Famous Butter Chicken" 7 nights a week!!

Excellent dish!  I crush the Ritz crackers with my "handy Chopper" and add the garlic powder and pepper afterward (makes it even quicker to make!).  I only use about a tbsp of margarine (vs. butter) as everyone else has and do put a small pat on each chicken breast.  Very moist, very tender.  I use a similar recipe I found on-line here for pork chops...  This is one of the new ways we now eat chicken!

This is a great recipe!  My 5 year old daughter loved helping me make this chicken.  We put the crushed crackers in a large ziploc bag and added spiced to that.  It was just like making shake and bake.  I also put my butter on top of the chicken as well as around it.  I added basil and Seasoned Pepper to the crackers.  I think you could use egg whites instead of the whole eggs to make it a little less fattening. I used regular eggs but substitued low fat margarine for the butter and it tasted great.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used cheddar crackers and I added cajun seasoning to the craker mixture and omited salt and pepper. I also reduced the butter by half and it was still more than enough. Delicious!!

My family really loved this recipe, even my extremely critical boyfriend. I melted the butter and poured it over the chicken and it was very juicy. Next time I won't do that because it made the breading soggier than I'd have liked. I said 'next time' because I plan on making this again and again.

The first time I made this, I used Cheese Nips crackers. The 2nd time, I used the crackers recommended. My family all agreed that the extra zing of the cheese nips made it even better. I also cut the butter in half and used a little top grade olive oil (couple tablespoons). It's great!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it 4 or 5 times and it turns out great everytime. My husbond loves it and always asks me to make it again. This is perfect for picky eaters like myself. Kids will love this chicken. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This recipe worked very well! I read all of the reviews first and followed a lot of that advice -- halfed the butter, drizzled it on top of the chicken, and added some more spice to the crumbs (cayenne and Cajun mix).  I also used skinless, bone-in chicken thighs, since my husband loves meat on the bone, and it was delicious!

We loved this recipe!!  Very moist!  I did add parmesean cheese, and garlic powder to the cracker crumbs like others had suggested.  I also melted the butter and drizzeled it over the top, and was very glad that I did.  This chicken dish was full of flavor, and did not disappoint!  Thanks ~ Scarlett

Hmm...well I don't think I could have done anything wrong with such an easy recipe, but I wasn't that impressed with this. While the chicken did come out very tender, it had no flavor and the whole dish was so greasy we felt yucky after eating it. Definitely wasn't worth the fat grams in my opinion! Sorry!

I can't believe how moist and tender the chicken was.  I also drizzled the butter over the breasts, and added more spices.  My girlfriend loved them, and has begged me to make them again and again. And they were so easy to make, I will!

This is a really wonderful recipe.  Normally my husband and I feel that you need to pound a chicken breast to get a tender peice of meat.  This definetly proved that theroy wrong.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.  I don't see any reason to change a thing.

I personally did not really enjoy this recipe - even though it was easy and fast to make I found out later that the clean up was long!!!  Taste wise, I did not get anything out of it.  Chicken indeed was very moist but all most tasteless.  My family thought it was just okay. I will not be using this recipe again.  I am sure that if you add several spices to the crumbs that it would taste better.  Sorry!

My husband loved this. I did alot of the extras that everyone recommended, a little Italian Bread Crumbs, a little Parmesan Cheese and a little Garlic Powder added and I cut the butter in half. This was so good. I highly recommend it to anyone who usually does Shake-N-Bake. Great recipe Heather. Thank you. Lisa

This recipe was  very good and VERY VERY easy!!  It was a little bland for my taste, even tho I used extra garlic salt and pepper in the breading AND sprinkled some garlic salt on top after breading the chicken.  Next time I will add some cayenne pepper and/or lemon.  But it really was good, and I would suggest making it as the recipe calls for the first time, blandness can easily be fixed after cooking by adding more spice!  Kids would probably LOVE this just as is.

I placed the butter cubs around the chicken and it some how came out with less buttery flavor. Next time I'm gonna sprinkle the butter on top of the chicken and see what happens. It's still good though!

Yum Yum Yum!! This was fantastic and so easy. My kids all really enjoyed it and my husband thought it was the juicest most tender chicken he has ever had. I also cut down the amount of butter. Fat or no fat, this will be made again and again in my house!

I made this because of the great reviews, but I just can't agree with them. It was tender, but rather bland. I might try it again (with a cracker like 'Onion Thins' & some cayenne), because it was very quick & easy!

This was a great recipe. It was easy to make and the end results were fantastic. I also added less butter, about 4 tablespoons. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted really great. We cut the leftovers up into pieces the next day to have as a snack, and we wished there was more.  I'm not sure which way was better.

turned out great. I was looking for something easy and new.
I did add a few more seasonings only because I love allot of seasonings.

I followed the recipe. I found it to be oily and salty. My husband thought it was bland. My child ate only one bite. I had high hopes, but wish I had just grilled the chicken instead.

It was tender and juicy. Simple to make but next time I will add more spices as it was missing something.
I will make again.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!! I didn't have any Ritz, so I used Club Crackers that were actually multi-grain. Gave it a kind of earthy taste that paired really well with the butter. I will add this to my list of easy-make dinners in the future! Thank you!

My son yelled “we just had chicken last night” as I was preparing it. He dislikes most everything. He is now eating it without a single complaint. We all love it. We generally don’t do carbs but this is excellent and there are ways to make it healthier. I served it with asparagus. 
1. I used Trader Joe’s round butter crackers. The ingredients are a bit healthier than standard butter rounds like Ritz. 
2. I melted a small amount of butter and added salt, garlic, and a few other basic spices to it. I rubbed it over the chicken BEFORE coating it in egg.
3. For baking I used a bit less than 1/4 c of butter. I cut it in very small pieces and dotted it around the chicken (I used 2 very large/thick chicken breasts).
4. I baked at 375 for 45 min. If you are using smaller pieces of chicken then 35-40 should be plenty.  I cooked them in a square glass pan.

The whole family loved this one and asked to add it to the rotation.  I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup to make this a bit healthier and followed the rest of the directions as written.

I didn't have much hope going into this due to me loving spicy foods, so I added cayenne pepper and paprika into the cracker blend. I also added cut up red potatoes and spread it around with the butter. It all ended up great! My slices of chicken were a bit bigger so I kept the time at 40 mins but overall really good! So much better than corn flakes!

I don’t eat meat made it for everyone else in the family. I did only put half of the butter and cooked it on 375° for 25 minutes, so it wouldn’t be dry. I flipped the pieces 12 minutes in and put it back in the oven for the remaining 13 minutes. Perfect

Everyone loved it. Added 1 tsp of parmesan cheese to the mixture and used 1/4 cup of butter instead. Only baked for 30 minutes. Will make again.

After reading reviews and being on a Keto diet, I used 2/3 stick of butter and I blended pork rinds with spices I like (Creole seasoning). Cooked it for a half hour. Delicious!

I used thinner breasts - I actually cut them in such a way that they were more like thick cutlets.  I also cut down on the butter, since they were thinner.  This also cut the baking time down by nearly half (I was checking the temperature of the chicken).  Despite my changes, these still tasted amazing!!  I made them for a friend that can't cook for himself and wants to eat a bit healthier and he raved about them.  I also set some aside for my kids, and they loved them as well!

I didn't have garlic salt, but I subbed garlic + salt.  I served it with some yellow rice and steamed broccoli.  It was such a simple, delicious meal that my partner was actually a bit irrationally upset that I hadn't cooked this before now.

Great chicken! The only thing I did different was I used Garlic Butter Ritz crackers, with seasoned bread crumbs and after putting the butter on top of the chicken, I drizzled some honey on top. WOW! I did this recipe with chicken thighs and they were very moist and tasty. Tops were nice and brown. Will make again.

I'd make this again. I read peoples' reviews and thought I would add a bit of cheese to the crumbs and maybe some garlic powder. I  made 2 chicken breasts and they were quite thin so  in half an hour  they were ready.  I would try to cut down on the butter more next time. The coating was delicious (who doesn't love REAL butter and crumbs) but a little greasy. It was also still a bit bland. Next time maybe a bit of paprika would liven it up.

Delicious!  Make it for company often, using just one jumbo egg for 20 tenderloin chicken pieces, it was enough.  I don't measure the butter, just eyeball how much looks right.

The chicken was moist but bland in flavor. I loved the method of cooking the chicken but will definitely change the outside coating to lightly crushed cornflakes and increase the seasoning. The method of making is easy and I will be using that again.

This would be a good choice for children. It is very mild and the butter cracker flavor comes through well so kids would like it. For me, it was kind of bland and the bottom was soggy. The leftovers were pretty good.

My kids just love this go to meal. I also make it for friends/ family when there is a call out for a meal donation. I put it all together and that’s all they have to do is bake it. It always gets  great  reviews.

It was good, but not especially moist as most of the butter just remains behind in the pan.

I don’t understand why all these people review recipes after making changes to 50% of the recipe. Regardless, I followed the recipe and could not believe how simple delicious it was. The kids all loved it.

This was very delicious! I was cooking for a young child who was very picky, so it was nice to not be to spicy. I would definitely make this again and again!
I've made it twice so far, and the first time I used the suggested amount of butter which was way to much. So the next time, I used a bit less and it was perfect! I would recommend this to everyone I know!

Made exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out great! My husband took a bite and looked at me and said "Wow! Man that is good chicken". He repeated that several times so needless to say this recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

Hands down one of my favorite recipes.  For the crackers I like to use Ritz low-salt or no-salt crackers and add a tablespoon more of garlic salt to offset it.  In addition, I add about 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese to the crackers for additional flavor.  Finally, about 10 to 15 minutes before I'm done cooking, I use a baster to suck up the melted butter in the pan and drizzle it all over the chicken for extra buttery taste and to keep it moist.  It tastes excellent, even as a leftover.

I have to agree with the 3 star reviews.  I followed the recipe and added the enhancements recommended in the reviews.  Chicken outside was not crispy.  Coating fell off easily.  Not a lot of flavor. Would not make again.

When this recipe is followed closely, it will come out super tender and moist. You should also be able to cut it with a fork.

Made it per recipe but scaled down the butter a little. It was ok, had a nice golden crust which I love on chicken and looked beautiful so I was very excited, thought I found a regular weekly dinner to add to the loop. But I  was overwhelmed by the buttery-ness and the ritz crackers. Just too much in my opinion.

Definitely will add this into the rotation, it's super easy, does not dirty many dishes, and pretty good. 

I made changes after reading previous reviews, and also I was only making this for myself and my 3 year old, so I adjusted the ingredients for 2 people - 
Added a touch of flour to the crumb mixture to help it stick. I used a sleeve of Ritz crackers, maybe 1/8 cup of flour (I was eyeballing it, sorry for the inexact measurement), and shook some garlic powder, onion powder and grated parmesan cheese into there as well, then mixed it all up shake and bake style in a ziplock. I also used chicken breast tenderloins (basically chicken strips / fingers) because that's what i keep in the freezer instead of breasts (they thaw and cook faster, and is a more proportionate size  for a toddler).  After dipping in the egg, I dropped the strips into the ziplock and shook them around and smashed the crumbs into chicken. I did end up using less than the amount of butter I was instructed to, and I also put some garlic cloves cut in half in there with the butter. I cooked in a 9x9 dish and the pieces were ready in 20 minutes. 

Once all done the chicken didn't end up looking like KFC as another reviewer said, but it was very tender, not dry, and flavorful. We had it with a side of collard greens. My son ate his whole portion of chicken, which is amazing.

Good every single time! The only downside of this dish is that you should definitely try to avoid having this for leftovers after a day. Very very very easy to cut through and its just filled with flavor.

The chicken turned out tender and juicy, and the coating fairly crispy.  I added seasoned salt and garlic to the cracker crumbs.  Because I used bone-in breasts, I increased the bake time to 50 minutes.

Love this recipe, it's easy and delicious. Tonight I was out of eggs but had a little buttermilk in the fridge, used it to first dip the chicken. Turned out even better. Will definitely make it again.

I took other people's suggestions and added various spices, such as paprika, seasoned salt, onion powder, and some chicken seasoning.  The chicken turned out delicious and so simple.

The crumbs can me out feeling very wet, I even tried to do a bit of a broil to get them to dry a bit. I put them in for 30 mins and they came out cooked and tender. It really wasn’t a big deal, would have rather made a classic parm.

I've been making these since I saw this recipe on this site a couple years ago. Only substitution was using "Chicken in a Bisket" crackers. They add a little bit of flavor over plain crackers.

TBD. Trying this: 

"try again with these instructions I learned from past reviewers. Use 1/3 cup butter, cook for only about 25 mins (do not let over cook, 40 mins too long), spoon juices all over the chicken 2 times while cooking. Perfect every time!"

This has been a staple for my very picky family of eaters for the past couple years now.  It was a little too bland for them the first time, but they liked the crunch of the crackers and how moist the butter made it.  So now before I bread it, I season the chicken with Old Bay or some other all seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, papricka, salt and pepper and I also add a little more seasoning to the cracker mix.  My husband is the pickiest eater and this is one of his favorites now.

This recipe was a pretty good guide, but I would recommend adding much more garlic powder to your crushed crackers, as well as a similar amount of onion powder and three good shakes of italian seasoning.  Also, butter can be placed on the chicken instead of just around it, but I use only half of what the recipe calls for.  Lastly, begin checking to see if your chicken is done around 20-25 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillets, as this is easy to overcook (I once overcooked this after only 30 minutes) which results in dry chicken.

This was very Good! The only thing I did different was egg and batter twice instead of just the once to make sure the breading was on good. It was so moist and delicious my boys and husband kept complimenting on how good dinner was! Thanks for the recipe share, will definitely become one of our staples!!!!!

Cooking time is to long.  30 min is about right and check at the 25 min mark.  I placed a sliver of garlic in each butter pat.  You can't hurt this recipe with additional garlic, only makes it more tasty.

I added more seasoning and used a ziplock bag to coat the chicken. This will now be one of our families go to chicken recipes. The chicken comes out so moist, no knife needed.

Love the simplicity of this recipe and have made it at least 5 times since I came across it. It lends itself to a variety of sauces or gravies and is great re-heated the next day. We love the contrast of the crunchy coating and the tender, juicy chicken inside. This recipe has made it onto my "heavy rotation" list!

I took advice of reviewers and did 2 T butter at 25 min (165 degrees chicken temp). Perfect and so easy! I’d like to sub a mayo/Dijon spread instead of dredging next time

I just made this for dinner tonight.  I crushed the crackers (I used Town House Butter crackers - one sleeve) in a large ziplock with a good dash of Italian Seasoning, a good dash of grated Parmesan cheese, and a good dash of garlic powder California seasoning blend.  After dipping the chicken in the beaten eggs I tossed them in the ziplock like shake and bake.  I did follow the guidance of others and used 1/2 the amount of butter which was plenty and I baked only for 30 minutes...the last 2 under broil to brown the tops a bit.  I was amazed at how juicy the chicken came out!  I had to double check that it was actually done because other baked chicken recipes I’ve made cake out so dry.   I made this with red potatoes cut into fry pieces mixed with melted butter, salt and garlic, baked for 40 minutes on the rack under the chicken which I put in 10 minutes after the potatoes.  This chicken even impressed my teenaged son who is pretty picky.  He even ate the leftover piece.  BIG hit and now a go-to chicken recipe I will make often.

This is an easy week night recipe that got high marks at our  house.  Like other reviewers, I cut back the amount of butter to 1/2 stick and added seasoning to our tastes to the cracker crumbs. I added Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese, and a little flour to the cracker mixture.  I also pounded the chicken breasts to a thinner more even thickness before breading them.  Flipped the breasts a couple of times during cooking so that they were uniformly crispy. Otherwise they would've been mushy on the bottom

Instead of garlic salt .. I used garlic powder, I added a tablespoon of Lemon Pepper, 2 teaspoons of Lemon Zest and a ranch dressing packet to the crushed buttery cracker coating for that zing.. i seasoned the eggs witj a pinch of pepper and a pinch of seasoned salt. Chicken can be  very boring if it isn't seasoned properly.. if you don't like the ranch flavor .. the dry Italian season packet. This is one of my daughters favorite dishes .. mine, too!

As was recommended, I added garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper & Italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs. I then added a little white wine and garlic to the pan with the chicken.  The chicken was very moist and tender with good flavor. This was a pretty simple recipe for a weeknight. I will be adding it to our rotation.

I changed it up just a little bit, added onion powder and a little flour to the cracker crumb mix (and used club crackers. Used a little less butter and only cooked 30 min. Yuuuuuuuuum. This is definitely going into rotation!

This is really good. At first I thought it was going to need a sauce because chicken is usually so dry. But it came out moist and juicy even though it’s covered in crackers. My family really liked it and we will be making it again.

Ahhhmazing!! Of course, we all make changes.  There is no room for chicken breast in my house. I used dark meat, I like to play dirty. Boneless chicken thighs, gorgonzola parmesan crackers, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, half Irish butter + half coconut oil. 30 minutes at 375F. Perfecto. Contrary to what a previous review said that this recipe would not work well with dark meat, it came out juicy, succulent and everything good. I omitted salt because the gorgonzola and Irish butter had enough salt in them. And of course, substituted half of the required butter with coconut oil for a healthier version. I made 6 chicken thighs, husband ate 3 and packed 2 for lunch the next day. I got away with 1. Phheew!

I love this recipe!  This is the first review I have EVER done so that is how much I really like this dish.  I followed the recipe as directed other than using a 1/2 stick of butter not 1/2 cup. I also adjust the cooking time depending on the size of the chicken pieces.  40 minutes is just too long.   As far as the chicken is concerned, I've used chicken tenders, tenderloins, and breasts. If I use breasts, I usually cut them a little smaller and tenderize with a mallet before coating with egg and cracker crumbs.  You can cut them with a fork when they are finished.  So yummy!  My family, even my husband, who prefers dark meat, loves this recipe.  I will definitely continue to make it!

OMG - loved this simple recipe. Did pound chicken breasts using rolling pin, coated with flour, dredged in egg mixture, and seasoned cracker crumbles with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Cooked approx. 35 minutes.

Chicken was buttery and juicy and delicious and yummy! I would suggest eating it at the first sitting so that the cracker crust does not soften after refrigeration.  Adding the Ritz crackers really made a great crust!

Sorry, I really wanted to l like this because buttery crackers are so yummy, but it truly didn't have any flavor. 

Edited to add a star because it was very juicy chicken, was done in 30 minutes, and tasted better when it cooled.

I made this easy recipe tonight and I loved it! My son is absolutely the pickiest person to cook for and he really liked it so that says a lot! The only thing I did differently was I reduced the amount of garlic salt because my son isn't a big fan of garlic. It was great, and I'm sure it would be great with the amount of garlic salt called for. It was so very easy I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I always seem to have a different cooking experience. We just got new appliances that we've been cooking with for approximately two months so they're broke in. I cooked for brass according to the recipe for 25 minutes and the internal temperature was 130°. I added an additional 10 minutes and all but one reached 165°. I would say a proper good time would be between 30 to 35 minutes unless you're just trying to build up your immune system. Otherwise the finished product was delicious and juicy.

The recipe itself was a nice base for me to edit and change up a bit. I used saltines crackers instead. I put the saltines in a plastic ziplock bag, and added seasonings (garlic salt, onion, powder, seasoning salt, and red pepper flakes). I then added minched garlic to the egg. I soaked the chicken in the egg and then tossed in the ziplock bag to the chicken coated. I noticed the crackers were falling off and not sticking well. After shaking on the crackers, I repurchase each breast back into the egg mixture and coated a second time with crackers. I put them in a smaller pan, and used 1/2 the butter. They turned out great.

This was absolutely delicious and my husband and daughter asked for seconds (which is a victory in my picky household!). I have to say, however,  that I did follow the advice of fellow reviewers. I added Italian Seasoning and Parmesan cheese to the crumbs and I also lightly seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic salt as well (but only lightly as it can get overwhelming or salty). I served it with mashed potatoes and vegetables and it was a hit. Will definitely make again.

Nice recipe! I took several reviewers' advice and dropped the temp to 350°F and cook time for my pounded flat chicken(25 minutes, plus 5 more on broil). Then only other slight changes were tabasco sauce in the eggs(my preference) and I used Club crackers, rather than Ritz round crackers. Liked the chicken! My only concern was that my cracker breading was still a tad pale. I'm wondering if some melted butter in the crumbs would help with more even browning. Will be making again!

My husband loves this, and asks for it often - so I've made it a lot of times. I usually add an entire stick of butter. Great recipe!

I gave it 3 stars and hubby gave it 5 so we'll meet in the middle at 4.  It was just "meh"... very bland.  I fixed this exactly as the recipe said to.  Made no changes.  The chicken was moist, but there just wasn't much flavor other than the butter.  I noticed that a lot of reviewers said there was too much butter, but I used what was called for and there was very little left in the pan that the breading hadn't soaked up.  The breasts I used were very large so I cooked them for about 35 minutes and they were perfectly cooked.  My husband wants me to make this again, and I will oblige him but next time I'm going to add some additional spices and maybe go with half butter and half evoo.  I served our dish with rice and asparagus.

It was pretty good! Mine turned out to be soggy unfortunately, however I think it was probably on my end as I added a few extra ingredients. I made an extra breast so I added a bit more garlic salt and pepper, and I also added a fourth to half a teaspoon of paprika, poultry seasoning, and onion powder. My egg wash was also modified by two tablespoons of buttermilk and about a tablespoon of ranch, which probably contributed to the sogginess. I also skipped on the butter, because my brother did not want any (and hey, it's healthier, so why not). 
My mom and brother liked it though! My brother seared it in a pan for a tiny bit to get rid of that soggy flavor and my mom was impressed with me (I'm 14 and I'm just learning to cook, lol) and yeah, it was a nice dinner served with applesauce and egg noodles. Thanks Heather!

Very easy to make and tasty, with a nice crunch. I made this as the recipe instructed, but I could see other seasonings being added to the breading mix for added flavor. Makes enough for a family dinner, or plenty for leftovers if you're just cooking for yourself!

Love this recipe!
I've made it twice over the past couple of weeks.  The only changes I made was to add 1/4 tsp each of onion powder and dried Italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs and it amped up the flavor very nicely.  I also didn't measure the butter when adding it to baking dish....i just cut up some pieces and "eyeballed" it.  Regardless, the resulting chicken was juicy, flavorful and overall delicious.  
Thanks for sharing your recipe:)

this is the best chicken recipe I have came across yet, my fam really luved it..The only thing I changed up was adding a little more butter & putting butter on the top to keep the rite crackers from drying out, but that was only cause my chicken breast where big & took longer to cook..Luv it..

Really liked this. Added a Tbsp hot sauce to the eggs and some garlic as well. I also pounded the breasts thin and decreased cooking time. Flipped them over half way through. Served with potatoes and gravy on the side. Will definitely make this again!

This was such an easy and quick recipe.  I added some parsley, Parmesan cheese and old bay to my cracker mixture.  Also, don't need so much butter.  The chicken was very tender and moist.  Really good.

I added shredded cheese after dipping the chicken in the eggs and before the Ritz crumbs, but next time I'll make it stuffed with cheese so that there are more cracker crumbs on the chicken. I'll reduce the butter from one stick to 1/2-3/4 a stick. I had it covered with foil and it turned out amazing. I also added more seasonings to the Ritz than just what was suggested. Super yummy. I foresee this being just about? the only way I'll make chicken. Hubby and his friend were thoroughly impressed.

I love the ease of this delicious recipe! The only change this recipe needs is that it has too much butter. This can be remedied by using 1/4 to 1/3 stick of butter instead of 1/2 stick.

I made this fro supper tonight and it was well received.  I did add a few things to the cracker crumbs though (Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper).  The chicken was very tender and moist.  Will definitely make it again.

This is the best tasting moist chicken. I make it at least two or three times a month. It is good just the way it is or served with side sauce... BBQ, Ranch or my husbands favorite Pineapple Habenero.  So fast and simple. One pan dish. I use my mini ninja cup to crush the crackers, dump them out and whip the egg real good. That's just how easy this is! Thanks for sharing.

Bland, soggy, just not great.  I followed the suggestions and reduced the butter to just 1/2 stick and I still ended up with soggy chicken at the end of this.  Even with adding additional spices to the batter and the chicken, it was still very bland and just didnt do it for us honestly.  I will say that the breading combination would probably make some phenomenal fried chicken, but as far as baked goes, it was a flop.

My family loved this chicken! I made a few simple adjustments just based off what I had. First, I lightly floured the chicken prior to dipping. I also whisked one egg and some mayo (only had one egg) and I also added a little bit of salt and parmigiana cheese to the cracker mix. I think next time I may cut the butter amount in half because of the excess at the end product.

I made this twice.  The first time without the added butter and the second time with the  butter on top.  It was great both times, but my kids preferred the version without butter!  Really tasty, definitely making this again SOON!

Agree with less butter and less time in the oven. ½ stick (not cup) and 30 min (not 40). Came out great!

I am in love with this chicken. I made one change. I used garden flavor crackers instead of plain ones. I have made them several times and even brought them to Work where they were a bit.

I made this just as instructed and loved it! I did take the advice of another to spoon butter over the chicken a couple of times while cooking. Perfect! The whole family loved it and I will be making it again! Thanks for great recipe!

The egg mixture will not stay on moist chicken pieces, so I dredged the chicken in flour before dipping in crumbs.

Great recipe

This was good!  I used Onion Toasteds in place of the Ritz crackers and don't like garlic so I used a little celery salt in place of garlic salt, but the butter is the magic and this  just couldn't be easier.  Also checked for doneness at 30 minutes, and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  This recipe would be so easy to tweak to your own taste preferences and what you have on hand.  No leftovers -- will definitely make this again!

This was easy & delicious. I used Garden Vegetable flavored Ritz crackers, and added herbs & garlic salt. Like other reviewers I cut butter back to 1/2 stick. I also cut cooking time down to 30 min, flipping at 15min. I turned  off the oven at 30min but let it sit in the warm

I made this following the recipe exactly. The chicken was wonderfully tender and juicy, but so bland and flavorless that I have no plans to make it again.

I thought this very bland, and mine came out a little dry, even with all that butter.  I doubt I'll make this again, unless I spice it up prior to coating with the crumbs.

Found the chicken breading was gummy and greasy.   I guess I expected it to be crisp.   Looked good though.
Won't make it again.

I make this every other week because my 8-year-old and 42-year-old love it, as do I. My 42-year-old also makes it from time to time, because he can do it without fear of messing it up! I always use chicken breast tenderloins so that the 8-year-old equates it with chicken strips, and I increase the amount of Ritz crackers and eggs to accommodate the extra chicken. I use the amount of butter and seasonings specified and have never had a problem. After all, I'm not making this dish for a 5-star restaurant type of audience. My patrons put ketchup all over it so it doesn't matter what I season it with. Also, I bake this at 400 degrees for 20ish minutes. Honestly, I set it for the wrong temp and time the first time I made it because I didn't have the recipe in front of me, but it turned out great. I just keep doing it that way! Always moist and yummy.

The only thing I changed what the bake time from 40 to 30 minutes due to tender lean chicken breasts, and they came out perfect!  Fantastically delicious recipe, especially for being so easy!

Best chicken I've ever made. I added 1/4 cup of flour to the cracker crumb mix that another review suggested. I stuck with the original amount of butter as the recipe says and I didn't think it was too much. It was succulent.  I'm going to make this again and again.

I loved this! I did season my chicken to keep it from being too bland. I also followed other posters recommendations of basting 2 times with the melted butter and cutting the cooking time to 30 min. Will definitely make again!

this recipe is good but not the best. i breaded the chicken then browned it each side 3 minutes over medium heat stove top with 4tbsp oil and then baked 30 mins as directed uncovered  but turning at 15 minutes. how i made it makes it not soggy! dont forget to grease your baking pan or you will end up losing all of your breading!

I just absolutely love this dish! So easy to make and it turns out so moist and flavorful. One thing I did do during the prep, before I prepped the chicken, I  took a knife and put a shallow cut down the middle of the chicken and lay the chicken where the cut faces upwards,  so it would absorb more of the juice and flavor of the butter! I highly recommend for anyone who loves chicken.

I made it with Ritz crackers because that is what I had on hand, and I didnt add the salt or peper. But, it ended up being so good. I will be making again tonight!

Didn't find anything special about this. The flavor wasn't anything more than any other recipe and the crunch wasn't there even afer using the broiler. Usually, I will try a recipe twice before taking out of the roster but this wasn't anything different than other recipes.

I needed something quick and easy. This was both! Since I forgot to add anything to the cracker mix while I was dredging my chicken, I sprinkled onion salt and oregano on top, So good!  I used a small amount of butter, since I used a glass dish.

I love this chicken!  I do add some additional spices (garlic powder, natures seasoning salt, onion powder and paprika) and used 1/2 stick butter.  

I cook primarily in cast iron so I heat up a cast iron skillet while warning the oven and then before placing the chicken in the hot pan, I melt one tab of butter in the bottom of the pan.  Place the chicken in the pan and place the remaining tabs of butter around the chicken.  (Turning the chicken half way through)

This chicken turns out moist and delicious.  It's a wonderful addition to our family favorites.  Thank you for this lovely recipe!

Very good.

I added a hint of sriracha powder to the crumb mix. I served the chicken with cole slaw and quinoa salad, and paired with Red Hook IPA. Mmmmmmmmm

Taste was good, but it wasn't crispy at all! The 1/2 cup of butter was WAY too much; will probably reduce to 1/3 cup or less. Ended up broiling for another 10 minutes to dry and crisp it up. Will try again, but with some modifications.

I used half cornflakes and half ritz crackers and only 1/3 cup butter.  Came out yummy.  Served it with a honey mustard  dipping sauce I made by mixing  1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayo, 3 TBS honey and 3 TBS whole grain mustard.

Soooo good.  I love making this on cheat night. I cut into thin chicken fingers for faster cooking and serve with alfredo pasta or mac & cheese and steamed veggies. Leftovers do not microwave well, but there usually aren't any so that isn't a big problem.

This chicken is delicious! I make it all the time and get rave reviews. I prefer to use a half stick of butter and I cook it for 30 minutes maximum rather than 40 minutes. The chicken does overcook at that point and loses its moisture.

My husbnad and I both loved this.  I was out of eggs, so I melted some of the butter and dipped the chicken breasts in the melted butter then into the crushed crackers.  Then put the rest of the butter as mentioned in the baking dish.  I only baked it about 20 minutes as I was using 4 oz breasts.  Very moist, very yummy, a real keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

good recipe, I added a few more spices to give it more flavor and it turned out great. If it seems the crackers are mushy when the chicken is done just turn the oven on broil to crisp them up, just keep a close watch so they don't burn.

Make this all the time, family loves it! I add more than just garlic though, spice it up with your own seasonings and mix it with the crackers. I also dip in the egg mixture, crackers, egg then crackers again to make it flakier.

Pretty good, even though I didn't taste much difference in this recipe than any other cracker breaded chicken recipe.  There was a little too much butter that I needed to drain some off and it left the bottom soggy.  I turned on the broiler the last couple of minutes to get the top a little crunchier.  It took about 35 min. cook time for 2 large breasts that I pounded out to a medium thickness.  Overall it was good but I would like a little more seasonings next time for more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

A family favorite.  Needs more spice as my family thinks a little bland.  Red pepper and the Italian seasoning a must.  However very easy and fast prep

Fattening for sure, but very moist and yummy. It's alright as an occasional treat.

Juicy and tasty - use 1/4 cup of butter and crush the crackers well - cook thick breasts the full 40 min

We liked this, and I'll make it again, but next time I'll either use tenderloins or halve the chicken breast horizontally.   Whole breast halves are too thick for this recipe.  Otherwise very tasty!

What a great recipe--the chicken turns out tender and moist! Per other reviewers, I used 1/4 cup of butter, and I seasoned the cracker crumbs with garlic powder, onion powder, grated Parmesan, and Italian seasoning. I flipped the chicken halfway through baking. I'll definitely make this again.

It was delicious!!! I highly recommend this however I cooked it for only 25 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.  I also added  some garlic and herb seasoning and I went a little off from the measurements and put less butter and it still turned out great.

I stumbled upon this recipe  looking for another recipe online.  MAN, am I glad I saw this and made it.  I was really skeptical at first.  It was so easy and effortless that I just knew it couldn't be very good but the fact that it had 5 stars made me try it.  OMG, it was so good.  Everyone in the house loved it.  I even had half a piece for lunch the next day and was mad when it was all gone lol...this will definitely be in dinner rotation.  I don't see myself making baked chicken breasts any other way from now on.

This was Amazingly the best oven fried chicken ever!

So delicious and easy to make! I used garlic salt and a bit of oregano in replacement of the regular salt and pepper. I used half the recommended butter. It turned out juicy and delicious!

I followed the recipe as written but I had to put it in two 9x13 pans because the chicken breasts I used were huge and I pounded them out a little.  The recipe was so easy and delicious.  Don't change a thing!  I will definitely make it again.

I used 6 chicken breast halves and a sleeve and a half of crushed ritz crackers. Kept the rest of the ingredients the same. However, I did use the left over garlic salt and egg mix by covering the chicken in it twice while it was still cooking. The whole family loved it, I was iffy but they insist I make it for them again.

My daughter has an egg allergy so I substituted the egg for a milk bath. The crackers stuck well. I added some extra seasonings and salt which was needed. I used 1/3 cup butter and put the melted butter on top of the chicken a couple times during the 30 minute bake time. The chicken was incredibly moist. I will be making again. Thanks!

Made this last night  and my picky eater said that he loved it!  The only changes I made were as follows:
*mixed 1 egg, 1/8 of a cup of whiskey, and yogurt
*panko bread crumbs with the cracker crumbs 
*onion  powder
*fried it in shallow pan with olive oil. Baking did not work the crumbs just fell off that way. The butter just left soggy spots on the crust.
great over all taste though. I will make this again

Recently came back from America were we tried crispy butter chicken, and want to make it as we liked it so much. Found this recipe online, added into dry mixture Cajun spice and Cayenne pepper. The chicken was totally delicious, I also made some crispy pancetta to go with it and serviced in a toast Brioche buns. It was so easy to make and so tasty i will certainly be making this one again.

I've made this multiple times. Very Easy and Delicious. I've tried using a couple halved chicken breast for me and my husband and cut up the other halves of the breast in nugget- and bite-sized pieces for my kids. They love it and never any leftovers!

Very simple to make, and delicious! Instead of using butter crackers, I used Club crackers, and crushed them in a Ziploc with pepper, garlic powder and dried parsley, then added a small amount of milk to my eggs. 
Being at a high altitude, I increased the cook time to 45 minutes, and used a foil lined casserole dish sprayed with Pam.  
I will definitely make this again!!

This is an awesome weeknight recipe.  It's really quick, easy to make, and tastes delicious!  I used 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, about 1/4 tsp pepper and almost a full sleeve of whole wheat Ritz.  I used a full stick of frozen butter, and placed slices strategically around and on top of the chicken.  I couldn't have asked for a better cripy/buttery chicken recipe.

Great recipe! I mixed in a little flour with the crackers as well as garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. I didn't use as much butter, maybe about 1/3 of a stick or so. I suggest pounding out the chicken so its an even thickness. But not too thin! I only cooked the chicken for 25 minutes and flipped it halfway through. Both my husband and I loved it!!

Couldn't be easier and tasted delicious.  

I made this for two - two chicken breasts, so halved the ingredients.   Garlic allergy meant that garlic salt was out, but I used seasoned salt in its place.

This is one of my go to dishes for nights I'm not sure what to make and want something simple.  I make it a bit differently.  I add about 1 tablespoon of flour to the crackers.  It seems to stick better that way.  I also add a dash of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and black pepper.  Then bake as directed.  I find that using a smaller pan is best too, that way the butter stays around the chicken.

I think we really liked it.  Used vegetable Ritz which added some additional flavor and only used about 2 Tbls of butter around 2 lbs of chicken.  Also crushed the crackers in a plastic bag and then used it as a shaking bag.   I cut large pieces of chicken into smaller portions.  Baked at 375 for 25 minutes,  Perfect. Will make it again.

OMG!!!! This is one of the best tasting chicken recipes I've ever made. My husband went back for seconds and couldn't stop raving about it. Super easy and quick. I'm glad I followed a reviewer's advice and added paprika, lemon pepper, garlic salt and powder and onion powder to the crumbs. I also melted the butter and poured it over the chicken. I'm so going to make this over and over again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent chicken but modify the recipe. Depending on how thick your chicken breasts are you may not need 40 minutes.

Great recipe! I don't measure the seasonings but I did use garlic powder, onion  powder, garlic salt, s&p. I also double coated the chicken (egg, crackers, egg, crackers) Came out so moist & tender. Best chicken recipe I've tried on this site. Will be making again! Side note; mine only took 25 minutes @ 375°. Check with a meat thermometer to be sure

Easy weeknight dish (or for those who like to meal prep - keeps great!) I seasoned the meat prior to rolling them in the egg wash.  Very flavorful! I highly suggest you do that. Although, mine came out kind of dry (Operator Error..I think I overcooked it a little), but pairs very well with the broccoli and cheese casserole (also on this site).  Will definitely make this again.

Using one packet of Costco's boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into strips, I used Trader Joe's Golden Cracker Rounds and Papa's Seasoning from this site to get a perfect dinner.  I can't believe I haven't rated this dish before because I've made it several times.  It's so easy to make, quick to bake, and yummy on the tummy!

My family devoured this.  The only problem with the recipe was fighting my daughter for the Ritz, since she was trying to snack on them before I had a chance to crush them.  Be sure to try some of the other flavors of crackers as well for a change.  Recently we tried the butter and garlic flavor, and it certainly added a nice undertone.

Enjoyed this very much.  Was very skeptical with using Ritz Crackers but it was absolutely delicious.  I made the changes based on IBClueless' recommendations at with that I would give it 5 stars.  Definitely a keeper.  Chicken was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I did put the chicken on a rack to keep it out of the pan and drippings.  Amazing!

I put the spices in the egg instead of the cracker mixture to make sure they stuck to the chicken.  It was super easy and delicious!

This had excellent flavor, but the bottom was not crispy.  Next time I will try flipping it part way thru baking time and maybe 25 degree hotter oven.  As suggested, I used 1/2 stick of butter (1/4 cup)

This was definitely a healthier alternative to the chicken fried chicken that my mom always made. I do think that it needed something to go with it like a gravy or something. It was a little bland on its own.

Yum!   My chicken breasts turned out super juicy and tender, just like the recipe says.   I added extra seasoning after reading the recipe and may have over done it just a bit, but still delicious.  Next time I will follow the recommended seasoning in the recipe.  I butterflied two large breasts to use for the recipe and it worked out perfectly for my family.  I also melted the butter & drizzled over the breasts vs putting the pats in the pan.  I turned them once & drizzled again.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I was very satisfied with this dish.  Next time I will make slightly thinner slices of the breasts.   It did take sometime to figure out the breading was simply ritz crackers crushed.

I'm making the recipe this evening.  This is the second time....and I love it!  I didn't have chicken breast, so I'm trying it with some drumsticks that I had thawed.  I did not modify the recipe.

I did it except reading the comments I only used 1/4 a cup of butter on the chicken, then after 40 min I flipped it put on another 1/4 cup of butter on the chicken and I cooked another 20 min. Was very good and I had it over spaghetti and sauce.

I did as a few others suggested - less butter, added a few more spices and a few halved garlic cloves with the butter.  I think it would have still been a four star dinner as is, but the few easy changes made it really good, and still super easy!

Delicious. Also, you can make the breading with cornmeal seasons with paprika, salt, black pepper, white pepper, and garlic.

Great way to prepare different cuts of chicken or pork.  I've made this many times & like it very much.  My fiance enjoys this meal as well.  Simplicity at it's best.

Very good!  I might cook it next time for 30 minutes instead of 40 and use 1/4 cup of butter next time but it tasted great! My kids loved it!

The crust stayed crunchy on top and the flavor was good but a little bland. I don't think a 1/2 cup of butter is necessary, if I make this again I will cut that down to 1/3 cup and add use garlic flavored  Ritz crackers.

This was so delicious and so easy to make!  My husband has trouble swallowing some of his food and chicken that is too dry is impossible for him to swallow.  I put aluminum foil over my chicken when I bake it to help keep it moist and it really does the trick  on this recipe.  The chicken comes out perfect and is very buttery (which I love!!).  I used Ritz crackers.  This recipe will be a standard favorite in my house!!

Uses an awful lot of butter and crackers, so not exactly a healthy choice, but once in a while it's all-good!  My son said this was, "The best chicken I've ever had!"  And I've made a lot of chicken in my day, so that's saying something!  I used boneless chicken thighs.  Lovely!

Very quick and easy to make. However I was disappointed by how bland it was, although based on the minimal amount of ingredients I'm not terribly surprised. I will make again when i need a quick and cheap recipe to make.

Loved it - followed it almost perfectly except I used boneless skinless chicken THIGHS and it was wonderful.  I had potato salad and baked beans for sides, reminded me of the picnics we had when I was little.

This was so good.  Used 1/2 stick of butter.  I did add 1/4 cup flour to crumbs.  Husband and I just loved this crispy, flavorful chicken.  Will be making this one again.  I do recommend turning about half way through.

Dang!  I've never had such tender and juicy chicken breasts before!  I didn't change anything except the cooking time.  In my oven it took 25 minutes.  Next time I might add a little more garlic salt, but it really was satisfying as is.

The husband LOVED this. I halved the recipe since it's just the two of us. I added flour to the cracker mixture as suggested by another reviewer, and also threw in about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, which we put on pretty much everything. Delicious! Thank you for this recipe - it's now going on my "weeknight faves" menu list!

Just ok really but would make again because of ease of preparation which is why I believe this has such high ratings.  Cut down on the butter quite a bit so didn't have any extra to spoon over chicken during cooking like the reviews suggested so I just added a touch extra butter on top of each piece half way through while cooking.  Enjoyed making and thank you submitter!

Extremely amazing!!!!  Everyone was begging for more.   I did follow the directions but I only cooked the chicken for 25 minutes  and I added  flour to the ritz crackers along with some other spices like season all and Italian spices. I then double dipped the chicken with the egg and breaking  before baking it so it had more of a crunch

I just love this simple recipe!  I don't use boneless breast but it comes out perfect every time.  I do season the chicken and I dip it in either melted butter or the eggs.  I then dip the chicken, once I've rolled it in the crumbs back in the butter.  No need to add the cubed pieces of butter.  I have fresh thyme of add that to the crackers.

I have made this dish two times and my entire family loves it!  I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder.  I also put Lawrys seasoning salt and some basil in with the crushed crackers.  It was amazing!  I do suggest crushing the crackers in a baggy, it's much easier than with your hands:)

Can do this with half or less of the butter, though.  Super moist and tender.

Very easy and fast dinner. Hubby complimented that the chicken was super juicy and the breading was delicious. I did add some extra seasoning to the crumbs (garlic powder, onion powder) and cut the butter down to 1/3 c as other users suggested. Good stuff!

I cooked chicken breast with this recipe for my girlfriend. she really liked it. When I prepared to cook this, it was very easy to prepare because only thing I needed to buy was garlic salt and cracker. Then, when I was cooking, I was little worried that I was cooking because the recipe is too simple. But, the result was no concern. Everybody liked it and this gave me good feeling of cooking.

Best baked chicken breasts! I used corn flakes since I didn't have Crackers. I used thicker chicken breasts so baked longer but SO juicy & tender! Definitely on my favorites list.

Very tasty!  I did add a little Italian seasoning and cut the butter a bit, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My other half loved it and he is not a fan of chicken.

My son ate it and had seconds so that in itself makes this a winner! I did make some alterations - added 1/2 tsp each of paprika and garlic powder to the cracker crumbs, used 1/4 cup butter which was PLENTY and baked for 25 minutes with a flip in betweeen. Chicken was super moist, but the coating did not get crispy. I will definitely make this again and add even more seasoning. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Spectacular! Okay changes- breading: used crushed ristz crackers, a little garlic, s/p Italian bread crumbs. Binding: Justin melted  butter, garlic powder, s/p and a little lemon juices ---- baked at 475 for 30 to get crispy.... An absolute hit!!!!!  Also used excess butter mix to season steamed broccoli!!!

Loved the taste, good simple recipe. Only thing I changed is that I dipped chicken in cream of chicken soup before rolling in cracker crumbs which added a lot of flavor I think.

When I make this I pour the rest of the bread crumbs on top.  I also use eithet thighs or drum sticks, breast just aren't liked too much in my house. This is my favorite thing to do with chicken.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband,he couldn't get enough of it. I used garlic butter flavored ritz crackers which I combined with some salt,pepper,garlic,and a little paprika. I butterflied two chicken breasts,sprayed my foil lined pan with some Pam and topped chicken with three tbls.of butter and baked only 25 minutes.

I loved this recipe, and so did my husband and daughter.  It's very rich, but could have used more garlic flavor.  I added grated parmesan & romano to the crumbs, and will try some smokey paprika next time.  I used 3 thick chicken breasts, so 40 mins worked for me.  Next time, I'll use a rolling pin to crush the crackers in a baggie.

It was very good. I put chicken in zip-loc bag with crushed up Ritz crackers, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and lemon pepper seasoning. I cooked on 350 for a full hour, every 20 minutes I spooned some of the melted butter on top. I only used about 1/4 cup butter and it was enough I thought. My whole family liked this chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

my husband loves this recipe! I add my own seasonings and then 1/3 of butter as suggested by LAYLAO89. I also cook it for a little less than suggested (about 30 mins).

This recipe is great and very simple.   I had most items on hand already so preparation was simple.  Next time I will add some additional garlic salt as I only used a teaspoon.  Seems like you can really customize this recipe with virtually any spice you may like.
I will definitely use this recipe often as it turned out great!

I made this dish a few days ago, not what I thought it would be. After putting the butter pieces around the chicken and after it baking for about 20 min's, the kitchen started smelling like burnt butter. The chicken turned out fine, but it was a pain to get rid of the burnt butter smell out of the kitchen and out of the pan.

I will be using this recipe from now on when I make chicken breasts.  I found garlic butter Ritz crackers at the store, and I love garlic, so used those and cut down the garlic salt and added a little bit of Italian seasoning. I also used an unsalted sweet butter and placed the pads around and between the chicken. Other than that, followed the recipe to a tee.  I think the time that is required to cook the chicken will depend on how many breasts you have.  I cooked at 375 for 40 minutes with 4 breasts and it turned out absolutely perfect.  It was the moistest chicken I have ever made.  I already have made this recipe 3 time within 2 weeks. Every time it turns out delicious and super moist.  I am also thinking of trying it on chicken wings and pork.  This is a very good recipe to substitute for frying.

I can't wait to try this on chicken breasts. I made it last night for the kids using chicken tenderloins (hubby and I were having fajitas and they don't like them). I cooked them at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe with one exception. I melted the butter and drizzled it over the chicken. Once before putting it in the oven, and again halfway through the cook time. I let them rest for a minute on a wire rack after cooking. They came out quite crisp and the kids loved them. My husband and I were eating their leftovers wishing we had this chicken instead of fajitas! Thanks for a kid approved recipe that is simple, quick and delicious.

My family DEVOURED this dish!!  

It was the night before grocery shopping, and there was little in our house to make a complete meal.  It was one of those peanut-butter-no-jelly types of nights.  We had chicken breasts, but didn't want just baked chicken, so we searched All Recipe and found this recipe.  By some miracle we had all the ingredients, so my husband whipped this up, along with green beans, instant mashed potatoes, and cornbread.  My kids LOVED it, and they won't eat anything breaded!! (Seriously, they pick the breading off of cheese balls) I highly recommend this recipe for a quick, delicious meal.

The way I make it is... I melt butter, make sure it is hot butter. Then I dip my chicken in hot butter and then the buttery cracker crumbs. I cook at 350* The chicken is so tender, it melts in your mouth! I use no seasonings but you can add your own.  You can use different kinds of crackers, 4-5 different kinds mixed together,  I use Ritz crackers

Made this for the first time tonight and it was THE MOST POPULAR DISH I have ever made for my 10 year old! She usually only eats chicken if it's drenched in BBQ sauce, but she ate this straight. She also declared it smelled like pizza as it was cooking and could not wait for it to get out of the oven. HUGE HIT!!!

This recipe made me want to try and cook every meat that I could think of with it!! The ingredients in this recipe made this meal so delicious, delightful and delectable! My choice of chicken meat were chicken tenders. I only made slight adjustments. I had about 8 tenders, used 1 tsp of garlic salt (probably could have used a dash more) and mixed 1/4 of flour to my Progresso Italian Bread Crumb mixture vs the cracker crumbs. I could have also just used 1 beaten egg instead of 2. I let them bake for just about 40 or a lil less; bathing them individually with melted butter during half-time and towards the end. I love to make different meals and to experience a variety of flavorful foods! Thank u kindly for sharing!!

I just had to rate this recipe! I made a few MINOR changes according to other reviewers suggestions and personal tastes but I don't think they changed the recipe very much. I used the new bacon flavored Ritz because EVERYTHING is better with bacon and crushed them into very fine crumbs. I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt because the Ritz were salty enough. And, finally, I lined the baking dish with foil for easy clean up and sprayed with nonstick cooking spray before adding the chicken and margarine (Country Crock not butter). Cooked a little less than 20 minutes because I made strips and they were golden and perfect! My SO, who is soooooo very picky, loved these. Definitely on the repeat list! I think these would be very good (except the extended cooking time unless using thick chicken breasts) exactly as is but the changes I made just made an already good thing a little better. Enjoy!

This was pretty good, also very easy to throw together quickly. I didn't have buttered crackers so I subbed oyster crackers and I also used minced garlic. I thought it would have more a crispy crust to it, but it was actually quite soggy. I might try again with a few tweaks.

It was very bland as-is - but it IS very moist. Next time I will follow other user's suggestions and add the extra spices.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was great! Everyone in my family loved it! I followed the directions exact except I added salt to my eggs and my cracker crumbs, both. (Im a salt fanatic!...unhealthy, I know!) I checked my chicken at 40min but it still seemed a little pinkish for my liking. So, I let it cook for 10 min longer. Although, that problem could have been me not letting the oven preheat enough! Im not exactly a "professional cook". This recipe was easy to follow and delicious!

My husband loved this recipe. Next time, for a change of pace, I might use crushed cheese crackers instead of butter crackers. Easy, filling, and very flavorful.

Seriously tasty, but seriously buttery. We can't eat this too often because the amount of butter, which makes it so tasty, also makes it upset our stomachs a bit. Eat with fry sauce (a Utah concoction of equal parts mayo and ketchup), and it's great.

This is the best recipe if you take the advice of other people:  I measure out the pepper, but I also sprinkle some on top prior to baking, I use pretty big chicken breasts so I have to cook mine for about an hour, I also cut down on the butter in the pan.  Halfway through put some melted butter on top and it gets crunchy too - this is hands down the best chicken recipe I have ever made, and I never have any leftover.

I made some changes.... First I didn't have any crackers so I used crushed up wavy lays potato chips mixed with flour in a zip lock bag along with seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic powder and red pepper because we like a kick!!! Dipped in beaten eggs than into the zip bag and than placed on the baking pan (sprayed with cooking oil) than I topped with melted butter all over and around chicken as well as minced garlic than Mozzarella cheese sprinkled on top. Put into oven for 15 minutes than I flipped it and sprinkled the garlic and cheese over the other side and placed back into oven for another 15 minutes. When taken out it was perfectly done and juicy!!! Served with Mac n cheese and salad. It was great!!! Next time I will try it with the crackers and compare but yeah it was great though would recommend to others and will make again!!! Thankyou!!!!

So good and delicious! Made 4 half chicken breasts in  oven at 375 for 30 minutes. Mixed in an extra 1/2 tsp of pepper, italian seasoning, and onion seasoning. Used extra butter in glass dish as I cooked and spooned butter on chicken during cooking. Loved it and will definitely make again!

This recipe was amazing!!  Only changes I made were to add additional garlic salt (1 tsp) and only cooked chicken for 30 minutes.  It came out perfect!!  Definitely a keeper for our meal rotations.  Thanks for posting.

This recipe is a regular at our house and there are rarely leftovers. This is delicious as the main dish or as part of a salad. We will sometimes add parmesan cheese to the cracker mixture and most recently I used coconut oil instead of butter....AMAZING!! It gives the chicken a light, fresh taste. If you have not tried this recipe yet you are missing out. :)

I love love love this recipe! My 6 year old said "Im in love!" After her first bite! So simple and the chicken came out so moist! I used half the amount of butter melted it and drizzled on top before baking. The last 5 minutes I added fresh mozzarella on top!! So delicious and the kids really enjoyed it!

While this was decent tasting and moist, it still lacked flavor and it smelled up my fridge with the garlic smell.  I will have to try adding some mild spices to it to see if it will make a difference.

I actually really like this chicken and have made it numerous times and it has evolved since the first time I made it. I still use the crushed Rits crackers - I use Garlic Powder (Not Salt - there is enough salt from other sources in here.) I sometimes add additional seasonings if the mood strikes me - Chili powder - sometimes poultry seasoning.  I use Chicken Filets typically or i pound the chicken breasts very thin.  I omit the eggs and I dip them in plain greek yogurt and then in the cracker crumbs seasoning mix.   I bake them with the butter "Basting" Them a few times while cooking.  very good and flavorful.

Amazing. Next time, I will add some more garlic salt and seasoning to the cracker, because it could have been a little more seasoned. Still amazingly delicious though! My husband loved it :)

This is a great recipe. I added seasoned salt, onion flakes and garlic powder to add some flavor.
I also cubed red potatoes and cooked them in same pan. My husband wants this put on the regular
Rotation menu! He loves it!

This is our fall back recipe when we don't know what we want for dinner.  It is so easy and tastes amazing!  I have changed it up instead of using crackers by using cornflakes a few times and it works just as good.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

Fast easy and delicious. My family raved about it. I used breadcrumbs. The butter in the oven makes the difference. You don't have to take the butter out of the baking dish. LOVED IT!

I love this recipe.  I make it as directed, and sometimes I add grated parmesan cheese and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good! I took the advice of another reviewer and only added 1/3 cup butter and it was enough. Cooked it for 30 minutes and it was still very tender (had to wait for side dish to finish). Will make again!

Very bland. Had no taste at all. Next time I will add more Italian seasoning to the cracker mixture (Townhouse Butter Crackers taste better that others, at least to me). I also put aluminum foil over my chicken while it bakes and it comes out very moist.

Made this once so far and thought it wasn't bad just sort of too much butter taste. Will try again with less crackers and butter.

This was AWESOME. Incredibly simple to make but super juicy with an awesome flavor. Of course I threw in a couple extra spices that my family likes but the melted butter was what made this dish special. Will definitely be making this one again.

OMG! Great flavor. Added some panko crumbs to crackers (only 1/8 cup).  Also marinated with butter during cooking and placed garlic cloves around chicken while cooking (DH and I LOVE garlic), also breasts were thick so I cut in half. even more delicious the next day.  Reheated initially in micro for 2 mins for 2 pieces of chicken, then in oven in foil packet with more butter and minced garlic for 20 mins. Finished up under low broil for 7 mins.

My house is full of smoke from the burnt butter.  Not impressed with that aspect BUT the flavour of the chicken/breading was delicious! Nice crunchy texture and colour.

This was by far the juicest chicken I've ever tasted! I improvised I used the rectangle snack crackers but I used a little too much butter but it was still delicious! The best chicken I've made.

Made with 6 organic boneless chicken breasts, 1/4 cup butter and crushed stuffing mix instead of crackers.
Family loved it. However, there was no sauce or extra butter left in the pan. The crust was not crispy. Next time I will try it using a shallow tray instead of a baking dish to try to have a crispier crust. In any case, it was good and I will make it again.

My chicken came out soggy and flavorless. I added garlic salt, onion powder, paprika, Italian seasoning and it was still bland. Way prefer greasing with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.

I was requested to make fried chicken for DH's birthday. I decided to try this out instead.  It was met with skepticism...then one bite. His eyes widened, he exclaimed "Holy COW!", and began scraping the plate with his fork.  I will assume that this was a success after all.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but I did marinate the chicken in buttermilk overnight before cooking.  This is a keeper!

Huge hit at my house. Even my picky kids thought it was delicious and wanted more. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough. So my only critique is to double it.

Very good!  Only change was that I melted the butter and drizzled some of it on top of chicken.  My chicken was thick, so it needed the 35-40 minute cooking time.

Very delish!!  I usually use tenderloins but, they bake a little quicker and I don't think they brown enough with this recipe.  Just my 2 cents.

Very easy recipe to make (and I struggle with pasta!!) - was vert good and tender. I generally followed the recipe to the letter, though I used lemon pepper as well, and was a bit more generous with the seasonings then the recipe indicated.

Definately a keeper!  Like others said, I used 1/4 cup of butter.  I also added a bit more seasoning to the chicken.  Loved it!

I love this recipe. I'm making this in college and not a very good cook but this chicken recipe was easy to follow and delicious. The only think I changed/added in the recipe was I added sprinkled parmesan cheese and took the chicken out twice to spoon the butter over the chicken.

I made this last night for my husband and me (only 2 breast) - very easy and very tasty!  I did take a little from all the reviews - I did add flour, parmesan cheese and lemon pepper to bread crumbs, cut the butter in half and drizzled over breast and poured rest in small round stone to bake, mixed italian dressing to eggs and baked only for 25 minutes.  Served them with butter noodles & corn on the cob - wonderful dinner!

My husband loved it, and he is very picky.. he said reminded him of NY. I altered the recipe a bit. I used olive oil along w/the eggs. I didn't have garlic salt so used garlic powder. I also added Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese. Instead of butter crumbs i used panko bread crumbs. I thought was good hubby was in love.

Made gluten free by using crushed corn flakes in place of the crushed crackers and adding Italian spices to the corn flakes (oregano, basil, garlic, crushed red pepper, etc.).  Absolutely delicious!

My husband and I love this recipe. We modified it slightly to increase the garlic salt, reduce the butter to 1/3 cup, and reduce the baking time to 30 minutes.

Soooooo good! Upped the cracker crumbs to about 1 1/2 cups because I used about 10 chicken tenders, also used 1/4 cup of butter as did most of the reviews I read. Because I used tenders only needed to bake about 25 mins. Rich, yes, but will make again very soon.

Easy to prepare and cook. My family really enjoyed this dish. It is a simple recipe, I only changed the amount of butter used ( 1/2 stick) and used garlic instead of garlic salt. I think next time I will try to spice it up a bit but still use this as the base recipe.

Very easy to make and my husband thought it was delicious. I also added some parmesan cheese just because I love the smell of it baking. Being a vegetarian, I didn't eat any, but he says he'd like to have it again.

I use chicken tenders instead of the whole breast and double the amount of crumbs.  I add about 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the crumbs and put it all in a gallon size ziploc bag.  I dip the chicken tenders in the egg wash, press the crumbs on the chicken, dip again in the egg wash and then back in the crumbs for a crunchy crust. I also add garlic powder to the egg wash for added flavor. The chicken is moist and delicious.  Definitely a family favorite!

Yummmmmm! I used bread crumbs instead. I added a full stick of butter (1/2 when I put it in, 1/2 halfway through. It was made for my sister and I along with some alfredo pasta, and BOYYY were we satisfied. Made extra for lunch and after putting it in the oven this afternoon on 325 for 5 minutes it was just as good. Very moist and homey. c:

I make it with chicken tenderloins, comes out perfect every time. My husband asks for it at least once a week. Easy and tastes as good or better than real fried chicken. Serve with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob for a real family favorite!

Just finished the chicken for dinner.  I did use 1/4 cup flour with the cracker crumbs, added garlic and onion powder, used only 1/4 butter which I melted and poured over chicken after reading reviews.  Baked for 30 min at 375.  Chicken was very moist and although can see why some reviews say it was bland but to all of us a good bland!  Everyone loved it.  I only wish the coating would have been more crispy and thinking how to do that without over cooking the chicken.  But even though excellent meal!  Thanks for recipe.

This was excellent! I did flour the chicken before dipping it in egg and it makes the crumbs adhere better. And I melted the butter and poured it over the chicken rather than putting pieces of butter around the chicken so it was more evenly covered. But other wise make it just as the recipe instructs and it is wonderful!

I thought this recipe was awesome.  I did follow advice from other reviewers and cut butter to 1/3 cup.  I also used plain bread crumbs instead of crackers because I didnt have any.  I also added 2 tsp of cornstarch to the bread crumb mix so they would adhere better to the chicken.  I used a 13x9 dish sprayed with olive oil and 6 medium size chicken breasts.  I also used salted butter.  I didnt need to add any other salt to it.  I cooked it for like 30-35 minutes.  40 is too long and 25 is too little.  Very tasty.

I made this for dinner tonight with rave reviews.  Even my pickiest 8 year old liked it.  I did change one thing and that was that I used fresh minced garlic and put it in the egg, so it wasn't over powering.  Will make again!

I love this recipie. I made it when friends were over and they loved it also. I think that a little over half a stick of butter is great. I really hope everyone will try this recipie it is really good.

So I made reciepe as written, but did add some more spicies... It was very bland. Well, as some reviews I used the same amount of butter. I think if I add some zesty cheese, or lemon it'll be a more tastey dish. The chicken was moist, I can say that...

This meal was a home run. Everyone loved it even my picky brother. I followed the suggestions of some of the other users. I added 1/4 cup flour, 1tsp of Itilain bread crumbs, and a sprinkle of garlic powder. It turned out fantastic. This is the best breaded oven baked chicken recipie i have made.

My boyfriend says this may be one of the best things I've cooked so far. It's relatively easy to make too! Of course, make sure to serve with some comfort sides like mashed potatoes, corn and buttered bread!

My husband says this is the only chicken we'll ever have! I used two enormous boneless chicken breast halves, 1/3 cup butter, pepper, garlic powder, parmesan, and substituted PEPPERIDGE FARM STUFFING MIX, crushed, for the cracker crumbs. Baked in round pie plate, 30 minutes at 375 & basted twice with butter in pan. Tender, flavorful; will be making again and again!

I liked the idea, but found it a little too bland. Added some more spices. I also didn't cook the chicken for 40 minutes, but 30, and it was still a little dry.

Try frying the chicken in butter flavor Crisco after dipping it in a mixture of egg/milk mixture and then sprinkling your seasons on it and then put flour on it.  Alternative to the baked chicken and you still get a butter taste.

Quick and easy to prepare.  It could have used more flavoring, so next time I make it, I'll add spices as others recommended.

I give this recipe 4 stars as written.  Upon reading other reviews, I added more seasoning to mine because some were complaining that the chicken was too bland.  Here is what to do if you want moist, flavorful chicken.  1: cut your chicken in half. 2. season with seasoning salt. 3. dredge the chicken in seasoned flour(I used paprika and garlic powder. 4. dip in egg seasoned as well 5. dip in finely crushed cracker crumbs.  Lastly, I added a little bit of garlic powder and paprika on top of the chicken prior to baking for 30 minutes.  I served with mashed potatoes, dinner crescents and corn.  Delish!!

This was ok...the butter flavor was good but to me the crackers lacked flavor.   I will probably do this again but adjust the seasonings a bit.

Simple, quick, and versitile recipe!  You can add whatever spices you like and it bakes (per my oven!) in only 30 minutes!  Double the recipe and use a large quantity of pre-cut chicken tenders!  Instant dip-able nuggets that any kid or hubby will love!

Very good, I would make it again. The chicken came out juicy and tasted great. The coating didn't go as far as I thought that it would but that may have been my fault. The next time I make it I will be crushing the crackers extra fine. My kids loved it!

Really good start and loved the butter crackers as the breading! I'll make this again with my changes and would also try this out on pork chops.

I had 3 really thick chicken breasts which I cut in half to make 6 thinner pieces and then marinated in Italian dressing overnight.

I added Italian seasoning, 1/4 flour & garlic powder (instead of garlic salt-the crackers are salty enough) to the cracker crumbs. It took a whole roll of crackers to completely coat the 6 breasts. I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, froze it and grated it over the top before baking at another reviewers suggestion.

I moved the oven rack down to the center slot and set the timer for 30 minutes to check temp but then let it continue baking for an additional 10 minutes. It was not dry at all and tender throughout. 

I think it may have been "bland" if I'd not marinated and added seasoning to the crackers, but that's just our preference.

I loved this easy recipe.  I was out of crackers so I used cheese its   Store brand it was very good but made it a little to salty.  maybe the real cheese-its would not have been so salty.  Very good I'll make this recipe  quite often

This couldn't be any simpler! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly. The chicken was moist and juicy, ready in exactly 40 minutes, which gave me enough time to make side dishes for a complete meal. I'll make this again!

Fantastic dish! I did make a slight change. Instead of the cutting the butter I pre-melted it in my dish and added more garlic along with it.  I coated the breast as told but lightly dredged both sides of the each breast in the sauteed butter and garlic.  This increased taste to be uniform on all sides of the chicken.  If you are tired of dried out chicken this is the recipe for you.  This is the moisted chicken recipe I have ever made and I'm Southern!

This chicken is awesome!  I made it for dinner last night & it was perfectly moist & so delicious!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a few additional spices (a little oregano, italian seasoning & dried mustard) to the cracker breading.  Try this...you won't be sorry!

This was a hit with the whole family, especially my picky seven year old!  Like some other reviewers, I also used half the butter that the recipe called for, and it turned out great.  I turned on the broiler for the last few minutes to get it crispy on the top....yum!

This was AMAZING. My kids aren't usually big chicken fans, but they gobbled every bit of this up! I cooked the chicken a little longer, as I had bigger pieces of meat--but it still came out absolutely moist and delicious! Next time I might try different flavored crackers just for a change!

I could feel my arteries clogging, but it tasted so great that it was hard to care. It couldn't have turned out better. Everything in moderation, I suppose.  Even the hubby gave this rave reviews.  He said, "this taste like some fancy-schmancy expensive restaurant stuff!"  The chicken stayed incredibly moist.  I was even more impressed by the fact that it re-heated well as leftovers without drying out.  This was easy to make.  I will absolutely make it again.  It would make a great company dinner.

I have made this so many times and even my mother in law loves it.  She never eats anything anybody cooks and won't even eat in a restaurant.  So that tells you how nice this is.  I love the fact that it is so quick and easy to pull together and the kids eat it all up and even have seconds.  Thanks for sharing this lovely and simple dish.

My husband made this for dinner tonight. It was VERY delicious! I read the reviews so we tweaked it a little bit. He made sure to make sure he broke up the crackers very fine so they coated the chicken well. He added more garlic and pepper and seasoned salt. I also noticed that a lot of people were saying that it was too buttery and not crunchy at all so he put it on a rack over a cookie sheet and put the butter on the pan and the chicken on a rack. Turned out flavorful, crunchy, moist. Definitely going to make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe, while simple in its construction, is a sure fire winner that can be modified in a number of ways for variety. I used Milton's Herb & Garlic crackers and a number of different spices in the crumb mix. Tonight I was in too much of a hurry and, gasp, forgot the butter and it was still killer.

I made this last night for dinner and the family really enjoyed it. Like other reviewers, I added a few extra spices like paprika and some a dash or two of italian seasoning. I also cut back to 1/4 C butter. Served it with some ranch noodles and broccoli and I had a "Mom that was great" dinner. Thanks for sharing!

Oh to hear my picky, picky boyfriend say "mmmmm" a hundred times during his meal, while eatting 2 full chicken breasts makes me feel really good about cooking :)
I had to cut butter & cooking time as suggested by other reviewers (less butter = less calories!). Absolutely wonderful! Loved it the next day for lunch too!

This is a family favorite! I don't measure out the butter. I use as much as I need to cover the chicken well. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is divine! My whole family loved it. The chicken was tender and moist- the great taste of fried chicken without all the grease. LOVE! I did add a bit on lemon/pepper salt and mixed unsalted/salted crackers for the crust. AMAZING! I highly recommend this dish- it is extremely easy to make!

Tried this tonight and was impressed! So easy as well. The only things I did differently: cut the butter in half and added paprika and garlic. So moist and flavorful. Everyone including the 3 1/2 year old loved this one.

We used Schwan's chicken filets and added some parmesan cheese and paprika, just 2 tsps. each.  It melted in your mouth.  The most delicious chicken we ever had.  The leftovers make great chcken filet sandwiches on slider rolls with a little mayonaise.

My long-distance boyfriend and I were looking for a quick Friday night dinner that we could both make and enjoy at the same time.  I found this, and it was truly one of the best chicken recipes I've ever tasted.  So easy, too.  I added a touch of grated parmesan to the cracker crumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as instructed.  The chicken was moist and cooked to perfection.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight!  Thank You!

This is the best chicken I have ever made/tasted! I am not a huge fan of white meat, cause I find it too dry. But this was so juicy and flavorful! I used Pinehill chicken breasts ( can get a box of about 20 for $29.99 at Sobeys) dipped in eggs and then crushed Ritz crackers and spices. Placed the pieces in a shallow baking pan and then put the pieces of butter all around. Baked for about 40 minutes, checking it twice in between to spoon the juices over top. I have made this several times now. I love it, my husband loved it, my son loves it, my friends loved it, and my parents loved it, and they are hard to please lol. This will definately be a family favorite for years to come :)

I loved it, boyfriend thought it was okay. I added a few more spices (basil, oregano, onion salt, and a little coriander) which I thought was good but the recipe would definitely be delicious as printed.

This chicken is phenomenal. It's easy and everyone loves it. I never ever have leftovers either. I use it as both my no-fail special occasion crowd pleaser and also as a regular weeknight dinner. I usually add some paprika to the breading mix and serve it with cheesy mashed potatoes. Perfect!

This is probably the best chicken recipe that I've tried; it was really moist. I made a few changes: I used half the butter and added a little bit of paprika and cayenne pepper and instead of pepper I used 1/2 tsp. of Garlic Pepper seasoning. It was really good.

These were good.  No complaints, just not fantastic.  I cut chunks and made chicken nuggets with them.  Cooked for 6 minutes/side.  they came out very juicey and tender.

We made it last night. It's very easy, very fast and worth keeping.
This morning my husband had the leftovers cold for breakfast!! He definitely loved it!
Only a little remark: it was fully cooked and ready in just 20 minutes in a preheated 200 degree oven.
Thank you for a lovely, easy, weeknight recipe :)

This was really good! I make breaded chicken cutlets on a regular basis, but this was a nice new twist. Next time I might use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I think that the crackers are salty enough that you don't need to add any more. This is a very family friendly recipe. My kids and husband all loved it.

Definitely did a little doctoring up with more garlic powder and parmesan cheese, but otherwise worked out really well. Surprised how juicy and non mushy it came out. Felt better about baking it, even with the butter.

This was excellent, although mine didn't turn out like the picture; not brown, but maybe it was how I did the cracker coating. It's a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely loved it!  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and included a few other seasonings (ie: thyme, cayenne, ...) in the cracker crumbs.  Also used slightly less butter.  The chicken was super juicy and moist, and the outside had a little bit of crunch to it.  Can't wait to do this one again!!!

I made this last night and I, too, had no leftovers! It's a very simple, easy to make recipe and it's delicious. I didn't change recipe except added salt and made enough for 8 pieces instead of 4...which was basically another egg and a few more crackers. Yummy! I recommend.

Was lacking a little punch - added a little extra garlic and some red pepper flakes also a little more salt - was much better the second time with the extras.

While the amount of butter and cracker coating negated anything healthy about the chicken, my husband and I simply loved this recipe.  We made it as stated but added about a half a tablespoon of cayenne pepper to the mix, which was nice for the spice but not necessary.  I'll probably lower or omit it all together when I make this again this week.  That's how much hubby liked it!  Also, it's perfect for chicken tenderloins and to get the kids away from the overly processed bagged frozen nuggets.

I made this for a sick friend and her family They all went crazy for it. Only used 1/2 cup butter as another reviewer said to. It looked to be swimming in butter, but they said it was SO moist and tender and delicious!!! Made with Baked Corn, and Creamed Peas with Onions. They went nuts for all of it. Can't wait to make it for my own family too!!!

This is a GREAT most chicken with a touch of crunch to it. I make this alot because the kids just love it. I do had a little bit more garlic salt to mine however because we love garlic. But otherwise this recipe is great just as it is.

DO NOT WASTE EGGS. Use about half the recipe calls for. Also, use a much smaller pan.

this had really good flavor.  i ended up not having any crackers... so i just used plain bread crumbs instead. (it probably would have been better w/ crackers though) my seasonings were garlic, onion, lemon pepper and some parsley. i just placed the butter on top and spooned back on top when the butter had melted one time before i stuck it back in the oven.

This recipe is awesome! I even had a picky eater finish his before I was done. I did make a couple changes. I marinated the breasts in Italian dressing for a couple hours. I pounded the breasts with a meat tenderizer and I used salt-free french onion dip mix and dried garlic, which I put in my magic blender to turn into powder. I added them to the cracker mixture. I only used about 3 tbsp of butter all together and added half at the beginning and half when I flipped them half way through cooking time. Definitely going to be a favorite at our house!!

I followed another member. 1/3 cup butter. Very simple. Did not look like the picture, but it was good. Today is cold, and it felt like comfort food! Next time I am going to flatten the chicken a little.

This is the perfect recipe for families.  If you're looking for complex flavors, this isn't for you.  It's very basic, but very tasty.  The chicken is moist and tender and leftovers are great too!  This will definitely be put into my rotation!  Thank you!

This was a nice change of pace from the usual breadcrumbs. I actually forgot the garlic but my chicken was pre-marinated in some herbs - so it was still flavourful. It did come out nice and moist. I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

delicious, moist chicken.  i cut the chicken into quarters instead of halves for smaller portions.  we cut pieces of butter to put on the chicken before baking.  probably only used about 1/8 cup butter.  we baked it for 25min per another reviewer's suggestion.

My chicken soaked up most of the butter so I didn't have a sauce everyone is talking about. Also, it never crisped up. But it had good flavor and stayed moist. Just not what I expected.

Substituted Ritz for crackers and cut the chicken into 1 inch nuggets.  Add a little brown sugar to give it a nice sweet taste.  My favorite dinner recipe ever.  If I could give it six stars I would!!!!

So good! I think it would work better with smaller chicken tenders, though instead of breasts. If you use big breasts, they do not turn out as moist as they are supposed to be.

I used breadcrumbs, and baked it only 30 minutes with a little less butter than required.  (Actually I used margarine)  Also I used 1/2 a tsp salt and 1/2 a tsp garlic powder.  It was tender but very bland, next time I'll use MUCH more salt and garlic, maybe 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic.  Thanks, this is a recipe with a lot of potential!

This was ok as written - chicken was very moist; however, it was a bit bland.  I will be trying this recipe again but will add some additional spices.

good. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of cutting down the butter a little. The chicken was very tender, but personally I prefer to bake the chicken with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese like I always have. I think it gives it much more flavor than using the cracker crumbs. I will not make this again.

This is really good country cooking dish! But you have to cut the butter to 1/2 stick otherwise it will be too greasy.

I've used almost every kind of crackers you can imagine for this recipe. They all turn out delicious!!! The "Club" brand crackers seem to stay on the best from my experience, so use that if you want a nice presentation. This is a must try for everyone!

This was a wonderful recipe.  While I was preparing it, I was very tempted to add to it because I thought it would not have enough flavor.  However, I was wrong.  It did need a little more salt added, but that was probably because I did not use the amount of butter they said.  I sprayed my pan with cooking spray and just used about 1/4 of a cup of butter.  There was plenty of butter to give it the crispness.  I also turned the chicken half way through the cooking process.  My husband thought it was really good and a definite keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Whoa BABY this was Goooood! I made this for my boyfriend and I and he ate THREE chicken breasts! IT was very easy, quick and absolutely delicious. I did add a little extra seasoning (garlic pepper) to the cracker mix, and only used 3/4 stick of butter and it was great! A MUST TRY!

The chicken was very moist, but that was the only good thing about it.  The flavor was too sweet, or salty, or something was just off with the flavor.  I really just didn't like it, and neither did my kids, I don't think I will make this again.

Loved it! I doubled the cracker/seasoning mixture.  Added a little extra garlic, also minced onion-personal preference.  Used 1/2 stick butter.  Be sure to either drizzle butter over the chicken while cooking or flip it over part-way through so both sides are equally wonderful.  Very simple and delicious!

This is simple and quick, but not too much flavor though. I think next time I make it I will mix in a few spices with the egg.

What a treasure of a recipe! This was absolutely delicious, my hubby and I cleaned our plates. I changed the recipe a little based on other reviews: 1/2 stick butter, plenty of garlic salt, pepper and onion powder, cooked for 30 minutes. I flattened my chicken to a 1/2 inch thickness while my husband kept his chicken breast thick, and we both agreed that mine tasted better so I definitely recommend flattening the meat. I double coated the meat, and it was crunchy and so good. Next time I will make more bread crumbs up because we ran out before I could finish double coating 2 breasts. Also, I used Town & Country crackers and they were perfect. Great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  I prepared this chicken for a book club dinner and it received rave reviews.  Tender and great tasting. It is so simple to make and is a fast dinner idea.  The only thing I added to the recipe was about a 1/4 tsp of paprika to the cracker crumbs. I also cut back on the butter (only 1/4 cup). I will be making this dish again and again.

I really wanted to make a "fried" chicken recipe without all the oil. I didn't have any buttered flavored crackers so I just used saltines and a bit of flour mixed in. I added paprika, lemon pepper, garlic salt, and pepper to the cracker mixture. I realized after I had the chicken breaded that I was out of butter/margarine so I used some pam cooking spray instead(saved some more calories!!) . Just sprayed down the pan and the side of the chicken that was faced up. I flipped the chicken over a couple of times and put some more spray on as I went. I cooked them for about 50 minutes cause the chicken was very thick. It turned out crunchy and absolutely delicious. my family LOVED it. my husband actually told me I could make this every day if I wanted. Thanks for a great base recipe.

Made this exactly as written, too greasy for us.  Still delicious, so next time will cut the butter in half.  Otherwise, everyone loved this moist, tender and delicious chicken.

My family loved this recipe. The chicken was so moist and juicy. I did substitute the crackers for a reduced fat garlic butter cracker and used light butter.

I followed this recipe exactly, which is what you are supposed to do if you are writing an honest review.  If you make substitutions, there is no way you can review this honestly.   Anyway, this was great!  SO juicy and full of flavor.  I used larger chicken breasts and next time I will use smaller ones because the coating was delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

Good recipe! Used 1/4 cup flour with cracker crumbs, used 1 stick of butter. I used more chicken cutlets then the recipe said, so the butter soaked up. I flipped them also 1/2 thru the cooking time. I will use garlic powder next time, not garlic salt, we don't generally cook with salt and it was a little to salty.I also added a little more garlic powder,some parmesean cheese would be good in the crumb mixture also. Will make again!

This was excellent! I, after reading several reviews, was worried this chicken would be a little bland. I was wrong! The ritz crackers made a delicious crust that permeated throughout the entire chicken breast. I just took a pinch of salt and garlic powder and sprinkled it on the chicken.  My only suggestions would be to cut down on the butter a little and make sure you grind up the crackers very finely. I felt it was a bit excessive as it was pooling up on the bottom of the pan and made some of the crust a bit soggy. Delicious, none-the-less.

I thought this recipe was good, however a tad bland as written. I couldn't help but seasoning the chicken some before breading it just for additional flavoring. I will probably make this again.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I marinaded the chicken breasts first - in lime juice and some seasonings because it was all I had.  Someone mentioned marinating it with lemonade - that sounds good for next time.  Chicken turned out very moist.  The one thing I will likely do next time is brown the chicken before putting into the oven to crisp up the coating a bit more.

This was pretty good, and the whole family ate it, which is always a good thing!  I sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before the egg and crackers.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter and that was plenty.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe was fantastic!! I took the tips from the other reviewers and my kids could not get enough. The only thing I did different was to use breast strips instead of full breasts cut in half.

I REALLY liked this. I would make it at least once a week, it was so easy and delicious, but unfortunately my husband thought it was completely bland. I am going to try to use it as a base recipe and add lots more seasonings and such, so maybe he will like it. Even though my husband wasn't impressed, I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I thought it was fantastic!

This is one of my husband's favorite chicken recipes. I only add 1/4 cup of butter and it is delicious! This recipe is easy, quick and moist. Plus, I regularly keep these ingredients on hand, so I can make it on short notice.

A great recipe. I use whatever cracker/chip combination I have in the house and I use less butter than the recipe calls for.

Awesome, awesome, awesome.  The chicken was so moist. I used saltine crackers because that is all I had, but it turned out great. I also used some garlic pepper and lemon pepper in my spice mix. Husband thoroughly enjoyed it so this will be put into rotation.

Mouth-wateringly good!!  I expected this recipe to be a little bland but I needed some sort of recipe to use up our ritz crackers.  This was so delicious I'm going to have to buy a whole new box of ritz crackers to try it again!!  Definitely a keeper!!

This is a good "comfort" type food.  Served with mashed potatoes & a veggie.  Really easy.  Just be careful that you don't over cook or the chicken will become dry.

This was pretty good. I can't say that I was wowed by it, but it was certainly tasty enough for me to want more. I'll surely make it again. I think it might be even better if the chicken were pounded thin and then fried. (Let's face it, w/ all that butter in this recipe it really doesn't matter if it's baked or fried). Unfortunalty, I hate pounding chicken, so I'll leave that to someone who doesn't mind the effort. :)

This is a dinnertime staple at our house!  The chicken comes out so tender, and the crackers give it a nice flavor and texture.  I've made it with anything from whole wheat ritz crackers to cheez-it crackers.  Comes out great every time. Has been a big hit at the in-laws too!  A definite keeper.

We enjoyed this chicken recipe very much.  Both my husband and I are gastric bypass patients.  I had two rather thick chicken breasts and baked them in a small pan for about 40 minutes.  I watched them closely as we can't tolerate dry foods.  These turned out juicy and tasty.  Next time I will play around with more spices, but even with just garlic, salt and pepper, they were good.

So easy and flavorful!  I did season the chicken AND cracker crumbs as others suggested--used seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper & a little thyme.  I can't get over how yummy and moist this chicken is.  I always have these ingredients on hand--very convenient!

Wow, this is a great recipe. The only thing that I changed was that I added 1/4 c. of flour to the cracker crumbs and my husband absolutely loved it!!! I used Keebler Club crackers and again...wow! Definitely a keeper in our house.

Mmmm...very good! My 13 year old son made this for dinner. Everyone liked it, my daughter even scraped the extra breading from the bottom of the pan. We wanted something fast to make for dinner so we cut each of the 4 huge breast pieces into 4 smaller pieces and cooked for about 25 minutes. Quick and easy dinner.

I made this for dinner last night and it was so tender and delicious. I pounded two chicken breasts thin and followed the recipe with only two additions. I added a bit of hot sauce to the egg beat and a little cheddar chesse to the cracker mixture. I served it with fried squash, mashed potatoes and garlic bread. My babe and I both really enjoyed it. Thank you for a keeper recipe.

I added 1/4 cup flour as other reviewers suggested and used half the amount of butter.  I did not cut the cooking time; however, and will next time.  Also, I think next time I will melt the butter in the dish and coat both sides just before baking, instead of "placing around the chicken."  It was edible and quick, but not yummy as I had expected from the ratings.

YUM!  This is juicy and so buttery.  We all at it up.  Next time though I would pounds my chicken breasts thin.  I served with Chicken Stuffing, gravy and peas.  Just a good home cooked meal.  Feelin' satisfied.

This chicken was good but not fantastic. It was easy to make. I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb to season the cracker crumbs and that worked well. I followed the suggestions of others and sprayed the pan and used less butter. I would make it again but probably not regularly.

This recipe is Awesome!! Probably one of my new favorite chicken recipes and so easy to make! The one cup of cracker crumbs was just enough for 3 really large boneless chicken breasts. I also figured out is was easier to put the crumbs on a plate rather than in a bowl to dredge. I'm already looking forward to the leftovers tonight!!

Finally a good recipe for chicken breasts! The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I think it needs more spice, less cooking time and, as many others have pointed out, not so much butter. I used an 8X8 pyrex dish to keep the butter on the chicken and cooked for just 30 min - 40 would definitely be too long. I also used 1/2 tsp of the following spices: salt, pepper, oregano, parsley, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. I did cut the butter down to 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) - though I can see how a 1/2 cup would be necessary if you were making this in a larger dish. Thanks for a great recipe to play with!

I made this recipe for my stepboys.  They always seem very picky about what they eat.  They will usually complain about new food before they have even tasted it.  I cut the chicken into nugget size pieces and made it the same.  However, I had to adjust the cooking time because it was smaller pieces.  I never heard a single this is gross or I hate this all through dinner.  Thanx!

I'm giving this 3 stars because I made it exactly as written.  I will try and it make it again though using some of the suggestions of the 'most helpful' reviewers.  I see now that it was suggested to reduce the cooking time, use a glass pan that better fits the chicken, to grease the pan first, etc.

Very Yummy, I didn't have enough eggs so I didn't use any. Just dipped the chicken in the cracker crumbs. used Saltine Crackers, and added some paprika to the crumbs along with the garlic powder. follow other people advice and put a slice of garlic clove on each chicken breast. in all very yummy. And all make it again.

This was great!  I did pound out the chicken a bit, and added season salt to the other seasonings for extra flavor. Baked at 400 for 25 minutes and broiled at the end.  Oh,and I only used 2T butter. You dont need 1/4 cup.  Served with mashed potatos and corn.  Will definately make again!

I hate to be the one to give this a bad review, but.... Made this tonight for my bf and I. After seeing Redjetta's pic, my mouth watered for a taste. Unfortunately, my chicken didn't look anything like hers - nor did it taste buttery-good. My bf however, really liked his....  I made two breasts. Perhaps the one I ate didn't brown like his did??? Oh, and the crushed crackers would not adhere to my chicken (don't know why...). I consider myself an excellent cook. I am confused as to how something so simple to prepare could turn out as it did (IMHO). At least I enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes and corn served with dinner! I won't be making this again. Thanks anyways.

This was a decent chicken dish. Very easy and tasty. Nothing that I would rush to put on my menu for guests coming over...but nice for a family meal. I baked at 375 for 25 mins as suggested. I also cut the butter by half.

This chicken is good.  Rating the recipe itself I have to give it a 3 because I followed some of the suggestions of others and not the recipe.  I added italian seasoning to the crumbs and parmesan cheese to the chicken as suggested.  This made the recipe a 4.  It turned out very good but as someone previously mentioned its a bit rich for an all the time recipe but it's certainly one I'll hold onto.

I've made this many times - very good.  I don't measure the butter exactly - I just put a tablespoon or so between each chicken.  Make sure to crush the crackers very small.  I put mine in a ziploc and use rolling pin to smash.  I've also used the lowfat Ritz crackers and it is just as good.  I've never made this recipe and got bad results.

Very good.  I didn't pound the chicken breasts so I let it cook the full 40 minutes and it was perfectly moist and tender.  My sis made this the same night so we could compare and her family loved it.  Will definately make again.

This wasn’t bad- very tender, but a little bit bland in my opinion.  It just wasn’t anything special.  However, one thing that may have affected it is that I did not have any ‘butter’ crackers on hand, so I used some kind of whole grain crackers I had, so maybe that affected the flavor.  The whole grain crackers had a bit of sweetness flavor to them, and it smelled delicious in the oven, but just didn’t taste too ‘special’.  If I try the recipe again, I’ll buy some butter crackers for it.

I have made this several times using the "pre pounded" very thin chicken breasts.  My family loves it. It is so tender and moist. This is another good week night supper that the family will love.

Everyone in my family loves it when I make this recipe. I did cut down the butter and added more garlic salt. This is so easy!

Very good, flavorful chicken. My boyfriend still prefers the Chicken Cordon Bleu, but this was very easy to make and a nice change.

I was pleasantly surprised by how moist and flavorful this chicken was.  I used the low fat Ritz, only 1/3 cup of butter, and I added onion powder & little cayenne pepper to the crumbs.  I actually cooked the chicken about 35 minutes, but the chicken pieces I used were pretty big & plump.  It turned out delicious.

This is the moistest chicken I have ever eaten! I did add to the seasonings, I don't measure, I just add. I added: Emeril's Essence, lemon pepper, and a dash of cayene. I do cut the butter in half, and really really is fork tender. I usually make this with my own mashed potatoes and french style green beans.

I love this recipe. I always have to increase the recipe because I have a large family, but everyone loves it. I made this not long ago, and used lemon pepper instead of garlic salt. It got rave reviews at my house! I will definitely do that again.

This is a great starter recipe! We don't use the butter because it makes it soggy, but we love the cracker mix. We still bake it in the oven, and it can be a healthy alternative to fried chicken tenders if you use low sodium crackers and lean chicken.

This was really good. A little salty for my taste but next time I will just use garlic instead of garlic salt. I also added a little cayenne pepper to the mix cause I like a little kick. It was easy to make which is a big plus for me. I definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

This dish was great, but like otheres suggest I didnt use as much butter. I used about 2 1/2 tbs and it came out good. Also I used crushed corn flakes and like one reviewer, I added about 3 tbs of flour to it so it can adhere to the chicken. easy and good, whats not to like??

Delicious!  This was a nice way to dress up baked chicken.  I made no changes to the recipe except for baking it for a shorter time.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Wonderful, I made it exactly like the recipe and my family ate it all and asked for seconds! I made the second batch with just bisquick (with salt and pepper, skipped the garlic, my husband hates it). I suggest melting the butter first, and pouring half of it over the chicken first, and then halfway through turn the chicken and pour the rest of it over the chicken. Put it over chicken flavoured rice, and it was amazing!

We loved this.  My oldest and I aren't big fans of chicken, but we liked this. Next time I will cut the chicken breasts in half to get more breading, but that is all I would do to change it.

I substituted the butter cracker crumbs with crushed graham crackers and reduced the butter to approx. 1/4 cup (I really wasn't measuring). Also, cooking time of 30 minutes was more than enough! My picky 4 year old even loved it! Served with mashed potatoes, corn and a salad - OH WHAT A DELIGHT!

Not fancy or amazing at all, but a nice dinner when you don't have much time in your hands.  I put less butter per other's suggestions, and it was still plenty.

This was very good.  Not quite 5 star though.  I always follow the recipes exactly the first time around.  It just seemed like something may be missing.  He said "It's good" which means it's a keeper for our recipe box!

20-30 minutes in the oven is long enough for this recipe.  Definitely don't need that much butter - I used only a few tablespoons of tub margarine and it still came out very moist and tasty.  Very easy to make.

This was pretty good to us.  I used tenders so it would cook quicker.  The chicken stayed moist and had a pretty good flavor.  I was surprised that is browned up as much as it did.  I would make this again because it was VERY quick and easy.  Thanks

I used 1/4 c.butter. Added 2 cloves of smashed garlic and a splash of white wine.  Fantastic!!!  For the breading - 1 tsp. italian season. 1/2 tsp. paprika and lemon pepper.

What's not to like with "buttery" crackers and a stick of butter in the recipe.  This was very good.  All of that said...I'll make this again!  I'll cut back on the butter though.

I thought this was just okay.  I added some poultry seasoning and still thought it lacked a little in taste.  Also..I did not like the texture of the crackers on the bottom of the chicken breasts.  The butter that they were swimming in made it soggy.  I am confused on why anyone would choose to prepare chicken this way. Normally you bake chicken to cut down on fat, but when it's swimming in butter why not just fry it instead?

This was good. It didnt get real brown or crispy like I thought it would from the reviews. I did use 1/4c butter. I also baked in a 9x13 pyrex dish, had 3 huge boneless breasts and cut them into strips. Baked for 18min. and they were almost overdone.

I made this tonight and the recipe works great!  It's easy and has a good texture.  Overall the flavor is good.  I will add a little more seasoning next time but it is good.

WOW!  Who would've though something so simple could taste so good!  Didn't change a thing except use less butter.  This will definitely be added into the rotation.

I thought this was okay. Used half the butter, and it was still too heavy. Will probably not make again.

I substituted plain bread crumbs for the crackers. These were easy to prepare, and had a really good taste.  I'll definitely make these again, using the bread crumbs.

I keep this recipe in my regular dinner rotation. We enjoy this recipe as is, but it's also a great base for adding additional flavors to it: basil, Italian seasoning, seasoned salts, etc.

This is a really good recipe. My family thought it was great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think next time I may add a little bit more flavoring to it, not much, but a little. Otherwise very easy, and good. I will make this again.

Crisps up nicely in the oven, although the bottom breading does get soggy. Next time I'm going to try putting the chicken on a baking sheet with a cooling rack underneith it to see if raising the chicken off the bottom of the pan helps keep it crunchy on all sides. I marinated my chicken for a day in Itallian Dressing and that gave it good flavor.

Delicious and easy..I added paprika, garlic powder and seasoned salt to crackers, and also melted 1/4 c. butter as others had done and put it on before baking. Very moist and quick.

This recipe was amazing!  I couldn't believe how tender the chicken was!  I used chicken fillet tenders instead and used one egg and added some milk to the egg wash.  I also jazzed it up some using seasoned salt, garlic powder instead of the garlic salt, and a dash of fresh ground sea salt.  The remaining cracker mixture, I used as a top layer to the chicken.  I also cooked it for 25 minutes as opposed to the 40 suggested.  I will make this recipe whenever I get a chance and will tell family and friends about it!

Yummy moist and delicious chicken with a light-tasting crust, not ACTUALLY light with all that butter but really great none the less! I only had to use 1 egg and 1/2 stick of butter and voila! Will definitely make this again, thanks!

I was looking for a delicious alternative
to breaded pork chops, so I thought I would try this recipe with chops.
It turned out great, and my picky 13 year old cheerleader ate 2!
Thanks so much for sharing!

This was very good!  It is a pretty good substitute for fried chicken.  I did cut back on the butter, only using 1/4 cup, which I melted and drizzled over the top of the chicken before baking.  I baked mine for the full 40 minutes and the chicken was still tender and juicy.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and white gravy, yummy!!

Wow, was this chicken good! I bought thin chicken breasts, which I was very happy about because you could really taste the butter crackers! Also, I used a lower fat butter and only 1/3 of a cup. I have a hard time using an entire cube of butter in one recipe. :) I will make this again and again.

FYI: to crush crackers easier, put in a thicker ziplock bag and seal.

I was really excited to try this recipe, but was disappointed when I made it.  I tried adding some spices like others suggested, but I think I over-did it.  I'll try it again and follow what others have done more closely.

Just like heaven...on a plate!  These were so delicious!  So simple to make, no expensive, oddball ingredients!  I played with the seasonings a little (I added 2 tbsp flour, 1 tsp rotisserie chicken seasoning, 1/2 tsp garlic pepper seasoning, and a pinch of salt to the cracker crumbs--no garlic salt) and it turned out soooo good.  I will definitely be putting this into our regular rotation, and I'll be serving it at our next big family meal.  YUMMMMM!!

wow.  Perfect, moist, tender baked chicken. I baked for 45 minutes, and changed nothing about the ingredients except for the amount of butter as suggested by other users. The crackers make a great crust. Will use often in the future.

So Delicious my Boyfriend and I loved it. Really Juicy and tender. I found some of the suggestions really helpful. First I tenderized my chicken Then I dipped my chicken in egg and lemon juice. I Crushed Breton Whole Wheat Crackers added some papricka garlic salt and pepper to the mix. sprinkled the chicken with parmesan cheese, and I used less butter about 4 teaspoons one at each side of the pan. I only baked for 30 mins 45 would have been too long. It turned out fantastic. No leftovers :(

Delicious & easy!  My only complaint was that the top dried out while the bottom had a buttery, crisp crust.  Next time I make this recipe, I will turn the chicken over once.

I made this tonight and it was a hit! I kept saying "this smells so good" the whole time it cooked. I also cut the butter down to 1/2 stick and added a few shakes of Parmesan to the crackers. This was quick, simple and delicious! Very moist and flavorful. It's a keeper!

This chicken was great. I didn't use as much butter and I pounded out the chicken breast first then cut them in half. I seasoned the crackers with a variety of seasonings from others suggestions. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made nuggets and they came out great, not as crispy as I would like them to have been but great all the same. I did infuse the butter w/ fresh garlic as one person said and I added some extra seasonings (Cajun spices).

My husband LOVED this, I thought it was pretty good...used Saltines as I didn't have any Ritz but seasoned them well with onion powder, seasoned salt, garlic salt and pepper.  Dredged chicken in flour first, then egg, then cracker crumbs, sliced 1/2 stick of butter over the top and around the sides before baking then turned chicken over halfway through baking time so the top didn't dry out.  Would definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

it was ok.  i thought it'd have more of a buttery taste, but it just tasted like plain (excellently cooked) chicken.  if i cook something with that much cholesterol, i want to taste it.  the cracker crust was nice, but again not very flavorful.

Delicious and easy to prepare! As others suggested, I flipped the breasts half-way through; used less margarine; cut the cooking time; and added some additional seasonings. Next time, I'll add some Parmesan cheese,too. The family says "this is a keeper", and I agree.

Really great recipe.   I enjoyed the taste.  Noone at the table had any comments but I think I am being spoiled by all these great recipes from this site.

Very tender and moist just like everyone said.  I did take the suggestions and added more seasonings to the breading and was glad I did.

I've had this recipe since Jan. of 2002, but I never reviewed it, it was well liked then and is still very well liked.  Thanks for taking the time for this wonderful recipe.

I had to try this because of the reviews, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. There was little to no flavor here, and it just tasted like something was lacking.  The chicken was very moist though.

Maybe I was expecting too much from this recipe.  It was moist but really lacking in flavor, even though I added 1 Tbsp each of pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder & paprika.  In my honest opinion, this wasn't worth the effort (which was little) or the calories.  Just not a keeper because it wasn't exceptional, just average.

My family loves this one. I've made it with chicken breasts, strips, even nuggets. I like to experiment with including additional seasonings - Adobo, Old Bay, even chili pepper and Lawry's. Try mixing in some Roasted Vegetable crackers for a unique flavor.

It was very good. Indeed it did taste a little like chicken nuggets. It was a little more soggy than I would've liked though. I did used the variation of flour etc… from the other user. I need to maybe cook it a little longer?

This is an easy "comfort" dinner that tastes great.  I like to use flavored croutons for the coating (favorite-- Roasted Garlic Focaccia croutons).  Just place 'em in a flat bottomed dish (I use round ones for making layered cakes) and  crush with a measuring cup.  These are easy, crunchy and add great flavor to the chicken.

Based on past reviews I was really hopeful with this recipe.  I just didn't think it had enough flavor to warrant the calories.  I did try it a second time and used half Ritz crackers and half fried onions.  I pulsed them in the food processor - then added more garlic salt and pepper.  I also pounded the breasts thin - adding more surface space to the chicken, thus adding more 'crumb coating' , which means more flavor.  Pounding the chicken means you only need to cook for 20 - 25 minutes.  Rewritten this way, I would give the recipe 4 stars.

This was so yummy! Made a few changes...used boneless skinless thieghs (cooked for 40 minutes and they were perfect), used 1 sleeve of crackers and added about 1 t each of kosher salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. Also only used 1/2 of the butter. It was delicious and enjoyed by the whole family! Served with roasted carrots (that I threw in while the chicken was cooking), rice and steamed broccoli.

My husband is not a fan of anything chicken, however, he went back for seconds tonight. I gave the recipe 4 stars because I added garlic and herb seasoning to the cracker mixture and a dash maybe two of hot sauce to the egg mixture. This doesn't make it too spicy but gives it added flavor. My children loved this chicken. I will be adding this to our monthly menus.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. By mistake my husband bought chicken tenders instead of breast, but no matter, they were the best baked chicken tenders we have ever had. It was a wee bit on the bland side though. I think the recipe could benefit from a little cayenne pepper, maybe some onion powder, something to kick it up just a notch for those of us who like things with a little more zip! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very tasty! My husband and I both enjoyed this. Best yet, it was super easy. I think it was done in about 30 minutes for us. I put baked pototoes in while the oven was preheating and I was finishing up. They were ready when the chicken was. I didn't use the full amount of butter, just cut a slice to put between each. I also used half regular and half light butter.

I used crushed cornflakes instead of crackers as that's all I had. It turned out lovely golden brown and crunchy however would have been quite bland had I not served with a side sauce.

Delicious!  I have made this several times and it is a family favorite.  Decreasing the butter didn't take away from the moistness or flavor at all.  This is so easy to prepare and is a never-fail recipe. So good, I'm making it again tonight!

Yum Yum Yum.  Even my 3 year old, who rarely eats meat, loved it! I made a few changes, I pounded the breasts out, I only cooked it for about 30 minutes, and I basted it with the pan juices once. 1/3 cup of butter was plenty. Chicken was juicy and crisp. I will make it again.

This is by far the best chicken recipe I have ever made!  My husband and children absolutely love it, even my picky 7 year old!  I have found it is the best when using real butter and I put 2 pats of butter on each piece of chicken.

Absolutely amazing! I'm a new cook so kind of scary making things I've never done before, but that was so good! I used about 12 chicken breast tenderloins and also added about 3/4 pack of ranch seasoning. And did everything else the same. Cooked it for about 35 minutes. It was to die for! Will definitely do it again. Everyone loved it!

This recipe is a regular at our house now.  I add 1/2 pkg of DRY Ranch dressing mix.  It is so full of flavor and very moist.  Even my super-picky 2 year old loves it.  Thank You for sharing this recipe!!

Made today for the first time. Excellent chicken. But-something was missing when eating alone. It needs some sauce (lemon sauce?) or some gravy! Will make again with topping next time! I did like it better than my fried chicken and not as messy to make. Thanks for sharing.

I noticed a lot of people said this dish was bland so I marinated for 24 hours and used garlic and herb crackers.  I also decided to half the butter because many people commented that the dish was too buttery.  After making those changes, I still found the dish to be bland and too buttery.  The chicken was very dry (even though I cut down on the cooking time)and I would have gave this dish a 1, but my boyfriend said it was "okay" so I decided to give it one extra star.  I really hate to be negative, but there are far better baked chicken recipes on this site.

This recipe needs way more seasoning.  While the chicken was moist, it was also pretty bland.  I made a little over a lb of chicken tenders and cooked them for around 25 minutes.

thanks for sharing your recipe.  i see many people have enjoyed it through the years...we thought it was just so so...dry and not enough taste.  some of the chicken broke up into strips when i defrosted them so i probably messed up the baking time.  i used keebler town house toppers because that's all i had; they're a little denser than ritz.  IF i make this again, i'm going to try using ritz crackers, add more salt, keep my chicken pieces the same size and perhaps make a sauce to go w/it.

My family enjoyed this meal - even my children! I didn't use as much butter as was called for in the original recipe. In fact, I also took some of the butter and put it on top of the chicken.  (Important: Be careful not to cook it too long.  It is also a good idea to loosely cover with foil after removing from the oven so as to retain the moisture.)

wow! this was AMAZING!! very tender and very flavorful! instead of using garlic salt ( i dont cook with salt) i used garlic powder and for the butter, instead of using 1/2C, i used 1/4C unsalted butter. i used the extra cracker mixture i had and poured it over top the chicken and baked it for 40 min even. PERFECT! will defintaly make again. i served it with garlic naan flatbread and fresh beans with melted garlic butter over top. YUM!!

I wasn't that crazy about this one. I thought the recipe sounded really good, but ended up being too salty. Maybe with the butter and crackers just gave it too much of a salty buttery taste.

My son is such a picky eater that I had make him try a bite (the one bite rule in our house) and boy was he glad, he loved it and asked for it again the next night.  Wonderful and easy recipe, thanks a lot!  I made a couple of changes to the recipe, which were just personal taste choices, I used just one egg and added two tablespoons of buttermilk to it and I used a dash of dry mustard and parsley to the cracker crumbs.

I tried this recipe using roasted vegetable Ritz crackers with salt & pepper and 1/4 cup margarine per two thinly cut breasts.  The cook time was approximately 25 minutes.  The final dish is exactly as expected - moist and delicious!  I highly recommend this recipe for the ease of preparation and end result.  It also lends itself to easy modification.  I will definitely use it in the future.

yes, this chicken is a moist one at that, but i thought that the taste was lacking and for the amount of butter used,....too many calories for too little taste. i did try to keep calories down by using reduced fat ritz crackers.  i have another chicken recipe "go to" that uses only two tablespoons of butter and ends up with a tastier end product. i must say, i was a bit disappointed with this one.

What a fantastic recipe! Very tasty and very fattening. Definately reduce the cooking time by about half. Goes great with sauteed asparagus or a leafy salad.

Family really liked the recipe. I used italian bread crumbs and added more dried basil leaves and added garlic salt. Only used 1 egg with 5 pieces of chicken breast. Used one large tbsp of margarine and cooked for 40 mins. Great flavor and not dry. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty.  My husband loved it.  I made one adjustment though.  I used half the butter and sprayed the bottom of the pan (lightly) with olive oil.

Simple and delicious.  I baked for 40 min. and my chicken was partially frozen yet came out perfectly.  I used 1/4 cup of butter and cut the chicken into thick strips. Served with rice and Butter Dill carrots from this site.

My whole family loves this recipe.  I use skinless chicken tenderloins, in which case they only need to cook for 23-24 minutes to be moist but done.  All three of my kids love it, which is a rare occurrence!

Great recipe everyone ate it right up. I did make a few of the changes other people mentioned. I used a little less butter, cooked for about 25 to 30 minutes instead of 40 and I mixed the cracker crumbs with italian seasoned bread crumbs for a little more zest.

Delicious!  Very tender, juicy, and all around satisfying. This is a staple at our house and my husband's favorite chicken dish! Sometimes i vary it by using spicy crackers for an extra kick, but the original recipe really doesn't need modification.

It was pretty good.  There are some things I will do differently next time.  Use less butter than is recommended... can get too buttery (even if you don't think that's possible).  Also, I read from another reviewer that it's good to occasionally spoon the juices (aka butter) over the chicken as it is cooking. I did that and wish that I hadn't because it was way to butter and not crunchy.  I Wanted some crunch.

Turned out pretty well...I added Parmesean cheese, Italian seasoning and a few sprinkles of Creole seasoning.  My husband said he would have liked it better with cheddar cheese sprinkled on the top.

This is so easy to make and tastes so good.  My kids don't really care much for  any kind of boneless chicken breast for dinner, but they love this one.  It's so moist it's hard to believe it's just baked in the oven.

This was great.  I made 12 chicken breasts and 1 stick of butter was more than enough to crisp up the bread crumbs.  I added parmesan and the Tastefully Simple Garlic seasoning to the bread crumbs, and used a potato peeler to slice off thin slices of frozen butter on the chicken.

My family loves this.  I don't use butter, but spray some olive oil in the bottom of a 9x13 and then lightly spray the top of the chicken.  It is wonderfully moist and tastes fantastic.

Very good.  My 5 year old gives it 100 stars.  We did decrease the butter to 1/4 cup and seasoned the cracker  crumbs with parmesean, salt, and garlic powder.  We will make it again soon because it is so quick and easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this one for dinner and the family loved it.  I added some extra all season spices to my cracker crumbs for extra flavor and the extra crumbs left from dipping the chicken in I spread over the top of chicken to bake.  Chicken was so tender and juicy fell apart when I went to dish it out of baking pan.  Great Recipe.

This is really good chicken.  I wasn't sure about it to begin with because it seemed so simple and bland, but it was really good.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I cooked it just as the recipe called.  In the future, I will use the non stick spray and use less butter.

Excellent recipe, followed other's advice on reducing the butter and added some extra spice, but definitely 5-star. This is going to become my standard baked chicken recipe.

I was out of crackers so I had to substitute seasoned stuffing mix(crushed).  And instead of the garlic powder, I put some minced garlic in with the butter slices.  My whole family loved it!

This was the most juicy, moist chicken we have ever tasted! I used chicken tenderloins and it only took 20 minutes to cook. I also left the black pepper out and added rotisserie chicken spice instead. Served it with rice and green beans. Delicious! And, it was VERY easy to prepare! Will definitely make this again.

This was a family favorite.  I tweeked the recipe though.  I used plain bread crumbs, 1 1/2 tablespoons Red Robin seasoning, and 1 teaspoon garlic salt.  There are never leftovers at my house.

I was not overly impressed by this chicken.  It was bland to me.  I might try to make it with cornflakes next time or add different seasonings to bring out more flavor.  My husband liked it, but he is pretty picky and likes bland foods.

This was really moist and was very good overall.  I will make it again - just not too often due to all of the butter/fat content - but it does make good chicken!

Very easy and very tasty.  I used a full teaspoon of garlic salt but not the whole 1/2 cup of butter and also cut my chicken into strips and baked for 30 minutes.  Very tender and juicy...and I think it would be easy to add many different seasonings to suit your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

I used chicken strips and saltines (because I didn't have butter crackers) with this recipe, and they turned out a lot like the breaded chicken strips you can buy frozen to bake (only much better).  I wasn't crazy about this, but my husband liked it, so I will make it again--next time I will try butter crackers!

I was a little nervous at first because I thought that the butter would be overpowering.  I'm glad that I tried it because the chicken was extremely moist and the flavor was excellent.

Very good!  I did it exactly as the recipe called for and it was delicious!  Note to those with people who have heart conditions - it is a LOT of butter.....but sooo good!  Definately in the rotation in our house.

This was a great change of pace, but needed something. I like a lot more flavor than this recipe called for. I always make a dish the first time exactly like the recipe calls for and then if I am not thrilled, I try it again with some changes. I omitted the garlic salt, added poultry seasoning, salt, minced garlic and lots of pepper to the crackers and was more satisfied the second time around. You could also try this with Italian or Greek seasonings instead of the garlic salt for a different taste.

Totally delicious! I added a little seasoned salt to the cracker mixture for a little extra spice and it was great! Also I did not use any butter, I used 2 tblsp. olive oil in the bottom of the pan and it was not greasy at all! Will definitely make again.

Cooks very well, very moist, however lacking in flavor. Perhaps it needs a lemon sauce to drizzle over the chicken.

This was just average to me- shake and bake except not crispy and less flavor.  I do like crackers with chicken, so when I want that flavor I'll stick with Poppyseed chicken.  Similar enough, but with sauce!

This has become a family favorite. I add two Tbls parmesan and 1/2 tsp pepper to the crushed crackers and only use 1/4 cup butter. Turns out great! We also use the cracker mixture to coat pork chops- pound thin, dip in egg, coat, and fry in olive oil. Yummy. :)

An ok recipe. We are not big chicken fans, so maybe that was the problem. Maybe it was the crackers we used. Worth a try if you like chicken.

i said 5 stars, dh said 4.  he said it needs more seasoning and i do agree.  but i think it's off to a sensational start all on its own.  will add a little more garlic and some italian seasoning next time.  (even the kids liked it.)

Made this for company. It was good, but tasted like something was missing. Think next time I will add more butter and maybe some garlic powder to give it a little bit more flavoring.

So moist and tender!  I have begun using this butter method for  all kinds of chicken dishes. (not to often, cause of the high fat content, but its soooo good)  Thanks for the submission.

Hi. I whizzed this up last night (using Cornish Wafers instead of 'butter crackers - couldn't find any in Waitrose). I totally ignored the Butter measurements too - chucked loads in - and it went down a storm!
Brilliant dish - a definate "keeper" for the future. Thank you xxXxx

Yummy! I tested this out on my husband (in preparation for a dinner party) and it was excellent. I've made versions of this (with bread crumb and herb topping or with parmesan topping), but the butter crackers really add a delicious taste. I'm looking forward to making it again!

It was good, my family liked it.  Just a little too buttery for my taste.

This reminds me of a recipe I had growing up. It was nice and rich tasting. I used Italian Bread crumbs, but the buttery taste came through. It was a yummy dish!

I loved this chicken, but I think my chicken breasts were a little thick because it took 1 hour instead of 40 minutes.  I also tried using 1/2 cup of crushed buttery round cracker crumbs and a 1/2 cup of panko crumbs and this make the coating very yummy and crunchy.  Will definately be using this recipe again!

EASY and DELICIOUS!!  We now have a new favorite way to make chicken in this house.  I lined the pan with aluminum foil and I threw away the mess.  We ran out because everyone went back for more helpings even though they weren't hungry, it just tasted delicious.  I left the chicken breasts thick and I cooked it for EXACTLY 40 minutes and it was just PERFECT!

This is ALMOST  a 5 star but was just a tad dry.  It didn't deter from the taste, however.  I placed a large pat of butter on top of the chicken as well as around the chicken to make the coating a little more crunchy and buttery tasting.  There were no leftovers.

My 7 year old shouted THIS IS AWESOME!! after the first bite she took. This is a keeper & very easy to make. I melted half of the butter & drizzled it over the chicken and put the other half in chunks around the chicken to melt while cooking.

Hi all, just wanted to save that I loved the recipe! I currently am living alone, but I made the dish for myself and found it truly pleasant. In regards to some other comments, I know the dish is a bit fatty, but, hey, sometime you gotta treat yourself. Am I right or am I right?

Very tasty! But I use fresh garlic, finely chopped, to replace the garlic salt. I also tried using turkey breast, with interesting results. It's a very fattening dish (thanks to the butter and buttery crackers) but I still make it every once in awhile.

this dish is absoultly stunning! a few changes, i put the garlic in with the egg and sweet paprika with the crumbs, makes it taste just like hot and spicy from kfc! without the heat. i also melt the butter and pour around the chicken. for something so easy this is delicious! i can't seem to stop thinking about making it.

This recipe has become my picky boyfriend's favorite.  He asked me to make it on a trip to the beach with his mother.  She spent the rest of the time bragging about how her son had found a good cook!  Since we have this fairly often I mix it up by adding different spices in each time.  Is great with an added kick of cayenne and/or curry!

Very good, my family loved this.  I used 5 large chkn breasts so therefore I needed more than the 1 cup of crackers but left the butter the same.  cooked up super but I think it needs a little more spice.  I made this with the "Grandma's green bean casserole" from this site and the Ceasar salad and the whole meal was a hit with everyone.  I love being able to make something new and fantastic out of our same old standby foods.  This will go into regular rotation, thank you!

All I can say is WOW!!! I was very skeptical about this recipe that I almost didn't make it, but I am glad I did.  I added a few spices of my own and it tasted great.  My roommate told me I went gourmet.  Wonderful taste and super easy to make.  It's a keeper!

This is the best chicken recipe I tried so far on this website. I was very surprised how juicy the meat was. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this again! I also added onion powder for added spice.

While this was tasty, it wasn't worth 5 stars.  And to me, one chicken breast with 500 calories and 32 grams of fat is ridiculous. I will not be making this again; I love my husband and don't want to clog his coronary arteries.

It's okay. Nothing more. I doubt that I will be making it again.  Maybe if I added a few different spices... the garlic just didn't do it for me, which is sad because I love garlic.

I cannot believe how good this came out! My husband was amazed when I told him how easy it was. I added monterey jack slices on a few pieces (I'm a cheese fanatic) My 4 year old son loved this! Esp. because he helped me crush his favorite crackers!

Really a 4 1/2 star recipe - chicken stayed very moist and was easy to prepare.  Flavor was quite good, but not exceptional.  I crushed Ritz in a Ziploc and added seasoned salt, garlic salt and Italian seasoning.  As other reviewers suggested I used much less butter, (maybe too little).  Will probably make again.

Very tasty and easy. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and seasonings. The chicken was moist and flavorful.

Very good!!  I only made one change and that was to add some grated Parmesan Cheese to the cracker mixture.  I did find that I needed to make more cracker mixture for the last 2 chicken breasts though.(I made 5).  The kids ate it without complaining too!!  I will definitely be making this dish again.

This is a great recipe, I had made this a while back and lost the recipe. I am so glad to have found it again. My family loves it, I never have any leftovers. Even my 14 month old comes back for seconds.

My picky eater husband loved this recipe and asked me to make it again sometime. I only had to use 1 egg and I added about a teaspoon of basil to the crumb misture to give it more flavor. It turned out fabulous and was incredibly moist. I will definitely make it again!

This was a simple recipe.  The flavor was not as I had hoped but I will try adding some other spices to the coating next time.  My husband and 2 children loved this!  It's a keeper in our house!  Thanks!

This was so moist and delicious.  I did add a 1/2 package of dry ranch mix to the cracker mixture and a tad bit more garlic.  Otherwise, I prepared it as directed & it was wonderful.  NO leftovers.  Will make again. Thanks Heather

This was really good.  I used thin cut chicken breasts and baked them for about 25 minutes.  Plus, I didn't have butter so I used margarine made from olive oil and it tasted great.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent.  I love this website.  I have tried several recipes.  I have loved them all.  However, my husband is very picky and doesn't like to try many new or different things.  When he said to me "that was good, that is how you should make chicken all the time", I couldn't believe it.  Usually when I try something new he doesn't like it.  It was so moist, we could cut it with our forks.  I will definately be making chicken this way from now on.  Also, I didn't have the buttery round crackers, I used Ritz wheat crackers and I was worried that it would turn out.  My husband doesn't know what I did to make it but he loved it and said to make it that way again.  Thanks for the great recipe Heather!

I love this recipe. So moist and very easy to make. The only change i make is that i add 1/2 pkg of Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix to the cracker crumbs...gives it a little extra flavor..really good - try it!!

Good stuff! The Ritz cracker is what sets this chicken apart from the rest. You can also pan fry the chicken w/ this recipe. 
My kids loved it both ways. 
Goes great w/ a vegetable rice mix. 
Thanks!

This is very good and quite easy to make. We had this for dinner and my daughter had seconds since I made extra. This is something to keep in mind when your crackers get stale. Rather than toss them, use them for this!

This recipe was okay.  The type of crackers might be the key.  I'm going to try it again with garlic butter Ritz crackers as was suggested by another member.

I needed to double the crumb mixture, I used two egg whites instead of whole eggs (lowered the cholesterol) and sprayed the chicken and the pan with canola oil. Then melted the butter and drizzled it over the chicken ... I added a few thinly sliced cubes of butter around the tray. I also added a little more season salt, paprika for color and a pinch of lemon pepper.
Needed a little extra salt.  It was great! Have fun cooking.

This was *very* salty! I will try it again with low sodium crackers and/or garlic powder. It seemed like it would be very good if not for the salt.

Fantastic recipe!! Great flavor and moist chicken, the whole family loved it! I did take the advice of other reviewers and pourded the butter, melted, over the top of the chicken, rather than along side it. Very yummy!

What a great way to do chicken! I did fingers, and they came out golden and crispy and VERY tasty. I did cut down on some of the butter, though to cut some fat. Will be using again.

Per other reviews I slightly decreased the butter and while it was certainly edible, it wasn't great.  It tasted like breaded baked chicken.  I did like the Ritz cracker crumbs better than traditional bread crumbs.  Personally, I think there are better uses for chicken breasts.

This was ok. I used 1/2 cup of butter and extra crackers.  I only cooked mine 30 minutes. Next time I'll add lots of cheese. That would perfect it!  Pretty good to be so easy! Ally

I don't know what I did wrong, but this didn't turn out well for me.  I used Toll House crackers from Keebler and they just got all soggy in the melted butter.  It tasted like plain chicken in a mushy breading.  I might try this again and see if it comes out differently.

Quick and easy!  So moist that you can cut it with a fork. I doubled this recipe and used a jelly roll pan instead of a 13x9. I will definitely make this again!

Great right out of the oven, but it didn't taste so good as leftovers - it got mushy.

I made this with chicken tenderloins and the wrong size baking dish!- It was dry, but only because I was in a rush and failed to follow directions and cooked it too darn long- husband and daughter loved it, even though it was overcooked- i obsessed about how i didn't follow the recipe correctly- my husband has asked me 3 times how i made it- and it was dry as a bone!- I am going to make this again ...but I will follow the recipe this time and i know it will be a keeper!- you know it is good when they still like it when you screw it up! Great flavor-house smells delicious hours afterwards! :-)- I added a bit of crushed rosemary to the cracker crumbs etc.....Can't wait until I make it correctly!

Truely the best chicken ever!  My daughter would not try it the first time I made the recipe so I made "chicken nuggets" the second time around.  She loved them!  Also excellent on a sandwich bun the next day.  Definate keeper.

I cooked this for my mother-in law and sister-in law last year and they absolutely loved it. When my mother, father and sister in law visited again they couldn't stop talking about the chicken. It is so soft you don't even need a knife.

This was a great way to have a moist chicken breast! I used Keebler club crackers and 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder and several grinds of good pepper. I only used 1 egg mixed with 1 Tbs. of water for an egg wash. We had it with cheesy rice and lima beans! It was really good! Oh and I did put the margarine,not butter, on the chicken as well as around it in thin slivers for better browning.

Very good recipe, I used half of the butter (1/2 stick or 1/4 cup) and it was still buttery enough.  My husband said it was very good, much better than shake n bake.  Will definately make again!

I noticed a lot of reviews said this recipe was bland, so I added a little Mrs. Dash.  Other than that, I made no changes and we thought this receipe was wonderful.  Tastes a lot like fried chicken without the mess.

I have made this 3 times and it is a family favorite. The last time I use crushed garlic and parmesean croutons instead of the crackers and I added Lawrys season salt and Mrs. Dash to the croutons. Either way is delicious. Make extra because they will ask for seconds!

Even cutting the butter in half still made this WAY too buttery.  Still, it had good flavor and was quite tasty.  I think next time I will reduce the butter even more or maybe use olive oil instead to reduce saturated fat.

This recipe was absolutly fabulous. I added some garlic and onion seasonings to the ritz crackers. The chicken came out perfect and tasted juicy.  This will definately be a keeper in my household.

I like the basis of this recipe I changed it by maranating the chicken in olive oil every time I do this the chicken comes out very tender and juicy also added real garlic to the chicken and some ms dash.  I will make this again and play around with the spices.  You could really use anything that you like on chicken for this recipe.

I made this recipe with low-fat crackers and about half the butter, and we didn't miss a thing in the taste.  I also added a bit of italian seasonings to the cracker mixture.  It was very good and very easy to make.  We all loved it.

This was very good.  And easy.  My husband loved it.  I made it with fresh corn and chicken-flavored rice.  I did add some Season All to the cracker crumbs, as another reviewer had suggested.  Will make again and again!  Thanks Heather.

This should be called the KFC recipe! I dont know how crackers can make it taste like kentucky fried chicken but it does! I made a few changes to the recipe based on others comments. I used Christies Onion Crackers, added paprika, garlic powder and seasoning salt and I used chicken thighs. I put half a tablespoon of magarine on top on the chicken and another half beneath the chicken thighs. Excellent!

This was tasty...I didn't really see or taste any benefit from using crushed crackers though.  I'll probably just go back to using bread crumbs.  I pan fry chicken a lot, so it was definately nice to find a good baked chicken recipe.  This smelled delicious while cooking  :o)

This is okay. The chicken stays moist, and the flavor is good. My only complaint is that the bottom of the chicken gets soggy (but, I pretty much guessed that before I baked it, since it is swimming around in all that butter). But enjoyable, may make again because it is so easy and a good basic dinner.

I made this tonight exactly as on the recipe and it was very good.  I will definitely make it again, however, I think I'm going to play with some spices... maybe add some chili powder to add some spice.

This recipe was so simple and the results were fantastic!  My 2-year old ate every since bite on his plate and even asked for more!  I'll be making this all the time!

*Update:  Fast forward 4 years later and my now 6 y/o, along with my 4 year old, both love this chicken!

pretty good, I spiced it up with season salt, fresh garlic, fresh parsely & paprika. would be too bland if I didn't, I used honey mustard as a dipping sauce, and served it with corn on the cobb & mac and cheese.  my husband LOVED the chicken, he ate all of it untill he was sick of it..  I will make again without a doubt.

This recipe is really easy to make. Great for weeknights. The crunchy cracker coating makes it taste like fried chicken to me, only not so bad for you! This will be in our regular rotation for sure.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It also freezes very well. One deviation: I put a single garlic clove on top of each breast before baking.

This was a tasty but basic baked chicken.  Moist and flavorful but without any flair.  After pounding the breasts to a little less than 1/2 inch thick I only baked the breasts for about 25 minutes.  Serve with more flavorful sides for a very nice meal.  This is a recipe that I'll make again.

WOW! Okay so I'm on here looking around almost everday but I hardly ever make anything. I'm a college student and I live with my picky eater of a boyfriend. So I barely cook. Last night he was complaining how I never cook and this looked simple so I made it. WOW! EASY AS CAN BE! I had all the ingredients in my pantry already. The chicken was crispy and so good. I added a few more seasonings of my own but other than that I followed this recipe to a T. Yuummy! If your worried about making something good and fast then this is your best bet. I will make it alot more! :)

I used the garlic butter flavored Ritz crackers for this recipe, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, since that's all I had. I forgot to season the chicken, as other reviewers suggested, so the end result was good, but not extremely flavorful. However, served with honey mustard on the side for dipping, along with a nice side of corn and warm rolls with the honey butter from this site, it makes a very easy and tasty meal. My boyfriend and I thought it was great.

This was very good. It was crunchy on the outside and very moist and juicy on the inside.  I only used 1/2 of the butter called for in the recipe like other reviewers suggested. I also sprinkled some season salt on my chicken before coating it in the egg. I used 1/2 saltine soup crackers and 1/2 ritz crackers.  What I liked the most was I didn't have to go to the store, I had everything it needed at home already and it was very quick to make and delicious.

I had my mother over for dinner and I am glad I made this. She really liked it. My 2 yr. old daughter kept saying good chicken. After reviewing the recipe, garlic butter ritz crackers came to mind so that's what I used and it was very good. I liked it better than bread crumbs.

This was absolutely delicious.  No leftovers.  All 3 of my kids loved it, ages 22 months to 10 years old.  Smells wonderful when cooking, too.  We will definitely do this one again.  Maybe a tad less butter, it just seems so sinful!

After reading alot of reviews, I decided to spice it up a bit by adding Everglades seasoning, other than that I followed the recipe. My husband raved about it the whole time, until I had to stop him from getting a 3rd serving! I may have over seasoned it a bit, but we loved it and will share this recipes with others! It was soooo moist, I don't see how anyone who followed the recipe said it was dry!

This chicken was great!! Very moist and delicious! My 19 month old gobbled it up and I usually cannot get him to eat anything!  My husband loved it too.

This is an excellent recipe although I do a little "tweaking". First, I add a little (not too much because it's pretty salty)dry ranch dressing to the cracker mixture for extra flavor.I also reduce butter to 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup is way too much butter. Also, about halfway through cooking, I flip the chicken over so that I get butter on both sides.

My family loved this one. I used chicken tenders, (that's what I had in the freezer)garlic powder instead of salt and 1/2 a stick of butter. Very good.

Another winner! I followed the recipe to the letter, and was worried about how dry and UNbuttery the chicken looked during cooking. However, the meat was moist and tender - not dry at all. Like other reviewers I added more seasoning to the cracker crumb mixture, namely a hefty shake of Lawry's seasoned salt. Delicious! This is an easy and tasty recipe. Thanks!

Add me to the list of those who think this is a great recipe. Used only half the butter as suggested by some reviewers but wonder if it would have been even better with all of it. Used Townhouse crackers and will try club crackers next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I don't see what all the 5 star reviews are for it was very bland and not that great. I have always had good luck with the recipes that had a lot of good reviews until I came across this one. Don't waste your time.

This is a GREAT recipe that I can make with my 
3-year old son!! I put the crackers, oregano, paprika and seasoning salt in a freezer bag give my son the rolling pin.. and he has a BLAST crushing up the crackers for mom. I only used 1/4 cup butter and it was plenty.. and around the pan I put a sliced garlic clove (with the butter)!! Thanks for a fun, easy and tasty recipe!

I probably would have liked this better if I used full fat club crackers instead of low fat.  I also only used 4 tablespoons of butter which I can only imagine how great it would have been if I used the entire stick.  The recipe said to place the butter "around" the chicken but I think it'd be good if you placed the butter both on top and around the chicken.  I also took a reviewer's recommendation and added spices (oregano, garlic, and ground mustard) to the bag of broken up crackers.  I also put 4 cloves of garlic in the pan to cook with the chicken. I will try it again with a bit more butter and the same spices.

I'm rating this four stars because of easy prep time and the simple ingredients required, but the flavor itself was just okay. The chicken was very tender with a crisp crust, butit was missing something. I can't put my finger on what exactly. I may make this again and experiment liberally with it.

Loved it!  I omitted the egg and melted 2-3 tablespoons of butter.  I dipped the chicken in the melted butter, and then dredged in the cracker crumbs.  Nice and buttery, not greasy at all, and I didn't have a problem with the cracher crumbs sticking.  I also just used a couple of pats of butter rather than 1/2 cup to "dot" the chicken.  Thanks so much Heather for a marvelous butter chicken that is famous with us!

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was fast and very good.  I also added some of my own favorite spices along with the garlic powder.  I will make this again!

Ths was good.  I only needed one egg and had enough coating for 6 chicken breasts.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and added additional spices (onion powder, paprika, parsley, oregano, basil).  I made it with the full 1/2 cup butter but next time I will definitely use less (probably more like 1/4 cup).  I would definitely make this again, although my husband called it "fast food chicken".

Awesome, but definitely not for the dieter in me!  I will save this one for company to save my waistline!  I don't think there's really any way to lighten it up and preserve the flavor.  It's great just as it is!

Wow!  I admit, I was skeptical, but this really surprised me.  I used cheese Ritz crackers and otherwise followed the recipe and this was a hit with my family.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Also, the butter combined with the cracker crumbs gave it almost a fried flavor.  YUMMY, will make again. Thanks

whoa. this tasted really good but not exactly the healthiest...I can't figure out how to modify it, though! I did find that the frozen chicken that I thawed in the microwave held the coating just fine w/out the egg step (did one w/ egg and the rest without and couldn't detect a difference in taste when done) so maybe I saved a little fat there. Anyway, this will be a great special occasion recipe.

This was really good.  This was quick which I like since I have kids clinging to me while I make dinner.  I will make it again. I just used plain Ritz crackers since I didn't have the butter ones.  Also I used 2 huge boneless skinless chicken breasts so it was pretty much equal to 4.

I thought this recipe was excellent! I used Ritz Garlic & Butter crackers like some other people suggested and it worked great! Contrary to what some other people said, I thought this recipe had a lot of flavor! My parents liked it too since I made it for them while my mom was recovering from surgery (and my father can't cook!) I will definitely make this again!

This was really good and my picky 7 year old liked it which made it even better. I wish it wasn't so fattening - but then it probably wouldn't be so yummy!

This recipe was the best chicken I ever ate, VERY moist I did add a few more spices though and I didn't  add quite as much butter to it, only because of someone else saying  it was too much. It came out perfect. Thanks to who ever invented it ,and I will always make it.

The chicken was definitely moist, since it had the breading.  I read many of the other reviews and used the Garlic and Butter Ritz, plus I added more seasonings, but the flavor was still just not there.  Also the breading was soggy, even when I cut down on the butter.  I have far better recipes that come out perfectly to bother with this one again.  Perhaps I should submit them here.... The Ritz by themselves are great!

Very simple and delicious!  You could add more seasoning to the cracker crumbs, but it doesn't really need it.  The butter flavor with the chicken is very tasty.

This was not as wonderful as I had expected.  It was definitely easy to make and very juicy, but I used plain Ritz crackers and there wasn't as much flavor to it as I would have liked.  If I try it again, I'll use more seasonings.

This is an awesome recipe!  I followed it exactly, however, Ritz has come out with Garlic and butter crackers and that is what I chose to use.  The flavor was perfect.

fantastic.  My husband and I both loved it.  I pounded out the chicken breasts and rub some rubbed some sage on them.  I used some rice crispies and cheese crakers for the crumb mixture adding a little bit of chili powder.  Will definately make this again.
