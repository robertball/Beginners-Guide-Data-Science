Very tasty! This makes 3 large portions, suitable for a main meal. I wasn't sure which 'cauliflower medley' was intended, but I ended up buying Green Giant Riced Cauliflower Medley, which has carrots, peas and onions. Perfect! I ended up cooking the cauliflower in 2 batches, otherwise my large pan was too crowded and the veggies were just steaming, as opposed to frying. I did this over high heat. I topped it with fresh green onion.  A healthy, low-carb alternative to fried rice that I'll be making again!

I used Green Giant riced cauliflower with peas and carrots and I should have drained it because it was watery.  Other than that, this was an easy and tasty recipe, I will make it again.

Amazing! Everyone loved it and most assumed it was rice! I did forget to add chopped green onions but still very very delicious.
