This is a good traditional receipe, but you don't have to cook everything seperately.  Just stuff the peppers, cover with foil and pop them in the oven until they sizzle. It will all be done.

This recipe is identical to mine (and I *love* my stuffed peppers) except for one little thing. I always use Parmesan cheese. I add some to the mix before stuffing the peppers, and I add some to the top of the peppers after throwing on that last spoonful of tomato sauce/soup at the end. It gives it a really yummy au gratin topping.

My first time making a stuffed pepper and it was simple as can be!  Came out great.  I opted for a longer baking time rather than pre-boil the pepper because I like to give all the flavors time to meld together in the oven.  Used tomato soup instead of sauce.  Topped the pepper off with cheddar cheese.  Delish, I will make this again.

I don't usually like green peppers but this was great! Tasted just like Grandma used to make.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used Tomato Soup.  I also added a little Mozzarella cheese between layers of the filling.  My hubby thought the peppers could have been cooked longer...but that might be personal preference.  This recipe made way more filling than 4 peppers could hold so I filled up a few cups of a muffin tin.  This was perfect for the kids since they will not go near green peppers! :)  Thanks!

These were so good!  I added more garlic powder, salt and pepper and used brown rice.  I may try to experiment more next time but this is a great place to start. UPDATE: Instead of plain tomato sauce I used some leftover home made spaghetti sauce.  Yum.  I was eating it out of the pan as I was stuffing the peppers.  Sooo good!

Good basic recipe.

I used red, yellow or orange peppers and I add a cup of shredded sharp white cheddar. I saute the onions, garlic and sometimes matchstick carrots before adding it in to the mix. It's also very good with spinach or shredded zucchini. Very filling and filled with fiber.

I made this for my family and found it very plain and disapointing. After following the recipe we sat down to eat it and ended up adding all sorts of things to try and make it taste better. The cheddar cheese we added was a big help and my husband added ketchup to his. It also needed a bit more salt. Using ketchup to top off the peppers might help with the flavor. We also used plain brown rice, maybe if you use some sort of flavored rice. Mexican rice might be good and top it off with cheese.

Very simple tasty recipe. I altered it a little, I used lean ground turkey instead of beef, added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the mixture, and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of the peppers. The one thing I would/will change next time I make this is to add a little more tomatoe sauce in the mixture of meat and rice.

A perennial favorite.  The only thing I do differently is top 'em with Mozzarella cheese for the last 15 minutes of bake time.  To mix it up, add in Worcestershire, and other spices.

A good starter or reference recipe - if nothing else I found it helpful for determining how much meat and rice to fill the peppers.  I made many modifications to "build" upon this recipe; didn't cook the meat first and, since we try to watch carbs at least where it's easy to, I used probably half the amount of rice called for.  I added egg because I always do and always have.  (One-half egg, or 2 T., for this 2-serving recipe)  I added minced garlic, a pepper seasoning and Worcestershire sauce.  I used my own tomato sauce I put up from my garden and added much less of it to the meat mixture than the one cup called for.  I dotted the peppers with butter before baking them, uncovered, for one hour. (My peppers were big and well-stuffed. Might be 50 minutes with smaller peppers) Put your own spin on this and you can’t go wrong with this basic recipe.  Excellent served with “Cream Cheese Ranch Potatoes” from this site.

A traditional family favourite. I garnished these with mozzarella, parsley and cracked pepper for presentation and pizzazz. It's important to find nicely shaped peppers with relatively flat bottoms so they present well.

Good basic recipe, however I attempted to make 10 stuffed peppers and the amounts were way off...way too much rice and tomato sauce. Just an FYI to those of you interested in increasing the serving size.

perfect. The only thing I changed was I used a jar of garlic, onion, pepper flavored spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. It was SO amazing.

I like the base of this recipe. We used marinara sauce for the mixture and topings instead of plain tomato sauce. We took the suggestion from reading other reviews. You want regret it! Perfect for those cold evening that you want something quick and hearty!

this was a perfect recipe for 2--- if you like it spicy  than add a lot,  because  it needs spice - maybe the original owner of recipe  doesn't care for spice -- I added lots of fresh  garlic and other herbs-even to the sauce I added  more  spice-- also had an old ear of corn that I cut  off and added.I used 3 ex large peppers which I cut in half ,so I  had 6 halfs  and they were stuffed full -- so I had plenty of filling  and now we have  leftovers- I  did par boil the peppers  for 5 min. I added some cheese to filling and last 5 min  I put shredded mozarella cheese on top.This  recipe will be a favorite- its easy and flavor was great with all the changes .

These were really good. I liked that it called for cooked rice instead of instant. I used leftover rice and leftover spaghetti sauce from the freezer so it was a pretty thrifty meal. I served them with Holuski (buttered egg noodles with cabbage, also from this site).

This is a good starting point for stuffed peppers.  I have made them with both green and red peppers and much prefer the red.  I use fresh garlic instead of powder, omit the salt (the tomato sauce has enough salt in it), and add oregano and basil.  I also add the chopped up pepper tops, mushrooms, zuchinni (all cooked in the pan after the beef is done), then add some mozarella.  I top them with parmesan for the last few minutes of baking time.

Positively 5 star.  Same as my recipe except I use whatever canned tomatoes, sauce or spaghetti sauce I have on hand.  Also, add cheese on top--whatever I have.  Nice to see someone else uses a down-to-earth recipe that is soooo easy.

An excellent recipe which has become a regular meal in my home. I may try topping the peppers with cheese next time just to try something new but the recipe is certainly flavorful without any modifications and/or additions. Thank you for posting.

Ive never cooked everything individually.. I just mix it all together, Stuff it and love it!  I do add 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan  cheese and 1 egg to bind it all together.  Also use minute rice so there's no need to precook that.  :)

This is very easy to make and it taste great.  Instead of using garlic powder, I used one glove of fresh chopped garlic, and I added some fresh grated parmesan cheese to the rice and hamburger mixture to add flavor.  Very good, I would also suggest cooking the peppers longer than 3 minutes if your peppers are thicker.  I will make this again!

If you use large, thick peppers, you'll definitely want to pre-cook longer than 3 minutes.  Using a flavorful pasta sauce will spice this up.  I would not recommend using brown rice (why would you not follow the recipe and then say the recipe is too bland?!?)

This is the first time I have cooked and tried stuffed peppers. My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. After adding the the tomato sauce and spices, we added a dash more of each spice and put some parm. cheese and mozzarella on top before baking. Delicious recipe.

Good, tasty and relatively easy recipe.  I doubled it for 2 of us, but with only crescent rolls complimenting it, we were full with one pepper each.

I doubled all the spices, and it could use a bit more.  Next time I'll substitute at least some of the tomato sauce with salsa, to add more of a kick and additional flavor.

I also added cheddar cheese on top and that added a lot of flavor!

This was a good basic recipe.  I doubled it cause we have more than 2 people.  It turned out that I was able to use up some of my left over fried rice from our dinner the night before.  Worked very well too.

I used a link of Hot sausage and one of Sweet sausage, that I pick up at my deli, instead of Ground Beef! I diced a whole onion and some celery and cooked with the sausage. Instead of plain white rice I used a box of 4 cheese Rice-a-Roni. Also, instead of tomato sauce I used a drained can of diced tomatoes! Things I had on hand! It came out fantastic! Not to shabby for not having made them in about 5 years! Thank you

I use this recipe a lot and love it! I usually make more than two so I can have them for lunch again the next day :) One little step I add is to chop up the tops of the peppers and throw them into the saucepan with the onions and the beef and I also try and use red and yellow peppers along with the green to add some colour!  This recipe is easy enough for me to make them at University and I usually have the ingredients on hand. Thanks Karen! :)

One of my favorite all time recipes.  I did not boil my peppers.  I have in the past and they turned out just a little mushy.  I use half sweet italian sausage and half ground beef.  Throw in some diced tomatoes...very tasty.

Great and tasty recipe with a few changes. I did not boil the peppers before hand. I think this makes them too mushy. Instead I just hallow them out, fill them, and put a little water in the dish I bake them in. I browned the beef with ample onion, garlic, salt & pepper. Along with the tomato sauce I added a can of diced tomatoes, green pepper, and celery. I let the mixture simmer and added cheddar cheese and let that melt. Turned out great!

I have made this twice now- and it is good, but I prefer to add the spices and more of them during cooking of the onions and beef, I also add a bit more sauce- they taste like Spanish rice filled peppers!

This is a great base recipe.  We added a generous pinch of herbs de provence and nutmeg with a dash of cardamom and coriander to the tomato sauce prior to mixing with meat.  The nutmeg, cardamom and coriander are wonderful in casseroles and red sauces; try the nutmeg - try it.  If you add a bit of brown sugar to the tomato sauce, it will cut down on the acidity of the tomatoes and add interesting notes to the topping.  Adding garlic to taste and a small pinch of celery seed to the onion and cooking with the meat mixture also lends wonderful flavor to the overall dish.  We use cooking terms rather loosely, but I'd guess a "pinch" equals 1/8 tsp up to 1/4 tsp and a "dash" equals 1/16th tsp or so.   I tend to cook with my nose, but my teenagers need solid base recipes they can expand on themselves, so thank you much for this post!

This was the first time I ever made stuffed peppers and they came out pretty well! I put in more salt, pepper, garlic poweder then the recipe called for and also added italian seasoning. The flavor was pretty good but I think they could have had a little more zip. Maybe next time I'll make the ground beef with a packet of taco meat seasoning to add a little more flavor to the stuffing.

Made this last night my whole family loved it! Even my 2 and 3 year old girls cleared their plates! Yum! I did add more garlic than it called for because it was a little bland. Also, the last 5 minutes in the oven I topped them with cheddar cheese. :)

These were great. Easy to make and delicious. The only thing I added was the tops of the peppers. I diced them up and put them in with the onion and hamburg as I was cooking them. I will be cooking these quite often. Everyone enjoyed!!!

this was my first time making stuffed peppers amd it was scrumptios! I made a couple changes I don't like onions very much so I used red onion and sataed them first with butter, garlic, pepper, and salt. I also cooked the meat before hand then added it to my onions. I made more then the recipe called for so I made some stuffed pepper soup with the left overs!  I will make these again:)

This "basic" recipe was good--
I did substitute white rice for 1/2 cup of brown rice and 1/2 cup whole kernal corn and used one can of tomatoe soup(diluted with some water) to pour over before baking.

These turned out as they should have...but ick. Even though I doubled the onion and added extra seasoning, these were so terribly bland that I won't be making them again (but weren't so bad that my husband and I couldn't eat them for lunch today).
