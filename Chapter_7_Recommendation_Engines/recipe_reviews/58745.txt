One of the best blue cheese dressing recipes ever. Triple or quadruptle all ingredients except the blue cheese and then add cheese to taste.  You will want to keep a supply on hand.

This was awesome!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I just mixed the vinegar into the milk first and let it sit for about 15 minutes to thicken. I won't be buying dressing in the jar anymore.

I made "wedge" salads last night and made this dressing to go with. I did use reduced fat mayonnaise and reduced fat sour cream but other than that I made no other adjustments. Quite good--the kids even liked it which surprized me! Next time, I'd increase the garlic powder but that's purely personal preferance. I'll use this recipe again.

I don't know about this being the BEST, but it is pretty darn good and very quick and easy to make. It is a bit thinner than other blue cheese dressings I've made, but that made it perfect for a wedge salad where I prefer a thinner dressing. Update: I've made this several times since my first review and it hasn't been thin since that first time. I'm not sure what I did differently that time, but I did want to clear that up. Also, this definitely needs to chill for several hours and overnight is even better.

I was not disappointed in this recipe! It was very good. I scaled it to 12 servings (appx 2-3 cups). I had looked at "Bills" and "Bobs" and liked things from theirs also, so I combined them with this recipe by first using only 4oz blue cheese, adding 2t Worch.sauce, 1/2t dry mustard, and cut back the white wine vinegar to 1t. I also added 1 chopped green onion and it was fantastic! My husband was very impressed.  I served it over a bagged meditarranean salad mix from the grocery store. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't change a thing!  I made this to go with our homemade buffalo wings and my husband who usually doesn't dip his wings into anything - loved this.

This is an incredible bleu cheese dressing that has put my proud recipe of years to shame.  I had a bleu cheese dressing recipe that turn bleu cheese haters into disciples.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes bleu even in passing.  I more than doubled the cheese quantity, but for me, too much of any good ingredient is just enough.

Recipes for a creamy blue cheese dressing are all over the place, most calling for some variation of sour cream/buttermilk/mayonnaise.  The number of choices is mind-boggling, so at some point one finally has to say STOP looking, this is the one.  I stopped with this one and whether or not I could have found one better I neither know nor care.  I was completely happy with this recipe which I prepared with no changes, using Gorgonzola, an Italian blue cheese.  I tasted this right after making it and loved it already.  I can’t imagine how much better it will be by suppertime, when the flavors have melded and it tops a green salad with bacon and tomato!  (And since Hubs detests blue cheese, it’s all mine)

Fabulous!  I have another recipe that I love, but it is so thick it is more like a dip.  This has the same wonderful flavor, but is thin enough to be able to mix with the salad.  I stirred the vineagar into the milk to make "buttermilk."  I think the next time I make it, I will process all the ingredients in the food processor, and then add another 2 ounces of blue cheese crumbles.  (I guess you can tell I really like blue cheese!!)

I am not a huge fan of blue cheese dressing so I personally wouldn't know if this was "the best", however, the company that I made this dressing for loved it.  One of my guests actually said, "I could just eat a whole bowl of this alone!".

Thank you for the recipe!

This has a nice flavor and texture. I thought the recipe called for a little too much vinegar. I will try with just 1 teaspoon next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Subtracting a star because I personally found it too sweet - sugar is normally something I try and avoid in dressings and dips.  Otherwise good flavor and consistency.  I made a lot, so will probably add more cheese and mayo/buttermilk to flavor more to my liking.  Also, this is an exact copy of an Americas Test Kitchen recipe, down to the directions where they explain why they chose to mash the buttermilk and cheese together.  Copied cookbook recipes should at least give credit to the original creator!

I served this dressing to guests on a chilled iceberg wedge, with extra blue cheese crumbles.  Everyone simply raved!  It only took a matter of minutes to make.  So easy and so delicious!

Very good - I made it even better by substituting the sour cream with Greek yogurt.  Also, I added  1/2 TBL of heavy cream to create the consistency I prefer.  Keeper dressing recipe!

Excellent recipe!  For those that don’t like the consistency or the flavor (and you say you are blue cheese lovers), the key is in using GOOD Blue Cheese.  Stilton is by far the best with the perfect amount of marbling.   It also makes for a creamy consistency.  The cheaper kinds tend to have been cultured too much and that’s when you get the bitter, strong taste.

Substitute balsamic vinegar, use less sugar, more garlic powder and add cayenne pepper. Thank me later.

I don't even know if I should be reviewing this recipe because although I didn't like it at all, that was because of the strong blue cheese flavor, which as I learned when I made the recipe, I really don't like.  I just wanted to warn other reviewers that it doesn't taste at all like blue cheese dressing from the bottle or at a restaurant and you should only make it if you've tasted plain blue cheese before and like it (by the way if you do like real blue cheese, you'll probably be crazy about this recipe).

I hate blue cheese! So I made this with iceberg lettuce and olive oil croutons for my boyfriend, and I took a little bit of the salad to taste- even I liked it.

When I made this it was fantastic, but I made it a day in advance. Little did I know, it would be a watery disaster when I went to use it the next day! SO disappointing and what a waist of my $$! And yes, I stored it in the refrgerator overnight. I researched and found it could either be from the buttermilk or you need to store it in a glass jar. I stored it in a plastic jar. rrrrrgghhh.

Because there's just two of for dinner I end up throwing 3/4 of store bought dressing out. This is perfect. I did alter the recipe to ingrediants I had on hand. I added sweet Mirin rice wine to milk & let that sit a while and skipped the sugar and buttermilk.

This recipes title is not an exaggeration. After trying this recipe I have vowed to NEVER but premade Blue Cheese Dressing again. I did make a few minor adjustments: 1) Doubled the amount of sugar 2) Used red wine vinegar instead of white 3) Added 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley.

You will get no arguement from me.  This is the BEST Blue Cheese Dressing Ever.  Unless my taste buds are way off, this tasted more like ranch dressing with a slight blue cheese flavor. Definitely a keeper!

This is good. I think it needed a little extra salt, but other than that it was quite good.

As an after thought, this is much better the next day. I highly recommend you make this a day in advance of serving.

Followed recipe exactly except adding about 1/2 t of Worcestershire sauce.  After sitting for about 4 hours it is quite good.  BTW 2 1/2 ounces of blue cheese for me was about 3/4 c.  Good info to know:  if you use low fat sour cream or mayo the dressing will turn to liquid overnight.  I used both and it didn't keep.

Pretty good! I liked the addition of garlic. The blue cheese flavor sinks in best after 24  hours in the fridge. This also softens up the chunks of blue cheese which is nice. I also added a dash of thyme from the garden which lent an earthy tone. Thanks for this recipe!

AWESOME. I had leftover bleu cheese and buttermilk from two different recipes I had made the night before (go figure) and I found this recipe. I love it! I followed the recipe exactly, except in the end I added more bleu cheese crumbles to stir into the dressing. It might be more expensive to make this than to buy a bottled bleu cheese dressing, however I love the idea of making EVERYTHING from scratch! That way you know EXACTLY what's going into your food. Thank you so much for the recipe! OUTSTANDING!

Wouldn't change anything on this.  It's the best blue cheese dressing that I've tried on this site.  Of course, it's only as good as the blue cheese you buy, so splurge a little, and get the good stuff.  Very nice recipe that's now my go-to for blue cheese.  ***UPDATE 11.5.18***  This is my go-to recipe for blue cheese dressing.  I can’t emphasize enough that you should choose a quality blue cheee for this.  I typically buy blue cheese that is labeled with “Castellano,” but the store was out, so I sub’d.  What a difference that made in this dressing.  There will be no subs in the future.

OK, I have to add my voice to the chorus of praise, here!  Excellent.  Made it for a simple salad of lettuce and cherub tomatoes, and my husband and I loved it!  It's very rich, but most blue cheese dressings are.  We will be having it frequently in the coming days, since I made enough for 4 oz. of cheese!

AWESOME!  We love blue cheese and we really enjoyed this dressing.  I left out the buttermilk and white wine vinegar as I didn't have any and it was still amazingly good.  I will be making this recipe again only in bigger batches.  Thank you LUCKYME9 for sharing such an AWESOME recipe!

Full agreement , this is the best. I used a very creamy Stilton and used Apple Cider Vinegar and a little less sugar. It was fabulous, will use this one all the time. Easy, peasy...

Made this for my wife, she was complaining about the dressing she bought at the store.  
She isn't complaining any more!  I normally do not like blue cheese dressing, but, I have been converted.  This is the best blue cheese dressing I have tasted, thanks for the recipe..

Definitely creamy & rich!  I loved the ease of making this dressing.  I can't stand bottled blue cheese dressing, but I love blue cheese and this dressing is outstanding.  I realized I didn't have any garlic powder so I used garlic salt instead and just left out any additional salt.

I would give this five stars if I had prepared as directed. However, I did not write down the recipe. I did it from memory, scaled it back and accidentally omitted the sugar. We had it on wedge salads. The next day my wife took the remainder for her salad at lunch. She came home and said to me, "You should bottle that and sell it". High praise indeed. I will make it again without the sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk so i made my own by adding the vinegar directly to the milk and letting it stand for 10 minutes.  I did not add extra vinegar to the recipe.

I made it today and I couldn't resist myself so I had it on salad! It was Amazingly tasty :) Just loved it. This dressing has real blue cheese flavor. If you don't like blue cheese please, don't try it! I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great. Its simple and takes less time to prepare the yumm dressing :) Thx, for sharing such a delicious recipe :)

I thought this was pretty good.  It was definitely easy to make, but the mayo taste was a little over-powering and the dressing tasted slightly sweet in the end (from the mayo).  We made it to go with buffalo wings and when combined with the buffalo wings, it tasted really really good.

I think I will keep searching for a better recipe though.

I found this to be thick, creamy, rich and full of classic blue cheese 'bite' (right out of the mixing bowl, I should add - this one didn't need time to meld). I followed the recipe, but using white balsamic vinegar, which led to leaving out the sugar. My sour cream was 5% milk fat. I used 1% buttermilk and light mayonnaise as well. As I found this sufficiently rich, I'm glad I didn't choose all full fat. I believe the levels of fat in the ingredients you use will net varying results (as seems to be the case with many reviewers) depending on what combination you use. As will the quality and variety of cheese. I used a classic full strength traditional Danish blue. My combinations worked perfectly for me and this will be my standard from now on.

this dressing is perfect!  it is creamy, delicious and easy-I can't find buttermilk where we live (or if you don't want to buy a whole carton), so I use the same measurement of regular milk and squeeze in a bit of lemon juice.  also, I have found that it stores better uncovered-if I cover it it has a tendency to get watery, but it's perfect uncovered in the fridge.  YUM!

Ok, I am THE blue cheese dressing fan, and have tried them all!  This is the best homemade recipe I've tried by far!  Did change it just a tad.  You must double or triple it to make enough to get through the week.  I used all the exact amounts for the ingredients except I cut the vinegar down to 1 tsp.  You really need to try this, and use a good quality blue cheese to get the best taste from this recipe.  Oh, use this dressing sparingly on your salad, as a little goes a long way.  It will NOT disappoint!

This really was the BEST.  My husband and I are crazy about blue cheese dressing, but I never wanted to DRINK it before!  Thank you for a truly excellent recipe, Lucky! 

Two changes that I had to make out of necessity were to use red wine vinegar instead of white, and a heaping tsp of dry buttermilk with 3 TBSP of skim milk.

I made this dressing and let it sit overnight in the fridge. It was a yummy blue cheese dressing, but it wasn't as thick as I wanted it (or should) be. I would say it was only about half as thick as it should be. Also, all the blue cheese was clumped together on the bottom. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I just added the white wine vinegar to 3 TBS of milk and let it sit for a few minutes. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce for a little something extra. If the dressing was thicker, then this would be a delicious 5 star recipe! I do plan to make it again to try and get it to a thicker consistency.

I love love blue cheese dressing. I've never made my own...I'll now never buy a bottle again. What a difference than the bottled dressing mixes. I did add a tiny dash of Worcestershire sauce and it gave an extra "ZING" I needed. I also left the salt out. We used this to go with Spicy Hot Chicken Legs here on AR.

This ended being very thick and sweet like a jarred sauce.  It was still good, but next time I will omit the sugar and add more buttermilk to make it more milky.

This was recommended to me on the recipe buzz and so I tried it. I thought it was pretty good. I don't know how many servings the original recipe was for but I made 6 servings, and it came out to a little over 1/2 cup. I used no fat buttermilk and low-fat sour cream and mayonnaise and it turned out fine. Thank you for the quick and easy recipe for blue cheese dressing.

Did not have garlic powder so just left it out. Used light mayo and light sour cream and it was still delicious! Living overseas right now and there are no good blue cheese dressing over here, so am very happy to have discovered this easy and delicious one. Thanks very much! Will be making often.

Very delicious!  I used a very strong blue cheese and wish that I chosen a milder version.  I left out the sugar and added a few dashes of worchestershire souce.  IMHO it needs no sugar and worchestershire adds a nice little extra to the dressing.  Excellent on all counts.  Will definitley make again with a milder blue cheese.  It gets better with age so make it at least a day ahead!

I replaced the buttermilk with lowfat milk and I used lowfat sour cream.  It'sa good thing, because I was eating the dressing, by the spoonfuls...absolutely delicious!   Thank you! I now can make a great blue cheese dressing.

Giving this a 4.  Used far more blue cheese than it called for in the recipe.  Still seemed like there was something missing.  Very tastey, but I'm going to keep hunting for a recipe that has that missing oompff.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too thin for us.  No way you could use it for buffalo wings.  The taste was good and not mayonnaisey at all but after being refrigerated, it had the consistency of milk!

Great, easy recipe.  I used low-fat sour cream and lite mayo, along with red-wine vinegar and Equal in place of the sugar, and it was still wonderful with all my modifications.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This is my all-time favorite blue cheese dressing recipe. I usually put in a little extra blue cheese and sometimes a tsp of worcestershire sauce. I omit the salt since the cheese gives it as much salt as you need. This tastes fantastic right after you make it, but it's even better if you let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.

After making this for my husband he will not eat any other kind of blue cheese dressing. He practically drinks this stuff, that I have to adjust the servings to 30! I use apple vinegar instead of white vinegar and if I'm out of sour cream I use plain Greek yogurt.

My hubby LOVES Blue cheese and he said "this is SO good, just how I like it, please keep it in the fridge at all times". I did everything ingredient wise to a T except I added the blue cheese crumbles after mixing all of the ingredients (thats how my husband likes it, chunkier). I NOW have to go BACK to the grocery store and buy more blue cheese today, I will be making about 5 times the amount this time, hope it lasts!! Thanks for posting!!

GREAT recipe! I doubled the amounts and the only changes I made were to keep the blue cheese at 2 1/2 oz., omit the sugar, and use red wine vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.

There is NO better Blue Cheese dressing than this one. For the buttermilk I use 1 cup milk + 2 tbls white wine vinegar, let sit for 5 minutes, then use. Great addition and you don't need to buy buttermilk. Forget the veggies and salad, just get a spoon!!!

This was very good and easy enough that I would definitely rather make this than buy it in the future. I used light sour cream and vegan mayo and this with good results.  It's not quite as thick as I'd prefer but that could be due to the substitutions.

This is great exactly as written, but I found that I really like the little kick that Worcestshire sauce & dry mustard (see "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing") bring to the dressing.  I add those seasonings to this recipe & it truly is the BEST!  I use fat-free plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream & canola oil mayo.  Still rich & creamy, but a little less fattening.  YUM!

I'm not a blue cheese eater so I'm going based on my husband's opinion. We doubled the blue cheese and the garlic powder and used 1/2 T each of salt and pepper. Better than the brand we were buying!

 Most blue cheese recipes taste like mayo, NOT this one.

Great recipe as written.  Here in the birthplace of the Chicken Wing, we taste a lot of bleu cheese dressings.  This is excellent, with a little tang, and may even knock my favorite (Rootie's) off the pedestal.

Extremely good and so totally simple. I'll never buy blue cheese dressing again. Mine was quite thick, so I thinned it a bit with some milk and after it sat for a while, I added more garlic powder. Lovely on a wedge salad with tomatoes.

If you are looking for a blue dressing like they serve in restaurants, this is it!  I did use buttermilk, but you could probably sub milk if you didn't have any.  I also used more like 4 oz. blue cheese.  I'm so happy to have found this recipe and I immediately shared it with my mom, who is a huge fan of blue cheese dressing!

All I can say is WOW.  I love blue cheese dressing and this one tops them all.  If you are looking for a great blue cheese dressing this is it.  The only changes I made - Gorgonzola Cheese Crumbles in place of standard blue cheese and red wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.

Well done!  This is a great basic blue cheese recipe!  My boyfriend actually made it and did an awesome job! Chilling it after putting all ingredients together is key too. The salt and pepper are important too!  But it's a quick and easy recipe.   I might throw a little Stilton in next time too, just for a little extra sexy. We added red onions, heirloom tomatoes, bacon bits and a few pieces of the blue cheese!  YUM YUM YUM!!  Thank you!!!

GREAT recipe, such a hit at my dinner party!  Only changes I made were to use fresh garlic (one clove) instead of garlic powder and to use about 3 1/2 oz. blue cheese instead of 2 1/2 since the package was 3 1/2 oz. (and I was generous with the other measurements to compensate for that).  Oh, and used red wine vinegar instead of white b/c that's what I had.  SO good -- next time I'm doubling or tripling the recipe, for sure!!

I'm not impressed. I hate to be the downer here, but I don't understand what the 5 star rating is all about. This is barely worth three stars (IMHO), but slightly better than two. Made this to accompany Buffalo Shrimp (JIGGYnFL). I actually wanted to try Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing, but didn't plan ahead in order to allow it to sit in the fridge for 24 hours (darn!). Perhaps my taste buds were "dead" from the INSANELY H-O-T shrimp, but nonetheless, I think this was incredibly bland (once my mouth cooled off, I dipped my fries in the dressing and had the same impression - meh). I do have one tip: if you do not have buttermilk on hand, mix 1 T lemon juice with enough milk to measure 1 cup; use what you need and save the rest for later. Perhaps this will be a winner for someone else??? Thanks for sharing anyways, LUCKYME9 :)

Very creamy.  I added more blue cheese, hubby's suggestion and some fresh parsley to spike the flavor a bit.  This dressing was awesome with the grilled chicken salad I made.  I can't imagine ever buying it at the store again, cause this dressing is easily a hundred times better. I am adding this to my rotation.

I've made this recipe on a regular basis for a couple years now, and it never disappoints! The last time I made a batch,  I forgot sour cream at the store but had nonfat plain yogurt in my fridge,  so I tried out the yogurt in place of sour cream,  and it was just as phenomenal! Cut calories without sacrificing the taste,  everyone loves it!

I love this recipe.  I introduced my mom to it and now we are making double batches twice a week.  Only changes are to add slightly more buttermilk and sour cream for a more pourable consistency, use real garlic instead of powder and to refrigerate overnight.  It thickens as it sits, which is why we make it a little thinner to start.  Seriously this stuff is like crack.

This is restaurant quality chunky blue cheese perfect for wedges.  I forgot I found this recipe on this site so long ago and is now and has been "my" blue cheese dressing for quite awhile.  Thank you so much for this!!

This blue cheese is delicious! I doubled the recipe to keep some on hand for the rest of the week and it tastes great. I'm very happy I found it, I will be using this from now on.

This is a very good recipe, and even better when lemon juice is substituted for the vinegar and omit the sugar.  Salt isn't even necessary given the tart lemon and the natural saltiness of the bleu cheese.  Coarsely cracked fresh black pepper makes all the difference in the world.

Make this recipe! This is my go to salad dressing. I follow the recipe exactly and it is so delicious. I am the kind of cook who normally makes my own changes or additions, but there is no need with this recipe.

Better than the store-bought!  Not as great as some restaurants, but still pretty good for homemade!  My boyfriend was very impressed with how it tasted.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I tripled all of the ingredients because I needed enough for 2 iceberg lettuce wedge salads.  I added white wine vinegar to taste, because I wanted to avoid having a bitter flavor.  This was very good and I would recommend anyone to try it!

This dressing recipe is absolutely delish!  The only thing I did different was double the recipe and only add 5 ounces of blue cheese crumbles instead of the 10 ounces.  I also added two crush roasted garlic cloves and a quarter of a cooked onion puree and added it into the dressing.

My husband liked this dressing, but I did not.  I thought it was way too strong, even after I added some additional buttermilk to tone it down.  Perhaps it was the brand of blue cheese that I used.  It was easy to prepare, however, and my husband ate it all up.

This recipe is reliable.  I have recalculated the serving size and it is always good, whether for 2 or 30!  Since buttermilk is a product that is not readily available to us I have used other reviewers tips and stirred vinegar into the milk and let it sit for 15 minutes.  I have used various vinegars and found that rice vinegar works very well as it imparts a delicate flavor.  A great recipe and one I return to time and time again as it is great for both chicken wings and salads.

This recipe delivers. It is fantastic, the complexity of flavors is just perfect. Gets better as it sits. I have been eating WAY more veggies with this stuff in my fridge!! Thanks for a great recipe.

Absolutely delicious!! We were eating it out of the bowl immediately - and I'm sure it will get even better as it sits. I'm not even a blue cheese fan and I love it. 

To sub for the buttermilk, I used milk soured with 1/2 the vinegar called for in the recipe and added fresh lime juice for the rest of the vinegar (had limes in the house and someone else suggested lemon juice). Dressing/dip didn't taste like vinegar or lime juice - the flavers just perfectly well balanced to make an ousttanding blue cheese dressing. THANKS Luckyme9 and everyone who reviewed this recipe before me (and made suggestions)!

I put only 1 tsp of vinegar and only 1 tablespoon of buttermilk..otherwise I felt it would be too thin.  I like really thick chunky blue cheese.  I use Ideal instead of sugar.  When I adjusted the recipe I thought it was really great..

I didn't tell my wife the name of the recipe and after dipping a carrot stick in this dressing she said, "Thats the best blue cheese dressing ever!"  So I guess it's true.  I made the recipe as written and can't think of a thing to change.

Yum! I just made this for superbowl Sunday to go with wings. I tried it tonight right after I was done mixing everything and it is already yummy. I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow once the flavors have settled.

We've been making this recipe for about 2 years now, and it's an absolute staple/favorite/must have for wing-night.  We're in Ireland, where it's difficult to get proper blue cheese dressing, and this. is. it.  Promise.  We always use Danish Blue, since it's the perfect balance of crumbly, strong, and...bleu.  I've actually watched family members lick the bowl clean after dinner.  It's that good.

GREAT blue cheese dressing! I agree with others that the blue cheese used makes a big difference. I love large chuncks of blue cheese in my dressing so I crumble a few more ounces to mix in when I am done blending. That is pure personal preferene. The recipe as stated makes a great dressing worthy of 5 stars (made with a good blue cheese) though.

This is fabulous!  I've been looking for the perfect dressing for a homemade wedge salad and nothing was quite right, until I stumbled on this recipe.  I also used a high quality blue cheese - a whiskey blue cheese from a cheese factory in WI.  Absolutely delicious dressing!!  Don't change a thing!

Hands down the best bleu cheese dressing I've ever had!!!  It is the perfect balance of ingredients.  Mine probably turned out a little thicker because I was out of milk and had to use half and half, but my fridge will never be without this dressing!  Perfect for salads AND dipping.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would!

Good. Didn't have buttermilk in the house, so subbed with yogurt. Still nice and creamy. The vinegar gave it enough tang.

We loved it, and it so easy to make. I let it sit about 45 minutes in the refrigerator to chill before serving with my buffalo wings. A real treat, thanks for the great recipe.

I read the reviews and just had to try this. I even had every thing handy for it. I followed the recipe to the letter and loved it. I also made a second batch and used yogurt in place of sour cream, just like others said. Side by side you could taste a tangy differance. I like it as written. Some even said to use more blue cheese.  I just bought the good stuff. It has a ton of flavor and if we used more it would be more like potato salid and not dressing. One problem was that we ate it all on just two salads, lol. Not hard to make more. IO never knew it was this easy. I dont think I will ever but blue cheese dressing again!

Simply outstanding. I made this in the morning and let sit in frig until evening, than took it in to work for a potluck dinner. I can't say enough how delicious this dressing is!!!!! All of my co-workers went crazy over this. One guy said that he had always hated blue cheese dressings until now...he couldn't get enough of it!! I served this along side buffalo wings and celery!! This is so good, you can just eat it right out of the bowl. Thank you luckyme9 for this wonderful recipe!!

I ate this on my salad, but won't try again. I thought something was missing. I plan to use the leftover as a veggie dip.

This is pretty impressive. You MUST use a cheese that you would eat with crackers too. This i much better 24-48 hours after you mix it. I did a double batch and used half to go with buffalo wings and the other half the next day for a wedge salad. I did have to thin it a little with about 1-2 tablespoons of hot water. It did not alter the taste in any way.

Although personally not a fan of ANY bleu cheese dressing, I make this for my mayonnaise-hating husband who thinks this stuff is to die for. In addition to using it on salad, he also likes to top burgers with it.  If he ever finds out he's eating mayo with that bleu cheese, he may divorce me.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loves blue cheese dressing.  He only has it when we eat out.  I decided it can't be that hard or that expensive.  This was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe, and used part non fat yogurt.  I only had red wine vinegar, and added a little tabasco and worcheshire.  My hubby will have blue cheese whenever he wants!

I made this and doubled the recipe and it came out great! I cooked up some extra crispy bacon as well, blotted off the grease, then put it in my nutribullet and pulsed it three times and added it for an extra punch. Probably the best unhealthy salad dressing i've ever had!

My husband and son are always on the hunt for the best wedge salad. This weekend they rated mine better than any restaurant and it's all due to this dressing. Made exactly as written. They used it on salads the second night and then over rib-eyes on the third night. Definitely a keeper!

This dressing is perfect!  Sure, it's supposed to sit so the flavors will blend but I always taste anything I make before I let it set, and right from the completion this is a wonderful blue cheese salad dressing.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent. I used 1/8 teaspoon sugar. Only suggestion is to double it because this single batch isn't enough.

Far too sweet for blue cheese dressing, just not right with the sugar. I recommend skipping the sugar and giving it a try, you can always add it later.

We've been making this and topping a lettuce wedge, sprinkling with crumbled bacon and adding a few cherry or grape tomatoes.  We used to go to a restaurant for a great wedge salad but this is perfect.  I reserve a few of the blue cheese crumbles to sprinkle on top as well.

This is the best blue cheese dressing recipe I’ve ever tried.  It is delicious!  I used low fat sour cream, mayo, and buttermilk and you couldn’t even tell.  We quadrupled the recipe and still didn’t have any left over.

Oh WOW! This is the best blue cheese dressing I have ever made.  I have made it 3 times now, and it doesn't last long.  One recommendation: Double all ingredients, the recipe doesn't make very much.  I used red wine vinegar the first two times I made it because I didn't have white, and I think I actually like it better, but white wine vinegar is good too.  I use a good gorgonzola that I get at Costco (and I probably use a little more than called for!) Yummy!

Too sweet & sour tasting. Try this instead: 1/4 C mayonnaise, 1/4 C buttermilk, 2 Tbsp good quality blue cheese crumbles, 1 tsp lemon juice, salt & pepper to taste. Make it in the morning & let the flavors combine in the fridge all day. The blue cheese flavor gets stronger with time. If it's too thin add some sour cream. For dip use sour cream instead of buttermilk.

I have no desire (or need) to ever buy blue cheese dressing again, now that I've stumbled upon this recipe. I was dreading buying a bottle at the store because I won't buy the stuff off the shelf unless it's refrigerated (Maries, LiteHouse, etc) since they have a superior taste and fewer "extra" ingredients to preserve it. But it's not on sale and I needed a lot of it for an upcoming party... I was SO happy to find this recipe and was so happy to have everything I needed to make it. The only changes I made were insignificant: I found it easier to break up the blue cheese first, by itself. I also skipped the sugar because...well, I was lazy and didn't think it was necessary. Yum! I'm in love :)

This is the bomb!  Just made it and now it's chilling in the frig, soooo good already.  Only changes I made was I used Boars Head Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, and I omitted the sugar.  Reminds me of restaurant salad dressing, dont ever want to buy store bought again.

Very good even though I didn't have sour cream.  Instead used in total 4 tbsps of light mayo plus I also   added one drop of worcestershire sauce for a lil extra zip!

This was so good I was eating it off the spoon when I made it. But it is too thick as written, so I had to add 1/4 cup of milk to make it spreadable over my salad.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. We did add a bit more sugar but other than that made it per the recipe. Sinfully good. So good you don't even need blue cheese crumbles on the top. This will be our go to dressing when we want a rich salad topping. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've only tasted one blue cheese dressing better and that was from a local BBQ restaurant called Ridgewood who naturally won't part with the recipe, this recipe is as close to their recipe as I have found. I made it to serve with chicken wings and I've used it on salad, it is terrific, didn't change a thing but, it definitely does need to chill for several hours so make it well ahead.

I LOVE Bleu Cheese salad dressing and this one did not disappoint!  I made it as written and thought it was wonderful, it was even better once it was refrigerated and the flavors had a chance to meld.  I will be making this one again.

I didn't have buttermilk so did the vinegar in milk as others suggested. I can't believe it would have made that big of a difference. This has a bit too much of a sour cream taste instead of blue cheese; I actually added an additional amount of blue cheese. It's an okay blue cheese dressing but not outstanding.

Something was missing from this and was too runny for my taste. I mean it was good, but I'm probably trying another recipe next time. I followed it to a T and just didn't find it to be anything special.

Easy to prepare.  I didn't have 3T.  buttermilk, so I uses an extra tablespoon of sour cream, a tablespoon of milk, and a tablespoon of ranch dressing instead.  I served this broccoli florets and carrot, celery and green pepper strips along with oven baked hot wing style chicken strips. Yummy!

Very good recipe. I tripled it. Also added blue cheese while making the dressing in the food processor and then stirred in some blue cheese at the end to make it chunky. Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't eat salad (or blue cheese), but my family does and they LOVED this dressing!  They said it tastes like the blue cheese dressing they give you at Outback Steakhouse.  Although I cannot personally comment on how it tasted, it was very easy to make!

This IS absolutely the best blue cheese dressing.  Thick and delicious!  I made it to serve as a dip for buffalo wings and it was yummy.  I don't like to review recipes after I've made any changes, but I forgot the sugar the first time I made it and it was fabulous then and yummy with the sugar too. Kudos to LUCKYME9 for a great recipe!

You're right, this is "the BEST Rich and Creamy...."It is similar to a recipe I've used for over 38 years. I double the blue cheese and add 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, a definite keeper.

I typically don't like blue cheese dressing but this recipe is absolutely delicious!  I made it to serve with hot wings and now I will be making it to serve with vegetables, salads, or maybe just eat it straight from the bowl.  It doesn't have a strong blue cheese flavor and it is very creamy.  I tasted the dressing before adding the vinegar and decided it was perfect without it.

I made this tonight following the recipe exactly BUT using reduced fat blue cheese, low-fat sour cream, low-fat buttermilk and light mayo.  Hubby and I both thought it was excellent.  Served it as dipping sauce with carrots, celery and Hungry Girl's Healthy Boneless Buffalo Wings.  YUM!  Looking forward to trying it on a Wedge Salad next time.  I will definitely be using the healthier version again and again.  THANKS!

This is the very BEST!! I made it twice within two days. First, I made it for a salad that we were taking to a party. It got gobbled down and then made it for a dipping sauce for fondue and again it was all gone.  I will never buy store bought blue cheese again. I'm always searching for one in stores and always disappointed! I didn't have white wine vinegar.  I used white balsamic that was in the fridge and it worked great. The 2nd time I had run out of white balsamic so I used regular distilled vinegar (I USED A TAD LESS) i WAS AFRAID IT WOULD RUIN IT AND IT DIDN'T. I also didn't have buttermilk so I did as others suggested and mixed the milk and vinegar and let it set a few minutes (used both 2% and skim) Yummy both times! Thanks to whoever posted this!!!!!!

I have nothing new to add.  Just wanted to pay my compliments to the chef and to some reviewers. Thank to Sweet lips, I doubled the recipe and did not regret it all.  Susan, you're right, it is better 24 hrs later... if you can stay out of it that long. And while I think fresh garlic may be better, one would certainly have to allow time for the flavor to infuse.  And finally to steve h, I, too am a bit worn with the worst ever phrase,  "The best ever".  But, LUCKYME9, you delevered.  This is Absoutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing ever. Thank you.

This really IS the best bleu cheese (for us anyway).  It was super thick and bleu-cheesy and the perfect consistency for a wedge salad.  Will save this one for next time.. thanks.

My husband won't let me buy blue cheese dressing anymore because he loves this. I mince a clove of garlic instead of garlic powder. The best blue cheese dressing ever.

I scaled this recipe up to 30 servings, as we have a big family that loves blue cheese.  To give it a little different taste, I used 3 cheeses - Feta, Blue Cheese, and Gargonzola.  It was awesome.  We all love it.

Ok I really didn't think this was going to be anything special.  The grocery store only had this huge bottle of the dressing I wanted, so I got irritated and tried to make my own.  I did what everyone else did and mixed the milk and the vinegar together and let it sit.  After it turned into buttermilk I just mixed everything together and folded the crumbles in.  So so good, I was shocked, I literally wanted to eat it with a spoon, but there wouldn't have been enough left for the 6 sandwiches (Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches - great recipe).

I love Bleu Cheese dressing but this time I had some gorgonzola.  I used this recipe substituting some 1% milk with a litte vinegar for the buttermilk and cider vinegar for the white wine vinegar.  It still was fantastic.

I had pretty much given up on making a blue cheese dressing that I truely loved until I tried this. I didn't have buttermilk but knew to put a little lemon juice into 2% and let sit for a few minutes. Otherwise I followed the instructions, I doubled it. I grew up in Asheville and there was a drive in called Bucks that spoiled Ashevillians to blue cheese dressing - it was famous!  This is right there!! On the spot great!!

I did not care for the vinegar in this recipe.  I don't think it belongs in bleu cheese dressing but I gave it a try.  While this was ok I will make a more true bleu cheese dressing next time.  Absolutely NOT the best....sorry.

Very good dressing, I will never buy store bought again. I used 1 T vinegar as others suggested, and added 4-5oz blue cheese (I am a HUGE blue cheese fan, I could eat it all by itself!). I ate it with carrots right away and it was delicious!

It is actually quite good. I change the ingredients slightly. I used a fine pinot grigio white wine vinegar (and only 1 tsp) and discarded the idea of using powered garlic (ugh). Fresh pressed garlic makes a tremendous difference-one small clove.

Tasty blue cheese dressing. Went great on a cobb-like salad. Will definitely make again - so easy. I am such a fan of homemade dressings to avoid at least some of the salt, sugar and preservatives of store-bought. Thanks for the easy dressing. Oh, by the way, I didn't have enough sour cream, so I added plain NF yogurt, too -- and added more buttermilk to water it down a bit.

Yum! The flavor and consistency of this recipe was great!  I used a little extra bleu cheese and I may use a little more sour cream and less mayo next time because I don't really like my creamy dressings to taste like mayo (even though it is a necessary ingredient).

This was so easy to make and I don't think I will ever buy store bought blue cheese again. I used it to dip my buffalo chicken rolls (recipe on this site) and it tasted great! I doubled the recipe so I put some in a jar and stuck it in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best blue cheese recipe ever.  I made one minor adjustment.  Instead of the garlic powder, I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic, grated.  I also used milk instead of the buttermilk.  Really delicious.

This is pretty close to my favorite Bleu Cheese Dressing served in a deli in NC.  They don't give out their recipe.  It was handed down by "Gran" the now deceased matriarch, who, by the way, was a wonderful person as well as a wonderful cook.  I didn't change a thing!

Tastes amazing! I gave it four stars because its not as thick as i expected. HOWEVER, I did substitute buttermilk for a homemade version of milk + the white wine vinegar. Also, I omitted the sugar and love the flavor it has already. Hopefully it will thicken up a little as it chills :)

Not bad, I ommitted the salt enirely and substituted approximately a 3rd cup heavy cream blended with a teaspoon of lemon juice and let sit for 15 minutes.  Nice consistency for a salad dressing.  I paired it up with oven roasted chicken wings.  It was good.

This turned out really well.  I substituted whole milk with vinegar for buttermilk and had no complaints.  Sets slightly in fridge and will flow well once you set it out.  Great for buffalo wings.

This was my first time making blue cheese dressing. MUCH better than the store-bought stuff. My slight changes to this recipe were that I halved it (just two of us eating) and used Splenda instead of sugar. Then, I added much more garlic powder because I love garlic and a splash of fresh lemon juice. This was delicious on a BLTA salad I made and I won't be buying the store-bought dressing again!

I have made this dressing over and over again and it is the best blue cheese dressing my husband and I have ever had!!  We want to just eat it by the bowlful!  I do not make any changes.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an amazing blue cheese dressing with no additives, real ingredients and incredible flavor.

I will definitely make this again. I love funky tangy blue cheese dressing so this is missing just a little something for me, but it is delicious regardless. I'll experiment, but this is a great base!

Excellent blue cheese...will never buy another from the store.  I used heavy whipping cream instead of buttermilk and added extra garlic and no salt.  This stuff is amazing!!

I made this recipe to put over iceberg lettuce wedges.
I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only change I made was to add fresh crushed garlic instead of powder.  It was delicious and I believe the white wine vinegar with its clean, crisp taste is what really makes it.  My husband actually added more to his wedge and he is not a dressing guy.  Thank you!

I’ve made this now several times, it’s excellent as is, but if you want to kick it up a notch add some fresh or dried dill, let sit overnight in fridge.... can’t be beat, thank you!!

Consistency is WAY OFF. Add twice the mayo to sour cream if you're going to use white vinegar, which I would suggest. Bland, at best. I would suggest a small amount of garlic powder and some salt.

I couldn’t justify spending $6 for a manufactured blue cheese dressing when we rarely consume all the dressing before the expiry date  (despite all the additives).   All recipes came through again!   This recipe is simple, easy and tasty thank you for sharing.  Also I really appreciate the ability to easily adjust the serving size to accommodate changes in the amount I ‘d like to make.  Such a cool feature... no more waste.

Too sweet - not tangy enough. Definitely needs more Bleu cheese or more vinegar. Next time I'll use less sugar.

Instead of adding the sugar I used rice wine vinegar (since it is sweet)  in place of white wine vinegar. Nice.

Made as-is, I have to give it three stars.  There was just something that was missing flavor-wise.  So, I reviewed the ingredients from several different blue cheese dressing recipes and combined a few things here and there.  After that, it was delicious!  Everyone that has tasted the modified version asks for the recipe.  Great for salads and wings!  I've  even used it as a chip and veggie dip!  With the modifications, I now have a keeper recipe that I've made multiple times.  Thanks for the base recipe.

Made it exactly as written and it was the best blue cheese dressing I’ve ever had! I had to make a second batch because my non-salad eating son wanted a third helping. Thank you for an awesome, and easy, recipe.

I’ve been making this for years, it’s excellent. I do make a few adjustments. Reduce the amount of vinegar and add cayenne pepper to taste and a few dashes of Worcestershire.

This dressing is awesome.  I used 1 t. Vinegar and 1 t. White wine since I had no white wine vinegar.  It tasted great when made and only got better in the fridge.

This is very good. We love garlic, and added a bit minced garlic to give it a more garlic flavor. Thanks!

This is absolutely delicious. I didn't have white wine vinegar so used apple cider, only about half the recommended amount. Mashed the bleu cheese and ingredients per the directions, then put chunks in it before refrigerating. Fantastic.

The blue cheese I used was a little sweet, so I left the sugar out.  It was perfect. I suggest adding the sugar to taste at the end.

Simple yet incredibly delicious.  This recipe lives up to its name.  Make the night before serving to allow the flavours to fuse while in the fridge.  Will make again.

Great recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I mixed milk with plain vinegar and a little white wine and let it thicken. Then I mashed in blue cheese followed by approx  3 tbsp mayo and sour cream. No need to measure ingredients. Then salt ,pepper,  garlic powder.I forgot to add sugar, probably doesnt matter. Let it chill for about 30 mins. Absolutely delicious!

This dressing is  chunky, rich, creamy, tangy PERFECTION.  I have made it several times now and don't see the point of trying any other recipe.  I use 2% fat Greek Yogurt and Reduced fat Mayo and it is still divine.  I can only imagine how good it would be with the original ingredients.  I add a bit less sugar and a bit more garlic powder.   A few splashes of Worscestershire sauce never hurts either.

When I was a kid,  thought my mom made the BEST bleu cheese dressing and rye bread I have ever eaten.  I found her bread recipe, but, unfortunately she developed dementia and did not have the dressing recipe written down.  She gave me a general idea of what was in it but no specifics.  This recipe just about nails it.  I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar and didn't have any garlic powder on hand.  However, for me it didn't make that much difference.  This is close enough to bring back those delicious memories.

Good!  Adjusted to make 8 servings and accidentally added an extra Tbs. of mayo.  No biggie.  Next time will add a small amount of minced shallots.  A restaurant I go to does that and its really good.  I used fresh ground pepper but next time will crack my own peppercorns in order to get a larger grind of pepper.  Restaurant also does that.  Can't wait to make again with these modifications.  Probably will add a little more cheese too.  Yum, more cheese.  Next day update:  Dressing got really thick after a day so thinned with 1/3 c. buttermilk and added a pinch of sugar and pepper.  Perfect!

I leave out the sugar and add the vinegar to whole milk (to make buttermilk). I've tried many blue cheese dressing, but this is my fave! Creamy and not a big mayo presence.

Made this in a single hole batch the first time. Big mistake... Why have so little of something that's so good! Next time, I tripled it across the board. Really, really good. Somewhat dependent on your blue cheese of course, but even generic-ish Alouette tasted fantastic. Tracking down Maytag for next batch.

Very good just the way it is , but if you like a little bit of a kick to your dressing try adding an 1/8 t horseradish sauce and a sprinkle of black pepper.

Not a bad tasting recipe, but if it sits in the refrigerator for 45 minutes while the wings cook it's somewhat runny. Followed the directions but think it would be better as a salad dressing.

Oh my!!! Wow! Wow! Wow! This is great! I tripled the recipe (18 servings), and using the suggestions from a couple other bleu cheese recipes (Bob's and Bill's), I made the following changes: I made buttermilk using 1/2 C. plus 1 T. heavy whipping cream and added 3/4 T. lemon juice - let sit for 10 minutes. This looked so thick, so I added a little half n half. (Can you tell we are on a low-carb diet?) 
Then I added 1/2 C. plus 1 T. sour cream, 
1/4 C. plus 2 T. Mayonnaise, 
reduced the white wine vinegar to 1&1/2 tsp, and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 
salt and fresh ground pepper, 
3 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, and 
3/4 tsp. dry mustard. 
(I did not add any sugar. It doesn't need it.)
I actually think it is divine right away, but if you are weary of mayonnaise at all, then wait overnight (or at least  6 hours) for the flavors to merge fully together. Most of this recipe is as written, I just wrote it all out because it's so hard to flip from a review back to the main recipe. Enjoy! You will love it!

This is a great recipe. I eat low FODMAP and omitted the garlic but made my mayo with garlic infused olive oil. I also omitted the sugar because I didn't see the point. It was too runny at first, but firmed up after sitting in the fridge for a few days. My friend took some

I used organic lite safflower mayo, organic fat free sour cream and a tad more Braggs apple cider vinegar. Full fat cultured buttermilk.   Maytag Blue Cheese for sure.  It's a winner for me.

I made this to go with our chicken wings last night...oh wow!! Absolutely the best blue cheese dressing ever! My husband loved it, kept saying how good this tastes...so rich and creamy. This will be a must have in our fridge. I left out the sugar, that's the only change I made.

I have made this a few times with excellent results. I now quadruple the recipe by default. The Only thing I do differently is to add a touch of cayenne pepper. That is the New Orleans in meI do think you are better off making this dressing the day before and letting it sit in the frig overnight. It will thicken up a little (which I love) and the flavor really seems to come together.

So good!!! I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly. I added in 1/4 tsp salt (for double recipe) and it was perfect. I will make this again and again! So much better than any dressing I can find at the store! My only problem is my husband will probably eat it faster than I can make it! Haha

Great recipe - will never use store-bought blue cheese dressing. You may want to add 1T milk to thin leftovers - if there are any.  Delicious!

Excellent as is! But in my unrelenting search for more bleu cheese flavor, I added  2t Worcestershire sauce,
1/2t of garlic powder, 1/8t cayenne, 2 more ounces of bleu cheese and eliminated the sugar. Outstanding
results! FYI: I never seem to have buttermilk on hand, so I get a quart and pour 1/2c into each slot of a 12 slot cupcake tin and freeze. When frozen, take out the "muffins" and place them in a freezer bag until you need it.

Loved it! I wanted an alternative to the oil based ones you get at the grocery store. I didn't have buttermilk but combined 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tbsp white vinegar, let it sit for 5 minutes then measured out what I needed in place of the buttermilk. We are making it again tonight.

I made it in two small batches- I eyeballed the blue cheese amount,  added a few drops of worcestershire sauce, and subbed milk and drops of lemon juice into milk for the buttermilk.   Tried it without sugar and with a bit of real garlic, and it was delicious.  You can adjust the cheese to taste of course, and I can tell using buttermilk as the recipe calls for would make it outstanding.

I am a Bob's big boy blue cheese fanatic  which I usually find at Albertson's in the cold section vegetable aisle . I stopped at a store that didn't carry Bob's big boy blue cheese and decided to take a crack at making it   Myself .  I love all recipes.com so much for all the different dishes that I have made from their recipes that I don't even look anywhere further than all recipes.com. First of all to make this blue cheese dressing it is not inexpensive  about $15 or better and that's if you have the seasonings to complete it at home.  I was very optimistic and looking forward to tasting the best blue cheese  dressing  I have ever had in my life  and was found left wanting.  It was not terrible it just did not even come close to my Bob's big boy blue cheese dressing that I find at Albertson's at $4.00  a jar I've never tasted anything better .

Delicious! Made it with gorgonzola and added a little extra garlic and think it could use a little bit more. But, this is quick, easy and yummy.

I love blue cheese dressing , but I don't buy it very often, and if I do , it's Marie's blue  cheese only!! Every time I get an order of wings or a nice salad, I look forward to Blue Cheese dressing, and almost EVERYTIME I'm so disappointed!!! Never thought about making my own until I stumbled across this Jem!!! Ugh, SOOOOO GOOD!! I made some let it set overnight,,,, and brought to my girly day card games, it didn't last long!!!! Everyone wants your recipe! Not sure I'm gonna give it to them ;-)) thanks!!!

absolutely the best blue cheese dressing and I made it in under 2 minutes for dinner tonight.  I never have buttermilk so I just add a little more vinegar and let the dressing sit in the fridge while I'm making the remaining food.  Such amazing flavor and the longer it sits the better it tastes.

So my husband came home from work the other day raving about how amazing the blue cheese dressing is at the restaurant by his work...and how that's the reason he's been paying to eat out every day.So expensive.  I said I could do better.  Thanks to this recipe I totally did.  I've been asked to keep a gallon of this stuff in the fridge at all times.  While that may be overkill, I'll definitely be making this often.  I doubled the vinegar and used a good amount of black pepper.  Rather than mashing the blue cheese I whisked together all of the other ingredients, diced the blue cheese into 1/2" chunks because we like it super chunky, and gently folded all of the blue cheese into the dressing mixture.  Great recipe!

This blue cheese was amazing. I did make a few changes, however. First, I used plain white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I also added about a teaspoon more buttermilk and sour cream than what was called for. I also added in only a tiny pinch of sugar. I did not add any salt because blue cheese is naturally salty. I also did not add pepper into the dressing, only on top of the salad so it tasted fresh. I don't think that there is any wrong answer here. Lastly, but I feel most importantly, I added all the ingredients to my blender and pulsed until it was to the desired consistency. I ended up with a chunky and thick blue cheese dressing.

This recipe is true to its name!!!!! 

My husband is diabetic so I'm careful with extra sugar so I tasted it before I added the sugar and it is PERFECT!!!!! So I did NOT add sugar or any other sweetener. 

Also, I doubled the recipe, but only used 3 t vinegar instead of 4 (that was called for in doubling). 

Oh and I used 5 oz blue cheese (that was the size of the container it came in) in the recipe. 

Yuuuum!  Will DEFINILEY make again..... Soon!!!

This recipe is very good as is...good for about 3-4 people! Very delicious! EDIT: I have made this recipe many times. I add a pinch of celery seeds and either a pinch of dried parsley or dried chives. It definitely makes it even better even though it is no major change to the recipe. Always try to make this ahead and let it set in the fridge so flavors develop.

Definitely one of the better Blue Cheese Dressing Recipes I have made. I have made the recipe as stated and I have made it with come changes w/out effecting the flavor. The changes: low fat buttermilk, low fat mayo and greek yogurt in place of sour cream. It is best made the day before. This is a really thick Dressing. Add more Buttermilk if looking for a thinner dressing.

I made this last night and it was ok. I'll probably make it again and just tweak it to my liking. Just a side note...Dale said that this recipe has been plagiarized because the exact same recipe is on another site and was posted 5 years ago. The first review for the recipe on THIS site was in 2004 which is 9 years ago. So this one was posted first. It very well could be the same person posting it on both sites. It is allowed.

I made this for a wedge salad.  I made a few changes, such as canola mayonnaise instead of regular, and reduced fat sour cream.  I also used a high quality Gorgonzola cheese for the bleu cheese, since I'm a cheese nut.  Absolutely delicious.  BTW, my husband loved it, too, and he's not much of a cheese person.

This is wonderful. The only change I made was to use fresh garlic, put through a garlic press, instead of garlic powder. I have always preferred blue cheese vinaigrette dressing, but the man in the house likes creamy, so I made this for him. I might have to switch. (Dressing, not men.)

This is exactly like the Cook's Illustrated recipe and its the best!  I also lighten it by replacing the sour cream with Greek Yogurt and add half of a minced shallot.

I liked it. Good blue cheese flavor. Neither too thick or thin.  Next time I would mix the dressing ingredients first, and then combine the crumbles since my dressing actually turned "blue", which wasn't really appetizing to look at, but tasted just fine. Not sure if it's "the best" but very good if you like blue cheese.

This is a good recipe for blue cheese dressing.  The next day it will be a little runny, probably because people dipped wet vegis in it but it is still very good.

SO GOOD!  I followed exactly the first time and it was a tiny bit too sweet.  Second time I cut down on the sugar by just a tad and perfect.  It's a great recipe, just may need adjustment according to your taste.  YUM!

We thought this was quite good, much better than bottled. I used Saga blue cheese and doubled the recipe. I only used one tablespoon of the vinegar and a sprinkle of garlic powder. A dash of salt and pepper and made a day ahead of time. Nice reviews from friends. Thanks.

The first time I had no buttermilk nor white wine vinegar so I substituted half and half and white vinegar.  The second time I made as directed.  Both were fantastic.  Make a day ahead- gets better overnight.  Double the recipe to fill a pint jar you have laying around.

Everyone raved that this was the best blue cheese dressing they had ever had.  I served it on a simple salad of torn romaine and grape tomatoes.  Delish!

This dressing was great.  I had to improvise on the receipe a little due to lack of available ingredients.  I only had red wine vinegar, so i used a dash of that instead. I eliminated the sugar completley and I used garlic salt (no powder available) and pepper.  It tasted absolutley delicious.

It's good. I thought it had a little too much sour cream taste to it, so I had to adjust the other ingredients. For me, this was a great place to start!

Simply the BEST!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used whole milk and it was delicious.  I will try buttermilk next time.  So yummy I make it twice already this week.

Now that is how you make some blue cheese.  I added a little more blue cheese crumbles.

What a fabulous and yummy recipe.  I followed the recipe to a "T", ok well almost.  I used low fat sour cream, nonfat buttermilk, and low fat mayo.  This will definitely help cut down on the fat grams and calories and the best part is you can't even tell the difference.  From now on, this will be the only blue cheese I will use.  Goodbye store bought dressings.

This is fantastic. I just added a bit more garlic. It was easy to make not too thick and tastes great.

This was great! I made it exactly as the recipe states and used Duke's mayonaise for the mayo. It is a Southern girls best mayo. Thanks~

I made this dressing this morning and took it to work(that is how easy it is to make) and my co-workers and myself ate it with crackers.  YUM!!  I will definately make again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I followed this recipe a little and also  another recipe posted on AllRecipes (I think it was called Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing). Between them both I think we got the best blend between too thin/runny and too thick. I substituted white cooking wine for the white wine vinegar because that's all I had, and it turned out just fine. I also used 2 percent milk instead of buttermilk. Very good!

YUMYUMYUM!!! I doubled recipe, however, I used 1/3 cup of mayo, buttermilk & instead of sour cream I used Greek yogurt. Added a bit more garlic and used Splenda for the sugar. Outstanding!

Perfection! I used fat-free sourcream and low fat mayo, I also used fresh garlic. Nice flavour and great consistency. I will definitely make this again as it tastes soo good and is soo easy. I will add more bleu cheese as I only had a little bit.

This is a tasty and easy to make blue cheese dressing recipe.

After having made this dressing my personal preference is the sour cream/mayo type.  I wanted to try something different which is why I tried this recipe.  My guests and husband enjoyed it very much.
