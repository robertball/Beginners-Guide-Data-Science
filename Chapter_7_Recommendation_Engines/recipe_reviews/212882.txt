I really loved this. The only changes I made were to use a very large onion, and the addition of 2 Tbsps ground cashew and 1 tsp. ground black sesame seeds. I think it would have been just as good without these changes. I'd rate it more than 5 stars if I could!

More curry powder and some vegetable broth makes this recipe saucy and great with rice.  I like it with garlic naan and sriracha, which is not very traditional but yummy.

OK, seriously amazing. I love this dish anyway, but the idea of microwaving the potatoes and cauliflower to cut cooking time...brilliant. I sorta merged two versions of this recipe...an old cookbook which had a bunch of spices and traditional cooking methods and this recipe which had modern versions and methods in it. Kept the tomatoes (awesome), used the microwave for the potatoes and cauliflower (brilliant), eliminated the oil (cooking spray), used real ginger and garlic (tsp each), no curry powder as I hate it (sub garam masala for pure awesomeness). Amazingly, this does not include turmeric or cumin (~1/2 tsp each), which I consider crucial (very earthy) but in a pinch the recipe is sufficient as is. I have tried paneer, carrots, chicken, and sweet potatoes for this recipe (dependent on what I have on-hand), all amazing in their own right. If you like a creamier gravy add equal parts milk or cream + broth to the sauce at the end. simmer until thickened. Serves well with chopped cilantro, mango chutney and/or yogurt.

I didn't have cumin seeds so I used a heaping 1/4 tsp of ground cumin. And as others stated, I added 1/3 cup of stock (could use either vegetable or chicken) because I predicted it might be too dry without. It was the perfect moistness!

The taste isn't bad, but it is a bit bland. I would have liked it to be saucier - this dish is really just curry flavored steamed vegetables. Maybe better as a side dish than a main course.

Great recipe! 

Modifications I made: cooked the veggies in vegetable broth rather than in the microwave, doubled the cumin & curry powder, added ground red pepper. Yum yum yum.

absolutely delicious! It tastes like a curry dish I picked up in an outdoor market in London. I followed other suggestions adding peas and baking the cauliflower and starch instead of microwaving. Also, I use whatever starch or tubber I have on hand, be it potatoes, rutabaga or turnips. I serve it with Greek yogurt like I ate it in the market and it is perfection. Yum!

Okay. This was great! I used 1 can Rotelle tomatoes (hot) instead of fresh. Chopp d up two onions, and used red potatoes. I went heavy with the curry powder and I grew in some dried  cilantro, black pepper, and chili powder. Can you tell we are a spicy-loving family? This was excellent.

I like this recipe quite a bit.  I, like many of the other reviewers, don't microwave cooking much, so, I first roasted the potatoes and cauliflower for 25 min at 475 F instead and it worked out very well. I added peas, too. If you want this dish saucy, I suggest using canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh.  This way,you  can adjust sauciness to your liking by varying qty of tomato. I used about 1/2 of a large 28 oz can and it came out great.  As others reported, Veg broth would probably work, as well, but, I didn't have any. I also suggest that you double the amount of curry powder that vburrito's published recipe calls for. Bob Appetit!

I read the reviews prior to making this dish, and added garlic to the sauted onion.The cauliflower ended up on the mushy side and the dominant flavor was from the tomatoes. Next time I'll increase the curry,and add black or crushed re pepper to give a bump to the seasonings. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

We both love Indian food. I prefer vegetarian dishes, so this was a perfect dish for me. My husband eats meat, so I added cooked chicken pieces to his share. I also added a cup of peas and served it with Basmati rice.

This recipe is very good. I agree with other reviewers - steam cauliflower, boil potatoes to firm cooked conditions, and the combine all in one large pan. I also added a pack of sweet peas, steamed, and chopped cilantro in the end. Garnish with cilantro leaves. Do not overcook or it will be mushy. Except onions you cooked in the beginning, all ingredients should have their own texture.  I made it many times received great feedback every time

I saute the curry just after the cumin.  Doing so activates the full flavor of the spice. I take the long way and steam the cauli and potatoes. I also add peas near the end.

I thought this turned out great! I made a few amendments though... Like other reviewers, I prefer not to cook in the microwave if possible. And since I don't have a steamer, I couldn't steam the veggies. Instead, I boiled the cauliflower in chicken stock for 12 minutes, then removed them from the water. Then I boiled the potatoes in the same broth for about 20-25 minutes (until they were soft-ish). Then cooked it all together. I like it spicy, so I added 1 teaspoon of garam masala and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It turned out so delicious! Thank you!

Great recipe. I microwaved the cauliflower and potatoes but will probably bake them next time. I used canned diced tomatoes and this worked real well. I'll probably use a cup of peas next time as well.

I used the same ingredients, but a different method. In a Dutch oven on the stovetop I softened the onions in the oil, added the spices, then the tomatoes. Next I added the potatoes and baked in oven @ 350 F for 40 min. Then I added the cauliflower and baked it another 30 min. It takes more time but uses less dishes. Turned out great. Coconut oil makes a good swap for the olive oil too.

I'll certainly make it again.  The flavors were excellent.  I thought there was too much  potato and too little tomato, so I'll change the ratio next time; and I followed the recipe for microwaving the potatoes, and they came out  raw.

Why is this dish not labeled VEGAN? I see nothing in it that would not make it Vegan instead of Vegetarian. Delicious

This recipe was wonderful as is. If it gets a little dry, I would just add a little chicken broth. I did add 1/2 tsp. more curry powder, but otherwise I made as is. Very tasty.

Great recipe. The microwave idea worked very well. I added some clove ... just a tad bit. And a couple of shakes of cinnamon. Learned that from my favorite Indian restaurant. Would also like to know how to make it with a gravy. Probably need to stew the potatoes, first. I'll try that.

One of my favorite Indian dishes. I omitted the tomato (for our picky 6 year old). Added turmeric, coriander, garam masala, and a pinch of paprika. I served it with a small dollop of plain yogurt on top.

I made it according to the recipe at first, and it was dry and flavorless. I ended up tripling the amount of spices, adding 1 cup of water (may need less at sea level), added peas and increased the number of tomatoes. It also ended up being 8-10 servings, not 6. Perhaps, it was intended to use smaller potatoes, but the recipe had no indication of potato type, weight, or volume.

There are many other Cauliflower and Potato Curry recipes on this site that don't need extensive modification. Use one of those, and steer clear of this one.

I used the ingredient list to make a non-microwave recipe of this dish and it was OK.  Don't use this exact recipe if you plan to prepare on the stove top; the recipe needs some adaptations (but I haven't worked out what yet!)
