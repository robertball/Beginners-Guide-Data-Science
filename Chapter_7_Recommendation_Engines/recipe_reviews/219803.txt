I've made this recipe a few times and my family loves it.  The only thing I would say keeps it from getting 5 stars is it is very salty...without adding any salt.  I serve this dish over egg noodles with a side of Normandy style veggies.  YUM!

I make this recipe often and my family loves it! I mostly serve it with noodles, but it's great over rice, too! Pretty rich, but fabulous! It's good even without the mushroom pieces as well.

There are 4 hungry Man/Boys (ages 17-22) at my table inhaling this. I asked; "How many stars?" They said; "Ten!"  I would give this a 4 - kinda reminds me of cafeteria food. Not my thing. The man/boys are happy! I cooked this with 3 large frozen chicken breasts & knew I would be gone all day at work. It got 7 hours in the crock pot on low & I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it because it started out frozen. Added almost 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes & some black pepper because that is our thing. It tastes good - I would tweak it with veggies & onions next time. Good base! Thanks!

I found this recipe on here and have been making it for over a year now. It has become a staple in my household. It's one of the few things all my kids and I enjoy. Over time I have found that when I take the chicken out of the slow cooker to cut up I can add the cream cheese (cut into 6 or 8 smaller pieces) and the soup to the hot Italian mix and just whisk by hand right in the slow cooker. This saves me from dragging out the mixer. I then add frozen peas, the cubed chicken and a little seasoning. I let it warm up about another 30 minutes. It's really wonderful over rice. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this before and would have only given it 2 stars BUT I did the following the second time around and made it a 5 star winner: Sear 1.5-2 pounds of chicken thighs in olive oil, salt pepper and garlic powder on both sides, remove from skillet and cut into chunks. Add to slow cooker and cook as directed. Use one small box baby bella sliced mushrooms instead of canned, sauteed in olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic with 1/2 cup diced onion until soft (5-7 min).  Set aside. Proceed with recipe as directed, adding the mushrooms after adding the cream cheese mixture (don't beat the mushrooms). WOW!!  This was spectacular!  Solved the very bland taste I got the first time.

I have actually made this recipe once before and neither my husband nor I really liked it. However, I decided to make it again with some modifications and it turned out quite nice. I used a can of Progresso vegtable classics creamy mushroom soup, 1/3 of the cream cheese (as the first time it was unbearable), added some onion powder, parsley, fresh black pepper, and a little parm on top. I used two frozen chicken breasts and just watched it. I served it over egg noodles and some boiled potatoes.

Sour cream would probably make it more like a stroganoff. I prefer the flavor of cream cheese.  The picture posted is not one I put there. I use linguini noodles.

This is my new favorite recipe. Everyone loved it. I didn't add the mushrooms and next time I'll double the cream cheese and soup to make more sauce to pour over the noodles. Divine!

I have made this many times and it is always a huge hit with everyone! So easy and so cheap! I also have tried fat free condensed soup and low fat cream cheese and you can't tell the different. I serve over rice and it has never been too salty for my family. This is a recipe I make at least twice. A month. My husband always gets excited when I tell him it's for dinner

I make this recipe close to once a month. I love that it is simple to make - little work and few ingredients is a big plus for me! And it is very tasty! It is a bit rich, but I have never done anything to thin the sauce because we like it just the way it is. I will note though that my kids don't like mushrooms; so we use cream of chicken soup and omit the mushrooms.

Very tasty. Of course I made a few adjustments. I had leftover baked chicken breasts. I used my instant pot pressure cooker. I put in the breasts, cream cheese, cream of mushroom soup, chicken broth, dry ranch seasoning and cooked on high pressure for 30 mins and let it natural release the steam. I then added a can of cheddar soup and stored that in and shredded the chicken in the pot. Very good. The teen critic gave it five stars. Definitely a do over.

I’ve made this a few times and it was always just ok....until the last time I made it.  I added the juices from crockpot in with the cream cheese, soup and mushrooms (we like a lot of mushrooms so I use a larger can) when I was mixing it...it made it SO much better and creamier.  I always serve this over egg noddles and then just make a veggie as a side.  WE LOVE IT!

This recipe was very good and easy. I did not use the entire packet of seasoning so it was lower sodium and I didn't have mushrooms but I bet the added mushrooms would have made it that much better.

We were expecting better, it was WAY too rich for our taste, could have done without the cream cheese. I have made two other recipes that are very similar in the crock that I like a lot more. (Ranch Pork Chops and Easy Chicken) Basically the same recipe minus the cream cheese and switch the Italian packet with a Ranch packet...
