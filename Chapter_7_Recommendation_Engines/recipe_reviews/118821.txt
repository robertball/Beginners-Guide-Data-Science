I gave this a four star rating only because my kids loved them . My husband and I did not like them all too much. To me it tasted like an oatmeal raisen, without the raisens. I will say that the shape of the finished product is perfect. The ease of the recipe is also a plus- just too bad the flavor wasn't better.

I used all butter because that was what I had on hand, half white sugar/half brown, omitted the cinnamon and added a half cup of chocolate chips. The Snickers were great, next time I think I'll double the amount called for and add some chopped peanuts next time. This would be an excellent way to get rid of Halloween candy. Because of the caramel in the Snickers, these cookies are quite a pain to get off the baking sheet. To save the hassle, use Silpat inserts or parchment paper when you bake these. EDIT: Next time, chill the dough for a few hours.

I liked the idea of using snickers and oatmeal, but they were dry and not very tasty. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Possibly using butter and applesauce might make them more chewy & moist?

hubby loved these. i accidentally doubled the cinnamon (oops!) but thought that it gave them great flavor.  i'm not a snickers fanatic like he is, but thought these were pretty good.  nice for something different. evenyone at our holiday gatherings would hear what they were and say "hmm! sounds different" try one, and say they were yummy.  thanks!

These were tasty, and my friends loved them! I left out the oats and thought they turned out just fine. The caramel is the strongest flavor, and  I wish you could taste more chocolate, but I made these in a pinch - I had baking ingredients and snickers bars, and it worked!

These cookies turned out yummy, but I did need to change a few things.  I followed all the directions up to the point of adding in the oatmeal & candy bars.  The dough was very crumbly and to dry to spoon, so I added another egg (maybe my first egg was too small?). Then I added the oatmeal and snickers and (because of other reviews) I also added 1/2 cup chopped peanuts and 1 cup chocolate chips.  Also, I used parchment paper which was a necessity due to the caramel sticking. At 350 degrees, these took 12 minutes to cook.  They did flatten out quite a bit and are chewy (maybe because of the extra egg?).  But they do have great flavor and we all love them.  And, yes, it's a wonderful way to use up the Easter candy! :)

I made these for a church function and they were the first things to go. People raved about them, and I have to admit they were pretty awesome! I did tweak the recipe a tad. I added 1c choco chips, 1/2c crushed peanuts, 1/2c of carmel bits - all to enhance the Snickers. I used 1/2 bag of Snickers minis, and increased salt to 1/2 teaspoon.
