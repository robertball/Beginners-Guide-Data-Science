I liked the idea of such an easy dish, but I took the laziness a step further, when I make this (twice now and third time will be tonight), Just brown the meat and onion in a large pot, then drain and put it back in, add the rest of the ingredients and put a lid on it. 15 minutes later the cabbage is steamed, the rice is perfect and I just glop it in bowl with a dallop of sour cream. Must be the busy mom in me that gets so shortcutty! You can use chicken broth instead of beef.

This was really tasty!  I read through a ton of reviews and two things stood out -- the dish needs more seasoning and it can become mushy when cooked 1-1/2 hrs.  Taking that into consideration, I socked the seasoning to the meat/onion while it was browning -- salt & pepper, a lot of garlic, oregano and basil and a heavy dose of both red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  Also sprinkled some of all those things over the cabbage I'd chopped (I estimate 10-12 cups, fairly large head).  To avoid "mushy" cabbage, I gave the rice a head start -- added the tomato sauce & half the broth to the browned meat/onion, then stirred in the rice, turned the burner off and let it hang out for about 10-15 mins.  I tossed it all together in a large bowl, poured into lasagna dish (way too much for 9x13) and baked covered for 50 mins.  Excellent!  Rice cooked perfectly and cabbage, while softened, still had a slight crunch.  Try this one, and don't be afraid to add a LOT of seasonings! :)

I would like to say that if someone didn't like this receipe, that they did something wrong or they just don't like cabbage.  I love this recipe! I found this recipe about a year ago and I have fixed it probaly 10 times since then.  I usually fix it when we have company (because it makes so much)and everyone asks for a copy of the recipe.  I usually add more tomato sauce than it calls for and I use one medium head of cabbage no matter what it weighs.  I add more salt than it calls for and I add plenty of black pepper.  It taste just like moms stuffed cabbage without all the work.  Mom even says so!

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. It was so tasty I had to have a second helping. Like some of the others, I also cut the recipe in half, using 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 an onion, 1/2 a large head of cabbage, 1 can of beef broth (14 oz), 2 cans (8 oz) of tomato sauce and 1 cup of rice. The only extra seasoning I added was salt. I turned up the temperature to 400 and found it was done in an hour. I will definitely be making this again!

This casserole was easy to make and delicious.  I did add a variety of spices, as suggested in earlier reviews, including Worstechsire sauce, a dash of hot sauce, garlic and nutmeg and a little vinegar to draw out the tomatoes. I used ground turkey to reduce the fat, and, possibly due to using drier meat, needed to add another cup and a half of tomato sauce.  I served it to company and they kept going back for 'just another bite' well after we left the table and took a copy of the recipe home with them.  This recipe will make many appearances at my table.

I made this last night.  I added some garlic powder and some pepper to the meat while it was cooking.  I also cooked the onions with the meat.  Stirred the rice into the pot with the meat and onions.  In a large, deep, foil roasting pan, I put a layer of cabbage and covered that with the meat/rice mixture.  I poured a cup of beef broth over the top and then added the spaghetti sauce on top of everything.  Covered with foil, and baked for 45 minutes.  After 45 min, I took it out of the oven, stirred it all together and then turned the oven down to 225 because I had to go out for an hour.  When we came back and had a taste test, it was PERFECT.  My BF loves my cooking, but he had 2 servings for his taste test, took some for his lunch today and wants me to make it again on the weekend!  I haven't seem him rave like this in a long time.  Thank you Nancy!!

Like a real cabbage roll, this recipe tastes better as leftovers, when the flavours have blended.  I modified the recipe quantities quite a bit so that I wouldn't end up with 2 9x13 pans of the stuff.  I guess I didn't cut back enough - I had a 6qt slow cooker full!  I added more rice and broth (1.5 c rice, 3 c broth), some diced tomatoes (14 oz), and a dash of chili powder, as well.  If you're going to slow-cooker this, you'll need about 6 hours on high, minimum, to cook the cabbage (I used 3 hours to start, and we crunched our way through supper the first nite!).  This is excellent served with sour cream and/or a nippy cheddar sprinkled on top. Yummy!

This dish is fantastic.  I made it last night for my family and they truly enjoyed it.  Even my picky hubby liked it!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I used a lasagna pan andsprinkled on a little pepper and garlic powder before baking.  

I baked it for the first hour, covered with foil at 350F.  Then we had to go away!!! I turned the oven down to 250F and loosened the foil.  It was done to a T when we returned home.  

I served mashed potatoes and bread with this meal and everyone raved about it.  Daughter took the recipe home with her.

Makes a lot!!!  Great one-dish dinner with plenty left for lunches or another dinner.  This would be a good dish to take to a pot-luck supper, etc.

Hope you enjoy!

I took cyndib's advice and made the whole thing on the stovestop; worked like a charm!!!  After browning the beef in my large stock pot, I added the rest of the ingredients except the cabbage.  I brought it to a boil, reduced to a simmer, and put the cabbage on top of it all (didn't stir it).  Put the lid on and let everything simmer for 15 minutes; cabbage was nicely steamed and rice got cooked.  I halved the recipe since I only have a family of 3, and that was very easy to do.  Overall I really liked the flavor, though I did add plenty of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 1Tb of brown sugar (to cut the tomato acidity).  Nothing beats a homemade cabbage roll, but this was a good way to cheat :)

I used ground Turkey instead of ground beef for a healthier version.  I added garlic and sauted it with the meat and onion.  I also added paprika and oregano.  It was really good and tasted even better the next day.  This is a good, healthy way to incorporate cabbage in your diet, which is really good for you!

I decided to try this one again since I am usually very impressed with the recipes I try on this sight. I am an experienced cook and AGAIN tried this and folloed it and the cabbage was mushy and the flavors just weren't there. Needless to say, I will stick to REAL cabbage rolls since I have NEVER had a problem with them.

Used V8 juice in the place of tomato sauce. Added a clove of minced garlic.  Also used a bag of shredded cabbage as a shortcut.  Tasted great, will have again.  

Thanks !

Awesome, although I too made some changes! Boiled cabbage for 2 mins first, cooked brown rice ahead, added 6 oz of beef broth instead, and added more tomato sauce! Last time I made this, it took forever and the rice was still crunchy, so I made these changes, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD and alot quicker! Yummm! Oh, I also added some hot sauce and garlic..excellent flavors! I wanted to add that I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for a family of 5.

Great recipe but I have some tips for making it simpler.  First, instead of chopped cabbage, I buy a 1 pound bag of pre-made slaw in the produce section of my grocery store.  Next, my kids like tomato soup, so I substitute two cans of that with 1 can of water.  I brown the ground beef with onion, drain off fat. Place the slaw and rice in 13x9 pan - then the ground beef, then pour the soup mix over all. I cover it with foil to bake.

I loved this.  Easy to put together, I halved it since the full recipe was too much for 2 of us.  I seasoned my meat and then did not add salt and used 1/2 diced tomatoes and 1/2 tomatoe sauce cause my dad used to make cabbage rolls that had chunks of tomato in the sauce.  I also cooked it about 10 more minutes to make sure the cabbage was just right!  Thanks!

This is an ok weeknight meal.  Based on prior reviews, I halved the recipe and browned the beef w/the onion and some minced garlic.  After draining the meat mixture, I added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomatoe sauce, 1/2 cup brown rice, and about 3/4 of a head of cabbage to the same pot and simmered covered for about 20 minutes.  I'm not sure if the cabbage is "supposed" to be soft, but I like it w/a little "crunch" still, those this worked out well.  I also added a dash of Worchestershire sauce, a dash of garlic powder, & a dash of Italian seasonings for some flavor.  Served w/a dollop of fat-free sour cream and a sprinkle of 2% cheese.

I halved the meat, precooked the rice, add minced garlic to meat mixture, sprinkle with salt & pepper, used tomato juice (like my Mom used in regular cabbage rolls), steamed the cabbage leaves(devein center stem) for 1 or 2 minutes, and lastly added 1 can of-- sauerkraut (like my Mom did), rinsed and drained.  I think the sauerkraut really makes this taste like cabbage rolls I had for supper growing up in NJ.

This is a cheap (less than $10.00) and great recipe IF you like cabbage.  Note that this serves 12 so unless you want to freeze or throw away you might want to scale it to feed 6.  If you don't scale the recipe you will need two pans to bake in as all ingredients won't fit in one.  I used roasted garlic tomato sauce, beef broth w/ onion, and browned my beef with the onion instead of mixing it after. The only thing this recipe lacks is seasoning.  If you season properly you will be happy.  Vinegar, Worcestire sauce, garlic-onion-chili powder, cumin, and a dash of hot sauce are some suggestions.  Also, once you remove the cover I would suggest stirring frequently to avoid the cabbage getting dry and burning on the top layer. Many people mentioned their rice not cooking.  I poured in one bag of Uncle Ben's rice in a bag (1 cup even though I scaled the recipe) and my rice was completely cooked. Again, I scaled the recipe which could be why mine was cooked...I can't imagine throwing double all in one pan and thinking the rice would be done??

My husband doesnt really care for casseroles but will eat the whole pan of this one himself.  I always half the recipe as  this will fill 2 9x13 pans as is.  I also use tomato soup as my sauce I mix it in with the cabbage mixture and save a can to pour over the top.  Tastes just like my grandmothers.  Thanks.

I halfed the recipie and it made plenty to fill a 9x12 dish.  After only an hour it was done, I was worried the cabbage wouldn't cook like some reviews said but it was completely soft.  It could use a little more flavor, next time I will add chili powder to give it a boost.  I didn't think it had enough tomato sauce so I added a can of chopped tomatoes which was nice.  Will make again with my revisions!

This was good, but it needed a little kick. Cheese or some spice would have perked it up. It was good but I will experiment with it.

This recipe is excellent! I added a can of drained tomatoes, garlic, and italian seasoning. I would also recommend cutting this one in half. It makes a lot of food.

I can’t believe I have been making stuffed cabbage rolls for years and never thought of this, so much easier!!  It is exactly the same except all mixed together.  YUM

My modifications – sautéed the onion with the meat, garlic salt, onion powder, pinch Italian spices and Worcestershire sauce.  ½ to 6 servings for my needs.

My mother always made cabbage rolls when I was growing up.  We lived in a Polish town in Western Pennsylvania so cabbage rolls and pierogies are a family classic.  Anyway, I don't have the time to make cabbage rolls now that I'm married so I decided to try this recipe.  When I did, it just didn't taste right so I called my mom.  She says instead of the tomato sauce use spaghetti sauce and tomato juice.  So whatever amount the recipe calls for in tomato sauce, substitute that for half of each (i say whatever because i know most of us half this recipe).  It gives the sauce a little more flavor and reminds me of my mother's cabbage rolls.  This might help for those that said they didn't like the sauce.  I also cooked the rice and boiled the cabbage prior to baking and it turned out really well.

Excellent meal! I used 3 cheese blend tomato sauce and per other reviews, used an extra 14oz can.  I used the pre-packaged, pre-shredded cabbage (1 1/2 bags = appx 1.5lbs) and an extra 1/2 cup of rice.  This was sooo easy to make and very tasty! As my roommate said "this is an A+ meal"...thus a keeper in my book! Thanks Nancy.

With a few changes this is a delicious, easy way to make a casserole that tastes like stuffed cabbage rolls.  First, I pan fried the onions with 3-4 cloves of garlic, for extra flavor.  I added about 1/4 cup basalmic vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar(brown and white) to have the sweet and sour taste we like.  I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I added 1- 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno(optional).  I precooked the brown rice before adding it to the casserole for baking.  I baked it covered for 1- 1  1/2 hours so the cabbage was well cooked.

I am a fairly good cook. I use recipes from this site almost daily. This is the first and only one that my husband and I did NOT like at all. I followed the recipe exactly and was so looking forward to this dish. It was so bad, we threw it out and ordered pizza, which is a first for us!!! I will stick to the old fashion cabbage rolls that have NEVER failed me. This was a waste of food and money!!!!

One thing I love is a healthy, tasty and EASY meal. This is all that. So, I love it. And so did everyone else in my family, including my daughter who supposedly "hates" cabbage and wasn' even going to "taste" it! After one bite.. she wanted more. Her byfriend, also a cabbage hater, raved abouth this meal.   After three times of making this, the only note I have is: Don't use too much cabbage (unless you actually want it to be the dominant flavor). I used more cabbage the last time, since it is hard to guage the "pounds" chopped, but I used too much cabbage, and my hubby commented on the cabbagey-flavor.   As the recipe is written, it is awesome. Delicious. The flavors are well and equally balanced. Next time, I won't change a thing.

this was so good, I thought I'd have left overs....nope, the family ate it all! I read the suggestions of others and decided to use italian sausage (1/2 italian and 1/2 hot pork sausage) for flavor.  I used 1 medium head of cabbage that I ran through my food processor on shred.  I added the suggested seasonings of others.  I used brown rice instead of the white and cooked for an extra 20  minutes because of the brown rice.  I served with mash potatoes- this is a keeper!!

My whole family loved it.  I made it with ground turkey.  I also added a little garlic powder, extra onion, and some mrs. dashes spices.  It was very good,  just needed some more seasoning of some type to give it more "BAM".  I'll make again and try some more seasoning.  Another reviewer mention Prego sauce, that does sound like a good option.  Watch out, this recipe does make a lot!

This is the best casserole in the world! As always I can't leave any recipe alone so I added fresh garlic, fresh pepper and worsetchier sauce. I also use the italian flavored stewed tomatoes. Umm Umm Umm my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I have made this over n over again and even my cabbage haters LOVE this!

This is so bland! The little bit of salt that the recipe calls for is not nearly enough seasoning. It needs garlic and pepper, and possibly paprika and oregano. I would also use about half the cabbage and twice the rice. If I make this again, it will be with so many alterations that it almost won't be the same recipe.

I despise cooked cabbage, but we received our second head of cabbage through our CSA this week and last week's coleslaw was still hanging around, so I thought we'd try this. It was great!  Even my picky kids liked it!  I did as an earlier reviewer did and just put it all in a pot on the stove for 15 minutes after I browned the beef and it was perfect! We will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  It's actually one that's been in my family for 30 years...real comfort food for me.  I only gave this one 4 stars because I think as is, it's a little lacking.  I add garlic, pepper, some italian seasoning and I only use 1 lb of beef for a cassarole this size.  I am taking the time to review mainly because I followed another busy mom's suggestion and fried the beef, added the rice and seasonings then after 20 min or so added the cabbage and cooked it all together on the stove for 30 min on med.  I'd always layered the cabbage and meat mixture and baked it but saving a step made it even easier, quicker AND was just as good!

This casserole came out great even though I had to make substitutions. I was out of tomato sauce, so I subbed two cans of tomato soup and 1 small can of tomato paste. All out of onions too, so I used dried onions and some onion powder. Only 1 lb. of ground beef, oh well, used what I had. In other words, this is a great recipe for those times when you didn't get out to the grocery store :) I know substitutions offend some of you, but hey, isn't that what being a good, creative cook is all about? Anyway, Nancy, thanks for submitting this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!

I thought this recipe was the greatest.  Never will I prepare the usual cabbage rolls.  This was much less time consuming and was wondering.  I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I substituted ketchup.  It worked very well.  And for a little extra flavor I browned my ground beef with a little onion powder, black pepper, and worchestershire sauce.  This recipe is definitely a WINNER with my family!!!

I'm not a big fan of cabbage unless it's in coleslaw or in the form of sauerkraut, but this was really good. I cut the recipe in half, I used ground turkey instead of beef, and cooked the meat with a clove of garlic, salt and pepper. I also put a little cheese on top at the end up baking time and let it melt in the oven. The rice turned out perfect, the cabbage was cooked well - -  my husband loved this, and we will be making it again, especially since it's low fat with the turkey!

I make this a few times a year since finding it. The hubby and the kids both love. We season ours up a bit as well. I also switch out ingredients as needed if my pantry is lacking. We have swapped diced tomatoes with basil and oregano for the sauce many times. I like to brown my beef with onion and minced garlic. And I'm super lazy with my stove, so it all goes in a crock except the rice. I cook that separate in broth and tomatoes and and add when we eat. Never had a problem with mushy cabbage, only with mushy rice IF cooking IN the crock pot. It's cooking again today. Kids can't wait for dinner. The aroma is driving them crazy. Thank you for such a easy fix to a long original. It's delicious!!

I have made this twice with some modifications and will be making it again tonight.
I brown the meat in a big pot with Adobo (Goya) seasoning and salt and pepper(to taste).  Once cooked and drained, in the same pot, I add the rice, cabbage and tomato sauce. I obmit the onion and in its place, I add a jar of sauerkraut.  I also pour in the juice of about 5-6 "fresh" squeezed limes (not lemons).  The limes is what makes this recipe.  Mix well and transfer it to the casserole dish and bake as specified.  This is a great recipe and it has been a hit with my family and it is one of my favorites.  My brothers and sister can't get enough of it.  Leftovers are fantastic.

I halfed the recipe.  And had to add way more sauce.  And even with the recipe halfed there was no way it was going to fit into the 9x13 dish that the recipe states the full amount will fit into.   So I used a 9x13 and a smaller 8xwhatever dish and froze the second for another night.  It wasn't fabulous but it wasn't that bad either.  I will make again.

Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what happened here. I read A LOT of reviews and nobody mentioned that this wouldn't fit in the pan. Recipe calls for 3 1/2 lb cabbage. I used 2 1/2 lb cabbage and it was to the rim before I even added the broth. I was able to get half of the broth in there. High maintenance dish. A lot of work removing, stirring, and trying to fit the rest of broth in there along the way. Long story short: took 2 1/4 hours to properly cook cabbage and rice. In addition to seasoning the ground beef with S&P while browning it, I added 3T lemon juice, 2T Worcestershire sauce, and 3T brown sugar to tomato sauce because that is how I make my cabbage rolls and was shocked that we had to add additional salt and pepper once it was plated.  But, I have to say, although it ended up being more work than making traditional cabbage rolls, we liked it better and will make it this way from now on, but in a bigger pan to eliminate the drama that it was:)

I've made this a few times now and it's always so yummy!  I recommend shredding or slicing the cabbage thinly and I think Napa cabbage, with it's lighter flavor, is a little better in this dish.  I've never used 2lbs of beef - generally no more than 1.5lbs.  Also, I've found it much easier to cook the onions and salt with the beef, then mix in the rice and most of the tomato sauce.  Layer the cabbage on the bottom of the baking dish and top with the beef mixture.  I then mix the remaining tomato sauce with one can of beef broth and pour it on top, followed by the 2nd can of broth.  Mix well after the first hour as directed -- the cabbage will have cooked down a lot so it's much easier.  Try it tonight!

I cut the recipe in half & cooked in a 9 X 9 casserole.  I also put this together ahead of time, so it sat in the fridge for several hours thus I could pop it in the oven when I got home; that might help with the undercooked rice issue. I substituted  pearl barley in place of the rice, because I though, hmmm, that might be a nice, healthy change, and it was very good. Added some (8 oz. can) tomato sauce to the broth and  used herbes de provence and garlic powder to kick up the flavor a bit. I also poured very hot water over my cabbage in a colander to help get the crunch out and save on cooking time. Cooked in a little over an hour.

This recipe when made entirely 'as is' is not very good. However, my grandmother makes this wonderful dish called lazy man's cabbage rolls. It's essentially the same thing with tomato soup and a can of diced tomatoes with a 1/4 cup of vinegar...it is to die for!

This was really good.  I made it according to the recipe except that I used only one head of cabbage which is not 3.5 pounds.  Next time I will use more cabbage as the recipe says.  I was able to split the recipe in half, serving one dish one night and saving the other in the freezer for another day. I didn't even thaw the frozen one. I simply cooked it (same temp) for 1 hour, stirred, and cooked for another hour instead of the half hour.  THanks for  a great meal.

Being a bit lazy I purchased the preshredded cabbage from the produce section of the grocery store (you know- coleslaw mix) and used it instead of shredding my own cabbage.  Great and SUPER FAST that way!  (I also halved the recipe based on other reviews about large quantities.)  Thanks for an easy alternative!

I made this again and used ground turkey instead and it was not that great.  Stick with ground beef.

Perfectly delicious! Tasted just like my Polish Cabbage Rolls. So many people changed the recipe and it sounded good as is, so I pretty much made it as it's listed except cooked the onion with the beef (it didn't need oil), used a whole head of cabbage (I don't know how many pounds it was), used beef boullion instead of broth. I had only small 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce so used 4 but it was a little too much. Next time I'll use only 3. Also, I needed it cooked quicker than 1 1/2 hours so did as one reader suggested and cooked it on 400 degrees. It came out perfect, the rice and the cabbage! It doesn't need all the extra seasonings that so many were adding. Family loved it so I'll definitely be making again. Oh, and it made so much that I had to put it in a 11 x 15 pan. It's OK though, there's enough for dinner another night!

We love this dish! We brown the onions along with the meat, and also brown in 2T. minced garlic in with the meat. We also melt cheddar on top of it during the last 15 minutes of baking. My incredibly picky 2 year old, who we constantly struggle to keep weight on, eats this like it's going out of style! Bravo on a fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!

My kids love these even more than cabbage rolls!!  Works great for me because cabbage rolls are a lot of work.  This recipe is EASY. I throw everything in the crock pot on low and cook till done.  How much easier can it get?  Kids love it with a dollop of sour cream on top.

With more seasoning (nutmeg, red pepper, garlic, salt, pepper), this was amazing! I also did what others suggested and cooked in a large pot on the stove - no need for the oven.

I used ground turkey and brown rice to make this a little healthier. I did follow DiscoBunny's suggestions and started my rice earlier. Brown rice takes forever to cook! I did add more seasoning like oregano and parsley. Very tasty!

I altered the measurements and added some more seasonings based on what I had sitting around, and I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef. I also just made it in a big pot on the stove. Quick, easy, healthy, and hearty. Makes great leftovers, too!

This was incredible!  I was surprised by how much it made and was happy, thinking it would serve us for 2 days, but my husband and son kept eating more and more until there was just enough left for their lunches today.  I used 1/2 of a  large cabbage and they want to know if I will use the other 1/2 next week to make this again.

This tastes like my moms cabbage rolls.  I changed it a little by reducing the broth, doubling the sauce and I used more pepper, also I put 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork to change it up a bit.  Everyone loves this when I make it, simple and stick to your bones meal

This is a yummy recipe. I compensated for the blandness by using 1 lb of hamburger and 1 lb of Italian sausage. I also sauteed the onions with a chopped red pepper, then added the meat to brown. I used a medium to med.-large red cabbage (because we prefer red cabbage) and brown rice.  Mine boiled over in the oven so I would suggest you place a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan underneath while cooking. Everybody liked it at my house. Will make it again.

So quick and easy. Would definitely make this again and again. We love cabbage rolls but often don't have the time for all the work related to them. This is the perfect fix for that problem. The only things I added were some green pepper, a bit of celery salt and a layer of shredded marble cheese on top added just before serving. Yum!

YUM! I tend to make this in my slow cooker,browning the meat first, and mixing in everything else. Also works well with brown rice, upping the fiber a bit. This just about fills my 7qt Crockpot. I cook it on low all day, and the leftovers just get better and better until they are all gone!

This is a very good recipe, but unless your family likes their food bland, you'll want to doctor it up. If you don't halve the recipe, I recommend about a quarter cup of light brown sugar, a tablespoon or two of Worcestershire sauce, and maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice. Remember to let the casserole stand for several minutes after removal from the oven to allow the rest of the liquid to be absorbed.

Quick and easy dish, and makes sooo much!  I had 2 casserole dishes.  I did make some changes though, I added minced garlic and parsley flakes to ground beef as it was cooking, and I added about 1/2 pound of ground pork to the mixture.  I added tomato soup like the others had suggested, but it seemed dry, so I added Progresso tomato soup with pieces of tomato and it was fantastic, it was moist and remained moist.  I also used shredded coleslaw mix and a very small head of cabbage chopped, to give some added texture.  A great dish!  I grew up on Halupkies as
us Ukrainian's called them, but this is easier!  Will definately make again!

I enjoyed this very much, although I can't say it tasted quite like my grandmother's cabbage rolls.  I thought it had maybe a little too tomato - I might try the tomato soup as others suggested.  I would also omit the salt - beef broth has so much already that adding more seems unnecessary - I found it a bit salty.  Makes A LOT - I actually cooked it in two dishes because it seemed like way too much for one casserole dish.  I froze some and will look foraward to eating the leftovers!  Vey good, very easy, and fairly healthy - I wonder could you use brown rice to make it even healthier??

I thought this recipe sounded a bit bland so I spiced it up a bit.  I sauted the meat with a couple garlic cloves minced, worchester sauce, sprinkled quite a bit of garam masala (for a more ethnic flare) oregano, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
I used a can of tomato soup and a small can of tomato paste, instead of tomato sauce. and added more seasoning. garam masala, oregano, crushed garlic cloves. 
I could only fit about one small to medium head of cabbage (3.5 lbs never would have fit.)
I used brown rice, and added a spash of red wine vinegar after the broth.  This was very yummy!  This was the first recipe I have tried off this site, as I am a newlywed experimenting in the kitchen.  I will definatly make this again!  I combined other peoples tips and reviews and found it very hepful. I hope this will help make this more enjoyable!

This was a very tasty recipe. I have had weight loss surgery so finding recipes that I can eat sometimes is difficult. This recipe was both yummy and full filling. I would recommend it highly. I did microwave it for 20 minutes and then threw it into the oven on broil for 5 minutes and it turned out great!

Wow, some people can be mean!  I love this recipe, and will make it again.  Sure, I may modify it, add more seasoning, or tomato, but that is cooking.  Just look at the recipe.  Of course it would be bland to someone who is used to heavily seasoned food.  Add seasoning and make the recipe your own.  It is not difficult, and it is worth the effort for such a simple, speedy dish!  This goes in my "do again" file for sure!  Since I first tried it, I have passed the recipe on to many friends, too.  This is just a really, really good recipe.  In fact, I am making it again tonight!

I've always loved cabbage rolls, but never had the gumption to try to make them. This recipe left me no excuses!

I had a feeling it would be good...but didn't know it would be THAT good. My 10 year old son loved it as well (of course, I've got the only kid who loves cabbage and other leafy vegetables).

Would suggest using a seasoned tomato sauce, like spaghetti sauce. And raw cabbage really "expands" when you chop it up, so it actually took two casserole dishes.

This is going to be a family favorite!

Loved it why?First off I love stuffed cabbage and I was looking for tasty ground beef recipes to convert to ground chicken.I'm on a lower salt diet so ommited the salt.As for the can of tomato sauce I used no salt and added low salt petite diced tomatoes,as well as the broth.I knew by the other reviews it would need extra seasoning.I used pepper,garlic,and onion powder a bit of sugar and vinegar as another reviewer suggested.I found it tasted fresh and natural.

I made this last night, exactly as written.  I used a whole head of cabbage, and it make two 8 x 11 pans.  The only thing I added was a cup of chopped tomatoes, as with all the cabbage, it seemed a little light on tomato.  It was very good.  I cooked it exactly 1 hour and it was cooked perfectly.  I want to cook the second pan tonight and serve it with mashed potatoes, so I will probably add another can of tomato sauce and maybe another can of chopped potatoes so we have enough gravy for the potatoes.  This was an easy and tasty recipe that will go in my recipe box.  Thanks BUCHKO for sharing.

So much easier than doing the time-consuming stuffed cabbage.  I'm sure this is very good is as, but I wanted it to taste more like my "real" cabbage rolls, so I added some garlic powder and a bit of Worcestershire and A1 sauce.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.

As others have mentioned, I thought this needed a lot more seasoning.  I added salt, pepper, paprika, worchester sauce, lemon juice and brown sugar (all the seasonings I put in my cabbage rolls).  This is pure comfort food, could eat it every day!  Thanks for sharing!

WOW, This was fantastic and super easy. It does though make a lot. I used am 11 x 14 x 2-1/2 inch dish and only 3 lbs of cabbage (by accident) and it came to the top. I am going to recalculate it for 9 servings the next time. I did add a little oregano, granulated garlic. Not sure what difference it made but it turned out great.

We really liked this BUT....I cooked it for 2 hours and my cabbage was still a but crunchy.  I will make this again FOR SURE but will cook the cabbage a little before mixing it in.  I did also use an extra can of tomato sauce.

I like to cook up ground beef and freeze it for meals later in the week. I had some that I cooked with green bell peppers and that was a nice addition! This was easy and very good!

So delicious and so easy. Followed cyndib's advice and cooked it all in one pot. Added some paprika, black pepper and garlic for my personal tastes. Sour cream a must!

I love cabbage rolls, but hate dealing with those leaves.  What a great idea to chop the cabbage!  Made this last night and I did not use the oven.  Just browed the meat and onion, threw in all the other ingredients, covered and let it cook.  It was delicious and will probably taste even better today. Next time, I am going to try it in the crock pot.

It doesn't look very good, I am not sure how I would feel presenting it to company but, it sure tastes good!  My family was really skeptical but loved it.  To be fair, I made it in a Dutch oven as a one dish meal.  I used ground turkey, red and green cabbage (because I had it left over) and I used chicken broth because that was what I had.    I also added 1 tsp worschtershire sauce, lots of ground black pepper and 1/4 cup vinegar.

I made this for supper using two cans of stewed tomatoes and no rice. I gave my 7 year old granddaughter a taste of the broth, and I've caught her twice trying sneak another taste while we wait for Pawpaw to be ready to eat. I did it all on the stove top, and we're having cornbread with it.

any recipe that has to be changed so much to make it work doesn't deserve a good rating. It needs to be scaled down to fit in a pan this size, and spiced up!

Halved the recipe due to other reviews. Used ground turkey for the meat, and barley for the rice. Chopped cabbage very finely and omitted onion. Used 25oz can of undiluted tomato soup. Kids loved it; my veggie-avoiding 8yo son even finished his. Miracle! Thanks for the post. Half the recipe made enough for 2 grownups and 2 kids (8&10) plus another meal to freeze.

I made this last nite and loved it.  I added a couple handsful sauerkraut and 2 Tablespoons honey and some lemon juice to give it more of the traditional sweet and sour flavor.  It was DIVINE, as I am sure the basic recipe is, as well.

This recipe was a good start but needed a some modifications.  I followed the recipe the first time I made it and thought it was a little bland and the rice was a little crunchy.  The next time I made it I added some ground pork and some spices...better.  The last time I made it I used mostly ground pork and browned the onion with the meat.  I added 2 heaping Tablespoons Hungarian Paprika, 1 heaping Tablespoon Garlic Powder and plenty of fresh ground pepper.  I also parboiled the rice.  It was delicious.  I will make it again...with my modifications.

DE-LISH!!!! Made this for a co-workers House Warming party.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I am also gonna make it for our Pastor's birthday covered dish.  I followed some of the others advice.  I cooked the cabbage beforehand.  Also cooked the rice in the beef broth before adding to the mixture. Then cooked whole thing about 30-40 mins.  Very very good.  My husband and sons loved it also.  A definate keeper.

My husband absolutely loved this, but only after we added spices (on its own we found it to be very bland).  We added garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne, and that definitely did the trick--he went back for thirds!  I also used ground turkey to lighten it up a little, and I took it out of the oven after 1 hour because the cabbage was getting mushy.

Very good! I used a jar of spaghetti sauce and precooked everything, including the rice and cabbage, so I didn't need all the beef broth. It only needed to be heated through, about 30 minutes or so. It fits nicely in 2 9x13 pans, great to bake one and freeze one. We had no trouble finishing it off. I will definately make again.

Yum-O!!! I made this last night and I think I could have eaten it all by myself it was so good! I halved the recipe and still filled a 9 x 11 pan to the brim. A made a couple modifications to the recipe: tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, omitted the salt and added 2 tsp. Italian seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, and used low sodium beef broth. I will definitely be making this again and often!

one of my favorite recipes from this site so far, and I've been using allrecipes for 6+ years!  I've made this a number of times - it's not pretty, but it sure tastes good!!  the only thing I do differently is to add extra garlic & some red pepper flakes (I like it spicy).

I thought this was easier than making cabbage rolls.  Very good!!  I added a bit more rice and only baked for 1 hour.  This recipe would also work well with green peppers instead of cabbage for a green pepper casserole.

This was pretty good.  Some changes I made were that I used 1lb beef, 1 can of tomato soup instead of the sauce, 1 can of diced tomatoes, used seasoned salt instead of regular, 2 cloves of garlic and added some oregano.  This was a nice healthy meal, makes a lot.

I think this recipe as written would have been fairly bland, but I followed a few of the other suggestions here and came up with a result that even my 3YO and 5YO sons loved. First, I browned the beef and onion together, then added the shredded cabbage and a *lot* of minced garlic and sauteed for a few more minutes. Instead of tomato sauce, I used one can of tomato soup and one of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. I also added a packet of onion soup mix and used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I used only one pound of beef and a single head of cabbage, so I reduced the broth to 3 cups(honestly, if I had used any more, it wouldn't have fit in a 9x13 pan). This casserole was a success--thanks!

This is, at best, okay.  It still tastes like just the filling of cabbage rolls, and it's definitely missing something.  I don't think I'll be making this again.  The flavor is alright, but it's no substitution for cabbage rolls.

I have made this dish a few times for work pot-lucks and each time someone new asks me for the recipe. I ususally prepare at night and let it cook on low overnight in slow-cooker.  I also add the onions in with the beef when browning.  Tonight I am making for the family.  I am crossing my fingers they will like.....

This was very tasty and quick. I should have chopped the cabbage up finer as my two, young daughters thought the cabbage was onions. They normally don't eat regular cabbage rolls so I thought I would give this a try.
I will make it again.

Tastes amazingly like the golabki my grandmother used to make.  I added two cloves chopped garlic to the meat when it was browning, only a 2 pound head of cabbage, and only 1 1/2 cans of broth.  I suggest onion flavored broth if not using homemade.  Also, if your tomato sauce has no salt in it, add 1/2 teaspoon additional salt.

I halved this recipe and it was enough for my husband and myself with leftovers for one more meal. We both loved this recipe and it was so much easier than making cabbage rolls. I used already shredded cabbage with shredded carrots. It was delicious.

I made this tonight and everyone, including my four year old, loved it. Since there are only three of us, we have plenty of leftovers. I'll definitely be making this one again. Thanks so much.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  
I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I used canned diced tomatoes
(the kind with garlic and onion already mixed in) instead.
MMMMM it came out great!  I will definitely be doing this one again.

Pure comfort food - I did not cook this in the oven, instead cooked the meat, cabbage, and tomato sauce (plus a tad of beef broth) on the stovetop in a covered Dutch oven. I had no problem with the cabbage cooking. Cooked the rice separately - in beef broth - and added that in at the end. Delicious - thank you BUCHKO !

Very tasty and even better the next day. Comfort food without all the calories. Rye bread pairs well with this.

Like another reviewer, I made this on the stove. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the tomato sauce and used cooked brown rice I had leftover from the other night. The brown rice stayed whole (didn't get mushy like white rice tends to get when over cooked) and the cabbage didn't over cook while waiting for the rice to cook). Healthy, fast and delicious!

The reason I like this version is because I live alone and to buy a Whole Head of Cabbage just to make a couple of Cabbage Rolls for dinner is way to much.   Cheaper to buy a bag of Chopped Cabbage or Cole Slaw Mix then I follow the Directions adding extra spice to taste works so much better for me and I still can freeze left overs for later in the week.

This is soo yummy!! Like another reviewer mentioned, I make it on the stove. One pot. Super quick and easy. This is a staple in our house!

I only gave it 4 stars, tho because I add 2c of rice, not 1. There's too much liquid left over w/just 1 cup.

This was pretty good. I did not bake in the oven but left on the stove top and add a little more liquid and made as a soup.

I took the advice of cindib and took her method of cooking on the stove top and letting everything simmer for 20 minutes.  Super easy, fast, and yummy.  The only change I made was add garlic, since I always add it to my cabbage rolls.

I love Cabbage Rolls but hate all the work. I  made it exactly the way the recipe says to and it turned out great!  Even my picky 7-year-old would give it a try. The only thing I would change, is decrease all of the ingredients just slightly so that it will fit better in a 9 x 13 pan (it overflowed onto my oven burner) and add a little more salt.

I'm rating this as I made it, I thought the original recipe would be bland.  I added garlic salt, onion salt, oregano and worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to the browning ground beef. Put all ingredients into a large crockpot. Cooked on high for 6 hours...after 4.5 hrs, checked it out - cabbage still crunchy, rice good. Still needed more seasoning - added hot sauce to it - just right!.  Easy comfort food! Great for a cold wintry day!! Thanks for the recipe Buchko!

This was fabulous and sooooo easy. I thought it had a good deal of flavor though I did add garlic thyme and ginger. I loved it and the kids ate their fair share. This will definatly be put on the family menu. So much easier than cabage rolls but still the same taste and presentation. I made it just as the recipe stated except used brown rice (just a preference) and cooked at 375 for an hour just to quicken things up. Fab dish!

Just as good without all the work!! I was planning to do things the hard way and remembered seeing this while cruising for recipes a few weeks back. I dont know if I will ever roll cabbage again it was so good. Hubby said this was a keeper!! My alterations were similar to discobunnies only I used 1 lb gr beef and 1 lb gr pork (not sausage). I used 1 and a half cans tomato soup, 1 can diced tomato and 1 can broth. Seasoned and did rice as the discobunny suggested. Made 2 meals for a family of 4, one has gone to the freezer for later enjoyment:-). Loved it!! Try it if you hate the work but love the traditional dish!!

This was a very difficult recipe to work with.  While the flavor was okay, the dish was difficult to make.  3 pounds of cabbage "in wedges" was just too much.  Hard to "stir" after the first hour.  Was really just a mess.  Needed cabbage in smaller pieces - that would help keep the mass down a lot and easier for eating.  Needs a bit of work - not recommended - by the time you get all the ingredients in this, its cost you over 10 dollars - not worth it.

I loved this recipe.  My great grandmother made her cabbage rolls almost the same way.  I add a bit more salt, a minced garlic clove, and 1 cup of tomato juice to make it more soupy to dip rolls in.  I am so glad I can get the same great taste without all the work of wrapping the rolls.

This recipe is great and so much easier than traditional cabbage rolls.  I added a large can of diced tomatoes, 2 tsp of brown sugar and a dash of lemon juice.  It's great served with cheddar cheese and makes fantastic left overs.

This recipe is pretty good with some modifications. First, you have to add garlic!  I added about 3 cloves minced.  I cooked the garlic and the onion with a little bit of oil for about five minutes and then added the ground beef and cooked till browned. I also had to add about 1/3 cup of crushed tomatoes into the recipe as it just didn't look "tomatoey" enough..hahaha.  Finally, this dish is excellent served with a splash of vinegar on top.  All in all, a solid recipe that will hit the spot when a craving for cabbage rolls hits, but not as good as the real deal!

This recipe is super simple and easy to make! It makes 12 large servings. I changed the amount of ground beef to 1 1/4 lbs, because that's all I had and I still filled a 9X13 to the top! I will half the recipe next time. Delicious though!

This was very good. I didn't make it as is though. Here are my changes - I cooked brown rice and I parboiled the cabbage while I browned the ground beef. I put everything together in a large pot on top of the stove and heated until the cabbage was soft, I also added a can of diced tomatoes, chopped green peppers and some minced garlic for added flavour. Yum!

Very basic 101 recipe. Not much flavor, no Wow factor at all. Thank God, that I read some of the reviews and added a few of the suggestions, but even then it just doesn't make the taste buds go wow. I added some wistersire sauce and some garlic powder and a little sugar. If I do make this again...hmmm, NOT!

I scaled down this recipe by half and it was very good.  I used an oven proof dutch oven, precooked the meat and onion with spices, added the liquid, rice and cabbage...brought to a boil, then covered with the lid and into the oven and it was all done in about 50 min.  Very yummy and I will make this again.  thanks!

This was a great recipe, with a little bit of tweeking. I cooked this yesterday for New Years and my husband loved it and even commented that it tasted like lasagna.  I steamed the cabbage beforehand, cooked the meat with the onions and seasoned with seasonins salt, garlic powder and thyme.  I used 24oz of tomato sauce and added two cloves of pressed garlic. I did everything else as the recipe called for.  I cooked it at 350 for 1 hour then added some cheese on the top.  It was GREAT!

I'll give it the five stars after making a few changes for extra flavor.  Here are my suggestions.  Cook a ground beef/pork mixture with kosher salt, onion and garlic.  Add Worcestershire sauce (or Dale’s seasoning if you can find it), a small can of V8 juice, tomato paste and a can of flavored stewed tomatoes and some tomato sauce.  Cook the rice separately in beef broth.  Add the rice to the meat mixture and let in simmer for 1/2 hour with a bay leaf.   Remove the bay leaf and mix together the meat mixture and chopped cabbage. Cook in the oven and uncover if it is too soupy.  The current recipe is huge and should be halved unless it is a great big hungry family that you’re feeding.  Also, this is a good one for football games.

Around my house this is called lazy man's stuffed cabbage, for the days I don't feel like doing the cabbage rolls (golabki)!!  I use tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and instead of using all ground beef, I use a mixture of 1/3 ground pork to 2/3 ground beef - not quite as dry this way. A true comfort food.

Using what was on my shelves, this recipe was far from bland and probably not at all tasting what it should have tasted like (0:
I used spicy roasted garlic tomato sauce instead of regular tomato sauce and basmatic rice instead of regular.  Ethnic contributions from all over!  Everyone in the family loved it especially the kids (both under age 5).

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband, who is not a huge fan of cabbage, loved it.  I had to promise to make it again...and I will.
I changed a couple of things though.  Instead of beef broth, I used beef consumme because that's all I had.  I also minced two cloves of garlic and added to the mixture.  I got distracted and added the consumme right to the cabbage mix instead of pouring it over after putting the mix in the dish, but it didn't seem to matter.
I ate mine with some sour cream on top, and it really added something to it...a tangy taste that worked very well.
I had to edit to add that I made a six serving batch of this tonight, and instead of using all tomato sauce, I used one 8 oz can of tomato sauce and two 6 oz cans of tomato paste.  Everyone said it was better this way because the texture was heartier.

First of all, I cut the recipe in half.  I used 1 pound of ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 garlic cloves, a sprinkle of oregano, 1 can of diced flavored tomatoes, 1 bag of coleslaw mix from the produce salad shelf, 1/2 cup uncooked white rice, 1 can beef broth.  I also used 1 tablespoon each of garlic salt and onion salt.  I cooked for 1 hour, then I added 1 can of tomato soup and cooked for 30 minutes more.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but he thought it needed salt and I thought it needed more seasoning.  I will surely make this again as it is much easier than stuffing cabbage leaves.  I think I will try brown rice and maybe 3/4 cup next time.  I cooked this in a 9"x13" baking dish.  It serves 6 easily.

There's only two of us, so I cut in half.  Only thing I changed was I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and added minced garlic.  By second day the casserole was gone.  My husband who dislikes casseroles ate 3/4th's of it.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  Definitely addred to my collection.

I Love stuffed cabbage, however I hate all of the work.  I made this, but tweaked it according to our family's taste.  I used a large can of Dei Fratelli Italian Sauce and omitted the beef broth and rice,and I cooked this in a dutch oven on top of the stove.  I found that when I baked this, the rice soaked up too much of the sauce.  This could also be made in a crockpot.  It's all a matter of your personal taste. Try it, it is an excellent recipe!

I've made this probably 10 times since finding it. Its so much easier than making cabbage rolls, yet just as delicious! 
Changes I make that we enjoy are:
I fry up 6 strips of bacon (diced) with the hamburger (I only use 1 1/2 lb. of the 93% lean).
I only use 1/3 c. chopped onion.
I only use an 8 oz. can tomatoe sauce, but I also add 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes w/the juice. I omit the salt (plenty of salt in the canned ingredients). Then I only use 1 can of beef broth plus 14 oz. HOT water mixed with 2 t. Wyler's Sodium Free beef bouillon. I add 2-4 t. of sugar to round out the acid from the tomatoes. The smell drives my doggies nuts, and they always beg until they score a little bit after we have dinner. Serve with crusty bread & soft REAL butter. Then pray for leftovers (as its even BETTER the 2nd day). This is GREAT casserole!

This recipe is great with a few changes.First I scaled it to serve 6. I used 1 can of Hunts diced tomatoes in tomatoe sauce,1 can beef broth, 1 can tomato soup and 3/4 cup rice. I blanched the cabbage 3 minutes first.I always keep fried hamburger meat in the freezer ready to use so I fried the onion and 1 tsp chopped garlic in olive oil and added to 1 lb ready meat.I mixed this with the other ingredients. I then added salt,pepper,a touch of Basil and oregano and Emeril's originale essence.It tasted great!!

This is my ultimate in comfort food. Instead of tomato sauce I use 2 cans of tomato soup and instead of beef broth I use 2 soup cans of water mixed with 2 low salt beef bouillon cubes. I could eat this every weeek, if only I could convince my husband that this is the best meal ever, he's not a huge fan.

I was afraid to try this one because I have never cooked cabbage before.  I was afraid that it would never turn out as good as my Grandma's.  I was wrong!  Not only was it GREAT, my husband ate it three days in a row!  He NEVER does that.  It reminds us both of southern home cooking, in which we get when we go home to visit. Now we won't have to wait, I can do it myself!

I made this for 11 of my family members a few weeks ago and had most of them asking for the recipe.   I made an increased  amount to have 18 servings and, the little that was left was taken home with one of them in a tupperware dish. ---

This was good but not great.  It was a little bland for our tastes.  I did like the fact that it made quite a bit and plenty for leftovers.  This is a great 2 night meal.  I think next time I will add some seasoning to the meat or the sauce before mixing.  I might also add more rice too and perhaps a bit less cabbage.  All in all though it was a hearty meal, perfect for cold winter nights!  I will make this again.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Like Nancy I spent alot of time making stuffed cabbage rolls.  I found this to be very easy and have made it before.  Although, this time I cooked the chopped cabbage in the microwave for 3 minutes in a small amount of water.  It seemed to make the casserole more consistant and not so crunchy.  Must say again we loved it.  Thank you Nancy!!

This recipe has real potential but needs more seasonings (I forgot to add garlic as other reviewers suggested).  It is simple and similar to cabbage rolls, just needs more flavor.  Also, I bought a 3 1/2 lb. cabbage and only used half of it because it overfilled my 9 x 13 pan.

This is just like my grandmother's stuffed cabbage
recipe except I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. We don't normally use beef broth either but it didn't change the taste much. I also added garlic and pepper. This is a tasty and easy way to make this meal out the hassle.

I HAD NEVER HAD CABBAGE ROLLS BUT I WAS TRYING TO BE MORE CREATIVE WITH WHAT I COOKED.  I DECIDED TO TRY THIS. MY BOYFRIEND AND I BOTH LOVED IT.  EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ONLY THE TWO OF US, I STILL MADE THE WHOLE RECIPE AND I USE THE LEFTOVERS AND MAKE STUFFED BELL PEPPERS THE NEXT NIGHT.

I made this cabbage caserole yesterday and it is excellent. I am accustomed to making the regular cabbage rolls,but this is so easy and quick!

I did add some chopped fresh garlic and basil.Since I am a garlic lover.

My family all enjoyed it with some good crusty Italian bread. I will be making this often.

The idea of the caserole instead of all that work to prepare and roll the stuffed cabbage is great!  But my husband and I added 1 1/2 lbs more meat (pork and beef).And to make it even easier, we used 2 lbs of bagged cole slaw with carrots and red cabbage, instead of coring and chopping cabbage.

This was excellent. I used lean ground chicken and also added grated carrots. Substituted tomato sauce with with herb and garlic pasta sauce. For sure we will make this one again.

This is delicious and easy, my family loves it! To make it even easier, use bagged pre-shredded cabbage (coleslaw mix)!

Made this for dinner last night. Subbed tomato soup for tomato sauce because that's how my Mom did it (and it was sooo good that way). I also used vegetable broth instead of water because I wanted more flavor, just not more "beefy" flavor. I spiced the ground beef with Montreal Steak seasoning and jazzed up tomato soup with 1 TB. Worcestershire sauce. Five stars for a great base recipe that allows for each family's preference of seasonings.

Instead of tomato sauce I use tomato soup gives it a much better flavor...I have been making it this way since my children were young now they are adults.

As written I give it a 4.5. Very delicious as is and super easy. However, I prefer it with wild rice. So, I cook the wild rice in beef broth before cooking and, when I assemble the casserole I omit the extra liquid. Also, for a little variation, I sprinkle the top with shredded gruyère and turn up the oven during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking. Thank you for the recipe!!!

I made this recipe, using the additional seasonings as suggested by other reviewers and it was great.  However, I did not bake it in the oven but cooked it in my electric pressure cooker.  It took the cooker 5 minutes to come to full pressure and it cooked for 8 minutes, so it was ready in less than 15 minutes, and I did not have to fire up the big oven and heat up the kitchen on an already hot day.
I plan to make it again but I think some diced tomatoes might be good instead of just tomato sauce.

Easy and delicious. I added some of my grandmother's ingredients for stuffed cabbage. I used half ground beef and half ground pork and browned with the rice to make it fluffy. As suggested added garlic.  To give it some zip and saltiness I used a jar of sauerkraut (drained)as well as the cabbage and half tomato sauce and half V8 Juice. Simmered in a pot about 40 min. Will definitely add to our "hit" list!

Wonderful! I used this recipe to recycle leftovers and use what was in the pantry for a delicious, original meal: I had 1/2 a compact medium head of cabbage to use up, half a vidalia onion and leftover meatloaf. Tossed chopped onion and two cloves of garlic with the chunked up meatloaf into my iron skillet with a tad of oil, and cooked til the onions were tender. Added a can of Rotel (we like it spicy here, and got this recipe to use what I had 'on hand') and a can of tomato paste which was watered down to tomato sauce consistency. Let that simmer for a good 10 minutes or so, then added the cabbage and cooked in skillet for a good 30 minutes or so - perfection!
Some Parmesan cheese added on top with a tad of sea salt and red pepper flakes (as individual tastes happened for the family - the meatloaf also had spices added originally) and we have a winner! It makes a ton, even without the rice. Definitely going into our work lunches tomorrow, and will be a quick and tasty heat up for dinner when we get home late, we don't mind eating this recipe many times over. THANK YOU!

I was worried when others said this was bland, but I enjoy it that way.  I did add more salt and pepper, but I made it with my tomatoes and cabbage from my garden, and I enjoyed the flavor of the vegetables.

One of my family's favorites!  When I first tried this recipe I didn't have any beef broth in my pantry so I substituted a can of beer instead.  I would not make it any other way! The flavor the beer adds is amazing.  My family also prefers if I shred the cabbage into smaller pieces.  We will be serving this one for a long time!

Only 4 stars bc it needs more spices than the recipe indicates.  That being said, I've made it countless times on the stovetop to save time (and dishes!) as some other reviewers suggested.

This is a good basic recipe, but it is kind of bland. On the other hand, everyone in my family was willing to eat it which is nothing short of a minor miracle. The kids aren't really into cabbage, so the fact that they ate it and said it was good... Now, I did spice it up and make a substitution or two. I used only 1 pound of ground lean turkey. I fried some frozen onions in a little grapeseed oil, added the ground turkey and cooked until it was browned. I like a little white wine to flavor my onion and ground turkey, so added a good splash of vermouth and let it reduce to almost nothing while I chopped the cabbage. Instead of tomato sauce I used crushed tomatoes and I used instant brown rice. To spice it up I added a tsp of crushed garlic, 1/8 tsp thyme, and "a bit" of freshly ground black pepper. I let it simmer covered on the stovetop for 30 minutes so everything got well cooked. Then I tasted it and added about 1.5 cups of sour cream. I served it with Emeril's Essence on the side so we could all add it to our own taste. In every other way I pretty much followed the recipe proportions and ingredients.

This recipe is very good!  Like others suggested, more spices is definitely a good thing.  I also added my rice to my ground beef/onion mixture.  Once I drained the beef/onion mixture, I put the rice in and covered the pan and let them simmer for about 10 minutes before continuing on with the remainder of the recipe.  This is very delicious and even better reheated!

I layered the ingredients like a lasagna.  Cabbage, meat & rice, then cabbage with tomato sauce on top.  I think next time I won't cook the meat first, just as an experiment.

Fast easy and very yummy! The whole family loved it! I did cut the recipe in half and used a 9x13 pan. I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and soy sauce. I also sauteed chopped onions with the ground beef.

Wow! I made it the same way another person made it. I steamed it on the stove. I didnt have tomato sauce so I used spaghetti sauce with chicken instead of ground beef. I added a little sugar to break up the acid in the tomatos. And jasmine rice. It tastes like a keeper.

I have a similar recipe that calls for milk and flour instead of the broth and is topped with cheddar and I love that recipe. I decided to try this one as it's healthier but for some reason thought the amount of liquid would be too much (I know, no one else says it's a problem in their reviews...) so used only 1/2 the broth. It was NOT enough. You must use all of it. Good and flavourful.

I made this without the rice so that I could pour it over rice and in a crockpot. It came out soupy.  I should have adjusted the liquids.  This was good.  I'll follow the recipe next time to see if it turns out very good.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was the most disgusting thing. No taste. I wouldn't feed it to the pigs. Total waste of the ingredients.

This recipe does make a lot!  About 2 9x13 pans of it!  But it's very good.  I took the advice of a few others and added Italian seasoning, garlic, a can of diced tomatoes 2 T. brown sugar, extra salt, Worcestershire sauce and added my own touch.... some shredded cheese.  I love anything with cheese in it.  My husband and sister-in-law had seconds... and I had so much left I sent an 8x8 casserole of it home with her and gave another casserole of it to my Mom.  My husband and I are eating the leftovers again tonight!  Nice if you want a night of no-cooking!

This casserole was so good my children even had seconds (and I think there was some sneaking of thirds also) and they don't particularly care for cabbage. I did add some shredded cheese at the end and put back in the oven (oven turned off) until the cheese melted. We will be making again and again. I've already sent the recipe to another friend for her family. Thanks!

I gave this a 4 as I made it, as written it would have probably been a 3. Simple & easy but very bland as written. Like others I seasoned the beef while browning with s&p, red pepper flakes, worcheshire, garlic powder and tomato paste. In the end it was very good, just like cabbage rolls without the hassle. Will definitely keep working with this one and make again.

Very easy and not too bad though it doesn't 'look' good. Needed more cabbage but the house needed less cabbage smell. Leftovers were good topped with cheese to hide the bad appearance.

This is a great recipe but I had to only give it a 4-star because I had to add a lot of spice to it.  It's kind of a basic recipe.    I also socked the seasoning to the meat/onion while it was browning -- salt & pepper, a lot of garlic, oregano and basil and a heavy dose of both red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. Also sprinkled some of all those things over the cabbage I'd chopped.

Just like cabbage rolls without all the work!I cut the recipe half but kept the amount of tomato sauce about the same (I used maybe 20-22 oz.)Also, I gave the rice a head start by bring a cup of beef broth to a boil and then adding the rice. Removed it from the heat.After sauteing the onion (I put some chopped garlic in as well,3 cloves) and browning the beef, I combined everything in a 9x13 in. pan. Covered and baked for 1 hour. We ate this 2 days in a row. Excellent recipe. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this! It was super easy--I did halve the ingredients with the exception of the rice, which I left at 1 cup. I followed the suggestion in an earlier review and turned up the oven to 400 and it was done in an hour.

I made the recipe exactly as it says, except I left out the oil when I browned the beef and it turned out pretty bland! To add some flavor I added a bunch of Adobo (spanish seasoning) which made it a lot better. It still seemed like there was something missing, so added four slices of pre-sliced cheddar cheese to the casserole, mixed it up, and it was finally perfect! I never salt my food so I was surprised that no one else really found it to be bland, perhaps the modifications most made added enough flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again, with my modifications of course!

Out of this world!!!!!  I made this dish in the crockpot and added ingredients from receipe with a few modifications:  used 3 lbs of ground turkey, 1 1/2 heads of chopped cabbage, 2 1/2 cups Uncle Ben's Brown Rice, 2 1/2 medium onions, 3 - 4 cans tomato sauce, Salt Sense Iodized salt, and 2lb beef broth.  (After reading everyone's reviews)  Then I added 2 - 3 tablespoons hot sauce, 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons worchestire sauce, 6 medium sized freshly minced garlic, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, and 2 teaspoons of vinegar.  On the side I served sour cream to help cool down the heat from some of the peppers I used in case it was a little too hot for anyone.  Entire family scarfed meal within seconds.  My mother came over for dinner and is now begging for receipe.  This dish will definitely be added to regular dinner menu and made again and again!

Yummy!  We love cabbage rolls, but who has the time.  This recipe is so quick, easy, and satisfying.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with their juice, and used basmati rice.  So good!

Excellent. Take DiscoBunny's advice in the review section, though. Add lots of spices, and mix the broth and tomato (I used 2 cans tomato soup) in with the meat and onions. As suggested, I also mixed in the rice with the meat mixture and let it sit 15 min (would do 20-25 next time). I used 1 medium sized cabbage. It took about 1 hr and 15 covered in a 9 x 13 pan, and another 15 uncovered. Was a smash hit.

This is a very good base recipe.  I sauteed a lot of onions and 3 cloves of garlic, then added beef and browned nicely, Added oregano, basil, salt, pepper, worchestershire, tomatoe sauce, broth, rice and simmered for about 15 mins.  I used half sour cabbage and half sweet cabbage.  That really kicked the flavour up.  Oh, just before I popped it in the oven, I poured a can of whole (chopped) canned tomatoes.  Made 2 pans, so froze 1.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is a good recipe. I didn't want to heat up the house by turning the oven on, so I cooked it in a Dutch oven on top of the stove. Worked just fine. My husband and I both like it. Much easier than making cabbage rolls! I'll make this again.

This was a very pleasant surprise. I was looking for a cabbage roll recipe that was easier and didn't require me getting my fingers burned or ripping cabbage to roll it. This recipe did the trick very very well. It's easy to make and in fact, my husband made it once for me and he even commented how easy it was. I was a bit more aggressive with the salt and this does make a LOT of food which is fine, since it reaheated well too.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I used very lean ground beef and added some diced, fire roasted tomatoes (one can drained).  This dish was very tasty, stayed together well (despite my concerns it would be too try - not the case at all), and was even better the second night.  I also added a few pinches of parmesagn shredded cheese, mostly because I happened to have it on hand.  What a great idea this recipe is.  I will be making it again.  My husband loved it.

I am a cabbage roll lover, but I hate the time it takes to make them. So this was a perfect recipe for me. I did add a couple of ingredients (oregano and basil) since that is how I've always made my cabbage rolls. It came out delicious. I will never take the time to make rolls again!! haha

Not fantastic, but pretty tasty.  Giving 4 stars because w/ minor alterations it is a super filling, low calorie meal.  I halved the recipe, used ground turkey, fat free broth, brown rice, and added green peppers.  Next time I will use a full 29 oz can of sauce bc 14 oz was not nearly enough, even though I halved the recipe.

Love this recipe!  I usually cut it in half and it makes a huge 9 x 13 inch pan.  Best using Campbells beef broth-adds lots of flavor.  Can substitute brown rice for a lower carb option-just cook a bit longer.

Today at work, I was thinking, "What should I make for dinner?" Cabbage Rolls popped into my mind, but I didn't want to hassle with rooolling each cabbage roll. So, as soon as I got home, I searched through the cabbage roll recipes and found this! This is very GOOD and SIMPLE! All I changed was I added 1 (15oz) can of "Fire Roasted Tomatoes" and used that can for water (filled it twice--instead of the beef broth) and seasoned to taste with Salt, Pepper & Granulated Garlic...and that's it. It is awesome and a definate keeper for my Recipe Box! :)

I only had one pound of ground beef so that's all the meat I could use but I kept all the other ingredient measurements the same and it turned out great.  I suggest you use a lot more tomato sauce if you use the full two pounds of beef.  I also sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top at the end and it was delicious!

I do not typically alter recipes but I did take the recommendation of others to add a bit more spice to make the casserole more flavorful.  Thank goodness I did because even though I added three cloves of garlic, some worstershire, parsley, garlic powder and onion powder, it didn't taste like much even the next day (which is when I planned on eating it).  I ended up boiling the chopped cabbage for about 10 minutes b/c I didn't have a bowl large enough to mix all of the ingredients (and I have the huge pyrex bowl-  cooking the cabbage down a bit made it more manageable).  I seasoned the beef after it was done browning and placed everything in a 10 x 15 dish b/c there was no way this was fitting in anything smaller. It was good for the amount of work involved b/c cabbage rolls take forever, but I might add extra salt or even a packet of onion soup mix or bacon next time to give it more flavor.  It definitely has potential to be a really good dish and it does make a ton!

Being of Lebanese decent, my family has been making "hand rolled" cabbage rolls for as long as I can recall.  Although they are much more labor intensive, they are still the best way to get the true cabbage roll taste.  I thought this recipe was good, but I did make a few changes.  I added some lemon juice (about 2 or 3 Tablespoons) and also added some cinammon.  (about a teaspoon or so)  I also steamed the cabbage in the pan for about ten minutes and that seemed to help the cooking process. My family enjoyed these, but I still have to say that these are only second best.

My family discovered German food during a trip to Disney World (Biergarten in Epcot) and since then we enjoy trying different recipes and restaurant.

This recipe is very easy and tastes near authentic.  Will definitely make again.

Tasted just like the high-maintenance-much-fuss-yet-super-tasty cabbage rolls.  Thanks for submitting such a superb recipe that not only tasted great, but simplified my life.

This was ok..just with regular recipe a little bland.  I added like others additional spices.  With some garlic bread not bad.

I changed up a few things, but with the end product using your basic recipe, my family enjoyed it!  I sauteed onions and 2 cloves minced garlic while frying up the meat; used cooked brown rice, and added basil and parsley to all when combining everything.  Like a previous reviewer, I steamed, rather than baking it for an hour, and it turned out yummy, husband and kids agreed!

My husband isn't even crazy about cabbage, but he went back for seconds!  I did add my own little touches to the recipe.  I substituted half of the ground beef with ground pork sausage and added some pepper.  This done a great job of adding flavor and spicing it up.  I thought it sounded like the original recipe might be a little bland, but had potential. The sausage helped out with the salt issue, because the original recipe would definitely need more salt.  It's been awhile ago, since I made this the first time.  I'm getting ready to make it again tomorrow night for supper, though.  Can't wait!

This was a good meal, we had it last night for dinner.  I did make a couple of changes though.  I fried a clove of garlic with the ground beef, soaked the rice and cabbage for about an hour before preparing it.  I also added some ground pepper and chili pepper for added spice.  After serving it my husband put lemon on his and it was great, it added a little extra zing to it.  This is a meal that I'm going to be making a lot more often.

I prepared as stated with no changes.  I cooked as stated.  Cabbage was half cooked.  I had to add a little water to keep from burning to dish with hopes it would also help cook the cabbage.  Thirty minutes later, I had no choice but to remove it.  If I ever try to make this again, I will at least soak the cabbage prior to baking.  I'm sure it would have been a great dish but I have no idea what went wrong.  We ended up eating grilled cheese sandwiches.

This was tasty---made basically as written with the exception of seasoning the meat (only salt in the mix would have been bland I think) and cut the recipe in half.  I used minute rice so undercooked rice wouldn’t be a problem and it came out great, however  if you don’t like instant rice I wouldn’t recommend subbing it since it cooks up to have a different texture .  Will make again, but I think I would prefer it a little sweet and will try that next time

Made this recipe tonight, and now it's one of my husband's favorites!  Reminds me of my Granny's recipe for rolls.  Very yummy. Used the changes suggested: halved the recipe, boiled the chopped cabbage for 2 min, drained, and put it in the 9x13 pan.  With the ground beef and 1/2 cup red onion in a saucepan, I also added a dash of Tabasco, cinammon, Worchestshire, tsp of brown sugar and tsp of lemon juice, as suggested, and sauteed until the beef browned.  Added salt and pepper to the beef  plus a dash of spicy Mexican seasoning.  We used brown rice and cooked it beforehand, which added to the prep time, but was very good.  Meant to cook 2 1/2 cups of brown rice and only use 1 but forgot and put in all of it, so the ratio of beef to rice was off but it tasted very good.  Helped to drop the calories/serving also. Once the beef was done, I added the cooked brown rice and a can of whole peeled tomatoes (400g) and diced the tomatoes. After the beef/rice/tomatoes were mixed well, I added them to the 9x13 pan and stirred.  For a topping, we poured a few rows of another tomato sauce on top and my husband added grated Edamer cheese (like Swiss).  We baked it for 1 hour covered with foil. Then baked 10 min uncovered. Was still some liquid left and cabbage was a bit crunchy, but we both liked it and are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!  Even with half the recipe, we still made a full 9x13 pan's worth.  Would be a great dish for a potluck. Definitely one I will make again.

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes on this site! My mom started making it several years ago, and now I make it now that I have my own apartment. I don't have a huge casserole dish so I had to split mine between to 9x13 pans. Make sure you cook it long enough so that it's not watery (had to call mom on that one and make sure I didn't mess it up! it just needed extra time in the oven.). If you like things a little spicy and vinegary, I suggest serving it with some Frank's Red Hot sauce!

Sorry I can't give this a better review but it isn't something I would make again. The rice was gummy from the long cook time and something just didn't taste right. Maybe I didn't care for the beef broth. Anyway if you do try this one I'd start with half the recipe. It did taste better with lots of sour cream.

I followed the recipe and tried to cook everything in one pan. I tried to have the weights the same, but everything did not fit. It cooked out into my oven. The rice was also not done and it didn't taste very good. I don't like instant rice so I will try this again, I like that you don't have to roll. But I think i will either soak the rice or pre cook it, and place it in two pans instead of one.

This is a great recipe sure beats rolling cabbage leaves around hamburg and rice.  I seasoned it up a bit my family thought it was great...I like it and it is extremely easy to make adding foil to line the pan that you bake it in leaves for easy clean up.

Very good.  I cut the recipe in half and accidentally added the full 29 oz. of tomato sauce, glad I did.  Came out very moist and reheated for a second meal very nicely.  I only added a bit of chili powder, garlic powder and red pepper flakes for a little more taste.

I halved this recipe, except for the rice and onion.  Added minced garlic and Italian seasonings but I should have followed the suggestions to add some brown sugar and lemon juice to the tomato sauce.  Found this to be a little bland so I might try again with these changes, plus I would chop the cabbage finely and sub a can of diced tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce.

if you saute the cabbage and heat the liquids to almost boiling, it speeds the oven time to 35 minutes.

Like many other reviews, this recipe did need some spark to it... thank goodness for spiced! I will admit though, my husband who is not so keen on cabbage asked for seconds. Its a fairly easy recipe to put together and just forget about it... in other words, easy and delicious for those lazy days.
Goes wonderful with garlic bread and Iced sweet tea.

This is a good substitute for actual cabbage rolls. There's nothing as good as the real thing, but this should satisfy that Hungarian/Polish craving. Keep in mind that most cabbage recipes are not meant to have over-powering flavor. They do tend to be slightly bland. If you seek tons of flavor this is probably not the recipe for you. This is a somewhat ethnic comfort food. I love it, thanks!

This recipe was way to big for just my husband and I. It's a great recipe. Next time I will half the recipe. I had a really hard time trying to fit all those ingredients into a 9x13 dish. I had to uncover it and jack the heat up to 400 just to boil the liquid off (even though alot leaked onto the bottom of my oven)

Did anyone else have a hard time cramming 3 1/2 lbs of chopped cabbage into a 9X13 pan?  My pan overfloweth!  By the time I was trying to get the beef broth poured in, I was laughing because there was no way it was gonna fit!  Use a great big bowl for mixing and a great big pan for cooking!  Other than that, it tasted pretty good.  Not quite as good as cabbage rolls but pretty good none-the-less.

Easy and delicious.  I halved the recipe and used Tone's beef paste (available at Sam's Club) mixed with water instead of the beef broth.  Definitely a keeper!

My family loved this recipe.  I did change a couple of things.  I substituted instant brown rice for white rice, used about 2 tbs of kosher salt, and added a little more tomato sauce.  I had to use a 14x11 dish, the 9x13 was too small.  Lots of leftover for lunches this week!

Good recipe, but needs more seasoning.  It also made alot more food than my husband and I could eat. It's worth a second try. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could...it's better than a 3, but not quite a 4.

Made this recipe exactly as written. I then tasted the mixture and thought it was really bland. I then read some reviews and alot of people mentioned spicing it up. I did it, but I guess it was too late because it turned out so-so. Made half of the recipe and had to use the big baking dish anyways. Had to double up the sauce as well since it was too dry. I will try this again since it is a decent guideline and usefull to get rid of extra cabbage.

Very good base for a recipe but I changed it a little, for instance I added tomato soup instead of tomato sauce since that's the way our family makes stuffed cabbage.  Needs a lot of liquid though or it will come out dry.

I was surprised at how well this recipe came out. My mother and I have been making golabki (cabbage rolls) together for awhile and this was a great way to use all the same ingredients without the hassle of filling and rolling each individual cabbage leaf.  My aunt also makes this time-saving version and calls it "dirty golabki".  I cut the recipe in half and further cut the cabbage portion only because I'm not a huge fan of cabbage.  I also used tomato soup (as my mother does) and it came out great!

I am giving you 4 star because recipe ingredients call for 9x13 pan.. I made exactly and couldn't add all the broth... this is not a recipe as it stands for a 9x13 pan..my oven is proof with burned on overflow.The ingredients themselve are fine, verified by my Polish friend, and the outcome was great, but if you halfed the ingredients it would fit comfortable in pan..  I will make again as it does take work out of rolled cabbage with the same results.

Don't know what went wrong..I followed directions exactly but my rice was not cooked at the end and the cabbage was still a little tough. There was so much liquid in my pan that it spilled out onto the bottom of my oven! Needless to say, I have a huge amount leftover and no one wants to eat it.

Very good! SO EASY! Thrifty and healthy! I made half a recipe and it filled a 9x13 pan. We have had three meals from it! Leftovers are just as tasty!We have cornbread or hot rolls with it. Hint:I used half of a small head of cabbage to equal 1 and 3/4 lbs. (I weighed it in my kitchen scale to be sure).
You can jazz it up a little with seasonings you like, e.g. a few dashes of garlic powder, black pepper or whatever. I have used tomato soup if I didn't have tomato sauce on hand and it is good too.

Delicious and fast to prepare.  I did add a tablespoon worcestire sauce and some brown sugar to tomato soup (instead of sauce)just for an extra tang.  Family friendly, cabbage disguised really well!

Very Good!  the flavor was awesome.  I got impatient, and didn't let it cook long enough.. and it was still a hit!! It takes a long time for cabbage to tender up, so plan this one early in your day!  I know I should have started a little earlier!  Taste is good!  makes a lot!

Overall a good recipe.  However, I incorporated my mother's version of cabbage rolls.  Instead of 2 lbs. of ground beef I used 1 lb. of lean ground beef and 1 lb. of pork. Added four chopped garlic cloves. I placed the mixture into a roaster and then covered the mixture with 1-14.5 oz. can of whole tomatoes(chopped them up) and 1-14 oz can sauerkraut(remove juice and rinse with water). Definitely a dish to share with family and friends.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!! I added a pound of ground pork,and sauteed the onions with the meat and added everything into a pan, made sure I made it with instant rice and it turn out so well. I did add garlic salt and pepper to the meat. I had 3 helpings and I think the next time, I will add a little bit less cabbage and I did double the rice amt. It's nice to know that it will taste even better tomorrow!!

I halved the recipe and it made tons. Even with half of the recipe -- I couldn't fit it in one 9x13 dish.

After reading the reviews of others I added several cloves of garlic (as my family likes garlic), sweet basil, used 3-8 oz cans of tomato sauce, and sprinkled cayanne pepper in for that extra pizzaz.  Husband is a picky eater and said a recipe to repeat again. My children thought I had added too much pepper.

GOOD RECIPE. I CUT THE RECIPE DOWN SINCE I ONLY COOK FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND. I ALSO ADDED A EXTRA TOMATOE SAUCE WHEN I BAKED IT BECAUSE I LIKE THINGS SAUCY. I USED INSTANT RICE AND DID NOT HAVE TO BAKE THIS FOR THE FULL TIME THE RECIPE SUGGESTS. THE RICE WAS DONE AND THE CABBAGE WAS JUST RIGHT. I WILL MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN.

Thank you Nancy!!!
This is fantastic, very easy. I prepare this about 4 times a year, since it makes a large batch and it freezes well. Just the thing to pull out of the freezer on a busy day. Add some crusty bread or rolls and dinner is done.

This recipe was really good!  Like many others, I halfed the recipe, added more onion and added some extra seasoning (seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper).  Even though I split it in half, this recipe makes more than enough for 2 people.  My husband really liked it.  He said it tasted somewhat like spaghetti.

I loved the taste of this recipe.  Although it didnt specify instant rice and I used regular rice and it wasnt cooked through.  It does make a lot, barely fits in a 9x13 pan.  I would cut recipe in half for just myself and husband.  Will probably make again, but not often.

My husband and I loved this dish.  It made enough to feed an army though.  I used a 9x13 Pyrex dish and had to pack it down to get it all to fit in.  The sugars come out in the cabbage and the dish tastes just as good as cabbage rolls.  In my opinion, it's even better, because I'm a bigger fan of the cooked cabbage than I am of the big meatball inside.  The leftovers are good with a little spaghetti sauce over the top.  A keeper.

I took Donna D's advice and gave the recipe a try...despite some of the reviews. I really liked it a lot. I will definately make it again!  Do not have any doubts making this recipe, my family really enjoyed it. Makes enough for a crowd!

Wow, this was wonderful!  I love how quick and easy it was,and how much it makes!  I froze the leftovers in small containers and that is just so convenient.  The flavour was great and the whole family loved it.  If only every dish could be this simple!
I don't know about the people who are posting nasty things about this recipe here.  I think they are just being mean on purpose and haven't even tried it.  Don't listen to their reviews.  It is wonderful.  And with a few ingredients added here and there, it can be changed to Mexican, Italian, Greek...  the possibilities are endless.

EXCELLENT!  I used brown rice instead of white rice , turkey instead of ground beef and pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I also added a few things:  2 TBS worchester sauce, 2 TBS red wine, 2 garlic cloves.

I don't know what I did wrong, but my casserole has been in the oven for over an hour and it is still pretty mushy.  

The recipe sounded good, but things are turning out as well!!!

I halved the recipe and used 1/2 of a medium sized head of cabbage and it still made a large casserole.  I added garlic powder, and I used 2 cans Italian flavored diced tomatoes and 1 can Italian flavored tomatoe sauce in place of the sauce listed.  I have made it twice...once with a tablespoon of vinegar and once without.  It was good both ways.  Me and my husband thought it was quite tasty and my mother loved it. I look forward to making it often.  Thanks for a great tasting, easy recipe.

Being mostly Polish, I love Cabbage Rolls(Stuffed Cabbage in my family) but they are a real pain to make!  But, not this way!!  It was so easy & very delicious!!  We ate the leftovers for the next two nights!!  By the way, it's even better the second day!!

This recipe was really good.  We ate it over plain white bread and it was tasty.  It was easy to put together, but It took an hour and a half to cook.  There was plenty of left overs to go in the freezer!!  I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Great easy recipe! I made it adding in some diced tomatoes and some crushed red pepper to give it just a hint of a kick. Was delicious.  Will cut the recipe in half since it made way too much for two people. Definitely keeping in my recipe “box!”

This recipe appealed me because I didn't want to suffer rolling and stuffing cabbage leaves. I decided to use a meat blend that my Hungarian grandmother (RIP) used... Ground veal and ground pork, 50/50. I also added polska kielbasa, like she did, although she added less than I did! Some of the cabbage cam out crunchy but no big deal. I did not find it lacking in flavor as some had said. I couldn't imagine tainting this with heaps of garlic or oregano or hot peppers!?? The relative plainness of the sauce let the subtle flavors of the two meats shine through. Served with a dollop or sour cream, and a couple of slices of Jewish rye bread with carroway seeds... This was easy to make and REALLY tasty. Happy belated birthday and God Bless You Grandmom!

My changes: used chicken broth instead of beef and added tomato juice. I also kicked up the spices with hot sauce and chili powder. I cooked it on the stovetop until rice was tender. It was fabulous! My DH loves cabbage rolls and said this was great. I'd like to comment on reader's criticisms for reviewing recipes with our own changes. Now, I hate it when someone makes a  bunch of changes and then gives the recipe one star.
That's their fault. But for the rest of us ... First, the review box asks what did you change? Second, a lot of us see recipes as concepts rather than strict instructions. I rarely follow a recipe exactly. It's an idea -- a platform that allows you to tweak and tinker to your own tastes. We take great concepts like this cabbage roll casserole, leave out what we don't like, add what we do, experiment, and make the dish our own. To me, that's one of the beauties of cooking, and I love the inspiration these reviewers provide.

I have made this recipe in my Instant Pot with great results every time. 

I alter it a bit to do in my Instant Pot  -
1. Brown ground meat (I use turkey) and onion on the saute setting before adding the rest of the ingredients. 
2. Add rest of ingredients to your instant pot and set to rice setting 12 minutes (it defaults on mine to 12)

Turns out perfect every time. 

I also substitute beef broth for vegetable broth since we don't eat beef in our house. Otherwise everything is left as stated.

Absolutely delicious casserole!  Made with 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey, my own very special recipe of red sauce (instead of plain tomato sauce) and added 3 carrots cut into julienne strips during the last 30 minutes of baking.  Both these suggestions were on the accompanying video only...but not in printed recipe.   I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed this dish!

This was a great and easy recipe! I halved the recipe, sautéed the onions and garlic with the ground beef and used brown rice. I also added some pepper and a decent amount of chili powder. I didn't have any beef broth so I used chicken broth. I think next time I will add more rice. It turned out perfect and we will definitely make this again!

Only way I'll do this now! I love that I can cook the ground meat and drain the fat. I also rinse with hot water. 

This was a little bland, but I'm from south Louisiana, and we like our food well seasoned! 

So, I added garlic powder, onion powder, a lot more salt, soy sauce, Worcester sauce, some red and black pepper. Chopped bell pepper.  And allspice. It makes it taste better! 

One thing I'll do differently next time - some tomato paste, and precook my brown rice a bit. 

Is a great recipe by itself, and wonderful  if you want to dress it up.

I liked this recipe.  I've made it twice.  Once with a cooking program where I live.  

It's also nice if you add in or sub for part of the tomatoes some diced or fresh tomatoes.  Also you could partly cook the rice in the beef broth and cook the other ingredients together on the stove then mix vs the bake in oven.  This is useful if you're cooking for a lot of people or don't have the largest oven.  The latter being my main problem cooking this.  

I also used bovril and beef broth when I cooked it in the cooking program.  However when I made it at home I used Knorr beef cubes (2 cubes with 700ml or 2 3/4 cup water).

I've made this three times now, and each time my family has loved it. I've made a couple adjustments. I add in around eight or nine cloves of garlic, minced, because we love garlic in our food. And I tend to use a flavored spaghetti sauce, normally tomato and basil flavored. This also makes way too much to fit in one 9x13 pan, so it goes into two and then into my oven. It's delicious, well loved, and I will happily make it again and again.

Love it.  Nice and easy.  I love cabage rolls and I never make them because of the time and work.    This is a wonderful easy recipe and it freezes well to.   I made up a large batch of it and separated it into meal size aluminum foil dishes froze them and had mane meals for the next month. 

My wife is not crazy about cabage rolls but still eats it.  I will make this again

This is a 5 star with a few tweaks....                                                                             

first i used marinara instead of tomato sauce.... adds more flavor.                                                                   

I also cooked the onions with the beef... also added garlic.                                                     

I sprinkled some Italian seasoning and pepper onto the cabbage.                                        

last i wanted this to be a full meal in one dish.... this also makes it more like a casserole... the last 30 minutes after stirring it i topped it with a creamy mashed potato, a lot like a Shepard's pie.                                                    

Because of the kids i cut back on the beef by half and kept the cabbage the same. it makes a lot so no need to keep so much beef.... i also added carrots. 

This is a keeper hands down...

A superb dish requiring more spices. Added oregano, a few chili flakes, Parmesan cheese and basil. I steam the cabbage onion to reduce volume. Then pile all ingredients into a large crock pot -- cooking it all day on low.Easy to make, my husband LOVES it. It's an inexpensive dish, I take it to pot-luck dinners frequently. 
While cabbage rolls are more pleasing to look at, this dish is quickly put together.

I don't even bother putting it in the oven. I've made this over a dozen times now and I never have put it in the oven. I cover the kettle and let it go on the stovetop until the rice is tender. Cabbage holds up nicely this way. I do season it to our liking. Salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and I'm not shy with them either. It's become a winter time family favorite.

Tastes just like stuffed cabbage rolls without the work. And how much easier can it get? If you add extra spices or something else to your regular cabbage rolls, this recipe allows for that I put a half cup of red wine in the meat after it is done browning and simmer it till it is almost gone. A fabulous recipe.

I liked the idea of no fuss; but most people who give 4 or 5 star reviews did major altercations.  I could tell by the ingredient list this wasn't going to have enough flavour for our family's taste, so like many others I added garlic, worc sauce and some dill.  With those additions it is 5 star, but not without.  I also used brown rice.  Thank you for the good base recipe, add seasonings to suit your taste.

Good recipe. Add what spice and salt pepper if you want. I like to use a can of tomato soup and less tomato sauce. Also I use a bag of slaw mix and you can't get any easier than that!

I have mixed in a box of zatarans Spanish rice mix in place of regular rice. I too am adding it right after draining meat. Then adding onions and peppers. Let stand 15 - 20 min with a lid before tossing in cabbage. Bake covered with foil for about an hour. Pour tomato soup or tomato sauce on top. Bake additional 15-20 min. Serve with sour cream. It was yummy!

This is okay and the fast way to make it. What I do is fry onion, garlic, bacon and add it into the mix of ground beef. I use a can of crushed tomatoes, can of tomato paste, can of tomato soup and mushrooms and a jar of souerkraut. I've never used beef broth in it but going to try it!

I like cabbage rolls as a fall comfort food.  This recipe is a good start, but I do make some additions.  I like to add a big can of petite diced tomatoes.  I'll also add two bay leaves, minced garlic, and a little oregano.  If I make the full recipe without trying to cut it in half, I need to use the big turkey roasting pan so it all fits.  Next time, I might try it in the crock pot.

With so many reviews I almost didn't bother with yet one more but I decided that there are a couple things really worth mentioning.  The recipe as written is every good but some changes make it really outstanding.  I use the same roaster I plan to bake every thing in on the stove top to cook everything... First, melt a couple tablespoons of butter in the roaster, add cabbage and saute until lightly browned. The flavor of the fried cabbage is delicious! Remove cabbage, add onion and ground beef to the roaster, add the spices you like (I use garlic powder, cayenne, worcheshire and lots of salt and pepper), and brown until cooked.  Then stir the cabbage, rice and sauces through all and bake as directed.  I always use three cans of tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce because everyone prefers that flavor (or its the flavor they're used to eating with real cabbage rolls) and most times I substitute the beef broth with water... So just tomato soup and water... It's delicious with just that.  Sometimes I add more rice and less ground beef as some people prefer the flavor of cabbage rolls that way and it turns out very well. It's a very versatile recipe that can be adjusted easily to suit different tastes!  I hope someone actually gets to read this and can make it with those suggestions! :)

I added a few more seasonings for that Hungarian taste: Smoked Paprika,  Marjoram leaves, Basil leaves, Oregano, and Garlic.
I used white onion gor more onion punch. 
I also added diced fire roasted tomatoes.
All of the spices and onion went into the meat while cooking.
I also precooked and used brown rice.
Then mixed in rice, meat and 1 can of tomato paste mixed into beef broth for less mushy cabbage.
baked and drizzled ketchup and more seasonings over top.

This is a delicious recipe.  I lazified and sped it up by eliminating the oven portion of the process by using instant rice and it turned out just fine.  One less dish to wash by leaving out the casserole pan.  This is a one pot supper that's tough to beat. Thanks so much for sharing!

Really, really good recipe to use as a solid base.  I like to add things like garlic and diced tomatoes and seasonings--but the bones of this recipe are fantastic--my husband loves it and he doesn't like cabbage normally.

I seasoned it as I would my grandmother's cabbage roll recipe, that is, more pepper, some tomato paste to the tomato sauce, and a jar of sauerkraut to the cabbage. Very authentic and lots of flavor.

This is also good with totally medium diced tomatoes and Bush's mild chili beans. I bake for 45 minutes at 375 degree then add 2% shredded mozzarella cheese and put back in oven uncovered till cheese is melted or you can make this in a large skillet on top of the stove. For soup just exclude the rice.

This was delicious.  Since I didn't have quite as much meat (I used ground chicken) as the recipe called for, and I had cooked basmati rice to use up, I briefly sautéed the chopped cabbage and then added a bit of water to steam and mostly cook it, then I set is aside, while I cooked the meat and onions.  Then, I added as much cabbage as I thought was appropriate,* along with the tomato sauce and simmered it for a while longer. Then I added the rice and adjusted the seasoning, allowing the rice to take on some of the flavours of the mixture.  I didn't bother baking this in the oven; the dutch oven on the stovetop worked beautifully.  Next time I make this, I plan to add some chopped bacon, for more depth of flavour. (Just don't tell my Ukrainian MIL, lol.)
*Leftover cabbage is always nice to have on hand, anyway!

Delicious!  My tiny daughter went back for FOUR helpings!  My only change was to use slightly less cabbage, season the meat with Nature's Seasonings and then after the first hour of cooking, stir and add more Nature's and some dried basil and oregano on top.  Made it look a bit tastier too.  Served with hot sauce and sour cream.

I made this recipe tonight and it was OUTSTANDING!  For the most part, I made it according to the recipe.  As some others suggested, I sautéed the onions along with the ground beef and seasoned the meat (garlic powder, salt and pepper).  I used organic Better Than Bullion Organic Vegetable seasoning to make the broth.  Also, my cabbage was more like 2 1/2 pounds than 3 1/2 pounds and it seemed perfectly balanced with the other ingredients.  My 9X13 baking dish did not fit all of the mix, so I had another, smaller casserole as well.  

I have to say that this was one of the best meals I have ever made and I will make it again often.

Just delicious. I followed the suggestions from a reviewer named  "cyndib" and made in a BIG pot, draining fat before adding cabbage etc., and I also added some garlic, cilantro, and the tiniest bit of paprika because that's what I use for my traditional cabbage rolls. It was fabulous - or is. I just finished making it, and I think next time I will plan to freeze half in some microwavable containers.

This is a good foundation for a recipe. After reading reviews, I made some alterations - and it was quite tasty. I sauteed the onion and added a clove of minced garlic.  I went with 2 tsp salt, and added 1/4 tsp black pepper.  I also used 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 spaghetti sauce. Brown rice worked just fine - I increased cooking time by 10 minutes. Next time, I'll try it in the crockpot.

Have made this often since my last review and still love it.  Onice I replaced TOMATO sauce with V8 and it was yummy.  I throw different spices in, too, from time to time.  The original recipe is great as is also.  You don't have to change anything if you don't want to.

I substituted the meat with ground turkey and white rice with whole wheat rice. I loved this dish and ate the leftovers for lunch all week. My 3 year old son even loved it.

Easy-peazy and scrumptious!  Not only is this most definitely comfort food---it is even better as left-overs!  I did make a few changes, but basically followed the ingredients.  I used 1lb. Ground turkey,  1 small onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 
2 eight oz. cans of tomato sauce, small head of cabbage, chopped, 1/2 cup of uncooked brown rice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning and pepper to taste and 1 14oz. Can chicken broth. Cooked turkey until no longer pink.  Combined remaining ingredients and added cooked turkey.  Cooked as stated in recipe.  Served over steamed white rice.  YUMMY!!!   JoanBB

I have to give this a five-star rating! I JUST finished my second serving of this dish. Oh, my goodness! It is DElicious! My husband devoured it. I cut the portions down to a four-serving recipe and we still have leftovers. The sour cream on top ... nice touch. I added cayenne pepper, and always add lemon juice to 99% of what I cook up. All I can say is: THIS one is a keeper!

I rated this recipe 4 stars because of its ease in preparing, and because it tastes pretty good. I wouldn't say it was AMAZING or anything, but I really like cabbage, and I LOVE easy to make recipes, and this fits the bill. 

I took the advice of some others and made a few subtle changes.

I halved the recipe and used 2 lbs of cabbage.
I cooked it on the stovetop- in a Dutch oven.
I used at least an extra cup of broth.
I added onion, garlic, and seasoned salt to the meat while browning. 
The cook time was more like 30 minutes, but I like my cabbage quite soft.
Next time, I'll add more rice, which will probably require more broth.

Very tasty and easy to make with ingredients I generally have on hand.
As others suggested, I browned the meat (I used ground turkey)with chopped onion, minced garlic, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. When the meat was almost done, I added the rice and continued
frying for about 3-4 minutes. Then I stirred in the beef broth and tomato sauce and topped this mixture with the cabbage and cooked, covered, on the stove for 20-25 minutes (rice takes that long to cook at my 7500' elevation).  Topped serving plates with shredded Mexican cheese - delicious!  Omitted salt as tomato sauce & cheese are salty enough.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...

I scaled it back from 12 servings to 4 and was glad I did because what I made completely filled our 12 x 14 baking dish.

To keep my cardiologist happy, or at least less grouchy, I substituted ground turkey for ground beef.  I added 1/4 cup olive oil to make up for the turkey being so dry.

As I usually do, I went through several of the reviews and used many of their suggestions.  I also looked at what the "The Flavor Bible" had to say about cooking cabbage and made some changes from it.

Ingredient changes were spaghetti sauce with garlic instead of tomato sauce and chicken broth instead of beef.  Ingredient additions for 4 servings were: 1 Tbl Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 2 Tbl white wine vinegar, and 1 Tbl brown sugar.

I followed the cooking directions except that at 55 minutes I removed the aluminum foil cover (We don't have an oven proof lid for that dish.) and put it back in for 10 more minutes.  The casserole was pretty pale at 55 minutes.  The 10 minutes uncovered at 400 degrees gave it a nice "tan" with just a few feathers on the cabbage developing a char.

The flavor was out of sight!  The tomato chunks from the spaghetti sauce gave it a little color and the spices blended in very nicely with the other spices and ingredients.

Made it tonight.  We loved it.  So easy to make; however, I used ground turkey  and brown rice since we eat very little beef and prefer brown rice.  I did cut the recipe in half; that is 1 lb of ground turkey and about 1-1/2 lbs of cabbage, but it still filled a 9x13 baking dish.  The outside temp tonight was 16 deg, so this was an excellent "warm up " dish!

I give it one star, even though your site says that means I couldn't eat it. I'm a depression era baby so I eat what's on the table. But as written, it was as bland as a dish could be. And fitting a 3.5 pound chopped cabbage into a 9"x 13" dish along with the other ingredients would be worth seeing. Think I'll watch the video.

I made this yesterday, and my husband loved it. Next time I make it (and I will) , I am going to add some garlic, and some diced tomatoes. I used unsalted tomatoe sauce, so I added a little extra salt & pepper. Might add a can of sauerkraut as per some of the comments I read. Easy & very tasty!

I make this as a soup, and love it! I think the flavors combine much better this way. You can also throw in a little sauerkraut if you like it to be more tangy. I do the same thing, without sauerkraut, with unstuffed peppers. Same ingredients except cut the peppers up into large chunks, and make it soupy. Yum! And, for a change of pace, you can substitute noodles for the rice.

I've been trying to find good recipes to substitute tofu for meat and this is a great one.  Prepared it with hamburger the first time and it was 4 stars as written.  Then substituted firm tofu and it was still 4 stars in my family.  To appeal more to my family's tastes, I took cues from others and added garlic and onion powders as well as a few other spices that we like.  This is a perfect, easy comfort casserole for my family.

This casserole was delicious! It's not the prettiest dish, but definitely tasty.  Like others, I made a few changes.  I sautéed onion and minced garlic with the ground before before mixing it with the cabbage.  Rather than tomato sauce, I substituted diced tomatoes with peppers and onions and also added diced green bell pepper, carrots and corn to the mix.

To reduce cooking time and give more flavour to the cabbage:
Boil the chopped cabbage in salt water just until all denté (do not overcook). Leave cabbage separate from the other ingredients.
I used a mix of tomato soup/tomato sauce.
Cook the onions with the hamburg. Mix remaining ingredients, except cabbage, with the hamburg. Add spices to taste.
I layered as follows: Cabbage by itself in the bottom of the pan; top with the other ingredients; top with cheese and broil in the oven until cheese is bubbling. Yummy!

I tried to make this a bit healthier and used brown rice, low sodium chicken stock and turkey sausage and it turned out really well.  I'm glad I used low sodium stock because I think it would definitely have been too salty otherwise.  I didn't put it in the oven, but simmered it on the stove for well over an hour (only because it took so long for the rice to cook) and I didn't find the cabbage too mushy at all.  Really, really lovely base recipe to make your own.

This is good. common sense dictates that you crumble fry this ground beef so that you have lil bits in the bottom of the pan. Than deglaze your pan with the stock.That is flavour town folks. Also I always season my meat while cooking because that is where you build the flavours. Good Recipe.

All in all this is a 4 out of 5 stars. Definitely almost as good as most real cabbage roll recipes without the extra work.

One thing I found I will never do again is to brown the ground beef. It changes the flavour. Real cabbage rolls use raw meat. 

I'm glad I tried this though, made for a nice change.

Very good recipe and so much less time consuming than stuffed cabbage rolls.  I probably will never make cabbage rolls again due to the amount of time saved using this recipe and the similarity of the taste.  I always chop up my cabbage rolls before I eat them anyway.  I served with mashed potatoes.  I definitely agree with other reviewers that the recipe as-is severely lacks seasoning.  I added a few cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of pepper and at least triple the salt called for.  Taste it after the first hour when you stir and adjust to your liking.

Loved the simplicity and ease of this recipe! Had great taste and leftovers were even better the second day! I will never make cabbage rolls again. This was easily comparable in flavor and texture without all the extra fuss and time it takes to make them. Thanks a bunch for sharing!

This made my whole family happier than I could have imagined.  My grandmother was Lithuanian and made Haluplies (cabbage rolls) that everyone adored.  We've been able to match them over the years BUT my husband and I would take a whole Saturday to do it! 

I used this recipe adding garlic and Heinz "Hot" ketchup (mixed with hot water) in place of one can of beef broth like my grandmother and nailed it!!!! Rice and cabbage were perfect (no one likes "crunchy" cabbage here)and the flavor was great.  Thanks Buchko!

I made this last night and will definitely make it again. After reading the reviews, I loaded up on the spices while browning the meat, onions and I added green pepper. I also halved the recipe because it's just me and I'll take part of it to my elderly Mom.  I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and everything was cooked without being mushy. I think I cooked it 40 minutes, stirred and then another 20 so it was right at an hour. Very good if you love cabbage. I think carraway seeds would be good in this also.

This makes a HUGE amount.  I had to use 2 pans.  Might have been able to squeeze it into a lasagna pan.  I thought I would have enough for 2 meals; when I came back, it was GONE!!  My 4 kids scarfed it UP!  I did add more seasoning and more rice.  Used instant rice.  Added nutmeg, garlic, pepper and whatever else I usually put in cabbage rolls.  DELICIOUS!!  I think I put some diced tomatoes in with the tomato sauce.  I used pre-shredded cole slaw mix from Sams.  Making again tonight.

Some of the reviews said this was too bland.  We used Rotel tomatoes instead of plain and we substituted the ground beef with tasso.  It came out great with tons of great flavors in a true Louisiana fashion.

I've made this a few times and I really enjoy it. I make this recipe on Sunday night inorder to have lunches during the week. I attempted to use brown rice once for a healthier alternative but it didn't work well. It didn't cook all the way through.

Good and easy.  I had only halved the recipe and baked it in a 7x11 pan for the hour.  I would've preferred a little bit more rice though, but thats just my preference, may add a little more next time.

I thought this recipe was great. Makes a ton, as others mentioned, but also delicious for leftovers. I cooked in a 6-qt(?, large, anyway) Le Creuset dutch oven, which is definitely the way to go, and cooked the meat in it first, as someone else suggested. Also as suggested, cooked for much less time (1/2 hour?, stirring halfway) and added stuff to up the flavor: lots of garlic, also paprika, worcestershire and some caraway seeds.

I thought this was good.  I added a couple of things that made a nice change.  I added some hot sausage (of course cooked them first) and along with tomato sauce, I added some clamato juice.  Turned out excellent.  I also layer it in the pan. Cabbage, meat, cabbage and it turned out great.

I learned how to make cabbage rolls from an old friend that grew up in Romania. She put sauerkraut in the pot with the rolls and they are best I ever tasted. As I was too lazy to make them that way, I tried this recipe but substituted some of the cabbage with kraut. Another tip is to cut out the thick stem at the bottom of each cabbage leaf to cook faster. Also spiced it up a bit as suggested by other reviewers with garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes and some italian herbs. Very yummy and way easier. makes tons!!!

I gave this 4/5 bcs of 2 factors: 1) I think cooking this dish this way is inspired, as it gives you so much more ability to fine tune the textures and flavours of your ingredients. 2) I'm not a fair critic of cabbage rolls. I'm not sure I've ever tasted one, as my culinary background & training is Asian, Italian & French, not to mention I don't know much about casseroles. Basically, I have no clue about this recipe style.

I thought the recipe would be too bland for my taste, & listened to the reviewers who commented on that. To add flavour, I took a screaming hot cast iron, tossed the onions about a bit to get some browning but not soften them too much, then popped them in a bowl.  I added garlic, whole fennel seed, a few cloves & some oregano to a bit more oil in the still HOT pan & flashed them, Asian style, for under a minute to pop their flavour. Then I tossed in the meat - the pan was still hot enough not to stew it.

Meanwhile, in my larger cast iron I sauteed the rice risotto style to give it more flavour & bite. When it was a light tan colour I tossed in everything else, including the meat, tossed it well, covered the pan with foil & stuffed it in the oven. 

I cooked it for about an hour, stirring a few times & checking the moisture levels. It was still not quite as flavourful as I'd have liked, but the cabbage had the perfect chew, the rice was tender but not mushy & I liked the flavour combinations. Cheap, fun and easy - with leftovers. Yay!

My fiance is a huge stuffed cabbage roll fan, so I grabbed this for him and surprised him with it.  I made this according to the recipe, but it made way too much for us, so next time I will definitely half or even quarter the recipe.  It was really good, and he said it tasted just like cabbage rolls.  It is definitely on the make again list!

I made this dish Sunday night and it was a hit.  I didn't have ground beef so I used mild italian sausage which was a really good choice.  I only used 1 cup of beef broth, a good amount of italian seasonings....it was goood....we had enough for several days. Oh, my side dish was yams...AWESOME!

I adapted this recipe, but our entire family (4 kids included) loved it!

1lb ground beef
1.5 whole onions chopped
1 head cabbage chopped
3 tomatoes diced
4 large mushrooms diced (very optional... this was the 4 year olds addition to the recipe...hehe!)
14 oz tomato sauce
2 cups brown rice
3 tsp beef better than boulion
salt
pepper
garlic powder

Prepare brown rice as instructed on package.  Saute onions, cook beef, add in chopped cabbage, 3/4 cup water, tomato sauce, better than boulion, salt, pepper and garlic powder and simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add in diced tomatoes.   Combine rice with mixture and then bake for about an hour.  Yum!

So easy and yummy too. From a previous reviewer "I added a little sugar to break up the acid in the tomatoes".  Another good tip when cooking with tomatoes...add 1/2 tsp (more if big batch) of baking soda and stir. It will bubble up and negate the acid. Works great in chili and spaghetti sauces.

Really good - my teenage son raved about it!  I, too, just did it on the stove in a large pot.  Used a jar of Ragu instead of just tomato sauce, and added a couple of tablespoons of garlic and italian seasoning.  Let simmer on very low heat for about an hour, stirring every 15 mins.

I cut the recipe in half, and we liked it alot. I had to cook it for about 45 minutes, the cabbage was still very chrunchy after 30 minutes.  I added 1 TBS garlic powder, and I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce.  Will make again!

I made this twice for my family.  First time my guys ate it all.  I never got to taste it.  Today they requesated it. So I put it in the oven and went to work. This time they saved me a little...AWESOME.  My husband's only complaint was that I didn't make enough.  It's so cheap and easy to make. Easy solution to my favorite "Cabbage Rolls".  Thank you.

this is one of my favorite dishes of all time! even though i dont like the cabbage. my family has been making this for years. it's our americanized version of Kapusta :) never thought to use sauce, we always used tomato soup. Definitely like the idea of onion nomz! 
delicious, quick easy meal tho. everyone should try this and try their own twist.

I followed this recipe exactly and did not enjoy it as much as I hoped. Its did not taste anything like the cabbage rolls I grew up eating. My family who really likes cabbage would not eat this dish. Maybe with some tweaking this can be a dish we enjoy.

This is so much easier than doing to "roll" thing.  And I actually eat the cabbage this way! Taste yummy and the family loves it too.  I used crushed tomatoes though and a little more rice.

Good as a base recipe but was not my favourite. Needs spices, I added a lot (garlic and onion powder, oregano, pepper) but still needed more. There was way too much cabbage and too little rice for me and my husband. I also had to add more broth and cook longer as it was dry and the rice was still a bit crunchy. Turned out ok, but next time I'll use more rice, way more broth, more tomato sauce, and more spices!

The only thing I added was some garlic powder. Next time I would probably add a little pepper too. This recipe is a great family meal on a cold night. Everyone liked it. It's very easy and not expensive. Definately will make again.

I'm sorry but we didn't care for this recipe. I'm always looking for shortcuts but I think I'll stick with the traditional method.  My husband ate half of his serving and declared he was full, which means he didn't like it.  I found it too cabbagey and soggy :(

I love this dish!  It takes some time to cook.  Today there is 4 in. of snow outside and the cook time will help heat up the kitchen and downstairs.  It's makes alot too.  I'll be taking some to elderly neighbors later.  I replaces half of ground beef with Potter's Sausage.  Yum!!!

While it was a good way to use up a head of cabbage, it wasn't particularly flavourful and certainly no one at the dinner table was raving about it.

This was a good recipe for a quick meal.  I prefer stuffed cabbage to the casserole, but this works great as a substution if you are in the mood for stuffed cabbage without the time involved. I did substitute the beef broth for a large can of diced tomato's (and a dash of brown sugar) and put sliced onion ontop, as I do with stuffed cabbages.

My family loved this dish. I modified it just a bit though. I did try it on the stove as osmeone suggested. it took longer than 15 min to cook but thats ok. I used 2 lg onions and about 6-7 cloves of garlic. I also used boxed stock instead of canned and use pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce. Next time i make it im going to used sausage instead to add a bit more flavor. I will def making this again

5 stars with changes. I'd been wanting to try cabbage rolls forever but I was trying to use up ingredients that were going bad in my fridge, it turned out so well. I satueed onion and garlic with bacon and then added chicken stock and  torn cabbage and let simmer for a few minutes. I took out most of the bacon (personal preference). Then added 2 cups frozen spinach, 1 can of tomato paste, 4 tbs red wine, 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1 tbs yellow mustard, 1 tbs brown sugar, dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp vinegar. Obviously salt, pepper and red pepper. I mixed the sauce in with the cabbage mixture and poured over cut potato chunks in a baking dish. I baked for 1 hour on 350. This was so good. I cant wait to try it with rice and turkey or Boca burger mixture.

This has become my favorite standby!  I've been asked over and over to bring it to friends houses when I offer to bring a dish.  As well, it's been printed off and distributed numerous times.  My favorite reason for making it, KIDS LOVE IT!  Simple beyond belief and the kids eat it up like crazy!  Wouldn't change a thing.

TMy friend & brother love this casserole. I plan on serving this for dinner tomorrow for my brothers birthday ( his request) and I was wondering if the casserole can be totaly put together (rice & all) the day before baking without affecting the texture of the rice.

I pulled this recipe off of this site in 2003. It was originally submitted by Nancy. I make this recipe every once in while and love it, though my husband recently admitted, that after all this time, it is a little blan. So last night I added exactly what another review called for. I added more tomatoe sauce, more salt and more beef stock. I also added pepper which I feel was the missing ingrediant. My husband loved it!

I have made this several times. The last time I made it I gave some to my my daughter, my sister and her daughter. They  loved it as much as I do. They all want the recipe. It is a low cal recipe but I made it even more so by using ground turkey. I also used brown rice, but you do have to precook this a little before adding to the cabbage. A great, easy recipe.

This is a great recipe and a super time-saver.  Our family has always added some sauerkraut to the recipe to give it a bit more zip.  Make a double batch because it is even better the next day!

This was very good. I made it with Turkey though and needed to beef the seasonings up a bit more to make up for the bland meat. I doubled the sauce too!

I also make this in my crock pot so I come home to to the fabulous taste of Cabbage Rolls with minimal work!  I add an additional can of tomato sauce, use 1 can of chix broth and 1 can beef and also add a splash of white wine (the taste is amazing and of course the alcohol cooks off).  And of course I add garlic to everything!  A fabulously easy meal!

Tasty, easy, and feeds several. I added 1/4 lb of ground pork (reduce beef) for a little more kick. Next time I will use a spicy/medium hot pork. Easier than wrapping up the mixture into cabbage, but same great taste.

LOVED this!!  I used brown rice (it takes more liquid than white) but other than that left the recipe alone.  Wonderful comfort food, and so easy to make, this will be making regular appearances at our table.

This is an easy recipe, but if I make it again I will use pasta sauce in place of tomato sauce.There was no flavor so I added some basil,oregano,pepper & salt.Also have an extra can or two of broth and stir every 20 mins. as it will start to get drier and the rice may not fully cook.

Delicious!!! I have made this probably 10 or more times over the past few years and we truly love it. I do add garlic and extra salt and pepper. Some red bell peppers also add some good flavor. This recipe is a keeper!!

I believe that even my Hungarian grandma would happy to eat this.  It was easy to make and everyone had second helpings at my first attempt to make it.  I added about 1T each of sugar, lemon juice, and vinegar to the sauce. I also used meatloaf mix (beef, pork, veal) instead of just ground beef. This would be great for church potluck dinner!

I didn't really use to much in your recipe, but used the same cooking method. :)  This is what I used ... 1 pound Lean ground beef 1 pound Lean ground pork 1 large chopped onion  1 large cabbage chopped (about 12 cups) 1 1/2 cups cooked rice 1 1/2 teaspoon salt  dash of black pepper a dash of cayanne pepper a tiny bit of crushed chili flakes 2 large garlic cloves (crushed and chopped)  Sauce (tangy and sweet): 1 (large) can bravo tomato sauce  1 can tomato soup  3 tbsp brown sugar 2-4 tbsp lemon (to your taste)  Cook meat,onion and garlic on med. heat, season as it's cooking. cook until the meat is no longer pink. Add rice and Chop cabbage and mix with the sauce ... let it steam 5 minutes. Will makes alot so use a turkey roaster if you have one. bake covered for 1 1/2 hours. We served it over steamed rice because I didn't add enough.   I still like cabbage rolls better but would make this again. Also my husband said it  would be better with half the amount of cabbage. Makes to much but has a tons of flavour. :)

Add spices like it's your JOB and you will love this.  My changes: we live in FL and it's June- I'm not turning my oven on unless there is a dire brownie emergency!! I did everything in 2 saute pans on the stove- one for the meat and onions (crumbled turkey sausage) and one for the cabbage and rice.  I added the broth and stirred the rice like risotto, it cooked up gorgeously.  Once I added the cabbage and let it cook down too, then the tomato sauce and lots and lots of cayenne and black pepper.   Guido declared it a home run!

I tried this tonight.  I used Rotel and Tomato soup like others suggested.  I also added minced garlic.  I put it all in a crock pot.  It was still a bit bland so next time we plan on adding italian sausage with the hamburger as well as one can of sourkraut to add a little kick.  All in all....it was great.  I'll never roll another cabbage leaf.  This is a keeper!

Nice recipe, very easy and tasted great.  As per suggestions, I did add some fresh minced garlic and a few sprinkles of my fave BBQ rub spice for extra flavour, and made a half recipe which fit nicely in a 9x13 inch pan.  Also, as per Natalie I used a bottle of beer instead of broth, and it was great.  Cooked for an extra 15 minutes to get the rice just right.  Good one.

Enjoyed this, but thought it could have used a bit more spice to flavor it.  Not sure what yet, but will continue to experiment.

My family is german so cabbage rolls mean sour cabbage. I liked the idea of spicing it up as well so I used 1 can of tomatoe soup and 1 can of Rotel along with the beef broth mixed up the cooked beef, rice, onion and celery, added minced garlic, salt and lots of pepper, piled into my slow cooker and topped it with 1 jar of drained homemade sourkraut.  My husband was the first one home when I made it and he was taste testing quite freely by the time I got home!  Great time saver and a definite hit at my house.

This was ok. Mixed reviews from family. Two liked alot. Two didn't. I used brown rice and it was still a bit crunchy. I also used a bagged preshredded cabbage to cut prep time on a weeknight. Cooked while at Ty-kwan-do, came home to dinner done! Receipe made enough for family of 4 to eat plus leftovers to have a whole another meal of it again another day.

Like another, I cooked this stove top and it was delicious.  I sauteed the meat, onion and garlic, added the rice, cabbage, sauce, broth and a can of seasonal chopped tomates.  Covered for 20 minutes and it was ready! Family loved it.

We loved this and so did the kids- I will have to one and a half the recipe next time.  I used marinara sauce that was spicy which gave it pizzaz plus a bit of tomato paste.  I used turkey and chicken instead of beef.  I baked in the oven for the amount of time noted and it was really yum!  thank you.

Yummy! I used only 1 lb of ground beef, one can of tomato sauce, one can of diced green chiles, one can of tomato soup, and one can of beef broth. I also added more onions and garlic. Added the rice to the meat at the very end of cooking and baked the whole thing for 1 hour, 45 minutes. Perfect!

This is the best Casserole.  I won't ever go back to the old style again.  This is perfect.  The only thing that I changed was that I was really short on time and I boiled the cabbage and it cooked for an hour instead of 1 1/2 hrs.  Very good and everyone raved and I got asked to make it again for another covered dish get together for Christmas.

I will use less cabbage and more meat next time. Perhaps add some stewed or diced tomatoes as well. Very good, but needs a little extra.

This is a good recipe & it makes a lot.  The first time I made this dish I didnt like the beef flavor from the beef stock.  The 2nd time I used more tomato sauce, 1/2 the beef stock, & topped off w/a lil catsup.

This was super good and easy which I always look for. I spiced it up a little with some garlic powder and seasoning salt. Thanks for sharing.

I love cabbage rolls but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to make the rolls.  This was so much easier and tasted great.  The only change I'll make is to add some pepper next time.  This is a keeper.

i followed cindib's advise and made this over the stovetop in my dutch oven. it took more like 20- 25 mins for me to get the rice cooked all the way through. i added worcestershire and vinegar. i will make this again and add even more vinegar next time. was looking for something very easy to go with homemade buttered egg noodles and this did the trick. thanks for the post

This was great, but I, too, agreed that this needed more seasoning, the cabbage got a little mushy, and the rice was a little crunchy.  I wish I had read the review by "DiscoBunny" before making this.  I agree with her assessment and modifications 100%!  Will follow her suggestions next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe and the first time I made it I followed the directions exactly and it took close to 2 hours in the oven before it was done.  So the second time I made it I added diced green pepper (to give it a stuffed tomato taste to it) and shredded carrot (to hide another veggie in there).  I also used 1 1/2 cans of tomato sauce and brown rice. I browned all of the meat and veggies together, added the rest of the ingredients, put a lid on it and simmered it on the stove top for about an hour and everything was done to perfection!

I loved this recipe.  My husband was a little leery when I told him I was making a Cabbage Casserole.  But, he loved it.  I think the longer you simmer it the better it taste.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Talk about stretching a lb of ground beef!  I cut this in half and it still made a huge amount.  I love, love, love cabbage rolls, but no one else around here does.  This is a good recipe, not great just average.  I added a lot more salt and pepper than the recipe stated.  I served mine with saurkraut and sour cream.  It was easy and if you like cabbage rolls you'll probably be ok with this.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe! I made it for a quick dinner and both my husband and I thought the taste was wonderful. The cabbage didn't overtake the taste od the meat. The ony thing I would change is adding more rice (if someone realy likes rice dishes) and I also baked it in a small roasting pan. The 13x9" pbaking dish just seemed to small for all the mix.My neighbor tried to talk me into just bringing it to her house just on the merit of it being an Allrecipe dish!!!!

Pretty good the first night...made way too much for the two of us and I found I got sick of it pretty quickly (and I LOVE cabbage). Probably just a personal preference issue rather than a problem with the recipe.

Good taste - husband liked it.  For myself, I would prefer a cabbage roll, as I did not like the texture of it.

This is decent to good. I like it for a quick and easy meal but don't compare it to actually cabbage rolls. It won't measure up. It is worth making though.

Nice, comforting dish.  I used ground turkey (browned with onion and garlic, and added some worstershire and one can au jus gravy), brown rice, and 2 cans tomato soup  with some nutmeg and white pepper in lieu of the tomato sauce.  I also cut the head of cabbage into wedges to parboil, and layered cabbage, rice, ground turkey, cabbage, and tomato soup.  The result was plenty saucy for me.  Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

This one smelled so good cooking! However, the basic version of this recipe sounded way too bland for me, so I took a bunch of readers suggestions. Firstly, I added a lot of seasonings to the beef while cooking it (little bit of brown sugar, parsley, worcestershire sauce, tiny bit of balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, black  pepper and red pepper flakes). Excellent flavor. Also, I only used 1 can of broth.  I think next time I might try and boil the cabbage or something---some pieces were done, other (thicker) slices were still crunchy. The rice was a little bit hard, so I might end up cooking that next time (I just don't want it to get too mushy though). Or maybe I'll stir it more next time while cooking. It fit into my biggest pan, but just barely--it makes a lot! It's very cheap to make though. Very tasty!

I enjoyed this. My husband and daughter, not so much, but he's partial to actual cabbage rolls. I was lazy! I used around 4 cups of tomato sauce, a whole smallish cabbage (around 1½ pounds), and 1½ pounds of ground beef. I also added more seasoning (seasoning salt, garlic powder, pepper, worcestershire sauce). It was tasty enough but it took more like an hour to cook. I thought it was getting too dry, so I added an extra cup of broth... So we had more like cabbage roll casserole stew/soup. :) Oh, well. I enjoyed the flavour with the additional seasonings, and I would make it again if I was feeling lazy but wanting cabbage rolls. Thanks for sharing, Nancy!

I personally don't see the point of white rice, so I used brown and found out that they are not interchangeable here.  It didn't cook well whatsoever and stayed hard.  It wasn't intolerable though, and my roommate and I decided to appreciate the added texture anyways.   I like it spicy so I added my favs - curry, paprika, cumin, turmeric, & cayenne - makes everything that much better

I've never had cabbage rolls so can't attest to this tasting just like the real thing, but it sure is good!!!  My 2yr old and 4yr old liked it and ate every last bite.  My husband said "make again" after his very first bite.  I did add more seasonings to the ground beef and added some ground pork as well (had some that I needed to use up).  I accidently added a bit too much rice so I had to up the  liquid ingredients to compensate.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the tomato sauce.  Gave it a little creaminess.  Yummy!  Will make again.

These were a lot easier than traditional cabbage rolls. There were a few things I changed. First of all I started putting the cabbage in my 9x13 pan, and it was obvious there was NO WAY everything was goint to fit! I ended up putting in a black speckled roaster pan. Secondly, I added about 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp. chili powder, and 1/4 tsp. black pepper, plus about 1/2 of a large green pepper. I didn't have a big can of tomato sauce, so used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, plus 1 small can of tomato sauce. It definitely does get better after sitting in the frig overnight and heating up the next day. Overall very tasty and filling.

Good base recipe.  Tweaking this to suite your taste makes this dish incredible!  My changes:  (A modified halving of recipe.) Mix 15 oz. can tomato sauce; 2, 15 oz. cans diced tomatoes (I always have no salt tom's on hand, so the recipe has more salt added); 1 t. salt; 1/2 t. black pepper; 1/4 t. nutmeg;  big dash cinnamon; 1 T. apple cider vinegar; some cayenne if you like spicy; (and next time I’m adding some cumin seeds, coarsely ground).  Mixing these together the night before and letting it sit in the fridge would probably be good, I do this with my chili recipe and it’s great.  Cook 1 C. brown rice.  Brown 1 lb. ground lamb with 2 med. red onions, chopped, and 6 cloves of garlic, minced.  Drain and add 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. black pepper, and some cayenne if you like it spicy.  Steam 1 med. head of cabbage (~2 lbs.), chopped for 5 min. or so until at least half-cooked (cabbage with any kind of crunch and I don’t get along).  Put all in large bowl and mix well.  Pour mixture into 9x13 casserole dish and bake 350F for 1 1/2 -2 hrs, or until cabbage is soft.  Stir ~4 times while cooking.  Melt some cheese on top in the oven for a few min if desired.  As others have said, even better left over.  Delish!!!

This was very good.  Made it exactly as instructed.  My husband said that it had the same exact flavor as the stuffed cabbage rolls.  Be advised - it does need a long time to cook (1.5 hours), so prep it and pop it in the oven well in advance.  Serve with some nice crusty Italian bread.  Great comfort food.

Very very good. I didn't have any beef broth, so I used chicken broth instead. Added a little garlic salt and pepper. Will make this dish again!

I followed the recipe to the "T" and although I absolutely love the ease of the recipe I felt as though something was missing.I personally found it to be a bit bland. I will be tweaking it to suit my families taste next time I prepare this dish.All in all a great base recipe with unlimited versatilities....Thanks for the recipe!

did'nt have any tomatoe sauce on hand so I used 2 cans tomatoe soup and one can of diced tomatoes. Also I used 1 lb ground beef & 1 lb ground italian sausage.  This is definitly a recipe I will make again & again. Perfect for a cold winter meal.

I gave this five stars but I made changes based on other reviewers-I used two cans of low sodium tomato soup and two cans of water with a splash of Worcestershire sauce...by doing this I omitted the tomato sauce and beef broth. Also cooked the onion and a clove of garlic before adding the meat as others suggested, and I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb.ground pork. I seasoned the meat with a little onion powder, parsley flakes and a dash or two of pepper. I layed the cabbage and meat-rice mixture in a casserole dish and then poured the tomato soup and water mixture over the top. Covered with foil and baked for 1 hour. It came out fantastic! I was worried the flavor might be bland because I used low sodium soup-and basedon what other reviewers said but it was not bland at all. Very tasty!

I really like this one!  I love stuffed cabbage, but hate going through the trouble to make it.  This is a great time-saver.  I made some changes as others suggested by adding garlic to the beef and seasoning with parsley, Worcesteshire, and brown sugar.  I also added about 1/2 can of sauerkraut,  drained.  Definitely will make this again.

This is very good. I use veggie burger in place of ground beef and leave out the extra salt. You really don't need the extra salt with the tomato sauce and broth. Also, watch it carefully so the rice doesn't overcook. I usually sprinkle a little cheese on top at the end of baking so it gets a nice, melty crust. Very kid-friendly since the cabbage isn't all that noticeable. Yum!

This was a pretty good approximation of my mother-in-law's famous "Halupki" (stuffed cabbage rolls) but with much less effort. I added about half as much ketchup as tomato sauce and would try it with half ground pork to really give it traditional flavor. Since I was halving the recipe, I just did it all on the stovetop and it's much quicker that way.

I have made this a number of times for a number of audiences and it has always been a hit. I have used garlic, Italian seasoning and chicken broth depending on what was on hand, all to delicious results. Great to top off with a little sour cream or Tabasco. Very versatile recipe, thanks!

I cut this recipe in half and it filled up a 9x13 pan. We liked it. Next time I will double the onion, and cut the tomato sauce in half. I used 1 tsp of cajun seasoning instead of 1/2 tsp salt it called for. Easy meal.

I made this casserole for my husband who is a big fan of cabbage rolls, it was pretty good, however it did not taste much like cabbage rolls, I think it needed more spices. However it did save alot of time compared to making the rolls. I cut this recipe in half and it filled a 9x13 pan, so if you make the full recipe I would suggest using a larger pan. I doubt that I will make this recipe again, but if I do I will add more rice and more spices.

This recipe worked out well in a slow cooker.  In order to make it a little healthier, I used 1 lb lean sirloin and 1 cup textured vegetable protein (measured before reconstituted), 1/2c rice and 1/2c whole barley.  This recipe made SO MUCH FOOD I don't really know if we'll eat all of this, even if we freeze much of it.  I gave it only three stars because it doesn't seem like a stand alone meal to me... I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's because it's not a beautiful food.  I feel like it should be stuffed into peppers or something of the like.  I'd advise halving the recipe for those of ya'll who haven't made it before.

Great recipe. My mom used to make something similar to this at St. Patrick's day, but somewhere lost the recipe, and it's never been as good since.  This was excellent, and exactly what I was looking for.  I used only about half the beef broth, and I added some black pepper, but no other adjustments.

I cut the recipe in half and after 2 hours the rice was still not cooked and the cabbage was crunchy. Way too much time to have to spend on a simple casserole dish. I'm giving it 3 stars because aside from the crunchy rice and cabbage the flavor was decent. I definitely would not make this again without precooking the rice and cabbage. It also didn't look very appetizing. I put the leftovers in a saucepan with a little water the next day and let it simmer until everything was cooked thru finally.

Overrated!  This tasted BLAH!  No one in my family liked it!  Less tomato sauce might make it more edible and raise this rating to a **.  I was very disappointed.  Will not make again.

I made this because I grew up eating a lot of Greek/Mediterranean foods and missed being on the east coast where it's much better than here in CA.  I didn't think my husband would like it but he now requests it at least once a week!  I do add a little extra tomato sauce because we like it that way.  Also had to add a little time....and this recipe makes a ton of food!  I don't know who can fit it all in that pan but I have to use a big lasagna pan.  He's now asked me to double the recipe....can you tell he loves it????  Enjoy!

I found this recipe in a bind. I was trying to make stuffed cabbage and none of my cabbbage leaves were coming off whole! So I took all of the ingredients and made this instead! Delicious, and sooo much easier! I added diced tomatoes and spices, and some grated parm to my own serving. Great weeknight dinner.

I love the basic concept of this recipe, because I enjoy stuffed cabbage so very much... but absolutely abhor the time and effort that goes into stuffing the rolls! What I did with this was to brown the meat with the onions, garlic powder, seasoned pepper and a bit of ginger. Then I mixed it up with the other ingredients, and added a can of petite-cut diced tomatoes, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice , 2 Tbsp. brown sugar and 12 oz. beef broth. The sweet & sour touch really perked this recipe up. Be warned... it makes a ton of food, but it freezes really well. Thanks, Nancy... I would have never thought to do it this way, and we loved it!

I loved the idea of this recipe and have been dying to try it since making cabbage rolls can be a little time consuming.  But, I have to say that I think putting the time in to make the rolls is worth it. I followed some suggestions and added some diced tomatos and lots of extra seasonings, and it still tasted sort of bland and not really like the cabbage rolls I am used to.  I think it is something about the filling cooking inside of the cabbage leaves that allows the flavors to really blend together.  Anyways, this was an easy meal and hubby ate it, but I think from now on I'll use my tried and true recipe.  Thanks, though!

This recipe is FAB!  I made it for a potluck at work and it got rave reviews.  It tastes JUST like stuffed cabbage rolls without all the extra work.  I even had a couple of Polish co-workers say they liked it . . . now THAT'S high praise!  :-)  I used Fracesco Rinaldi "sweet and tangy" spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce.  YUM

Giving it 4 stars because I love the idea..it just needed jazzed up a bit. When I make regular stuffed cabbage, a big can of diced tomatoes and a big can of sauerkraut go in with them...so I threw all this in together when I made this casserole. Also, instead of baking, it's in the crockpot for about 5 or 6 hours. Smells like stuffed cabbage, and the bites I have stolen from the pot already taste like stuffed cabbage too! It's a winner...and takes about 1/10 the time that stuffed cabbage does to prepare.

My husband and I thought this was a great recipe.  We need to add more salt once it was done but after that it was great.

The difference in the way the recipe said to cook it is that instead of mixing everything in a bowl then putting in a baking dish, is that my husband cooked the meat and onions, then added everything else in the same pot on the stove.  He then cooked everything on the stove then put the pot in the oven to bake.

I usually make cabbage rolls on the weekends because I don't have time during the week. This simple casserole had the same great taste as traditional cabbage rolls but without all the work. I halved the recipe & it still made plenty. Next time I will probably use even less cabbage because my husband only likes a little bit, but I thought it was just the right amount. Thanks!

I made this recipe just as written, though I just added more seasonings.  After cooking for an hour and a half, the cabbage still wasn't cooked, and the kids refused to eat.  I chopped in thin pieces, so I don't know what went wrong.

Delicious and extremely simple.  I always add a bunch of extra rice and sauce.  When it's done cooking, I pour more sauce on top, too.

Wonderful! Li love cabbage rolls and have never made them myself because it sounded like too much work. This was so easly and tasted justl like the real deal. The only variations I made were to add garlic and cooked the onion with the hamburger. I also used about a 1/2 cup more tomato sauce than the reciped called for. Delicious!

Very very good recipe; can't say I've ever had anything like it!  Never tried cabbage rolls before, but very impressed with the taste of this casserole.  Stumbled upon it because I had a head of cabbage; didn't know what to do with it....Did add a tsp of garlic, brown sugar, and some lemon juice as suggested, also substituted diced tomatoes for sauce cuz it was what I had..oh and I halved the recipe and still have enough to eat for at least a week of lunches and suppers!

My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe.  It was delicious and really easy to make.  I followed the suggestion of several other people and cooked the onion along with the beef.  I also used shredded coleslaw mix (mostly cabbage with a bit of carrot) because I felt lazy about chopping the cabbage, and it turned out great.  Like many people I cut the recipe in half, and there was still a ton of it.  I will definitely make this again and pass the recipe along to anyone I know who likes cabbage rolls.

I made this for the first time last night and my family and I enjoyed it. The only change I might make in the future is to add more cabbage to accomodate our tastes. This may mean using an even bigger pan because this recipe makes a ton! Super simple to make and both of my kids (9 and 6) asked for seconds!

I love this recipe!!!  You can't go wrong with it.  I do add a Puerto Rican flair to it by adding a mixture of Cilantro, garlic, and green peppers.  It really makes the dish top notch.  You can add the above mixture in their whole parts or you can blend them together with olive oil and just put a 1/4 cup of it in and freeze the rest for later use.

My husband, 9 year old and father had seconds.  On the other hand I did not neither did my 6 or 4 year old.  I halved the recipe and it filled a 9x13, I also cut down on the meat which I wouldn't do next time, it needed that extra flavor.  I'll make it again, but only if my dad comes for dinner.

I love this recipe!  I didn't need so much, so I used 1 lb. ground beef... and about 2lbs. cabbage and 15 oz. tomato sauce.  Needs more salt, but great recipe.  Also its good to make a day ahead of time and just reheat... better the 2nd time around!

I added some garlic salt, garlic powder and all purpose seasoning to my meat while it was cooking, and browned my onions with the meat.  This was a very good recipe.  My husband loved it.  I will make it again. . .and the best part is that while it was baking, the smell completely reminded me of my grandmother's house!

I quartered this recipe.  Still plenty for two and leftovers.  Added the onions and some garlic to the beef toward the end of browning.  Used an 8 oz can tomato sauce and 14 oz of diced tomatoes.  Also added some ketchup and a little brown sugar.  Instead of canned beef broth, substituted about 1/3 cup of water and beef boullion.  We loved it!

Great recipe with a few modifications. Used tomato soup in place of tomato sauce as I also do with my stuffed peppers.  Also added 4 cloves of garlic, black pepper and 2 seasoning packets of G. Washington broth. My kids, who hate cabbage normallly, loved this! Will definitely make often!

I liked it, my kids and husband hated it :(
I used a can of peeled tomatoes and a squirt of tomato sauce, and I used a Thai herb mix to flavour the mince. I added the onions in with the mince and also wilted the cabbage over the hotplate first too. I used brown rice

I really liked this recipe. It was easy to make. I used tomato Juice and beef broth. I also used canned tomatoes too. I had to cook it a little longer because the cabbage wasnt done enough for me. It made enough to feed a small army. I will half it next time. It doesnt look very good but it tastes good. Also it is very inexpensive to make. I will make it often.

I liked the simplicity of this, but did not find it as good as stuffed cabbage rolls.  It was a little bland, and runny - I like more of a tomato gravy.

OMG  This is the BEST casserole!  I made it for my family for dinner and ended up taking it to our neighbors house for a group of 6 adults and every single one of us had at least seconds.  By the time we were done there was just a small bowl left over.  I only changed a few things:  added two of the smaller cans of tom. sauce, added a big box of beef broth which was only about a few oz. more than called for. and used less cabage since it doesn't fit in the pan, my head weighed in at about a little over 2lbs. To the meat I seasoned with spices and added fresh garlic about 5 cloves.  Will make often if not more!!!  Thanks

Lately I have been craving stuffed cabbage, but since it is only 2 of us to cook for that seems like so much work. This recipe was very easy & tasty. I scaled the recipe to 6 servings. Used 1 large bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix which had shredded carrots in it too. Then followed the recipe as written, Cooked it for 1 hour covered only as it seemed like the extra 30 minutes would have dried it out too much. I am sure this will taste even better for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for another keeper!

Hmm. I too found this really bland, but the second night I poured some pasta sauce on it and that made it a bit more flavorful. I think I try adding garlic and/or a flavoured tomato sauce next time.

Very good, simple and tasty, husband approved.  I sauteed the beef, cabbage and lipton onion soup (I was out of onion) together. In the same pan I threw in tomato soup, rice, minced garlic and some steak seasoning, the broth and then baked it.  Served it with garlic bread and beer, yum!

Well I give this recipe this rating because I made so many adjustments! I added lots of seasonings to the beef mixture...garlic, salt, pepper and oregano.  I parboiled the cabbage for about 10 minutes, and then when I went to stir in the uncooked rice, I realized I was completely out!!!  So, I added a cup of pearl barley instead and I must say, it came out very nice!  For the liquid I added 1 cup beef broth and 1 can of water.  Also added 2 cans of tomato soup - one stirred in, and one smoothed out on top!  My daughter loved it!

This was great.  I took the advice on the reviewer who did this on the stove top.  I browned meat with onions and garlic. Added salt and pepper. Then added in chopped cabbage and sauteed for a bit.  Added can of beef consomme, tomato sauce, can of petite dice tomatoes, dash of worchestire sauce, TB of brown sugar, TB of lemon juice and 1 tsp of caraway seeds.  Dash of basil and oregano. Delish!!  Simmer all for about 20  mins on stovetop.

I make this frequently for my Polish husband...it's his favorite dish, he could eat it all the time.  I add a bit of black pepper to this dish, and it is wonderful! Tastes just like labor intensive stuffed cabbage.

So easy! The only thing I do different is precook the cabbage a little bit. I have made this casserole over and over again and it is a winner everytime (even with the kids). I have shared the recipe with my sisters who also love it.

This was pretty tasty.  It made so much that it did not all fit into one pan though.  I think I will try adding some sliced potatoes with it next time.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

YUM!! At this time of year when cabbage is like $0.07 a pound, this is a great way to use it.  I wanted to make cabbage rolls but didn't want all the work.  This is quite a good compromise, it's very delicious.  I used 2 cans of condensed tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce and substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, and added a good dose of garlic powder and some italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  Also after baking for 1 hr at 350 I didn't think the rice was cooking enough so I raised the temp to 375, kept it covered for 15 mins, then removed the cover for the last 15 mins.  It came out great.  A little bland, but I sort of think that cabbage rolls are supposed to be a little bland.  Also the way I assembled it was very easy (mixing all of these ingredients with the cabbage in a bowl sounds impossible to me)- I put down 1/2 the cabbage in my pan.  Then sprinkled the meat over that.  Then in a bowl I mixed together the soup mix, rice, and spices and poured that over the meat/cabbage.  Then I poured the 2 cans of broth over.  Then I layered the remaining cabbage on top.  When I checked the dish after the 1st hr of cooking I stirred the mixture a bit to make sure the rice was getting enough contact with the broth, so the "layering" effect was pretty much lost.  I think I might add a splash of vinegar or chili sauce next time, just to give it a little tang.  I will definitely make this again.  Oh, and yes, it is better the 2nd day.

What a great recipe, I was skeptical but very surprised. Here's a couple changes that I made to the recipe. I added 3 tsp sugar, an extra can of tomato sauce and a 14oz. can of diced tomatoes - drained well, and it was so good....Tip, I made only half the recipe and it was still a lot for a family of 3 1/2 eaters...

This is delicious. I wanted to make it a little lower in fat so I cut the amount of meat in half and used extra lean ground beef.  I also used brown rice instead of white.  Has anyone froze this?  I was wondering if it thawed well.

My husband especially liked this (probably 4 and a 1/2 stars).  I halved the recipe & added one 15 oz. can of water (from the tomato sauce), garlic, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice & 1 Tbsp. Splenda.  I baked the dish for 2 hours to soften the cabbage.  As I have family members eating low carbs, I left out the rice.  If I wanted, I'd just serve brown rice on the side.  The consistency of the dish was more like a cabbage soup, which we enjoyed.  I served shredded cheddar at the table to sprinkle on top.  I think next time I make it, I'll experiment with leaving it uncovered the last 1/2 hour of cooking to brown the cabbage a bit.

This recipie is 5 stars all the way!!! It was absolutely delicious and tasted the same as cabbage rolls without all the extra work!! Although, I have to say it made 2- 13x9 pans of dinner, so we had plenty of leftovers, but this makes this a terrific meal for a company!! I highly recomend it!!

So much easier than make cabbage rolls, and it tasted great!  I halved the recipe, but still used a whole can of tomato sauce.  My husband and I loved it, but my kids were less than thrilled.  I also used brown rice and it was fine.  Great recipe!

Using tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce gave me the flavor I was looking for. I had to use a 16x12 pan also to fit it all. We all enjoyed it very much. It is a keeper.

WOW! That was a hit!!! When I was a kid my grandmother made stuffed cabbage every weekend it took her hours. From someone who ate this dish there entire life I must say it was GREAT!!!! The only thing I changed was using tomato soup instead of sauce. THANKS!!!!!!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but there was way too much cabbage and meat to fit in one dish !!!  Tasty though.

Easy to make and plenty of leftovers.  My husband and I like cabbage rolls to begin with, so we really liked this.  The only change I made was to use tomato soup instead of sauce.

Tastes the same as cabbage rolls, and very quick to prepare. My 4 year old ate this. But, something in the texture was missing and as far as looks go....I think presentation is important. It's a toss up as to whether I'd make this again or not.

Too bland even aftor doctoring it up.  I cut the recipe in half, added 2 cloves garlic, 2 TBSP brown sugar, 1 TBSP lemon juice and 1 tsp worchestershire sauce. Also seemed to be too much rice and that made it mushy. It was worth trying but will probably not make it again.

I added garlic to the hamburger as others suggested and I used 4 cheese tomato sauce. It was a hit with my family! I did have to separate it into two baking dishes to cook because it made so much. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy and very good.  I also halved the recipe and went with a tad more tomato sauce and added some salt and pepper as well.  My 5 year old is picky and she ate it!  This is a keeper in my house!

This is a wonderful recipe, I just fixed it tonight and the house smells wonderful. At the end, I just added a little black pepper and it seemed to bring all the flavors together. We had some crusty french bread too.  This is a great cooler weather meal, and now my mom wants the recipe.  I will be using this one again!!  We did cut the recipe in half and theirs stll plenty.  Maybe a nice potluck dish too!!!  Enjoy!!!

The recipe made more than I thought it would. I used leftover plain white rice, and baked it for half the time required in the original recipe. It is delicious. I served it to a friend to day for lunch, and she really enjoyed it too, said it was better than real cabbage rolls and asked for the recipe.

We were very disappointed in this recipe.  It got good reviews from other users but we didn't think it had a lot of flavor.  I definitely would have added chili powder.  I doubt that we'll make this again.

I didn't put near the amount of cabbage it called for.  Too much!  And the cabbage didn't soften up like it should be.  I would boil the cabbage first next time.  I used some sauerkraut. Would use more of that next time.  Needs more rice!  Don't know if I'll make this one again.

This has got to be 1 of the BEST I have ever tried! Who ever said it was geasy is nuts, You must have forgot to drain the hamburger grease. I did add a little extra seasonings and sprinkled some cheese on top last 5 min.Recommended this one to family & friends. A keeper!!!

Yum! I made this last night but decreased ingredients by 2/3, but added cinnamon, nutmeg,garlic powder,worstershire,1 can of tomato soup,a little ketchup and it was delicious! My husband is Slovac and grew up on dishes like this. He said it reminded him of his grandmothers
cooking. Thumbs up!(I didn't rate "kid friendly" because our daughter is grown and doesn't live with us, so I can't comment on that.) Thanks, Terri

I think this is a very very good recipe. I find that when I buy those large heads of cabbage, I usually get 2 or 3 meals out of one cabbage, and this is a great recipe to use for that other 1/2 of cabbage. I've made it with ground turkey and ground beef, both were great. I've added different spices and adjusted it to my personal taste and the recipe has only improved.  My husband, who loves cabbage rolls, loved it. My 5-year-old and 2-year-old also ate it, and my 5-year-old raved about it. I've passed this recipe onto friends. Like most recipes, this recipe is a starting point to adjust and change to suit your and your family's taste.

Awesome recipe... I used my turkey roaster and the size was just fine.  In addition, I did add a few spices, garlic, Mrs. Dash, etc. and
my family thought it was wonderful.  I have passed the recipe on to my coworkers
and they are raving as well!  Thanks!!

Wow! This was super simple to make and was surprised at how good it was.I added some extra seasoning while cooking the ground beef. Also, topped with an additional can(small) of tomato sauce and low-fat shredded cheddar cheese just before done. Definately will make this again although, my picky eleven year old didn't care for it.  Susan B. Kingwood, TX

This is one of the best recipes I have tried on this site.  My husband loves this casserole.  I boiled the cabbage, browned the ground beef with 1 packet of onion soup mix and also used a jar of speghetti sauce rather than the tomato sauce.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!!

Hi .. I've been making this for years .. here's how .. mix the rice & chopped onion with the hamburger & just layer some shredded cabbage & the meat mixture.  I mix a large jar spaghetti sauce & can diced mexican tomatoes & layer with it & pour the rest on top. I don't use the broth at all. The idea is wonderful & I'm sure lots of people love this as is.  You can also spread a layer of sour cream about half way through your layers & on top for a different taste.

I used half the cabbage, half the beef, spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste, barley instead of white rice. I also added garlic powder. And I cooked the cabbage before mixing. The result was excellent. Even better the next day. This is an excellent recipe.

I have made 4 recipes this week from this web site and this was our least favorite.  It isn't bad, it is just very bland and doesn't taste like the real this.  I would suggest more tomato sauce and the addition of garlic...

Yuk!  3-1/2 lbs. of cabbage chopped didn't seem to fit in the pan with 2 lbs. of meat.  Rice didn't cook.  The whole thing was pretty bad.

This was very bland, and nothing like the real thing. I ended up dumping the whole pan in the garbage. My husband and daughter hated it. The recipe needs alot of work.I think i'll stick with the real thing.

Sorry to say I wasn't too fond of this recipe.  The title "Cabbage Roll Casserole"  is the problem because this dish tastes nothing like Cabbage Rolls.  Too mushy.

I halved the recipe and added 4 potatoes and a total of 28oz (2 cans) of tomato sauce, changed the salt for garlic salt and it came out great!  It was good the next day, too!  Even halving the recipe made enough to fit my 9x13" pan!

My family loves this recipe - even the kids.  I did add some extra seasoning.  My grandmother passed away recently and she had not had a good appetite lately, but I made this dish for her and she loved it.  I got to make it for her several times and now that she's gone we are gonna rename this casserole, in my house it will be known as "Granny's Cabbage Casserole"!

As a family of cabbage roll lovers this turned out to be a fantastic idea.  I prepared this dinner last night and the family thought strange things of my new creation - but when I told them how easy it was to make and less time to prepare - we all enjoyed the meal and look forward to next time.  Thanks for sharing your great receipe and idea!

I find this recipe works best with italian-seasoned, chopped tomatoes. The longer it's cooked, the better the flavor. This might be a good one to try in a slow cooker...

My grandchildren love this easy and great dish using cabbage.  It is by far, one of the best recipes that I've used using cabbage.  It works with the "dinner on the ground" functions as well.

I loved this recipe.  I used to spend hours making cabbage rolls, but will probably never do it again.  This is a healthy and simple homemade meal that families will love.  Add some spices that you like.  We are arabic, so I made it arabic style.

I added 1/2 t. garlic powder to the beef.  I thought it was a nice casserole, but somewhat on the bland side.  My husband said he liked the taste, but we wasn't crazy about the texture of the cabbage.  I think I'll cut them into smaller pieces next time.

I also used 1/2 dice tomatoes and 1/2 tomato sauce. I also Increased temperature to 400 and baked for 1 hour without any issues. My family loved it and requested this recipe be a keeper.

As a vegan with a couple of other vegan family members, I used a meatless form of ground beef and veggie broth.  Added a few Italian seasonings to the sauce and this meal came out sooo delicious!!!  Even the meat lovers in my family loved it!

Recipe as written seems like it would be bland as all.  Maybe that's how piggies are made some places?
Liked it, but modified it. 
I was low on ground beef, so I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb sweet Italian sausage. 
I recall locals use tomato soup, so I used 2 cans of it plus one can of water. 
I used a tsp of Adobe (salt, garlic & onion powder), black pepper, and some minced garlic. 
The beef broth seemed excessive. My rice was  Jasmine which only requires 1.5 c water to 1 c rice? Plus the cabbage would lose water.  So I only used 2 cups of beef broth. 
Only cooked it 75 min total, 15 extra after the initial 1 hr covered .

The ingredients were fine. I believe the better way is to do the, Unstuffed Cabbage Rolls. One pot putting cabbage in last so not to be mushy.

I did 1 year cabbage and halved everything else,to fit into 8 x12 pan perfectly. I also added garlic,bacon and diced tomatoes. I actually liked it. I haven't ever liked cooked cabbage before. Hubby really liked it. Will be making repeatedly! Thank you.

I replaced 1/2 of the beef with turkey. Switched out 1/2 of the broth for V8. Melted shredded cheese on top at the end.  Definitely worth repeating:)

So yummy! Note: watch the video. The recipe does not include all of the ingredients and what to do with them. Garlic and Paprika are those I am talking about and they had a nice flavor. Only the video mentions these. Will definitely make again!

Very good! I took the advice of the other speed chef and did the entire thing on the stove top in a big kettle. Cut the time down drastically. I also added extra garlic, s & p, italian seasoning and a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper. 
Will make again!

We love this recipe!  I usually added some sweet bell peppers and Italian type spices.  Plus I cut the rice in half.  I’ve even made a vegan version for our son and daughter-in-law.  They loved it too!  I omitted the beef, used a vegetable stock and black beans.  The whole family loved this version too!

The base recipe for this casserole is good, but I've made it twice now and agree with many other reviewers that following the baking instructions as the recipe is written will not cook the rice properly. I have popped this in a slow cooker on high for about five hours and that works great; I made it again last night and started in the oven at 375 but after 90 mins switched the mixture back to a large skillet and simmered on medium for about 10 minutes because the rice still wasn't done. I added 2 tablespoons of garlic powder, 1/3 cup white wine and 3 tablespoons sugar while cooking the meat, I substituted lean ground mild pork sausage for ground beef, and I used a 28 oz can of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also added 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar to the recipe after it was mixed to add some of the "sweet and sour" element most cabbage roll recipes have. The finished recipe is great topped with shredded cheese or sour cream.

This was awful.  First off the quantites are way too much for a standard 9x13 pan. I had to use a 10X14 lasagne pan and it was overflowing.  

Secondly it didn't cook through.   I followed the directions exactly, as I always do on a first recipe.  And after just over 1.5 hours in the oven, the internal temp was only 140 (yes my oven is spot on and was well heated).  The rice was raw - completely crunchy and disgusting. 

End result - completely inedible.

This recipe is terrible! If you follow the directions the cabbage will end up raw and crunchy. The cabbage needs to be cooked first and then added to the mixture with double the amount of ground beef and more seasonings. I don't know how this recipe made it onto the website.

I read the reviews and decided the lady that made this  on the stove top was right on!
I used one of the cups of minute rice that goes in the microwave for one minute.  Just tossed it in. I used one can of diced tomatoes(spicy red peppers) and half a jar of Bertolli 5 cheese tomato sauce. I used napa cabbage which i find doesnt stink the whole house like regular cabbage. And used beef broth and 2 Bay Leafs.
This was ready in 30 min but i let it simmer for an hour. Yummy!  They say its better the next day, I'm about to find out!

Awesome recipe. Just made a few tweaks. Added a can of marinara sauce as I didn’t have any tomato sauce. Added basil, thyme, mushroom and edamame when cooking the beef, onion and garlic. Used brown rice instead of white and let it sit with the beef mixture and beef broth for 15mins before popping into the oven. Did not put salt as my beef broth was quite salty. Loved it. And will definitely make it again

I consider my self a very experienced cook. This dish, sounded good, but it wasn’t for sure.  It was very, very dry, you could hardly swallow it.  Thank God for every cooks and Chef’s saving grace called Catsup!  Won’t be making this again.

This recipe tasted great and very convenient to make!  Don't understand the low review other than the quality of ingredients used.  Much simpler than making roles and tastes even better the second day.  I did not diverge from the recipe and it was perfect!  This such an easy recipe that you could easily alter for different combinations or taste buds.

It was o.k,  not great.  Way easier than the old fashion way.  I think I just prefer to make them the old way, my rice got mushy in this recipe.  I like cabbage rolls so it's not the issue with the flavors.

I made the stove top version as others had mentioned.  I did add paprika, salt, pepper and garlic.  I will definitely make it again.  It was easy, tasty and leftovers for lunches during the week.

This was not bad, but I made the whole recipe and the rice and cabbage was still crunchy after cooking 2 hrs in the oven.  I transferred what we were not eating to a pot to continue cooking.  It was better when the rice was done.  

Changes I made were to use 1 lb hamburger and 1 lb mild ground Italian Sausage.  In addition to the ingredients listed in the recipe, I added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, 4 cloves minced garlic,  1 t. Italian Seasoning, 1/2 t. pepper, 1 c. shredded carrots,  and used 1 carton of Kitchen Basics Beef Stock instead of two cans of beef broth.  I think the Kitchen Basics Beef Stock has more flavor.   I have a huge baking dish and it was full to the brim so I'm glad I put a cooking sheet under it to cook to catch the liquid spillage.  The whole recipe will not fit in 1 normal 9x13 dish.  Next time I will just cook it in my stock pot as others have suggested. If you do this in the oven, I'd suggest maybe cooking your rice first.

The sauce is off.
Besides the reg. tomato sauce, one must add ketchup and vinegar to taste, in order to make it slightly sour/sweet.
Also, try using arboreo rice.

I used to make the rolls, too, but it's a lot of work.  In essence, this is the same thing, just dissected!  I learned to make this quick and easy dinner while I was on the fat flush diet about 13 years ago.  It's a winner!

Next to regular stuffed cabbage this is one of my favorites. When I make mine I only use about half that much cabbage but add a package of VERY WELL drained and rinsed Frank's Sauer Kraut.
(It's usually next to the refrigerated Polish/ Smoked sausages. I can't stand the canned kraut!!)
The kraut adds extra zing and is how the old (prob 40 at the time, but I was a kid) neighbor lady from Poland(??) used.

Used only 1.3 lbs of burger and only one can of beef broth. Still made a lot. A little bland but still quite good if you love cabbage.

We actually really liked it!  Grandson ate over half the pan!  I was surprised.  Husband added some hot sauce to his...he's not really a cabbage eater.  I loved it.  Will make again definitely.

I had never made cabbage rolls but my boys "encouraged" me to try - it was my husband's favorite from childhood.  Instead of making the traditional first I made this for my woman's group at church.  It received rave reviews from my ladies!  It gave me the courage to make the rolls.  Never going to do that again!  It's cabbage roll casserole for all!

I made this recipe when family was visiting because Our Mom used to make cabbage rolls and I didn’t have her recipe. Thought this would be pretty close. It wasn’t until I was putting it together that I realized I needed sauerkraut in it if it was going to taste like Mom’s. Didn’t have any on hand so made it to the recipe. It was good, but next time I’ll add sauerkraut and I think it will be great.

It tasted just like a cabbage roll but I didn t have to go through the rolling process, which as we all know can be demanding. Next time I am totally adding sausage with the ground beef!

Glad I read some reviews as they were helpful. I followed the recipe close. The changes I made were 2 bags of coleslaw instead of cabbage, didn't have onions so used onions powder, about a 1/4c of brown sugar. Also cooked it on the stove which was a time saver! Thanks for that idea from a couple of reviews. Think it needs more seasoning but will probably make it next time like I make my cabbage rolls, use coleslaw and cook it on the stove again. Great great recipe!!! My 3 1/2yr old ate it and liked it!

I did as another review- after browning the beef with the onion, I added the rest of ingredients - put a lid on IT- 15 min later it was done.  Instead of rice I cooked cauliflower rice in microwave and added that to. The cooked recipe. Served  with plain yogurt and salsa which made it much tastier. A GREat low cal meal??

I made it exactly as the recipe said except I did use one lb. of Ground Chuck and one lb. of Ground Venison.   It is delicious.        It would not however fit in my 9 X 13 Cassarole dish.  I had to use the next larger size.  I will keep the recipe and definitely make it again.  We all loved it.

I always make changes but it turns out well. I typically add more sauce, about a can and a half. This time I didn’t have beef broth so I reluctantly used chicken broth. Guess what?  Still delicious!

I loved the dish,  so much easier than rolling each leaf.  It was enjoyed by the family and I know that I will use it again.

Followed recipe and added my favourite tomato sauce, worchestershire sauce and spices as per comments of others.  Did not like the smell of the dish while it cooked, it did not look appetizing at all.  The flavour was not great and I feel this was a waste of ingredients.  Tossing the balance out!  Sorry All Recipes, this one is a definite NO on my books!

We loved this on a Friday night after a long work week.  The hubs & I kicked this out the short-cut way in less than an hour, prep time included, by using the stove top method that reviewer "cyndib" wrote about.  The rice was done for us after 20 minutes of simmering with the burger, cabbage, tomato & broth mixture. Top notch comfort food, quick & easy.  Will certainly make again.  We served with a bit of sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Super yumm.

I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it was rather bland. I went back and read the reviews and added a lot of seasonings to the leftovers and it was much tastier.

I used venison burger instead of beef and home canned tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce. I would use more broth next time as the rice was a little crunchy. I don't eat this, I made it for my boyfriend. He said it was delicious except for the rice not being cooked all the way.

I decided to make this in a pot as others had done. And I halved the recipe. I browned the beef and the onions together and added garlic powder, pepper, salt and oregano. Once the beef was browned, I added 15 ounces of the tomato sauce, one can of beef broth, a half cup of uncooked rice and a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut out the acidity of the tomato sauce. Once this mixture came to a simmer, I added about a half of a shredded cabbage. Turned the heat down, covered the pot and let the cabbage steam for 15 minutes. My 5 year old and I like it best with sour cream. This was really fast and I’ll probably make it again.

It wasn’t “bad” but no “wow”. Overflowed my 9 x 13 and I used less cabbage then called for (1 head only). Bland, better with hot sauce added for serving.

Loved it; adding to the rotation. Like other reviewers, I halved it.  I did the prep in an oven-safe pan. Inspired by my JOC cabbage roll recipe, I added 2 teaspoons of vinegar and 1/2 tablespoon of sugar.  Since other reviewers complained of blandness, I made sure to add plenty of salt and pepper, plus 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and 2 teaspoons soy sauce (for umami). I cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. The rice was perfect and the cabbage al dente, which is how I like it.

I’ve been wanting to make this recipe for a long time and today was the perfect rainy day to give it a go! I followed the recipe with minimal alterations. I chopped 3.2 pounds of cabbage in chunks as I don’t like cabbage when it’s cut too small and tends to disappear especially for the long cooking time. I used only 1 14 oz can of beef broth which worked out perfectly. After mixing all ingredients in a very large mixing bowl, I had enough to fill two 13 X 9 pans. I baked the covered pans using the convection oven set at 400 degrees for 50 minutes, then uncovered for 10 more minutes. I served the casserole with extra sauce on the side for those who like more sauce. I added red pepper flakes and a little hot sauce for me and my son since we like a little heat. I served the casserole with corn muffins and the outcome was a big hit at my house. Will make again with no additional changes! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Much easier then making cabbage rolls. Tastes yummy! Great to have on hand when you’re hungry, as it makes a nice sized portion for left overs.

This dish was good. I did what others suggested and I seasoned the meat generously with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and minced fresh garlic. Then added all the ingredients except cabbage to the meat pan, covered and let it simmer for 15 minutes so the rice could cook mostly. My favorite cabbage roll recipe has sauerkraut and bacon on top so after mixing the meat mix with the cabbage in a glass dish, I drained a jar of sauerkraut and spread on the top. Then I added bacon slices on top of the sauerkraut. Baked uncovered for 50 minutes. Then turned on the broiler for a few minutes to gently crisp the bacon. With this addition the dish is five stars! My 14 year old son ate three servings of this so I’d say it’s a keeper and easier then making cabbage rolls.

This casserole is far from a good substitute for stuffed cabbage. There's very little flavor, not enough rice, and it devolved into a glob of mush after stirring as the recipe directs. Trying to fit it into a 9" x 13" baking dish is impossible. I will never make it again, except perhaps for my beloved dog who liked it very much. (But he also eats dirt.)

This was great! It made a huge amount and we wanted some quicker, so we did a smaller portion in the microwave in 7 minute batches, stirring each time. I also added an extra cup of water or so at the stirring phase. My daughter also added some salt and pepper and a can of tomato paste.

I will make this again for sure! It tastes exactly like the cabbage rolls that I’ve made for years, but so much easier! I will make it more often because it is less labor intensive than the old version.

First of this recipe is a winner and I will definitely make it again. Many thanks to the chef that submitted this dish.

However, there are a few changes that I made and would like to share. First is the recipe as written makes a lot of food. So much that it will not fit into one 9X13 dish as indicated unless your dish is 4" to 5" deep. I used two dishes and lets say it was a tight fit.

The ground beef does not get browned in oil as indicated. I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. I increased the rice by 1/2 cup and added the rice to the cooked meat. I also added the onion to the cooked meat.  This dish was done in 60 minutes and ready to eat. I served it with mashed potatoes and tomato gravy.

I didn't like the end result; however, I think I know why.
 I found the recipe, and transferred it without watching the how-to video.
The printed directions say nothing about browning the onion and garlic with the meat. THEY SHOULD!!!
Also, the pan size in the printed recipe is 13x9x2. That pan size  is TOO SMALL for the amount of combined ingredients.
Being an experienced cook, I should have taken it upon myself to fill in the gaps of the printed recipe, or watched the video. 
But, isn't it the responsibility of a good printed recipe to state ALL of the required steps in order to achieve a good outcome?
What if the next person who finds this recipe can't watch the video? I couldn't. I was pressed for time and looking for a manageable dinner recipe that could later be used for left-overs.
I experienced a COLOSSAL FAIL.
As I said, my 13x9x2 was a tidge too small. When the dish began to coalesce in the oven, the juice dripped out from under the foil and onto the oven floor, causing the oven to smoke.
The cooking time, for the printed recipe, should have been longer than an hour and forty minutes.
Even at 90 minutes, the long grain regular rice had not yet begun to soften (following the printed directions).
The taste was WAY TOO oniony, and garlicy. This was due to the fact that the printed directions DO NOT mention sauteing the onion/garlic either before, or with the hamburger.
As for the cabbage? One good sized head of cabbage should contain enough leaves for this dish. One go

Delicious and tastes just like cabbage rolls!  It does make a lot.  I used the recommended amount or cabbage and ended up with two 9x13 pans, which was fine with me.   The second time I made it, I cut the recipe in half and had enough for 5 people with a cup of leftovers after everyone had second helpings.

Wow, delicious! Actually made 2 pans of 9x13.  We added mushrooms and used basmati rice. Fantastic meal - will be added to the circulation and made as a special meal for special events.

It was really good.  I did modify it just a little.  I only used about 2 1/2 lbs of cabbage.  I also added a can of tomato soup and a can of diced tomatoes. There was no way the amount would fit in a 9X13 baking dish so I used a roasting pan in the oven.

I halved this recipe with no problems - definitely needs more seasoning per individual tastes (ie salt, garlic, oregano, basil)  I also browned meat with onion, then added rice, tomatoes, seasoning, broth and let sit while I chopped the cabbage.  Cooking time was accurate - rice was cooked but cabbage still had some crunch.  Will make again.

This is a terrific recipe! Not a whole lot of time or ingredients, which makes it a go to recipe for short notice and/or  quick night dinners. I did add a large can of petite diced tomatoes and medium can of tomato sauce. I thought it wouldn't have much taste because of no seasoning other than salt, but I was pleasantly surprised of the taste. It was so good and a definite repeater.

I was not impressed with the results I had. There was not enough sauce to this recipe for my taste. I will go back to the makeshift way I have always made this when I'm too lazy to roll the cabbages.

Great dish, but I will add more meat next time.  Also, the rice and cabbage soaked up all the liquid within an hour.  I used one head of cabbage, about 3 pounds.  I will add more tomato sauce next time.  I had to put it into a roaster, because it was way to much for a 9 x 13  pan.

I substituted brown rice for white rice, but it was not completely cooked, too chewy.Next time I will partially precook the rice.  I also substituted roasted pepper Marinara sauce for 1/2 the tomato sauce. Recipe was easy and delicious! I will make again!

I had a 7 pound head of cabbage that was on sale at our grocery store and I used half of it to make this dish. I followed the recipe closely except I made my own tomato sauce. I will definitely make this again.

Yes I did use a substitution. I used Vegetable Broth b/c I didn't have any beef broth. This recipe is extremely delicious. I baked it and almost couldn't stop eating it. Very tasty.!!! I would suggest some condiments with it. Like sour cream would be a yummy dip dip with it. Or have some chopped cilantro or green onions.

This was so disappointing. The sauce had too much tomato taste. My regular cabbage roll sauce would have been ok. Have people really tasted this?

This dish was great! The only things  I did differently were season the cabbage as I layered it in the dish and I used ground turkey instead of hamburger meat.  Several other reviewers said they did it and they were right! But it was great and I will make it again! Great comfort food!

This one gets 5 stars!  Its very much like the one that a German restaurant that was in town offered on their menu.  The owner taught me how to make it.  The only thing that they did different was to layer the cabbage and beef mixture alternately, beginning and ending with cabbage.  Fantastic meal made either way!

Heaven on a fork!!! Best dang recipe 'Ive tried in a long time! An instant favorite. Only thing I did different, was took the advice of a poster and made it all in one large pot on the stove. Took 15-20 minutes and ready to eat! AWESOMENESS!!!

This was fantastic!  My husband loved it. It tasted exactly like my stuffed cabbage.  I added a few of my special touches like onion onion, garlic-garlic, pepper, 3 tbsp. brown sugar and cooked it in the crock pot.

Great recipe, the cabbage was moist and tender and makes for a well balanced meal for lunch or dinner. has a terrific balance of protein, carbs and fibre. I used turkey instead of beef and chicken stock. Tastes excellent when topped with some sour cream and fresh parsley!  I will make it again!

Way easier than rolls but a bit on the bland side.  Gets better with each day of sitting and or reheating.  The sour cream does change the emphasized favor from tanging to creamy sweet.  Very fast to make though.

Just finished dinner,  I thought it was Amazing! Hubby is not usually the hugest fan of cabbage but he cleared his plate! Only deviances from the recipe were halving it, because it's just the 2 of us, adding  garlic paste, because Garlic! And I sauteed the cabbage and onion a bit because we like the taste of the browned cabbage with our typical cabbage rolls. Thanks so much for the inspiration! The alterations were purely out of personal taste and I have no doubt that it's equally as amazing as written!

Made this last night for dinner, it turned out very good. My 93 yr old dad who eats like a bird, went back for a second serving, so he definitely liked it.  If your making it for 2 or 3 people,  cut the recipe in half.  I definitely will be making this again, and share the recipe with friends and family.

My wife has long had a similar recipe, but it was my turn to cook. The biggest difference is the Beef Broth. I pretty much stuck to the recipe (halved as there is only 2 of us)  though I did only cook it for 1 plus 1/4 hours. The flavour was good, the cabbage was definitely not mushy (as some have said) and there were plenty of left overs. I used 2 casseroles knowing I would freeze one. It's a keeper!

Easy to make and bake.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, but missed the slightly sweet/sour taste of traditional cabbage rolls.  I got out a bottle of Worcester  sauce and added some on my plate and it helped.  I would make this again but would add some brown sugar, lemon juice and Worcester sauce to the tomato sauce prior to adding to the rest of the ingredients.  Overall, this recipe is tons easier than assembling the traditional cabbage roll!

This recipe is delicious.  I made it in my Instant Pot and cut the recipe in half. I browned the meat on sautee mode.  Then I added dried onions (instead of cutting onions) and theother ingredients and set the timer for about 14 minutes.  Probably could have had a shorter cooking time. Very good recipe!

The video for making this meal is different from the recipe:
--different size pan
--add carrots (video)
--cover to cook 30 more minutes after stirring (recipe)
--cook uncovered 40 minutes more after stirring (video)
Found the video to be more precise!! 
Need to match the recipe to the video!

This was a pretty mushy mess. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef as we are on a lower fat diet due to heart issues. I should have known that turkey doesn't have the same mass as beef and the amount of liquid was just too much. I even left off the foil for the last 30 minutes. 

The good news is it tasted ok absent the texture. Good flavor. I did add some hot pepper flakes, cayenne and some dried herbs as well as a dash of Worcestershire sauce plus 3 cloves of garlic. So the taste was fine but the texture was not.

I don't know if using the Turkey instead of the beef was an issue. Next time I will reduce the amount of liquid and/or increase the amount of rice to see if I can get it to set up firmer.

Husband didn't care though. He loved it.

I was disappointed in the results. I tried using more spices as noted on a previous review using oregano, Italian seasoning and hot flakes. It still is very bland. Plus, I would advise anyone to cut the recipe in half. It makes industrialized portions!! Just not for me!! Very let down. Will not make again.

I used chopped cabbage. Saves time! Plus I’ve always made the rolls using marinated leaves so I used 20oz fresh cut cabbage & 1 jar of sauerkraut (good kind, no vinegar, drained but no rinse). I like meaty dishes so I put in 3lbs of gr beef. This is absolutely amazing! Same taste for a quarter of the time I’d need to make the rolls. Absolutely love it!
I agree with previous comments: yes to chicken stock/broth, yes to one pot that goes stove to oven. 1hr at 350 was enough for my rice

I think the recipe is a great base - but found it a little bland.  Next time I think I will add garlic, hot sauce and more salt and pepper.  Not bad - just not as good as I think it could be.

Love this recipe!  Great comfort food.  I add some garlic when sauteing the hamburger,   other than that I don't change a thing.  It makes alot, so be prepared for leftovers, which is not a bad thing because it is just as good reheated as it is when freshly made.

I have never had or made a cabbage roll, but I like cabbage so this recipe caught my interest.  I read alot of the reviews prior to making it  to see if I could see any modifications needed. I made it pretty much the way it was said, except I reduced the ground beef to 1lb instead of 2lbs. I used a whole medium onion, which I sauteed with the meat. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder & montreal steak seasoning to the meat. I used 1 (29oz) can of tomato sauce and almost an entire medium sized cabbage. I also added some worcestershire sauce & a few dashes of hot sauce. I cooked at 400 degrees, covered. It still took about 1.5 hours before it was ready. It was tasty & delicious & most of all my kids ate veggies!!!

I made this the first time following the recipe to a T. Mushy cabbage, bland, and starchy tasting. So, I made it again. I did not brown the ground beef first, I did cook the rice first. Instead of using Tomato sauce and beef broth, I covered the whole casserole with a large can of V-8 juice. Cut the cooking time down to 45 minutes and it turned out great.

I haven't made this yet, but it sounds awesome..... however I wanted to say that all you people who 'added' spices to this or any recipe for more flavour - would you PLEASE say HOW MUCH of each thing you added?  Some of us aren't mind readers!'-
Also..... my hubby is allergic to anything 'tomato' - does anyone have a good substitute for tomato sauce, paste etc. for things like cabbage rolls,  lasagne, etc????

I didn't make this recipe as written but it sounds a lot like how I make mine with a few minor differences and it really is soooo easy to throw together and it is delicious. Instead of tomato sauce and beef broth, I use V8 juice. It sounds very tasty this way too so I am gonna try it this way next time I make it. I will add the results onto this comment afterwards

I will par-cook the cabbage next time...Some of it was still hard, even after cooking it an extra 1/2 hour.  Oh, and I did put some grated cheddar on top 15 minutes before I took it out of the oven.    We all really enjoyed it and yes I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used to make regular stuffed cabbage but then came across this recipe & tried it out & my family loves it!  So, now instead of me making cabbage rolls for our Holiday Dinners, I make this casserole.  Been making it for 4 years now! I love it!!

Scaled it down by half but kept the original ingredients without otherwise changing anything. Can't figure out how such a simple recipe could be so delicious, but it was. This one goes into the regular rotation. Thanks for sharing.

This was dinner tonight, and it was fabulous!! I followed the changes made by another reviewer and made the whole thing on the stove, and added Italian seasoning, salt and oregano. I also halved the recipe for my family of three, and despite seconds for everyone, we have lots of leftovers!! This will be in the regular rotation from now on!!

I used a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, undrained, along with about another 1/2 cup water, as I added 1/2 cup rice into the mix to cook. Turned out great!

Very meh. I ate it becuase I was hungry, but I didn't like it. I tried the popular tips of: sauteing the onion with the beef, seasoning beef (with salt, pepper, garlic powder, ground oregano, and Italian seasoning), and adding in Worcestershire sauce. Someone noted at 400º it would be done in an hour, still took an extra 15 minutes as it was still too wet, but the cabbage and rice were mushy. Tried the suggestion of adding in a dollop of sour cream and/or some shredded cheese. Was better, but just not good. Even without the mushy texture, the flavor was just lacking a lot. My husband ended up going for leftovers instead, after trying a few bites. Not sure how this got so many good reviews. Glad I only made half.

I did make a slight change. I used ground beef and sausage. I made it for our church potluck and everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again and again. My picky sister even loved it and asked for a to go serving. ??

I’ve made this twice and both times it was delicious.  The first time I made it true to the recipe  and it was very good.  I made it a second time much later so I thought I had all the ingredients but I didn’t.   I ended up using fresh tomatoes  and mushroom soup instead of the beef broth.   I  also threw in some schredded carrots and a chopped sweet bell pepper.  It was still really yummy.  I’ll definitely make it again.

Good recipe to build on. I didn't like that the video had different ingredients from the written version (I followed the video ingredients). Next time I will add some Italian seasoning (oregano, parsley, basil, garlic). I did use 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of the recommend 1 can of sauce.

I’ve made this as written and it’s delicious. Today I didn’t have enough broth so I substituted a can diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano for the other can of broth and simmered on the stove and it’s still a winner in our house!!

This recipe needs to be rewritten. It needs to be a stovetop recipe so some won't end up with crunchy rice. But also, the amounts that it calls for does not fit in a 9x13. It fit in two 9x13s. Also, I live in a country where they make cabbage rolls as a national dish. It is done stove top and they add dill, fried carrots and onions, and add a splash of lemon. This dish is delicious when it works. And I usually love Allrecipes recipes.

Great recipe.  I halved it and it was plenty for four.  Could have used a bit more salt and pepper.  I added a can of drained tomatoes for the last 1/2 hour which added even more flavor.

Love this dish!  I make a vegan version with vegetable broth and beefless grounds from Gardein.  It's in the weekly rotation and makes so many leftovers even after I half the recipe.  My husband and I both love it and it freezes well too!

We all loved it.  Made a couple changes: used one head of cabbage as 3 1/2 lbs seemed like a lot of cabbage, substituted 1 lb Italian sausage and used 1 quart of my home canned marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.

I actually made it from another site and it had 2 table spoons of Italian seasoning. That's why I only gave it two stars since it didn't include the Italian seasoning. Otherwise, this recipe  is healthy and will fill bellies.

This is a Russian/polish dish. Not meant to be Italian. Forget all the fancy add ins and changes! Raised in a Russian household, this is a classic lazy mans stuffed cabbage. I’ve made this several times and the only thing I OMIT is the 2nd can of broth. Too much liquid, it’ll boil over in the oven. My family loves this AS IS.

I don't use beef broth. I use V8 juice or tomato juice as the liquid.  I layer everything and slowly pour the juice mixture over it.  I also always use cooked brown rice.  It takes longer than I expected for the cabbage to soften....about 60-75 Minutes.

So easy when you just cook the whole thing on the stovetop as the top reviewer suggested.  I take the "efficiency" (aka laziness) one step further (and add a little healthiness) by using ground turkey and then don't even need to drain it.  I also add garlic, cracked black pepper, and a little basil and oregano.  Great recipe for a weeknight!

My husband loved this dish. I took one reviewer’s opinion and made this in a stovetop version. I added 12 cups cabbage and the rest was the same. Very simple. I only added one pound of hamburger which was, I feel, a mistake. Definitely needed more. Mixing this all together on the stovetop saved much time. One warning: needs more spices, I added garlic salt and pepper to taste. 2nd warning: this makes a lot! I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this with brown rice that I cooked in  advance, then I halved baking time. The cabbage came out perfectly cooked. There was extra liquid doing  it this way , so you could cut back on the stock. I just served with a slotted spoon.

Delicious and much easier than rolling cabbage rolls. I made 3/4 of this recipe. I didn’t have canned tomato sauce so mixed about 14 oz canned diced tomatoes, 1/3 cup ketchup, 3 TBs coconut sugar, 2 TBs vinegar, 1 small can tomato paste salt and pepper and cooked over medium heat for about 15 minutes to combine and reduce slightly and continued on with the recipe. I did bake this in the same skillet as I used to brown the beef as it’s oven proof and has a lid, which made for easy clean up!

Needed more salt and a little soy sauce
!0 minute prep time is a joke. more like 30 minutes with chopping onions, cabbage and browning hamburger. More like 40 minutes.

But it sure taste good!!!   Steve

Read all the reviews and made it last week.  Threw the entire batch out after several attempts to eat it.  Just horrible.  Followed directions but was absolute garbage in my opinion and other who I asked to try it for me.  Will be cautious about wasting time on some of these 4 or 5 star recipes.

The taste of this is very much like cabbage rolls.  You do have to watch the timing to avoid overcooking and it begs for some additional seasoning but overall it’s really good and I’ll definitely make this again.

First of all, I grew up eating Cabbage Rolls made from scratch, since my mom was of Polish descent.  They're a lot of work, so I decided to try this 'easy' recipe.  I was very disappointed w/the result.  It was mushy, and didn't have much flavor.  The easy way out doesn't always produce the best result.  I'll stick to making Cabbage Rolls in the traditional way.  The 'cooks'  who rated this recipe 4 or 5 stars were obviously novices, or never had 'real' cabbage rolls.  Sorry, but no good cook would give this recipe more than 2 or 3 stars, or even that.

I halved the recipe and it was more than enough to fill a 9x12 dish, which as an experienced cook I figured was the case. I'm glad I didn't waste 2 lbs of ground sirloin for the full recipe. A lot of people don't like cabbage, but this recipe absolutely failed to deliver as an easier version of cabbage rolls that might be more attractive to those who aren't fans .  Zero flavor--reminds me of college dorm food from the 1960's.

I am NOT a good cook and only cook when I have to LOL.  Has anyone made this ahead of time and then froze (i.e. in prep for hunting camp)?  Any ideas on what type containers to use to go from freezer to micro?  Or would you thaw & warm up in foil container in oven? and, if so, for how long and at what temp?  Hunting camp needs to be quick & easy.  Thanks for any feedback.

This was very good.  Used chicken broth instead of tomato sauce as my hubby can't have tomatoes.  Added a couple of teaspoons of mustard and some worchestshire.  Came out delicious and very easy.

It was pretty blah.  I ended up adding an extra can of tomato sauce to make it better.  I'm not sure what it is, but something's missing with this one.

This recipe has a lot of potential. Definitely needed a little extra bit of spices to give it that extra kick of flavor. I added some garlic salt and black pepper, which helped. This was a hit with my fiancé, and I will definitely make it again!

SO TASTY!! This is just great! Hubby does not like cabbage and it was a huge effort on my behalf getting him to even try it. Can I just say: mission accomplished! He loved this! Served this for my mom’s 76th birthday to the whole fam and everyone was raving! This is comfort food at its finest! Thank you! My alterations are a few dashes of soy sauce (best mystery ingredient ever! Use it often.) and can of V8 with 14.5 oz can crushed tomatoes. Enjoy!

Made this the other night. We loved it. I followed the directions this time and it works. When I make it again I plan on putting cheese between each layer as well as on top. I also used Mrs. Dash spices in stead of salt and pepper.

Usually when someone changes the recipes on here, I get frustrated with their reviews.  But this recipe begs for some free styling.  However you enjoy cabbage rolls will apply to this recipe.  My family uses condensed tomato soup for the "gravy" and that is how I made mine and we loved it.  This is all about convenience.

I didn't have marinara, and the last time I used tomato sauce to make this, it was too bland. So, this time, I used salsa. I also added chili powder to the meat. Our family likes it a little spicy... AND THEY ALL LOVED IT!!! I have 7 kids, and a picky husband. They ALL liked it!!! Will make this many more times!!!

After I read so many reviews, I decided on adjusting some stuff. I hope that it comes out fine or we lose a dinner. Perfect!!! I'm relieved!!  In a stockpot, I cooked 1lb ground beef with 1/3 diced onion. After draining the grease off, I sprinkled with kosher salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, brown sugar and worcheshire sauce. Then, add 15oz chicken broth, 2-8oz tomato sauce and 1 cup long grain rice.  I bring it to boil and stir for 2-3min. Turn heat off and add 1/2 head cubed cabbage. Combine well and pour into deep oval Pyrex glass dish. I add 3/4 cup of water to let rice to have extra liquid on top. Bake with foil cover for 1 hour at 400. Rice is tender & cabbage is just right, not too crunchy or too soft. Hooray!  Will fix this again. One for our church s potluck soon!   God bless!

The idea is great but this was quite bland, needs a whole lot more flavou. I ended up adding some salt and Ferman Curry ketchup just to be able to eat it at all, but I will not be making this recipe ever again, sorry.

Deconstructed Cabbage Rolls is what I told my hubby this was. It was good but I like real cabbage rolls better... just a personal preference.

Really, really good!  But it makes a ton!  At least 8 servings, so I will freeze portions and take it to work. 

Next time I will use chunky tomatoes in place of the sauce, and maybe add some red pepper flakes to spice it up just a bit.

Hello, this is a great recipe and will taste good when you finish it. Just one note: I did not use any of the beef broth and it still came out plenty moist and flavorful.

Also, I did not season the dish until afterwards. For my first helping, I added salt to taste, black pepper to taste, and then crushed dried basil to taste. Delicious! This is a flexible dish so you could experiment with vegetables and other spices. For example, with tabasco sauce and then eaten in a tortilla, this would be south of the border. Great basic dish worth trying!!!!!

I enjoyed this. I didn't have beef broth, so I used beef stock. I also added a few dashes of hot pepper sauce to this.

this is so easy - only comment is that it is a little bland - I will make it again but I think I'll do a nice tomato sauce on the side to add a spoonful on top when serving.

Sounded bland so added tarragon, cayenne pepper,basil, rosemary, sage and thyme. Halved the meat and broth. Cooked covered for 45 min. and uncovered an additional 15 min. Needs tomatoe paste to thicken and tastier.

Love it! I've had golabki (cabbage rolls) many a time in my life made by me, my mom, grandma and countless aunts, uncles and restaurants. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of this dish. This casserole was a breath of fresh air, a total surprise. It does not taste exactly like golabki. The structure is different: cabbage is harder and crispier (I didn't preboil it) and juices from it infuse into the rice and meat changing their flavor. The final effect: amazingly good. The whole dish (about 3 pounds of it) disappeared in one sitting split between me, my wife an infant and a toddler. Will definitely make again.

Basic, Easy, and Fast.  When I put it a bowl, slopped some ketchup on top like I did with stuffed cabbage, it was great. Will share with my brother who loved mom's stuffed cabbage.

My family loves this casserole!  It tastes just like the stuffed cabbage my mom & grandma used to make.  The nice thing is that it can be made in the oven or the crock pot.  There's nothing better than easy peasy comfort food!

Update: In addition to the ingredients below, I added about 350 ml of tomato sauce this time and cooked in my turkey roaster. Next time I will ensure that cabbage and onions are cooked all the way before adding to the rest of the mixture. They don't cook much in the oven.... Excellent with a few mods... I use a large can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste instead of the sauce. i also add lots of salt, pepper, oregano and garlic powder. I fry the onion and cabbage in bacon grease on high heat for a few minutes. I have to divide into two dishes. I put in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes, covered, then uncovered for 10-15. P.S. - in my opinion, the cabbage is supposed to be well cooked.

This definitely tasted like stuffed cabbage.  However, there were some problems with the recipe. I used only 3/4 of the cabbage called for (3 bags of coleslaw mix)  and had to use a huge casserole dish.  It also needed another 2 tsp salt.  I used half pork and half beef, and sauteed the onions with the meat first and added paprika.   Next time I'll cut the recipe in half, add a bay leaf and whole allspice.  I'm also considering trying it with half sauerkraut or half sliced peppers.

This recipe was okay to me. I probably did not get enough seasonings into it. I did eat it with some sour cream and that seemed to help. It made so much I had to put in my turkey pan. Good thing my roommate likes leftovers.

Made EXACTLY as listed.  Waaaay too bland!!  Plus the cabbage wasn't thoroughly cooked, in my opinion.  Came out 'al dente" so the dish didn't ever get the full flavor of cabbage.  

It was eatable so I gave it 3 stars.  I will NOT make it again, however.

2nd time-Followed recipe but added big can of diced tomatoes and 1 tbsp curry powder. Boiled chopped cabbage and rice for 20 min before assembling, to eliminate crunch factor. Really does feed 12! No need to double.
1st time-Gave it a 3 for success and a 5 for taste! I needed an extra hour for it to "work"! After the 1.5 hrs recommended, rice was still crunchy and cabbage was still "cabbagey". Baked another hour AND added  1 tbsp curry powder and 28oz can drained diced tomatoes. Made it with ground moose meat. It was a hit. I will definitely make again.
The rice: was it supposed to be instant or long grain??

I think the sweetness of the cooked cabbage overtook the flavors.  I also did this on stovetop which took quite a long time due to the rice.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was amazing... I did do some of the changes that others did though. I browned the meat (I used 1 lb of ground beef, and 1 lb of ground pork instead) with the onion and I also used a lot of garlic at this stage too in a large pot. Drained the meat and returned the meat to the pot. Then added all the other ingredients to the pot (I used the bag of shredded cabbage like someone else suggested and I also added basil, and Worcestershire sauce), put the lid on and let it sit on low for 15 more minutes. Best thing I've made from here in a while! Even my kids liked it and they hate cabbage rolls lol

Not bad. I used a combination of ground beef,pork,and veal but otherwise followed the recipe. However I'll stick to traditional stuffed cabbage. must be the Polish in me.

like another  poster, i added rice, but i used a can of tomato juice in place of the water and added a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, that's what i had in the pantry! i covered it and let it cook about 30 minutes. it turned out pretty good considering i  had to use what was on hand!

This was delicious and so easy. I added a can of tomato paste, used 1/4 less cabbage than the recipe stated and added onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, basil and salt. I also found that it needed an addtional 20 minutes in the oven.

This was a great recipe to quickly have stuffed cabbage rolls. I did swap 1lb of the ground beef for hot Italian sausage for some spice and it was amazing. I also added the onion/tomato sauce/rice and half the broth to the meat for 10-15mins before combining witht ecabbage and rest of the broth so the cabbage still had a little crunch, coveeed and baked for 1 hour. Delicious.

I wanted this to taste like a cabbage roll and used the traditional 1 tsp lemon juice  1 tsp sugar  1/2 tsp garlic salt addition.    The taste seemed about right, though tomato paste would of given it a bit more tang.  Problem is it doesn't look appealing.   one review said to layer large pieces of leaves with the meat and the sauce, like a lasagna.   I think that would be a good idea - much easier than cabbage rolls!

1.  There is NO way this fit into a 9 x 13. You would have to cut recipe in half.
2. I used ground turkey and chicken broth.
3. It took longer than an hour and a half. More like 2 and a half (to cook rice thoroughly).
4. I had to used the aluminum pan (turkey roaster)!
5. Makes a ton! Would use for church potluck.

I did the "lazy method" some of the other viewers deceived.  It seemed kind of bland the first day. The next day I added 2 small cans of tomato paste.  That really did the trick!  I will definitely make this again w the addition of the tomato paste. It makes a lot. If your 4 or less, I would cut it in half or plan to freeze half.

This turned out great! I tweeked it to my taste by using ground turkey as the meat and stock instead of beef. Also brown rice rather then white. Added kale and sweet peppers. The texture and flavor was perfect.

I liked this with a couple of modifications. To make it a little bit healthier, I rinsed the ground beef  with hot water in a colander after cooking, then seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic, and a little cayenne. I also used pre-cooked brown rice instead of uncooked white. Only baked for an hour in foil, and cabbage was perfect! A dollup of fat free sour cream rounded our bowls off nicely. Yum!

This a very good recipe. I do add more seasonings and add some lemon juice to the tomato sauce. What makes this dish magical for me is that I melt mozzerlla cheese on top at the end. Amazing!

We really enjoyed this. I used a large scan of diced tomatoes rather than tomato sauce and stirred in about a cup of sauerkraut at the one hour stir time, to make it more like my husband's Hungarian stuffed cabbage. I also added pepper and garlic for more flavour. My kids both loved it and it's not very often they both like something.  Stirred in some light sour cream (and extra sauerkraut) with our servings. Yum!!

I made a few changes and it was absolutely delicious! I cooked 2 diced onions with the 2# lean ground meat, added an extra tsp of kosher salt, 2 tsp  crushed red pepper, 1 tbl granulated garlic until the meat was browned (or cooked) . I added 2 (28oz) cans crushed tomatoes to the meat mixture and 1 cup beef broth and brought mixture to a boil. Then added 1 and 1/2 cups raw rice and took off heat covered and left it for 15 mins as suggested by a few reviewers. Poured this over 3 1/2 #s of chopped cabbage which I had spread over the lasagna pan. I did not stir at this point. Covered with foil and Baked @ 350 for 45. Removed and stirred mixture to incorporate cabbage. Covered with foil and baked at 225 for 1 hour. Delicious!

Good basic recipe. Instead of tomato sauce, I added diced tomatoes and spicy Clamato juice. I also added hot sausage (cooked and cut up prior to adding). Instead of beef broth I added a pkg of onion soup mix. Turned out great. Sausage was a nice addition.

Loved it. I had more seasonings to it. This makes an awesome recipe to freeze. I actually double this recipe and freeze it in small portions for future use.

This is a great idea; much easier than cabbage rolls. I would have rated it 5 stars, but I used ingredients from my original recipe, and it wouldn't be fair.

Look out because if you use all the ingredients listed it won't fit in a 9x13 pan. I had to omit some of the cabbage and unfortunately always have to leave out the onion because of a sensitive family member but even so it was heaped in the pan and ran over in the oven. The taste is very good. I would make it again.

Very good! I should have cooked it a bit longer. I used a ground beef/ground pork mixture.  I will make again, but try to thicken the sauce a bit.

I also cut the cook time down so the cabbage wouldn't be mushy. I cooked it for the first 60 minutes and it was perfect! The cabbage still had a little crunch to it. I also added more of whatever spices I enjoy so it wouldn't turn out bland...it was great.

I told my husband what I was making he said: "I don't really like cabbage"  But even he said that this was tasty! (Not that he could eat it all day though...)

The stovetop version:  Make rice in rice cooker. Cook onion and beef and add tomato sauce.  When rice is done, add to pot and simmer for 10-15 minutes.  STEAM CABBAGE SEPARATELY for just 5 minutes to maximize its sweetness, and mix before serving.  Overcooking cabbage makes it more bitter. This makes a LOT of food, even when halved!  But I had a cabbage to use up!  If you're super smart about stovetop rice cooking you can do what you want, but our ricecooker is so easy and cooks it perfectly with no worry.

Will definitely make this again with a few changes. I halved the recipe, added 1 tbsp each of oregano, garlic, Italian seasoning, cayenne and pepper. I also added a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and a cup of pepper jack cheese.

I made this using vegetarian crumbles instead of meat. I put everything in a slow cooker and let simmer all day. It was fantastic.

An excellent and quick meal.I fry my ground beef with bacon and a little diced green pepper.I added a can of tomato paste to give it a bit more zing.Result tastes very much like the cabbage rolls my mother and father made.

I liked this recipe. I did not go the long road by putting it in the oven but I went the short cut way by cooking it in the stove top. It came out very good. I adjusted the salt content, and I added freshly ground pepper when close to the end. This really gave it that perfect balance. Same taste just without the extra work of rolling the cabbage leaves!

I loved this recipe and served it to guests. The only change I made was that  I added cayenne pepper and some hot Paprika. Very easy. I will make this again. By the way, my husband hates cabbage rolls. When he asked what this was, I said,"Never mind. Just eat it." He did and he loved it!

I made this recipe according to the directions and after 1.5 hrs at 350 the casserole hadn't cooked. When all was said and done I cooked it for 3 hrs at 375 covered. BIG DIFFERENCE from the recipe! I had to serve something else for dinner, because this one was cooking until we got ready for bed. Taste was good, but I would recommend making this in the crock pot on low for 8-10 hrs. Also add a bit of sugar, juice, wine or something to brighten it up.

this is really good and much easier than making cabbage rolls by hand. I used one pound of meat instead of 2 and used spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. I will be making this again!

I made this recipe over the weekend, exactly as written.  I can see where you can make some changes or add some seasonings, but delicious as is.   It does taste better the next day after all ingredients sit for a while.  I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks!

Love this recipe and it's even better with bacon thrown in. Season the meat with garlic powder, and fry up some chopped bacon. Combo of bacon and cabbage is always a win-win!

This was delicious. I halved it for just DH and me plus leftovers. Added a little more onion, a little more rice and a little more salt -- advice from other reviewers. Next time I think I'll add a bit of vinegar to try and make it a little more like my mother-in-law's cabbage rolls who makes them with sour cabbage. But loved it as is.

I tried the stove top version and in an attempt to save more time used 2 bags cole slaw instead of head of cabbage.  (I like the plain cabbage better)  An old recipe I had for cabbage rolls adds honey and grated nutmeg.  Did that too.  I like that flavor.  This is one of my new quickie GO TO recipes now.  Thanks for the quickie version!!

I've done the oven version many times and we love it but the time factor is a bummer with our schedule.  We like the no peek chicken that takes 1-1/2 hours too but is a weekend meal too.  Weekends we'll do the oven version.

Such an easy way to make cabbage rolls. This casserole obviously lack the aesthetic presentation of traditional cabbage rolls but the time you save is worth it.

We all agreed that the dish was very bland. It needed herbs and spices, which I did add. It still didn't help the taste. We grabbed the parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top and that helped. The 10 minute prep time isn't accurate.

I liked this recipe. I saw other people said the recipe was bland and watery. I used half the amount of beef broth and seasoned the beef with salt, pepper, and worcestershire sauce. I also sweated the onions with some garlic.

Made this yesterday and it is a keeper; can see myself making it often! Used ground veal, extra onions and garlic and garlic and herb sauce because apparently,  i love onions and garlic. Added more sauce (about 36oz.) And brown rice instead of white rice. As such, i had to cook it a bit longer but the extra sauce avoided it from drying out. Thank you so much for this recipe!

\My dish was way to small for the amount of cabbage so I used a large roaster.  I cooked it for 2.5 hours and some of the cabbage was still tough and,yes,I did shred it. Looking at the video after cooking it didn't make me think I had my cabbage pieces cut too big.   I had to use 2 cans of tomato sauce. All in all it was nice tasting (even without the garlic) but the next time I will half the recipe.

We really liked this recipe a lot. So easy. I used ground chicken because that is what I had available when looking for something to make.  I sauteed the onion in olive oil, then added the chicken and lots of seasoning, my favorite is Morton's Natures Seasoning, also a little additional salt and lots of ground black pepper.  I then added a can of Manwich Sloppy Joe mix for the tomato sauce, I didn't have regular tomato sauce.  I added 1 1/2 cups water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes and 1 cup of jasmine rice.  I let this come to a boil then simmer for 20 min, then added my chopped cabbage and let simmer for an additional 20 min.  YUMMY!!!

Just so you know, 3.5 lbs. of cabbage is A LOT. So when it says large mixing bowl, it means it. I doubt anyone will fit this into a 9 X 13 baking dish. I also found it to be deficient on spices, it needs more. Otherwise, easy and delicious.

OMG....I made this tonight. Like all the others I added ingredients. Lots of garlic, red pepper flakes, seasoned salt, and in place of some of the tomato sauce I added spicy V8. I cooked it on top the stove. It was fantastic!

Really great recipe, pretty easy and very good as written! I did half it as others suggested. My second time around I did add garlic and Worcestershire, and cooked onion with the meat, I used turkey, and it did add very nice flavor. Also a bit more tomato sauce. I saw some say the rice came out hard, I did not have that issue, was perfect. A keeper.

Idea is great!  I put a layer of cabbage, tomato sauce, then rice and meat --already mixed together with seasoning, then more sauce, cabbage, rice and meat, etc.  top layer should be cabbage. Cover completely with tomato sauce.  Bake at 3:50 until done.  Note, precook cabbage enough to pull off leaves.  I do not cook ground beef, just add it raw with rice, finely chopped onions and seasonings.

I make this often.  I find if I'm in a hurry instant rice is used and I just cook it until the cabbage is done on stove top.  It is good either way.  Although, there is something special about cabbage rolls.

Love this!  Super easy and super tasty. I don't cover the casserole when I bake it because I like the cabbage to come out crunchier. Any kind of stock works. Then each family member gets to garnish however s/he chooses - with cheese, sour cream, more onion, etc.

I love cabbage rolls and the thought of making them easier sounded great. What a waste to time and ingredients, even though they all sounded like what I put in cabbage rolls, I will take the time to make the real ones.

I used tri color coleslaw to save time and add more color. I added yellow and orange peppers, a can of diced tomatos,  a can of tomato soup instead of sauce. I added sauerkraut to give it a sour flavor. It turned out delicious. You can add garlic, dill, etc as you like. I added bacon bits as well.

This was awesome! Didn't change much to it - added a little bit of oregano and balsamic vinegar to the meat, and used 1.5 lbs of meat instead of 2. It was soooo easy and delicious, I'll definitely make this again.

Very good!  Next time I will make 1/2 recipe for a 7x10 pan.  Full recipe really requires a 10 x 15 pan.  I added 1/4 C. sugar to cut the tang of plain tomato sauce....perfect to  our taste.

This needed extra spices/salt.  It was much better after the flavors blended for a day or two.  Next time I will make a day ahead of time.

This dish was really boring. It needs more spices like cinnamon. It would be better to layer the cabbage leaves with the rice/meat mixture.

I found this recipe to be so easy.  It did take some time, but it was worth the wait. I made some substitutions: instead of white rice, I used a blend of 1/2 cup wild rice and 1/2 quinoa. I precooked the meat with the onion and added some garlic. In the slow cooker on high it took about 6 hours to cook.

Better than cabbage rolls. The cabbage just seemed to soften up a bit better than cabbage rolls and remained more moist. The less stringy texture was enjoyed by all. As most reviewers noted, increasing the spices is a good idea, and my family enjoyed it topped off with ketchup at the table.

This was quite good! I do think the tomato sauce needs some seasoning, though (thus the four stars). If you have a favorite stuffed cabbage recipe, use that. I wasn't ecstatic about the combination I came up with this time - I added too much paprika - but I'll keep trying. I used veggie crumbles instead of ground meat, one bag of coleslaw mix and most of a bag of leftover sauerkraut (I know, totally not in keeping with the recipe, but it's cabbage, and I had to use it somehow). I also used brown rice. I cooked it all in the slow cooker, on low for 7 hours. It turned out really well! I'd like to try and make it in the oven sometime, but this wasn't the time. I will say that actual stuffed cabbage is far prettier than this, but I'm certain that we'll make this again. Thanks!

Made with ground turkey. It was actually great. It makes a HHUGE pan. I used my lasagna pan.i think buying the bagged coleslaw mix helped save time. I still had to use a small head of cabbage. Will make it again.

I made this today and substituted Johnsonville mild Italian sausage for the beef. It added a wonderful flavor! This recipe is really easy to make and tastes good. However, the time in the oven is at least two hours or more. I lost track of how long my recipe baked but it was at least two hours.

Delicious! I love cabbage rolls but I don't like making them. This is perfect! I think it's a little better with more tomato sauce but we all have our own tastes. As is, it's great!

This casserole was very easy to make nothing to it actually.... I did however feel that it lacked some spices and flavor... I added some black pepper and that seemed to help but something was still missing maybe next time I will experiment a little more and read other reviews... But after the hour and a half of baking it was no longer runny and thickened up quite nicely... My brother did mention that he might like it better if it was layered and not all missed together... It may be worth trying as well rice,meat, then cabbage with the tomato sauce and broth over everything... Not sure how that would work though.... As written it is a very simple and good tasting casserole

I think if you find this too mushy that you should cut down on the broth that is used.  I have been making this casserole for over 30 yrs. and my recipe calls for 20 ozs.  of water (or broth).

Yes, my husband and I liked this recipe very much.  It was very easy to make.  I don't think I will add as much broth next time and I could only fit less than 2# of cabbage in my 9 x 13 dish.  I used about 1/2 of a large cabbage.  I used Minute instant brown rice.  An Octoberfest beer and some crusty bread were a perfect accompaniment.

I liked this recipe. It was easy, and I was lazy and did it all in a skillet. It could have used a bit more seasoning, but that is just my taste. Even my husband who isn't much of a cabbage fan, had more than one helping.

This was relatively easy to make for cooking-novice me, and it tastes so good! I did the "lazy method" suggested by another user of browning the hamburger and onion in a large pot, draining, and then adding all other ingredients to the pot and cooking for 15-20 minutes. I had already made my own tomato sauce ahead of time (attempting to use up the last of my garden harvest for the year), so I wanted to make quick work of this recipe. I should also note that I made 6 servings instead of the 12 that the recipe is written for...halving the recipe still made plenty! I shared the finished product with three friends, and there's still a lot left over!

I couldn't understand why so many reviews said it was bland, when the ingredients are pretty close to the same as my cabbage rolls, and they are anything but bland. I made it with half a recipe ( I would not have had a bowl big enough to mix it in otherwise)but used the full amount of tomato sauce, and it was barely enough sauce so I added a can of chopped tomatoes. After cooking 1 and 1/2 hours the cabbage was still crunchier than I like and IT WAS BLAND. Next time I will try it with the exact ingredients for my cabbage rolls- two large cans of tomato juice instead of one can of tomato sauce, and no broth, and cook it for 3 hours like I do my cabbage rolls ( the beef is not precooked) and see how I like it since I think a lot of the flavour comes from the length of cooking- some of the reviewers have commented how it is better the next day and the sauce thickens up while cooking ( some have commented it is too runny)

This was pretty good. It needed something though. I put a little bot of cheese (mozzarella and parmesan) on the leftovers and it was even better. Next time I will add some seasoning like garlic and herbs. Pretty good as is though.

I loved cabbage rolls as a child, but have never made them as an adult.  This was certainly much less work, but something(s) was definitely missing. This should have been a little sweeter.

My husband loves cabbage rolls but they are a LOT of work.  This recipe is very tasty and so much easier!  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and I cooked it in my large crock pot on high for 5-6 hours.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Very good.

Super delicious!  Healthy and easy to make! Great for the winter! I saute minced ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes in the pan then add 1 1/2 LB ground turkey plus 1 med onion.  I also added Trader Joe's 21 Seasonings in the turkey for more flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I halfed the ground beef, used a small can of tomato sauce, added a can of rotel. While I was browning the meat, I also threw the rice and beef broth into the rice steamer for a few minutes to avoid crunchy, uncooked rice. Serve with Louisana Hot Sauce - yum! Kids even love it!

Everyone in my household loved it!  I read other reviews and since this was the first time I was making it, I decided to make it as the recipe directed, except I added 3 or 4 garlic cloves (always!), used my homemade marinara sauce with 1 8oz can tomato sauce to make up the difference, used more salt as advised (and added more after it was cooked), used the beef juice in place of one can of broth since it was mostly water and substituted bulgar wheat for the rice.  Yummy!  Next time, I will add a little more bulgar!  I will definitely make it again.  It was so easy!  I also covered and cooked at 400 degrees for one hour and it came out perfect with slightly textured, crunchy but cooked cabbage.

I altered a few things based on previous reviews, and my own taste.  I steamed the rice seperately so it wouldn't be soggy.  I made an 18 serving batch.  To the meat, I added a head of garlic (chopped).  For the sauce used 4-15 oz. cans of tomato sauce, 2 boxes of condensed Cream of Mushroom w/ equal amounts h20 added, and 1 Tbsp beef base.  Delicious...and much easier than stuffing rolls!

I love making this on top of the stove. I cut it in half and to add a little more flavor, I put in a splash of good balsamic vinegar and a squeeze of honey (I keep bees so I have plenty of honey on hand.)  I also add about half a can of petite diced tomatoes.  This is a quick  school night recipe when done on the tope of the stove.  Some crusty bread and you're done!

This is a standard pot-luck dish in our house.  It's easy to make and tastes alot like the real thing without all the work!  Caution- cabbage REEEEELLY expands when chopped up, I had enough for a huge cassarole dish of this, there's no way it would fit in a 19x13 pan!

This was awesome! I didn't have everything on hand, so here's what I did...1 lb of ground turkey, 1 can of chicken broth, 1/2-3/4 of a lg cabbage, 15 oz can of tomato sauce, one small onion, 1 cup of brown rice. I halved the recipe because my only my husband and I would eat this, my kids are picky. I do absolutely agree that you need to season a lot. I added some minced garlic in with the onion and ground turkey. Also, added basil, oregano, ground pepper, and salt. I baked it in a 9x13 and covered it w/ foil for 1 hr, stirring once. I also let it sit covered for a few hours to let the flavors blend. My husband went crazy over it! I will be making again, very soon!

I took Cyndib's suggestion and made the entire dish on the stove top like jambalaya. I subbed leftover red chili sauce, El Pato sauce and one can diced tomatoes which took care of the spice issue. Next time I would add a little sauce. It took about 30 minutes to cook all the liquid down but the results were fantastic.

I agree that this was very tasty but I did add some extra tomatoes and garlic.  It was still a little under seasoned for my taste.  It did make a huge pan full and it did take longer to bake than 1hr and 30 minutes.  I will make this again but next time with a little more spices for sure.

This was very easy and tasted great.  Was hoping it would reheat better, but found it to very mushy the second time around.

Very good even though I was short some of the tomato sauce.  I made some cornbread also and the two went pretty well together.

Great recipe, made it for the first time last night.  Eating the leftovers for lunch today. YUM!  Since we only have 3 people in our family I cut the recipe in half. I used 3/4 cup of rice and 2 cans of italian seasoned tomato sauce (I like a moist casserole). Like many of the previous reviews I added spices to the meat and onions while it cooked (salt, pepper, garlic, basil, oregano). It took over 2 hours to cook and even then there were some grains of rice that could have been cooked longer.   We will make this recipe again.

I made half the recipe (because I wasn't sure if my kids would eat it) and I had 2 full casserole dishes.  Needless to say, the pans were empty.  If you can fix up a cabbage dish that a 2 year old and 17 year old will eat, then it must be GOOD!

Like previous reviewers, I seasoned the hamburg with onion, garlic, chives and italian seasoning.  I also threw the rice into the hamburg mixture after adding the liquids and threw in a half cup of salsa  It's a keeper according to my hubby!

Love this recipe!  I shredded the cabbage in my food processor in a few minutes.  Instead of ground beef, and beef broth, I used ground turkey and chicken stock.    The husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, and will definitely make it again, and again.

Made this for St. Patricks day. I loved it. My husband said it did not taste like Cabbage rolls but I think that was because I over cooked it and the rice turned to mush. I had only made enough for 4 and had company show up so made it stretch by serving it over mashed potatoes. Everyone like it. Most of us had seconds. Excellent recipe. Oh and I did cook it on the stove top. It was done in 20 minutes but mine got cooked alot longer. I will make this again! Thanks for this super easy dinner casserole. This would also be good to take for a potluck!

seasoning to the meat/onion while it was browning -- salt & pepper, a lot of garlic, oregano and basil and a heavy dose of both red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. Also sprinkled some of all those things over the cabbage I'd chopped (I estimate 10-12 cups, fairly large head).  I gave the rice a head start -- added the tomato sauce & half the broth to the browned meat/onion, then stirred in the rice, turned the burner off and let it hang out for about 10-15 mins. I tossed it all together in a large bowl, poured into lasagna dish (way too much for 9x13) and baked covered for 50 mins. Excellent! Rice cooked perfectly and cabbage, while softened, still had a slight crunch. Try this one, and don't be afraid to add a LOT of seasonings! :)

I cooked the rice separate. I cooked onion and garlic in olive oil until tender. I added some parsley, celery salt and some cayenne pepper. I cooked it for the 1 1/2 hrs in the oven. Cabbage rolls are a labor of love. Tastes just as good with a lot less effort. Perfect. Will definitely make again.

I chopped the cabbage coarsely, added garlic, worcestershire sauce, and some basil, oreg, and brown sugar.  Cooked it in a huge pot on top of the stove.  It's a definite keeper.  Thanks

Very good, and freezes well. I parcially cooked the rice. I sauteed garlic and onion with the ground beef and added black pepper, salt, hot pepper flakes and oregano. This recipe can also be made ahead.

I did add 1-2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbs.of chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon-Italian seasoning, added celery(1-2 stalks), added 1 can of diced tomatoes,  added 2 cans (8 oz.ea.) tomato sauce(instead of 29 ounce), few drop of hot sauce.  Cooked on top of stove 50mins. Next maybe cook in the crock pot. This is very Good!

My whole family loved this!  The only thing I did different was put the onion in with the ground beef while I was browning it and use chicken broth instead of beef broth.  This was like cabbage rolls without all the work! It's a keeper!!

This tastes just like my grandma's recipe, without all the work of rolling the cabbage. It is very easy, and very hearty. I will make this over and over.

I've made this twice, in a electric pot. The second time I used ground sausage and it is good both ways.

Update- Now that cabbage from the garden is here I've been craving this...making it now with ground beef because it was thawed and the sausage isn't. Still using the electric pot because it makes it fast and easy one pot cooking. I use one can of Rotel chunky, one jar of home canned tomatoes and one can of broth. I use one bag of boil-in-bag rice cut open and dumped in with the rest of the ingredients as the first reviewer stated.

Yummy. I made it a little healthier by using half ground round & half ground turkey, and brown rice instead of white.  I added pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce (while the meat cooked) and a dash of hot sauce. Next time I make it - and there will be a next time - I'll add some seasonings like basil, bay leaf, etc. I was surprised, but I needed to add more liquid when I stirred it.   I served it with mashed potatoes, which I think were the perfect side. My husband and I really liked this dish.

overall this was a very easy recipe.  I would have to agree with some reviews that it is very bland.  I added some garlic and italian seasoning but it was still missing something.  maybe next time I will try spaghetti sauce inplace of the tomato sauce.

I had a couple issues with this recipe. First of all, it makes so much more than one can possibly fit into a 9X13 pan. Secondly, I noticed that the recipe didn't call for any seasonings other than salt. I added a hefty dose of italian seasoning, garlic salt, and onion powder. The end result was still completely bland. I let it sit in the fridge overnight, and yes, it did taste better the second day, but still very bland. I adore cabbage, especially cabbage rolls, but this was not at all what I was hoping for. Thanks anyway.

This was great. My boyfriend grew up eating lebanese food that his grandmother made. I had never made cabbage rolls so this was a great way for me to make something he loved. He actually said it made him think of his grandmother! Followed the recipe except adding some extra seasoning to taste. Will no doubt be making this again!

This has a very good taste however i'd like to see someone put this in a 9x13 dish. Its enough for 2 and then some. One other thing, partially or completely cook this on top of the stove, it takes forever in the oven

I came upon this recipe because I had beef, cabbage, and rice I needed to use. It was a really simple recipe and almost impossible to mess up. Some of my proportions we a little off and I used spaghetti sauce instead of regular tomato sauce. It turned out great and was really yummy, pretty healthy too. I did add a bit of cheese in to the mixture and loved it!

DELICIOUS!!  My Nanny always made stuffed cabbage and I have tried them but they are time consuming, this recipe is tasty and easier than the rolls.  I only had a regular sized can of tomato sauce so I did have to add some chili sauce (closest thing I had) at the end.  Very good quick recipe!!

this was SO GOOD! i cut the recipe in half, added 2 (16 oz) cans of diced tomatoes and while it was in the oven i took another can, put them in the blender and heated them over the stove with a tiny bit of garlic powder and pepper. This was really good to drizzle over the top after it came out of the oven. My family LOVED this recipe. My sister asked for the recipe so she can make it! Also, I layered the ingredients in the pan and then slightly mixed it. One layer of cabbage, a can of tomatoes, ground beef, onions, rice, cabbage, can of tomatoes, can of tomato sauce and then poured the beef broth over the top. I didnt have beef broth so i used a packet of beefy onion broth mix and instead of water i used vegetable stock. It was amazing!

This was really good!  Hearty, filling and easy to make.  We are trying hard to be heart-healthy, so used 99% fat free ground turkey instead of beef. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added the cabbage 40 minutes into cooking so it didn't get mushy.

This was really good. I'd pre-boiled my cabbage and added some extras like garlic and garlic powder. I'd used Tomatoe soup with Basil and Oregeno.  Will cook again.

How could I not make it a 5 star? I make it, freeze it and that gives me a few days of stress free lunches. Any meal that I can stretch for a few days is a meal on my favorite list! Now I did add some spices garlic, italian...either way it all comes out great!

This is such an easy recipe and the taste is so comforting on a cold day! I used 2 cans of tomato soup in place of the tomato sauce and omitted the onions and it was still delicious! The beef broth really gives it a nice flavour...I've made a similar recipe before with no broth, but it really makes the recipe that much better.

Yummm! This is a quick and easy recipe.  I make a lot and put it in the freezer for future busy nights!  No one is ever disappointed when they see that I am serving this dish.  I have experimented with a variety of spices and condiments and have never had a turned up nose at dinner.

I like this recipe! Except I added a few things myself. I tried Worchester sauce, good, but I think I over did it just a bit. But since I like it, that's alright! I added tomato sauce, and paste plus diced grape tomatoes, green peppers, home grown tomatoes, tomato juice, garlic powder and my "secret ingredient" A sweeter RED WINE! Just a half a cup or so. Sweetens it just a tiny bit, very subtle, but adds an unique flavor! I would suggest the wine to use, but maybe that's not allowed in here. Maybe a hint.....I would serve this dish at a family "REUNION" at "NITE" This will give you enough info I would assume, but only use "LAMB" Rusko flavored. By the way, this wine gets you quite drunk too, so lay off the "hits" inbetween tastings, unless you want to! It really does give it an unique flavor! Try it! I LIKE IT!

I have made this recipe several times over the past couple of years. It's definitely a winner with my family and its ease beats the preparation of traditional cabbage rolls.

My family absolutely hated this recipe, And I love cabbage. The flavor was bland and did not remind me of real cabbage rolls. We threw most of it away and ended up finding something else for dinner that night. This was a waste of ingredients! Sorry!

Good concept, but the flavors were somewhat bland.  I added extra hot sauce to individual servings, but it really didn't "hit the spot".  It was better the next day, though, as flavors had blended some.  Okay, but I won't fix again.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I thought it was a little flavorless so to the leftovers I added garlic, oregano and basil and it was MUCH better.

This is an incredible recipe. I make it twice a week for my hubby. He absolutely loves it. Once I was out of the tomato sauce so I used red enchilada sauce and what a hit it was. The enchilada sauce gave it a nice kick!

A nice all-in-one supper. I used ground chicken, which I sauted with the onion and two cloves of garlic. Then I added vinegar and a dash of pepper to the mixture. I found this good, although not amazing, but my kids had triples!

This was easy and pretty good. I did although add some garlic pepper and Mrs. Dash garlic herb to it. Next time I will replace some of the broth for some diced tomatoes.Which is pretty much like the recipe I have used in the past.

Tasted just like stuffed cabbage rolls! I added a few spices to kick it up a notch. I cooked the onions with the meat, added one teaspoon of tyme and seasoned salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and one crushed garlic. I cooked my casserole in a metal roaster. The 9x11 dish looked to small for the casserole ingredients.

I altered this recipe by adding fresh tomatoes from our garden and by adding a jar of sauerkraut. I end the layering with a second can of tomato sauce.  I also choose to steam my rice first and therefore eliminated the broth it called for.  The juice from the tomatoes and sauerkraut keeps it moist enough. very good recipe though. Easier than rolls and just as delicious.

I make this all the time, only found the recipe today looking for variations.  I cook the rice separate as well as the meat, while I cut up my head of cabbage, I put the cabbage, minced garlic and some no salt added beef broth in the pan to simmer, once it starts to cook down some I add 2 8oz cans of no salt added tomatoe sauce.  I also put in paprika and some worchestire sauce and a healhy dose of hot sauce,for extra health benefits, I add a big scoop of ground flax seed, you don't taste it at all but it's so good for us.  Once the rice is done I combine it all in a big pan & let it cook the rest of the way on the stove.  I like my cabbage to stay firmer so I've never put it in the oven.

My Mom made traditional Mennonite cabbage rolls all the time when I was little.  This casserole is a great way for me to get the same flavours but without the time consuming process of making the rolls. This one is a favourite in my house!

Definitely more simple than traditional cabbage rolls.  Even though this was good as written, I think it could use more meat.  I will make that change the next time I make this.

I generally make stuffed cabbage (halupki or blind piegons) using ground pork.  So I substituted the pork for the beef, and used tomato soup rather than tomato sauce, and added some stewed tomatoes.   
This is much easier than the process I normally use.  I like them rolled but this was great & wasn't an all day project.

Added garlic salt, onion salt, onion soup mix, cumin, and black pepper.  tasted reminiscent of a cabbage roll, but I wasn't into it.  Edible, but not my favorite.

I like the idea of this recipe, and I read the reviews, so I tweeked it a little myself...I browned 1 lb. of ground chuck with 1 lb. ground turkey, added 1 cup onions, and then I added the seasoning packet from a box of beef rice-a-roni. Simmer and drain.  I added 1 1/2 cups cooked rice and I cut up my cabbage and boiled it for 5 min. Add cabbage, 2 16 oz. cans tomato sauce, and 1 can beef broth. If it seems too dry, add more sauce or broth. Less baking time, and dinner is served! Go Meat!

This was great.  Had the kids up for the weekend and there was nothing left.  Son was going home and surprised with a small dish of the extra that wouldn't fit into the 9x13.  Quick and easy just the way I like it.

Satisfies the craving for cabbage rolls. Made the following changes: used quick cooking (10 min.) brown rice, only 1 head of cabbage (not 3 lbs.), and cooked onion with meat.  Turned out yummy (I had to add extra salt).  I will make this again.

Wow, we couldn't handle this. I made it exactly as directed and apparently we don't love cabbage enough because even my husband who will eat anything didn't want to finish this - eventually we threw most of it away, I can't explain what was wrong so maybe it's just a cabbage thing.

If you like cabbage rolls this is good and much simpler than making cabbage rolls. Mine turned out with the cabbage mushy because I think the cooking time is waaay too long. I think 45 minutes to an hour is plenty. Made some changes as recommended by others: added oregano reduced beef broth to 16 oz and reduced tomato sauce to 16 oz.

This recipe was pretty good, but I think it smelled better than it taste.  We ate plenty for our dinner, but we didn't really care for the leftovers.

Not very attractive looking but great tasting.  I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to give it  more taste.  Really easy to make.

I read the reviews for this dish and made a few changes of my own. I halved the recipe, used a 14-oz. can of diced tomatoes with a small can of tomato sauce, and baked it for two hours. After tasting it, I still thought it needed something more, so I added 2-3 TBs of honey BBQ sauce. It was better than I'd expected as I assembled it, and we ate it as a meal. But my daughter had a couple of suggestions that I thought were awesome: This would make a great new dip for tortilla chips! Or even more unexpectedly, how about a Polish taco, using a flour or corn tortilla and cheesy toppings?! Before you go, "Ewww!", try the original recipe, then make a judgement. It works!

AMAZING. I love the fact it's SOOOO easy to make! The other cabbage rolls really intimidated me (I'm an advanced cook, but with a young child). It's VERY tasty. I would add less stock and more water, to make it less salty. (but that's because we have a health concern)

This was a pretty good recipe after it finally cooked.  I would recommend changing the cooking time to at least 2 1/2 - 3 hours, rather than the 1hr 40 minute suggested.  We ended up making a quick pizza the night I made this because it would have been 9pm before we could have eaten it.

Simpler AND better than cabbage rolls imo...everyone liked it, which would not be true if cabbage rolls were served.  I halved the recipe and that worked well, but it still filled a 9 x 13 pan...you'd need a big one to make the whole recipe!

A bit bland, but a pretty good recipe.  I didn't put in the meat but added mushrooms.  Next time I'll put in more veggies and add more spices.  I put in oregano and garlic but thought it needed more.  I'll make it again.  Good vegetarian dish.

It was diferent.I added a few extra things to it, and I cook the cab,meat and rice before hand.I add spag, sauce and pepper sauce,and then some spices, it needs more flavor so you have to add spices to it. But all in all good.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have a pan big enough to combine all the ingredients, so I pulled out my electric skillet and combined it all in there and let it simmer in that.  I added some of my own spices to our liking and it was fantastic.  I still have some in the freezer!

This was disapointing. The flavor was bland and the consistency sort of mushy. I've made cabbage rolls the traditional way and it's worth the extra time and effort. Probably won't make this again.

We thought this was very bland. It seemed to be lacking any depth of flavor.  We ate it that night but no one wanted the leftovers. They ended up in the trash after a few days. Would not make this again.

Excellent!  Since the recipe is enough to feed an army, it is a wonderful picnic addition.  I used elk meat instead of beef, and it still was great.

My husband is picky, so I gave this 2 stars, but it was not all that great.  Next time I'll stick to the traditional rolls.

So much easier than cabbage rolls.  I went through 3 heads of cabbage trying to learn how to make the traditional cabbage rolls that I grew up on.  You made my day when I found this recipe.  It is delicious and easy.  True comfort food.

Iused to make stuffed cabbage rolls but this recipe is so simple. Why go thru all that trouble when you can put everything in a baking pan and bake it.
N0 hassle and the end product is so good. I do add about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed fennel to mine. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

My husband and I love cabbage rolls and this recipe was great with one modification. I used Prego spaghetti sauce (Traditional) in place of tomato sauce. I also cut the recipe in half and it turned out great!  Thanks Nancy

Much easier (and just as good) as cabbage rolls!  I made this with ground turkey and it turned out fine.  The recipe is huge; I made a half recipe  and it filled a 9 x 13 pan and fed 4 hungry adults with plenty leftover.

This is a very easy alternative to cabbage rolls if you love the flavor, but  don't have time for the traditional rolls. I added some seasoning salt for a little more flavor.

This was different. I sauteed the beef with garlic and onion before making the casserole, added some extra spices and used a jar of chunky mushroom/garlic/tomato sauce instead of just a can of plain sauce.  It didn't really taste like cabbage rolls, but it was good and made a lot (and I halved the recipe).  I don't know if I will make this again though...it wasn't one of those "oh my God" things.

Excellent! Just what I was looking for. We all love it and it was simpler than filling all the cabbage pieces, thank you! I also browned the meat with the onions and garlic as everyone mentioned. I also added two minor things, which I always put into my cabbage rolls, one small can of tomato soup and a couple shakes of worcestershire sauce, this was in addition to the large can of tomato sauce called for. 
This will definitely be made again.

I loved this recipe and it was big hit at dinner with others as well. I took the suggestion to brown the meat with the onion and some garlic. I also added a bit of chunky vegetable spaghetti sauce to the tomato sauce. I reduced the recipe by half (small family) and it still almost overflowed the 13x9 pan! This recipe is a keeper and will definitely go into my regular rotation of favorites.

Very good comfort food. I did season the meat because of all the other comments, but I don't think it would have been that bland if I didn't with all that beef broth and tomato sause. I know I will make this again.

I make a similar dish. However my family has cabbage lovers & haters to solvre this I make a batch of meatballs & layer them with bought coleslaw mix. This has carrots etc in it. If you find it too bland you can always use your favorite pasta sauce.

My new husband loved this recipe!  I asked if there was anything I could do to improve the taste, he said to keep it just as is.  However, I put this in a crockpot but stirred it halfway thru so the top cabbage was covered.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

This is a HUGE serving, but it really does taste great!!!  I added twice as much tomato sauce as this calls for, since I like the tomato flavor in cabbage rolls.   Also, I don't know WHO has a bowl large enough to mix this whole recipe, so I split it in half to mix, as well as cooking.  I used two 9x13 pans to cook this in.  It made it much easier to stir.  Great recipe - certainly worth a try!!!!

This recipe's ok. I had authentic polish cabbage rolls yesterday. Absoultely mouth watering that's why I decided to emark on a simple cabbage roll recipe. This not even a 1/3, as good as they were. In all fairness we did have seconds, it was filling and different but nothing to write home about.

I cut this recipe down to 4 servings. It was excellent. It was missing something in terms of flavor the night we had it but it tasted better the next day. I'll definitely make this again, and regularly.

This was very good. I am not fond of tomatoe sauce with my cabbage rolls, so I only used a 15 oz can (will even go to the next smallest can as it was still to much for my taste)and I added a 27 oz can of sauerkraut. Only used about half of the cabbage as well.  Mixed and cooked it all in a roaster pan instead of the 9x13 baking dish as it is deeper and holds more.Definitely easier than making the actual rolls.

Really yummy! I have made this numerous times and it is always welcomed. I changed the meatballs into the beef ones that are premade in store. It saves time. I also use spaghetti sauce with stewed tomatoes instead. You don't have to add any spices to it this way. The last half hour of cooking I add in instant rice. Everyone that has tried my version has loved it.

Great idea. I took the advice and halved the recipe, and it filled a big lasagna pan. Used 2 cans Tomato soup instead of sauce.  I used one and a half bags of shredded angel hair cabbage (the store was out of coleslaw mix), I think 1 bag would have been enough. Seemed like too much cabbage. Will make again, much easier than cabbage rolls!

It was different... I didn't think it tasted like true cabbage rolls, and the rice gave me issues. Overall, an "okay" dish but not one I'd make again.

I really didn't enjoy this one.  I followed the recipe, allthough I found it made much more than could fit in my 9x13 pan.  It just didn't taste as much like Cabbage rolls as I would have liked.  
On the positive side, it did taste a little better as a leftover, I think because flavors had more time to mix together.  I won't try this one agian.

I halved the recipe, used ground turkey and chicken broth, added garlic and sauteed the onion w/the meat.  I heated the broth to a boil before adding. The casserole was ready in an hour.  My kids think they hate cabbage but loved this dish.

This is good however it is quite bland.  I added garlic salt before serving which improved it tremendously.  Next time I'll try some of the suggestions in the reviews and will cut back the recipe amounts.  It may be easier to make but it doesn't fit in the pan, and I'm using my saved time to clean the oven of all the spills.

Aside from the fact that I think the taste of this should lean more toward bland than spicy, I still was a bit disappointed in this recipe. Certainly this takes much less time than a traditional cabbage roll recipe, but I think if I wanted that taste I would take the time to do it that way.

I put this recipe together a little different and added few things to give it more flavor. First I halved the recipe which fit one 9x13 pan.
 I boiled about 1/2 lg. head cabbage in water w/ a T. olive oil and tsp. salt and some pepper while I cooked the hamburger with 1/2 cup salsa and T. chili powder. I cooked the onion in there too. When cabbage was almost done I drained it and put it in a large bowl with 2-8 oz. cans tomato sauce, 1 fresh tomato, diced that I added and my precooked minute rice w/ sprinkle lemon and tsp. lea and perrins sauce and I upped the salt to 3/4 tsp. Then I added beef mixture and stirred good and put in 9x13 pan and baked for 30 min. covered and 20 min. more uncovered cause it was still somewhat juicy. It turned out tasty and good. I will definately make it again cause I like to make casseroles and have tried the regular cabbage rolls without much luck.

I also used instant rice to cut down on time.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a little onion to the beef/rice mix, and took out the beef broth.  About 5 minutes before it was done, I added a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.  My kids, who don't usually like cabbage rolls, both really liked it.

Good, quick, and easy.  I did add some worchestershire sauce and extra salt to the meat mixture.  A little tomato paste might be good, as well.  I used instant rice to decrease the cooking time. Next time I might use more rice and more cabbage to extend the dish a little.

This was good, but something was missing or just not quite right, I just couldn't figure out.

I am giving this 4 stars because of the ease to make.  It wasn't that tasty, even though I did add some worchestshire, garlic powder and a couple of teaspoons brown sugar.  I don't think I'll make this again.

This was okay.  My kids weren't very excited about this.  However, if you have cabbage that need used up, it is a very good recipe to have.

Makes a lot! I used an 11x15 pan and barely fit, so had LOTS of leftovers.  Next time I'll use 2 11X13 pans.  Only change I made was to add a good teaspoon of black pepper.  

Reminds me of my mother's "Shipwreck" recipe, but she added sliced potatoes and carrots as well.  I'll try that next time.

I read all the reviews before making this and tried most of the suggestions.  I still was not impressed.  It has a mediocre flavor and is nothing to see.  It's a pan of mush.  Not the worst I've ever had, but I definitely won't make it again.

Used ground turkey and season that, the mushrooms and onions with soy sauce and seaon salt. I added some brown sugar, should have used a bit more. I took someone elses idea for the can of dice tomatoes, but it created too much juice. During the last thirty minutes I covered it with cheese (not enough). 

Overall this is a good recipe with a good flavor. Easy to make for even the worse cook, like myself.

This was extremely good and my husband loved the fact that the cabbage was shredded up inside of the casserole, that way it didn't over power the dish. This would probally be a good way to get your kids to eat their vegetables. Really good! thanks

Just served this for dinner. My family enjoyed this more than the cabbage rolls.  I made a few changes- I used a combination of ground turkey and spicy italian sausage & I used bullion instead of broth (so I could control the saltiness).  Will make again.

This was far better than I had expected, though the other reviews were good.  I had to try it for myself.  It is the most delicious meal!  My husband loved it!  I will make this many times for company and my family as well.  I used 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of vegetable broth because that is what I had. Do make this dish if you love rolled cabbage.  Lots less time but just as much flavor.

I thought this recipe was very good and easy.  The only trouble I had was it really made too much for one 9 x 12 dish.  I crammed it in anyway and baked it.  Some of the liquid boiled over and made a mess.  Next time I will either use a package of shredded cabbage or put it in two pans.  And there WILL be a next time.  It was that good.

My family gives this one not one but two thumbs up.  They loved it.  It was so easy to make.  I used onion flakes and garlic in my meat as it was browning.  I also used one can of tomato soup along with the one can of tomato sauce.  The sauce I used was Hunt's Chunky Vegetable.  Thanks for a very easy recipe!!

Delicious! My family loved this. I will never spend hours rolling cabbage rolls again!

I did use seasoned salt instead of regular salt and added a little more tomato sauce after I mixed it because I had a little more ground beef than the recipe called for.

Thanks so much for sharing this!

Not great, but not bad either.  It did mimic the taste of cabbage rolls, but the consistency was not quite what I expected.  I'll definitely make it again because my husband happened to fall in love with it.  Daughter and I were on the "so-so" side of the fence. :)

I must be the only looney, according to the other reviews, but both my husband and I thought this was a loser!  No taste...  We love cabbage rolls, and I normally make them, so I thought I'd try this to make it easier... no dice, no comparison, as far as we are concerned!  There is no flavor!  Just sort of bland.. blah! In the last 30 mins. of cooking, when you remove the cover, it got dried out.  I even added more tomato sauce, I stirred it in, to sauce it up a bit. There are a lot of rave reviews on this one, and I must say my kids enjoyed it, but I will not be making it again.  I will go back to my good ol' standby, Cabbage Rolls.  Just plain ol' average to me.  Nothing to rave about here...

This recipe was tasty although I did think it needed some additional seasoning. I added two packages of dry onion soup mix and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg which really provides a nice hint of flavor.

Extremely easy to make and very tasty, but tasted more like stuffed peppers than cabbage rolls.  My husband liked it since he can't tolerate peppers and hasn't had stuffed peppers in years.

This was a disappointing experiment. The pan size was too small for the amount this recipe produced and using a larger pan threw off the baking time (had to finish in the microwave to keep the meal on schedule). I'm back to "real" cabbage rolls until a better shortcut comes along.

I love this recipe -- but I found that the cabbage too overcooked and soggy for my taste, so I adjusted it by adding the cabbage after baking it for 45 mins.  Then I stir in the cabbage, cover it and bake another 15-20 min.  I also added thyme, garlic and the secret ingredient, a tablespoon of cider vinegar that enhances the flavors w/o making it taste vinegary.  Yum!

My family loved this, but I added 2 cans of Rotel Tomatoes, and envelope of dry onion soup mix to it!!!  It does make a VERY FULL 9x13 pan, but the cabbage goes down as it bakes, but I also used a turkey roaster.  Very easy and good -- would make again!!!!  Much easier than cabbage rolls!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing

Cut this recipe in half!!  I selected it because it looked like a good choice for my diet.  It makes way too much for people trying to cut portions.  Also needs a small amount of garlic and pepper added.

Nobody in my family liked this recipe!  I added extra seasonings as lots of other reviews suggested and it still was very bland.  It didn't even look appetizing.

I found that the 3 1/2 lbs of cabbage was too much. Even using about 3 lbs of cabbage it did not fit into my 9x13 pan and I baked it in a large casserole and it was fine.  I prefer it a bit spicier and would add a touch of tabasco next time.

I make and prefer a similar cabbage casserole; using condensed tomato soup and water instead of sauce and broth.  I also add 1 T of white sugar.  This one was okay, but I love mine!

As I put this in the oven, I was convinced it would be terrible.  But I was wrong, it was very good.  Next time I think I will add some season salt.

This was a great weeknight meal, and my husband absolutely loved it! To kick it up a little, I added Mrs. Dash when cooking the meat, and used onion flavored beef broth. Definitely a keeper - thank you, Nancy!

I was so disapointed! This dish smelled so good in the oven, but it turned out not so good. The cabbage was greasy (even though I had drained the meat), and the leftovers were soggy. My kids wouldn't touch it. On the other hand, my husband enjoyed it, but he has a tougher stomach when it comes to fatty food. I probably won't make this one again.

Oh my gosh, this was so good! I often have craved traditional cabbage rolls, but never felt like they were worth all the trouble of blanching the cabbage leaves, rolling them up, etc. This is the perfect answer. It's so easy, it's almost embarrassing. My husband loved it, and it was just as good the next day. Because I wanted a flavor like the ones at the Lebanese deli, I used ground lamb instead of beef, and I added some brown sugar and cinnamon. Fantastic!

I made this tonight for dinner...it turned out great!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half - so it only made 1- 9 x 13 inch pan - there was plenty left.  I also added - chopped red/green pepper, garlic salt, nutmeg, season salt and worsch. sauce.  It is very easy and very tasty.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

I made this receipe for my husband and myself.  The idea of a "casserole" appealed to me.  I found the recipe easy to make, but the pan size was not accurate.  I used double the size pan.  The only thing I did differently was added a good bit of pepper and some cajuan seasoning.  It was a great dish and the neighbor's loved the portion I gave them!  Also tasted good reheated.

Very tasty recipe. I used a mixture of Italian style stewed tomatoes and canned tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. I used Mrs. Dash for the seasoning. We loved it. I think I'll try it with chunks of chicken instead of ground beef next time.

We were having unexpected company yesterday and I decided to try this recipe on them.  Everyone loved it including my children.  I did add a sweet italian pepper and a small chili pepper to the recipe and was it ever delicious.  Very quick and easy to make.  There was definately more than enough for everyone.  My family liked it so much, they asked if I would make it more often. I would recommend this to everyone and plan to use it as a regular for any bring your own dish parties that we attend.

The kids thought it was so-so but the husband and I enjoyed this.  I didn't have beef broth, so I used chicken broth which worked great.  I added two cloves of garlic to this, and I thought it tasted just like the cabbage rolls my mom used to make.

This is similar to a recipe from a magazine called "Lazy Man's Stuffed Cabbage". It did make 2 lasagna trays and could be halfed. It got better as it sat in the refrigerator (great for a make-ahead). A good substitute but could never take the place of the "real thing".

YUM, YUM, YUM!!! This is fantastic. One of the best dishes we've ever had. This tastes better than traditional cabbage rolls, and it's incredibly simple.  I added some Italian seasoning when browning the meat, and more Italian seasoning and garlic to the tomato sauce. This is GREAT!!!

I was very happy with this recipe.  It was quick and easy to prepare.  It had all the taste of cabbage rolls without the work.  I added green pepper and this was very tasty.

I have tried a simular recipe with spaghetti sauce.  My husband and I didn't care for it at all.

The only problem that I had was that the recipe was much bigger than I had expected.  I would say it was more like 12 servings.  I put it into two small roaster pans.  I have cut in in half for next time.

Makes a lot!!!! I did add some brown sugar to the tomato sauce, next time I'll add more seasonings.
Just didn't have the same flavor as my cabbage rolls, I liked the overall idea though and will make it again but less of it!

Very good flavor.  I don't believe it is quite as good as the real thing, however.  But it is definitely easier.  I used the slow cooker and cooked it a little too long - probably should cook on low for about 5-6 hours. I pre-cooked the ground beef and onion and used Prego sauce.

This recipe satisfied my taste for cabbage rolls perfectly! I used pasta sauce and added a few other spices to pep-up the flavor. I also halved the recipe and that filled a regular-sized lasagna tray just fine.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of it's quickness rating.  Because it has to cook in the oven for an hour, when you are busy and short on time, that can be long.  However, I prepared it the night before, and just reheated it in the microwave the next day and it was still very good!  I added some garlic seasonings and cardamom seeds, and made it with low fat beef broth, extra lean ground beef and low fat/low cal tomato sauce.  It was a big success at home!  Something important with a 13 month old picky eater!  One last thing, the portions are HUGE, so it's great for big appetites!

This was good, but rather bland, so the next time I added a little more seasoning. (garlic, chili, and onion powders.) That improved the flavor.

I got good reviews from family on this. The cabbage and other ingredients did not fit in my 9x13, so I put it into 2-2liter casseroles. It seemed like a huge amount!!I would probably 1/2 the recipe next time. I will also try some of the other additions I have read in the other reviews

Great crockpot recipe!!  I made a few minor changes that I suggest....I boiled my cabbage first.  I've found it's always best to do that.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and used spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoe sauce.  I also cooked my beef with a packet of onion soup mix and 1 tbsp of minced garlic!

My mother still makes the BEST real Houlupkie (Stuffed Cabbage) but as a busy career woman -- this recipe works very well!!

This was a good recipe.  It was faster than making stuffed cabbage and had the same taste.  I took the leftover with me for lunch the next day.  I would make this again.

I found this recipe to be extremely bland for some reason. There also seemed to be quite a bit more cabbage than meat. I was hoping for something that tasted more like actual cabbage rolls, but this only tasted like shredded cabbage with tomato sauce.

I love this recipe.  I use extra cabbage and pour a can of spicy V-8 over top in place of some of the broth.  It's so easy and fast and tastes great!!

My family actually enjoyed this dish but I should have decreased the amt of cabbage.  3 1/2 pounds was too much!
I used italian tomato sauce & doubled it.

It is just like the way mom use to make them. I varied the recipe only slightly.
Instaed of tomaotoe sauce I put in a large can of Italian style diced tomatoes with some V-8 tomatoe juice to give it that real tomatoey flavour. If you're a tomatoe lover like me ,you won't be disappointed.

This recipe made a lot!  I usually cook for 8 adults but the standard recipe  made enough for seconds and then some.  Quick, easy, and it really does taste like stuffed cabbage rolls.  Even with the hour and half cooking time, the cabage was not mushy but just right.  I added a little vinegar to make it taste a little more like my stuffed cabbage roll dish.  It's a keeper!

A wonderful alternative to rolling!!My grandmother taught me how to make cabbage rolls and she always used a meat combination and a dash of sage...so I altered this recipe to 1 1/2 pounds each of beef, pork and veal.  It does make a difference!  Also, use a deep pan or it will boil over!

This is the first time I made "caggage Roll's"  I always wanted to try them, but never had the time. This recipe is very simple to make. I took the suggestion of other reviewers, and halved the recipe. By reading the list of spices, I knew this recipe would not be spicy enough for my taste so I added garlic and italian seasoning. It was wonderful.  I will definately make this again. Thanks Nancy!!

It is a good recipe, except that the next time I make it, I will make just a half recipe. There is too much to mix in the mixing bowl, and also too much for a 9x12 baking dish. A one-half recipe would be just right.

My husband, who loves my stuffed cabbage, said that this recipe was excellent.  He definetly wants this to be made again.  I feel that perhaps if I precooked the rice it would've been better, but it was tasty and much easier than rolling.  Great Alternative.

This dish is great, but it takes a long time to make.  It made quite a bit, and I was able to freeze over half for a later day.  My husband was leery at first sight, but loved it once he tasted it.
