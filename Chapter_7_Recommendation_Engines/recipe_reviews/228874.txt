Rather than boiling, I steamed the brussels sprouts in the microwave for 2-1/2 minutes.  Nice recipe and very easy.

I will definitely make this again.  I added a bit of cayenne salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar to the brussels sprouts and pan fried till golden then steamed them for about  10 min before tossing them with the gremmolata.  This is my new favorite brussels sprouts recipe!

The flavor was very mild. but it was good. I will be making this recipe again with a teaspoon of lemon juice. cooking the sprouts longer to make them a bit more tender. Thanks, Happy Cooking!
