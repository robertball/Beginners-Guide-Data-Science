Made this for a dinner party that we went to instead of our usual mandarin orange salad, when we realised that the host was diabetic...this turned out fantastic and received much 
praise from all the guests. We used pine nutes instead of sunflower as we do not really care for the latter and it worked fine...the arugula (aka rocket) is just an outstanding salad flavour. Salad is not overly leafy and the colours are very appealing. We dressed with a simple balsamic vineagrette. 

We will defnitely make this in future.

I halved this recipe and it was enough for 4!  Omitted the avacado because nobody likes them that I was serving.  Used blue cheese instead of goat as another reader suggested. Used a basil vinaigrette dressing. Loved it!  Delicious!

Beautiful salad. I used bagged spring mix instead of arugula and left out the mandarin oranges because I didn't have any. Topped with ranch dressing (the refrigerated kind from Sam's Club). This was delicious. Paired beautifully with the Sausage Tomato Tart that I made (see reviews).

This tasted so good I almost finished it all myself.  Like a mouthful of summer.  I will make this again and again, and I intend to take it with me when I bring a dish somewhere.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was fantastic........yum.  I used romaine lettuce, pine nuts, feta cheese, and olive oil and red wine vinegar for dressing.  Also, I didn't add the mandarin oranges because I forgot them.  I think it was better without them though.  I will definitely make this again.

This might be my new favorite salad! It was delicious! I served this with a simple vinaigrette and a grilled pork chop. Add a glass of wine and you have yourself a five star meal.
