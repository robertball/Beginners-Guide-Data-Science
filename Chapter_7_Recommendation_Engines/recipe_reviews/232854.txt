Unimpressed. Took a LOT of cornstarch to get some texture and added bacon to get any flavor. And why would you drain the cans of clams and then add bottled clam juice? Clam juice is expensive!

I made this tonight and it was excellent! So easy too. I so substituted 1% milk for cream to cut back in fat and sugar (my husband is diabetic) and used some corn starch to thicken it. He absolutely loved it. I willddefinitely be making this again.

I was looking for a simple and quick clam chowder recipe and I found it here. The only change I made was I used 1 bottle of clam juice. It was delicious!

Very fast,and tasty clam chowder that has no canned soup or evaporated milk...Awesome!! The only ingredient I added was 1 chopped celery stalk and a tad of Old Bay seasoning and a couple of dashes of smoked paprika.  Reminds me of the clam chowder we enjoy at the coast.

No taste, without the cream of mushroom soup. I used juice from canned clams, and canned am juice. I am not sure why I picked this recipe, maybe the novelty of the mushrooms!

This is the second time I've made this. It's easy to fudge on foods you don't have and foods you like. I thought two T of butter was a bit much so I went 1 T butter 1 of EVOO. Sauted the onions and some celery 'cause I had it. I added about 2-3 T of flour w/ salt & pepper cook stir constantly for 1 minute. Dropped the clam juice because I didn't have it but added a cup of chicken broth.  Used up leftover roasted potatoes drained two cans of clams into broth. Then finished w/clams and cream.

Made it, the problem is the American cream, it is dead, won’t thicken, if you have access to a fresh dairy, then it will thicken. If you try ganache, with American cream don’t bother,it will fail. You nee

I made it according to the recipe. I liked that is wasn’t gooey thick. I will make this again, but it is a small batch. Next time I will double it. And it is a little salty. Next time I won’t add salt as the clam juice adds enough salt on its own. Good soup!

I took a little different tack and used evaporated milk instead of cream, because it is what my family prefers.  Nice recipe!
