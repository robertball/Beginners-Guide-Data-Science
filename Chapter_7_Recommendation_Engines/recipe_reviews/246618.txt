Delicious! I used a low sodium chicken broth instead of the cubes and subbed kale for spinach, plus my salt wasn't kosher, but this turned out wonderfully! The dressing was so light and zippy and anytime quinoa and I get together it's a good time. Definitely would make this again for quick lunches.

My huband and I loved this simple recipe, but did not add the dressing.  He does not like strong flavors, yet I do, but neither of us liked it with dressing.  We made the quinoa as stated in recipe, but added green and kalamata olives and it was perfect for us.  Will definitely make again.  Great light, yet filing recipe!

I had leftover rice and quinoa mixture that I used.  It was a great way to use it.

This was great. Very light and flavorful. Good summer side dish.
