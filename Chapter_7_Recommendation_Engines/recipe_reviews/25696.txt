This can be made better by eliminating the potato flakes and cooking up medium diced potatoes. Add after cauliflower is cooked. Save the cheese out and let each person add what they want to. Saves having to clean up a messy pot.

I found this quite good and very well-received by those who liked a little spice.  It was easy, especially with a hand blender which I used to blend all the cauliflower.  I used a little more than the recipe called for and the flavor came through, mixing well with the ham, cheese and pepper (the strongest flavor but not the first one noticed.  I will definitely make it again!  I may try adding potatoes for a heartier soup and perhaps experiment with other seasonings to add body. I think that the kind of ham used and how it was cooked will also change the flavor a bit.

This soup is wonderful!  I made it last night in anticipation of our sub-zero weather coming up.  I added sliced mushrooms, zucchini, and green peas to the soup after I pureed some of the cauliflower.  I added nothing else for seasoning and it was perfect.  I only wish there was an easier way to clean melted cheese out of a cooking pot and bowls!

Really super easy soup and if you leave out the potato flakes, it's lower in carbs, too. I doubled the recipe so that I could use a mammoth head of cauliflower. I cooked the cauliflower in the broth, then pureed it in batches with some of the broth that it cooked in. I did add two very large organic chopped red peppers and one very large organic chopped zucchini and four cloves of garlic. I really wanted a little extra veggies in my soup to make it a little heartier and not just cauliflower-flavored. What I did was while I was pureeing the cauliflower and the broth, I sauteed the onion, pepper, zucchini and garlic in the EVOO (I did need a little more) in my soup pot and once they were ready, I just added the cauliflower puree and a little of the excess broth. I then added in the ham and the cheese. (I only used about 3/4 cup or so. Not much.) After tasting it, I did add about a teaspoon of red pepper flake. This really almost seems like a potato soup. That's what I love about cauliflower soup. You puree it and it fools you into thinking that it's potato soup and you don't need the added milk or cream to get that creamy flavor/texture. This soup had a few steps but the end result was awesome.

Excellent soup!!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I was looking for a recipe to use up the leftover ham from Christmas, however, I don't care for the traditional ham and bean soup.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out absolutely delicious.  p.s. a great time saver was using my submersible blender stick/wand to puree the cauliflower.  I served the soup with Hawaiian bread (also from allrecipes.com)which was a perfect combination--the spicy kick of the soup with the sweetness of the pineapple in the bread.  Thanks again for a great recipe

Excellent soup! Based on previous reviews, I used an additional cup of chicken broth for the cauliflower, and when it came time to add the ham & cheese, I made a paste with 1/2c milk & some flour.  I added that and the amt of potato flakes required to the soup. The result was a creamy, cheesy soup with a kick. Next time, I will have to double the recipe so that we all have seconds...this doesn't last long in our house.

Made this today.  Previous reviews said it was bland so I did make a few changes because I like soup with a lot of flavor. I also needed to use up a few veggies that were in the fridge.  I sauteed the onion with celery, carrot, onion & garlic & 2 bay leaves.  Added 3 cans ckn broth & 1 can of veg broth.  Learned this from another recipe on this site.  Veg broth does make a difference.  Scored a smoked pork hock.  Put it in & simmered for 1 hour. Took the hock out.  Put the cauliflower & a lonely little diced zucchini in & simmered for a few minutes.  Put the immersion blender in for a few seconds. Not long.  I like to see the veggies in my soup. Added diced ham & meat from the hock.  Mixed 1/2 cup flour & milk & let it thicken.  Finally the potato  flakes. I will make this again. OH YUM!!!!! Also when you are adding the cheese do it a little at a time and keep stirring has it melts.  This way you won"t have a cheese ball in your soup.  Enjoy

Good, but I had to add nearly a cup of potato flakes to get a thick soup.  I prefer a more traditional thickening method--roux and milk and/or chicken broth would give a smoother texture.  Potatoes would be a good addition; simmering them with the cauliflower would add stach to the broth and help to thicken.

I eliminated that potato flakes and added a diced potato, BUT the cheese isn't a good idea, very messy, instead I would substitute Cheez Whiz instead next time....had some left over corn I added....and now it's a keeper.  I also added a dash of pepper flakes....now it's a five!!!

I love this soup!  What a great way to use the leftover ham from the holidays!  I love the cauliflower in this soup.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written except I doubled the recipe.  Don't forget the cilantro, it really makes it.  Even the teenagers ate it up and asked for seconds! This is a keeper.  Thank you!

Loved the taste of this soup, my only complaint like others the cheese doesn't melt, need something like velveeta.  Will make again.

The only change I made was to eliminate the ham.  I have to say that the taste was great but I couldn't get past the texture.   The potato flakes seemed a bit starchy and the cheese wouldn't blend into the soup to my satisfaction.  Won't be making this again. sorry

Yummy.  Subs too numerous to mention but not too many to get the idea.  I needed to use up some cauliflower, potatoes, ham, and cheese.  Used mostly pepper jack but threw in bits and pieces of white American and cheddar.

I found this to be a good base recipe, but added carrots and jalapeno at the beginning. When almost done cooking (before blending) I added cilantro, and served it with a little more fresh cilantro and chopped jalapeno on top. I also omitted the potato flakes and used white cheddar cheese, didn't have any pepper jack.

Good soup, although the texture wasn't very attractive. Added more ham then the recipe called for and next time I won't bother with the cilantro, which I don't think added much.

Keeper recipe.  Added 3 potatoes and boiled them with the cauliflower.  Also added 2 bay leaves.  Then blended it all.  Used about 3/4 cup of cheese.  Yum.

This soup was super-easy and totally delicious!!!  However, I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  We eat mostly vegetarian, so I left out the ham.  Also, I used real potatoes, finely sliced instead of potato flakes.  In addition to the Pepper Jack, I used some Chipotle Cheddar which kicked the spice up a notch--I probably only used 1/2-3/4 cheese, and it still tasted amazing.  I was shocked that there weren't any spices needed to make the flavor so scrumptious.

So quick and easy!  I added garlic to the onion, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Used a hand blender to make it even quicker.  Got a "please make again" from the family, and I definitely will.

This yielded a lot more than 4 servings, at least with the changes I made: used a whole cauliflower head, as I have no idea how much 3.5 cups is. I used a whole package of roasted garlic potato flakes, and it turned out very thick and yummy. It was great and will make again.

Great Soup. Used left over ham from a spiral. Added a little more onion and cheese. Also used canned potatoes over the instant flakes (used half can). The soup has a great flavor and kick. The cilantro topped it off. YUM.

Absollutely delicious! I sauteed 6 fresh mushrooms with the onions. I added an extra cup of chicken broth and 1 diced cooked potato with the cauliflower. Next time I'd use 1/2 PepperJack and 1/2 Monterey Jack with Habaneros.

I thoroughly loved this soup, made it twice. The 1st time I had to sub regular colby jack mix for pepperjack for the company I was serving and used seasoned potato flakes that I had on hand. The 2nd time I made it, I used the nacho cheese blend that is made from a local company with the pepperflakes and cilanto already in it...man both times, top notch. The one thing I like about this recipe is, that it may look like a cream based soup...without the cream persay and the potato flakes addition. The potato flakes help skip the dislike part on liquid separation in the recipe. Without the cream, a lot of times I see the liquid separating from recipes and makes the recipes look watered down, this nice little step of adding the potato flakes takes that irraition I get right out the window. I might have to use that trick in a few different recipes that I love. Great addition to winter weather soup rotations for sure and soo simple to make. Thank so much, my family truely loves this recipe.

Great soup!  I used turkey broth that I had made with the turkey carcass from Thanksgiving, and also the leftover ham from that day.  Great use of those things.  I had bought cauliflower a couple weeks ago, and blanched and froze it, and it worked wonderfully in this- not mushy at all.  I did used more potato flakes than it called for, as I wanted it a tad thicker.  I added a healthy amount of salt and pepper (I made my broth salt free, so it needed some).  Like others, and like I do with almost all soups that call for cheese, I left the cheese out and allowed my family to add it their bowls.  I also chopped up a scallion for the top, as we like onions around here.  Very, very easy and quick dinner, perfect for this cold winter's night!  Thanks PAPERDOLL2- this one is a keeper for me  :)

This was a relatively simple soup to make, that was extremely well received at my house. I made a few changes, I used an immersion blender, not a food processor; I increased the amount of potato flakes, to help increase the thickness of the soup; and I did not add the cheese into the soup. After reading other reviewers complain about washing cheese out of the their pots, I topped the soup with cheese and cilantro when it was being served. My dad, who is not a big soup fan, took seconds without being asked! That is high praise in my house! Will definitely be making again.

Oh so yummy with that little kick from the pepperjack. I used a large head (about 2 pounds) of cauliflower, reserving about 2 cups of small  florets.  I did not have to use the potato flakes (better for our low carb diet) and is was creamy and delish.  Micro or steam the reserved florets and add them to the finished soup.  Really a great recipe.

This is a great family recipe!!  The kids loved it (I'd made extra, and I'm lucky I did; as my fairly picking 7 year old asked for it the next day!)   I did make some changes though; to make it a bit better to our taste.  We'd added a bit of garlic when sauteing the onions; and a bit of diced mushrooms (which the kids hate but we love); a bit of zucchini; and a little brocoli; as well as some potatos (added about 6 medium/large potatoes for a double recipe.)  Blended up; the kids ate all the veggies; no worries; we'd blended about 3/4 of the soup; made for a thick; but still slightly chucky, soup.   We'd added the cheese to individual bowls to help with cleanup (as it takes forever to scrub cheese out of a pot!)   Also; instead of using ham or chicken broth - we'd gotten a smoked pork hock and covered it with water; and simmered that for half an hour or so.  Then removed the pork hock and cut all the meat off of it to use in place of the ham.  And the water used to boil the hock in - instead of draining it out; we'd used that instead of chicken broth; and topped up whatever was nessesary with water and chicken stock powder.  Really nice flavour; really hearty; warming, soup; perfect winter/fall meal!

It was ok.  I love cream of cauliflower soup but was trying to avoid the high fat and calories.  This recipe did that but I sure missed the fat and calories : )

Superb!  The pepper jack cheese makes it so good. I added a little more potato flakes than called for because I like a thick soup.  I also pureed all the cauliflower which made it thicker.

Yummy! So good with the mild kick of pepper jack cheese. Great combo of flavors with cauliflower, cheese, and potato. I used a sixteen-ounce package of ham slices and an eight-ounce package of shredded pepper jack. I diced one large white potato, cooked in the broth with the cauliflower (to thicken the soup). Added eight ounces of Velveeta and two ounces heavy cream. (Yes, I know Velveeta is not real cheese ; ) ... But the emulsifiers  support the melty-ness of other cheeses, making for a super-creamy, non-separating soup.) Thanks for the recipe. A real keeper!

My husband said not enough flavor plus it was too spicy hot.  On the plus side, it wasn't hard to put together, but we won't be making it again.

this was delicious.  and better yet, quick!  i did have to boil the cauliflower for about 7-8 mins, tho, as i didn't want it 'grainy'.  i used an infuser to blend right in the pot.  i also used shredded monterey jack cheese. i will definitely make this again.  thanks

The cheese in this recipe clumped together in the soup and made the it rubbery.  If there were a way to emulsify the cheese, the recipe would be tasty.

This was delicious, easy and super fast!  I used a small potato, peeled and small dice, as I didn’t have potato flakes.  Also added a little diced red bell pepper since I had that on hand. We will make this again and often. We may reduce the cheese to one cup to save some fat and calories.  The soup is so good, I don’t think we’ll miss it.

I adjusted the recipe a little bit used two boxes of chicken broth two peeled chopped potatoes, Some celery stalks with leaves chopped up, two packages of frozen cauliflower, couple of carrots chopped and some edamame at the end. I simmered then puréed 1/2 the cauliflower with the chicken broth, Celery, onion and some of the cooked potato, then added the potato cubes, carrots and ham to the purée & I let it simmer till the potatoes and carrots were cooked and I added the cheese the edamame some butter and a little bit of milk. The only seasoning I used was a little french fry seasoning and salt and pepper. I think it’s yummy, am taking it to a pot luck today!

I had fresh broccoli crowns & sweet organic carrots to use up on a busy work night, added to the cauliflower to steam.    Once veggies were tender, I removed 1/2 & puréed with my immersion blender.  Added back into soup, nice taste & golden color along with  some canned mushrooms (all I had) & about 1/2 cup of leftover mashed potatoes/chives from night before. to thicken.  Tossed in some shredded mozzarella/provolone in addition to pepper jack.  Great taste w/o adding cream/milk.  Served with garlicky texas toast.

I thought this soup was so good!!! I made one variation in that I used italian chicken sausage instead of ham. The only thing I would change is trying to figure out a different thickener instead of potato flakes...I am gluten free so they work in regards to that but I don't know if they make organic potato flakes that don't have preservatives in them. Otherwise Delicious!

Good soup!  The only change that I made was to use refrigerated shredded potatoes instead of the instant.  I added 1 cup of the shredded potatoes with the cauliflower.

Next time I might try roasting the cauliflower just to see how that tastes.

Thanks!

Hubby and I loved this! Lovely light flavor, with the cauliflower and potato providing "creaminess" without the cream. And just the right amount of kick from the pepper jack. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to substitute 2 red potatoes, diced, for the potato flakes; cooked them right along with the cauliflower. Unlike others, I didn't have a problem at all with the cheese sticking to the pan, probably because my pan is nonstick.
