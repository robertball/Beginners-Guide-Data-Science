This large recipe could easily be scaled down.  Definitely a cookie that would appeal to those who enjoy molasses cookies, for that is what they essentially are.

These are delicious, and the dough is easy to make. However, this is the stickiest dough ever!  I finally figured out that I needed to roll the dough right on the parchment paper, cut out the cookies and remove the scraps, because the dough was too sticky to be transferred. Makes a ton of cookies, so good for a cookie exchange if you're willing to do the work.

We didn't like these cookies even a little bit!  Made the dough. You better be a REAL molasses lover for this one.
