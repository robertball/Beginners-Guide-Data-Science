Hi, Lady Linda here with a correction of a misprint in the recipe! I use only 1 tsp each of both ginger and hot pepper flakes. My husband sometimes asks for extra spicy, but the rest of the family value our tastebuds too dearly to burn them off! lol!

Sure glad I tasted the scallops after cooked in the spicy sauce but before proceeding.  It was horrible.  I cut the red pepper flakes back to 1/4 tsp from 1 T. but it still fried my mouth.  In all fairness I didn't have any Fish Sauce so used oriental Oyster sauce.  Still, the flavor was totally unappealing.  Threw out the scallops and sauce and used the vegis in a normal chicken stir fry.

The recipe was delicious although a bit too spicy. Next time, I would cut the pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon. I also substituted vegetable broth for all of the broths as that is all that I had.

Loved it but ended up increasing broth to a can.  We like sauce and found the amount of liquid in the receipe was not enough.  I also increased vegetables. We liked the warmth of the red pepper and did not find it overwhelming, but that is a result of the additional ingrediants.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe turn out very good. Only I did different was I cut out the red pepper flake. Overall it turn out good for me. I substituted the fish sauce with soy and Worcestershire sauce. My kids loved it!!! That's all it matters to me.

This is a good recipe, but I did use less red pepper flakes for the kids' sake!! I really like Asian food and love to find new recipes that are easy and I can cook at home!

This recipe was too spicy and I like spicy foods. Will use 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes the next time. Did not have fish sauce so I used clam sauce.  Added 1/2 cup more of chicken broth after I sauted the vegetables because I wanted more liquid so I could serve everything over rice. Will make again.

I made this with firm white fish cut in bite size pieces.  My husband does not like "seafood" per se but will eat white fish.  I used bok choy, carrots, yellow pepper and a couple small potatoes.  It was very good!  Next time will put over rice.  I would say this is worth making again!  Kind of spicy-but we love spice!

I made this with what I had, which was just the shrimp and no zucchini.  I had canned mushrooms.   It was ok.    I think the marinate for the shrimp helped give it some zing.   I used almost a Tablespoon of the red peppers and it wasn't hot enough for me.

This was pretty good. I cut the red pepper flakes in half and it was still really spicy, and the ginger was a bit too overpowering for us. There wasn't much of a sauce to serve over rice or pasta, I served it over couscous.

one major difference...stir fry the veges first, then the scallops and shrimp (i used fresh not cooked shrimp) also used soy sauce and a bit of sugar. Served with stir fried rice.

This was a perfect recipe for the seafood lovers in us. However, I added a tablespoon of red chili paste over the flakes and did not add any carrots (not fans). This took a lot longer to cook and had to add more cornstarch at the end to give it a real thickness. Still wasn't hot enough for us but just added Siracha on top to give a bit more kick.
