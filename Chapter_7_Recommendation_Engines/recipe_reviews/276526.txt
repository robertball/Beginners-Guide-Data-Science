I've made this a few times, its easy but does take some prior planning because the potatoes need to chill. Mixing it how he shows with the forks makes a big difference, and is worth the extra effort. I used Gruyere cheese once but its better with cheddar.

I don't think I've ever had potatoes romanoff, but I'm certainly a fan! This recipe did not disappoint, but I did take the advice of others and reduced the amount of salt I used in half. Definitely a keeper!

I made these for Holiday dinner party . Worked great ! Did  baking of potato on day . The next day put everything  in  Large  baking casserole I sprinkle a little salt as I had guests on low sodium and covered lightly . The day of a party all that was left to do was pepper the top lightly with cayenne Thank you John no left overs!

Made it twice: First exactly as written except decreased salt by half as cheese has a lot of salt in it - glad I did. Second round - by request BTW for New Year's day dinner - was a bit  shy of cheddar so shaved in half a stick frozen butter and green onion in place of shallot as it's what I had. Rave reviews again.  Personally prefer the green onion cuz I like 'em but this appears to be a user friendly recipe. Will stick with half the salt, green onion, probably try yellow cheddar for more visual interest since it's just lightly tossed in and maybe some bacon.  Great recipe. TY Chef John, love your recipes and inspiration!!

Great dish alongside prime rib,  I would use a little less salt next time, and I cooked it in five little cast iron pans (#3) so each person had their own serving pan, mostly for presentation, and I have vintage cast iron pan addiction to justify .

I followed the receipt exactly.  Way, way, way too much salt.

Made no changes.  Made it with his prime rib recipe for Christmas dinner. Family loved it. They  Couldn't  believe I would shred my own potatoes. I will definitely make them again and again. I used kosher and it was a tad salty for our taste buds. I would lessen the kosher half a teaspoon next time. I actually made this ahead and placed back into frig. After prime rib was sitting and covered I popped it into oven. Both ready to serve at the same time. For me this dish was not time consuming. Took less time than If I made cheesy pot with the canned soup. This was much much better.

I thought this was great. I didn’t think it was a lot of work.  For me the hardest part was making sure the sour cream was fully mixed in.  I did not add the cayenne.

Used green onions (1/3 cup) instead of shallots. This may be the best potato dish I have eaten.

Family thought it is a really good dish, although a lot of work. I would recommend half the salt.

Made for Thanksgiving and everyone raved! Made exactly as directed except I had to use black pepper instead of white as that was all that was available. Everyone requested these for Christmas dinner as well. Thanks Chef John!
