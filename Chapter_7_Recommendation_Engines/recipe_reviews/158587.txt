Some wise advice when making this recipe would be to make sure you have all your ingredients out and all your cheeses shredded before beginning,because you need to stir the flour mixture continuously. This recipe does not take long to prepare, and the sauce is very rich, with all the cheeses. Also, the liquid smoke is a necessary ingredient for the smokey flavor this recipe is intending to deliver. Although I feel this is a delightful tasting dish, I enjoy traditional mac & cheese a bit better. Sometimes a shot of liquid smoke to regular mac & cheese lends a great flavor. But I enjoyed the experience of trying the different cheeses in this recipe, such as the swiss, which I had never used in a mac & cheese recipe. All said and done, I would make this again for a change of pace. Thanks for sharing!

This. Is. Awesome!

I wanted to sneak some veggies in for my kids, so I cut the macaroni in half and did a 12 oz. package of cauliflower I blanched for a couple minutes. I also sauteed a couple large handfuls of matchstick carrots in with the onion and garlic. My kids aren't big on cream cheese in their macaroni, so I used 1/2 c. of sour cream, which was a nice touch, and I also added a little Frank's. Everything else I kept the same. Very, very good. You couldn't tell that there was cauliflower or carrots in it. My kids and husband inhaled it and asked for more. I will suggest that if you make this, you might want to half it unless you have a big family. This fills a large 9x13 baking dish!

TIP: If you chop the cauliflower in small pieces, it unnoticable when you add it to macaroni dishes!

WOW, this was really good, I used provolone in place of the swiss, because I really dont like swiss.  I bet gruyer would be nice, anywhoo, I did not use the liquid smoke, but i did use roasted garlic instead to give it a deeper flavor, omg, with the breadcrumbs and parm on top, to die for!thx

This was a wonderful mac and cheese recipe!  I followed it exactly, w/one exception...i did not use the liquid smoke simply bc I did not have any.  It was still delicious...it reminded me of my mom's homemade recipe...i will definitely make again...also easy for a beginner cook, and great for picky eaters like my husband!

I made this along with meatloaf tonight and it was amazing! I don't know what those 1 star raters are talking about. I did make a change or two. The first change I made was to the roux. I did not add 1/4 cup flour because in my experience with making mac and cheese, too much flour will make it dry no matter how much liquid you use. I instead melted the butter, cooked the onion and garlic then slowly drizzled in the flour and stopped at a certain point. Then after that I let it cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Then I added the milk and half and half and cooked for ten minutes. After that I did the following in order with the pan on low on the stove: I added the cream cheese, stirring until the mixture was smooth, then I added the Parmesan and mixed until smooth, then I added the cheddar in three parts, mixing until smooth after every addition, then I added the Monterrey jack in three parts, stirring until smooth after every addition, then added the Swiss in three parts, stirring until smooth after every addition. Then I added the pasta. I omitted the smoked flavor and the bread crumb topping and I added seasoning salt and black pepper to the roux before I added the cheese. This was a nice recipe and there is no reason why, if you follow my tips, that you cannot achieve smooth sauce. Remember, adding cold ingredients to a hot sauce when the pan is off the stove is going to yield griddy results. This is just experience over 19 years, I started when I was 8 years old.

I try a lot of mac & cheese recipes and really enjoyed this one. I've never used cream cheese before, but it really gives the sauce a smooth creamy texture. To enhance the smokiness I added 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika and crumbled bacon. I would definitely make this again!

This was SOOO good!!!  I followed the recipe pretty much except that I didn't have Swiss, so I used a "fiesta" mix of shredded cheese (Monterey Jack, Asiago, etc.), and I didn't top it with breadcrumbs.  I've never had mac and cheese with liquid smoke, but it was absolutely delicious, and I love the flavor it added.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe was great...I hosted a dinner for 8 people and EVERYONE loved it! I didn't use the onion or the cream cheese (personal preference), and instead of swiss used shredded mozzerella. Love this, will stay a keeper for this family!

I followed this recipe.  It came out WAY to dry and I had to add ALOT more milk.  The flavor was just OK.

I made this recipe three times, one exactly as is, one without the optional liquid smoke, and one with the additions to make it a little more creamy: 1 tsp dijon mustard, no liquid smoke, 3/4 cup half and half in place of the 1/2 cup. It was a great recipe all three ways, but I prefer it without the liquid smoke and my only complaint was that it was a bit dry so with the additions it came out with a creamier sauce and was more what I wanted.

this recipe is GREAT! I have tried it using so many different cheeses and it always comes out amazing! I've used habenero pepper infused cheddar cheese or pepper jack when I want a little kick to it. I also put a bit of cayenne pepper it complements the smoke without being too spicy. I love using seriously sharp cheddar because it adds to the smoke. If you don't like liquid smoke try using apple-wood smoked cheddar. It's amazing! thanks for sharing this recipe it's rotating my menu pretty frequently and it's not so expensive to make!!! Gracias!!! :)))

I loved this recipe! I made it for my boyfriend for a special dinner and he loved it so much and speaks of it often (enough that I've made it again). I did my own thing with the cheeses, I personally love gouda so chose to substitute that in for one of the cheese (it turned out amazing). I also added some cooked bacon pieces to give it a smokey flavor. All in all, it is amazing. Try it out!

Very cheese! We left out the liquid smoke thinking it would make it taste odd.  After cooking it I can see how the smoke flavor could complement the cheese flavor. 

This is a good mac and cheese base recipe.  You could add different cheeses or even meats to change the flavor. 

We are making it again this weekend and will be adding rotisserie chicken pieces to it.  We are also thinking smoked salmon would also be a good addition.

This was just ok. The flavor of that liquid smoke is very overpowering and not at all what I wanted to taste in my macaroni and cheese.

This is a great recipe and will not disappoint but I'm looking for something a bit more rich in flavor. Next time I will play around with different cheeses and see what happens.

I still must tweek this recipe a bit to my own personal taste, but it has the basics of a GREAT M&C dish!  The idea of the cream cheese is genius and makes a real difference in the creaminess of the finished product.  FIVE stars!

This is the BEST baked mac and cheese I have ever had/made! Followed the resume for the most part- just didn't have parmesan cheese so I used more mild and sharp cheddar cheese. Also used evaporated milk instead of half and half. Grated asiago cheese on top along with the bread crumbs. Bread crumbs are a MUST. This is SOOO good and exactly how baked mac and cheese should taste!

I was looking for a mac and cheese recipe that didn't call for a processed cheese as the main ingredient (like Velveta) and came across this one. Very good, however, I would skip the flour step. This recipe is basically how I make alfredo sauce, just with different cheeses. And I have never used flour or any thickener. If it's too thin, add more cheese!  I also suggest using a whisk when adding the milk/half & half. I've found that when you heat the butter and milk together (in any cheese sauce), whisking for a good minute or two before adding anything else will help it from separating later.

Excellent Macaroni and Cheese!  Instead of liquid smoke, I added Bacon Salt, and as other reviewers did, substituted a hearty dollop of sour cream for the cream cheese.  I took it to a Super Bowl party and it was gone quickly.  Will make again and again!!

This was OK. Like other reviewers stated, it seemed really dry as I was making the sauce, so I added another cup of milk and another half cup of half and half. Also added paprika to the sauce and a little dried parsley in with the breadcrumbs. I also roasted my garlic before adding.  All said and done it was a little bland, though. Pretty rich but bland. The smokiness didn't come out as much as I expected, but this might be because of the extra milk I added.  I don't think I'll make it again, but if I was going to I would butter the bread crumbs first, use about half the flour the recipe called for and maybe change the cheeses around a bit. I like Swiss, but I think it overpowered the other cheeses in this dish.

Oh my goodness, this is so good!  When I tasted the smallest drop of the liquid smoke, I thought that maybe I should leave it out because it tasted terrible on its own, but I'm glad I left it in.  As soon as I put the cheese in the sauce it was clear that the liquid smoke was adding the perfect little oomph! to this dish.

This came out very well. I buttered the bread crumbs before spreading them because every time I have a recipe that does NOT call for doing that, it has sandpaper on top at the end, though I realize that the method as written does work fine for other people. I twice-baked this recipe (30 minutes the day I assembled it, another 30 minutes the day I served it) and it came out terrific. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  A little time consuming for mac n cheese, but worth it.  I used smoked gouda instead of Swiss and Colby Jack instead of Monterey.  I imagine Manchester cheese would be good somewhere in there, too.  Do add the liquid smoke when you make this.  Mmmmm!

Very good! I left out the liquid smoke (didn't have any) and added 1 cup each chopped ham and frozen peas to make it a meal. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I was afraid it was going to be too thick and dry when I saw how thick the bechemel was and how goopy it became when I added all the cheese. But once it baked off, it was creamy and delicious. Also, I used freshly grated Parmesan, not the Kraft powder stuff. I will continue to use fresh-grated in the sauce, but I think in the future I'll use the powder with the bread crumbs for the topping.

It's incredible!  I did, like most others, add a lot more milk, and I didn't have onions, so I just added a little onion powder.  I used swiss,mild cheddar, and an italian mixture along w/ a mexican mixture.  I had a lot of different cheeses stored in my freezer!  I'm anxious to see how my kids like it since they usually only like the boxed kind!  Also, I used panko breadcrumbs and broiled for a couple of minutes @ the end to brown.

nice & cheesy, bread crumb topping did not go over well with the fam and they thought it was a bit rich.  Will make again but use more milk maybe. Also needs a bit more zip I think - maybe will add some jalapeno jack next time.

Best mac and cheese I've ever tasted!  Before tasting it, I thought I'd never make it again, because it's fairly labor intensive.  It's worth it!!  My changes: 1 whole 1-lb. box of macaroni, only 1/4 c. onion to please my daughter, didn't have garlic, so I used 1 t. garlic powder, only 1/4 t. liquid smoke, and I ussed mozzarella instead of Swiss.  Tastes amazing!!

This dish was a real hit at dinner last night.  As others recommended, I omitted the flour and was glad I did as it was a bit dry even without it (hence the 4 out of 5 stars)!  A very pleasing flavor and texture.  I added bacon bits and used panko instead of breadcrumbs. definitely making this again!  Eating the leftovers for lunch right now! :-)

As suggested by others, I added a little more milk for maximum creaminess. I didn't have mustard powder, so I used regular yellow mustard. Deeee-licious!

This was pretty good but just a little bit dry and I even added a lil' extra milk.  I'm thinking that maybe using less flour might help.  I also added in some crumbled bacon and sliced green onions.  If I make this again I think I might change up the cheeses next time and use less flour.

AMAZING! payed close attention to the reviews that gave this recipe a bad rating..i was worried to make after that but it sounded so appetizingly interesting and different so i did it any way.... the biggest complaint ppl had was that it was too dry...so i doubled the half and half and the milk 1 cup of half and half 3  cups of whole milk....VERY creamy and delicious... i also cooked some bacon with the garlic and onions but i don't think it needed it.  for the topping since the recipe didn't call for butter in the bread crumbs i used ritz butter crackers instead...stayed very light and crispy...yum

Um... nope. Made this for dinner tonight. It is chilly here in Chicago (I think fall is setting in early!). A comforting meal seemed to be the ticke. And what better food to serve than creamy baked macaroni and cheese (not to mention this recipe has been on my "to try" list for quite a while)! To my disappointment, this was BLAND and had a very unappealing, pasty texture. I had to add an additional cup of liquid (1/2 c. half-half and 1/2 c. milk) to achieve a consistency other than cement (and my sauce was still terribly thick, regardless). My other gripe is that there is WAAAAY too much topping. It should be substantial enough to cover your pasta, but not so much so that it creates a thick, powdery layer on top. Both the Parm cheese and breadcrums need to be tossed with melted butter and then sprinkled over all. I've never seen a recipe that didn't include the addition of melted butter, but left all common sense out the window and am sad I did. I pretty much followed Eshel's directions to the letter except for subbing mini penne pasta for macaroni (at the last minute, I realized I was out) and Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs for plain ones. Other than these two changes and the addition of liquid, I followed this recipe exactly. Sorry, Eschel, my fiance and I agree that this is not worth a repeat. We didn't even save the leftovers. What a waste (sigh...). Thanks anyways!

This is everything mac and cheese should be. It has all the best ingredients. My only suggestion is to use 1 tbsp dijon mustard instead of the dry  mustard powder, it give a stronger flavor, and also add some smoked paprika.

I tried this recipe this past weekend. It was a big hit, I used rigatoni for noodles, formed bread crumb shells in a muffin pan then loaded them up and topped them with sprinkled bread crumbs and greated paramsen cheese and baked them. I also substituded jack for pepper jack for a little kick. They popped out nice after cooling for about 10 miniutes, I will be doing this one again. the rigatoni noodles pushed serving suggestion from 8 to 13. Thanks for posting the recipe!

Not very good, the combination of cheeses wasn't quite right. Macaroni and cheese is a favorite of both my husband and daughter, yet neither of them enjoyed eating this. My search for the best Mac and cheese recipe is back on.

Liquid Smoke is one of those ingredients where a little goes a veeeeery long way, so I cut the amount back to 5-6 drops (about 1/4 to 1/8 tsp). PERFECT!! Also added 1 cup each chopped ham and frozen green peas, and increased the half and half to 3/4 cup. Broiled it for the last two mins so I got the all important crusty presentation for the adoring throngs at the table. Served with green salad.

My family and guest loved this!!! I am in the process of making it again for or New Year Eve gathering.  My only input would be to add more cream.  I added additional cream to make the sauce creamier and so that I could stir the sauce.  I think I added an additional cup of cream.

Made it last weekend.  Took the advice of the many who said add at least one more cup of water. Had no liquid smoke so I used one third cup smoked sharp cheddar.  It came out perfect. It does make a lot so lots of leftovers. Zap a serving size in the microwave for about 30 seconds and it comes out great!  I also took the advice of a previous poster and all ingredients measured and ready to go.  It happens fast!!

This was really good...I picked it because it called for cream cheese, which I thought would help get rid of that strange "grainy" texture melted cheese sometimes gets. It worked and the recipe was yummy. I didnt have liquid smoke unfortunatley but maybe next time I will add someother type of smoky meat (bacon, sausage, etc)

good recipe. definately a keeper! I do not add the liquid smoke because I'm just not a fan of it, but it still turns out great. I've used different cheeses at different times and its really good. A good recipe to get rid of those half used bags of cheese that I seem to collect!

I love this recipe! I didn't use the smoke flavoring though, instead I bought smoked sharp cheddar cheese and it was GREAT! Kids loved it and so did the hubby.  I am going to make this mac & cheese for our 4th of july party!

We were impressed.  We used long macaroni noodles (made serving a bit more tricky), a little less cream cheese (ran out), and skipped both the swiss and parm on top (seemed cheesy enough).  The onions and liquid smoke were great additions.

I used corkscrew macaroni, holds sauce better. Also 3/4 Cup half and half rather than 1/2 Cup. A little less liquid smoke -1/4 tsp but added 1 tsp smoked paprika. Panko breadcrumbs and the grated Parmesan are the best topping! I have made this recipe twice and it is by far the best Mac and cheese ever.

This was so good. I've been looking for a good mac and cheese recipe and finally found one. I made a few slight changes. I put crumbled up thick bacon in the sauce instead off liquid smoke, very yummy, and I used provolone cheese instead of Swiss. everything else the same.

Great classic and basic. I used this as a guide and then used what I had on hand and then some. It was yummy! My son thought it was great and went back for more. 

I only had 6 ounces of macaroni,  so halved the recipe though I was very loose with the measurements and put in more than called for cheese I think. I used more than called for yellow onion plus half a large shallot,  and bottled minced garlic. I also added matchsticked baby rainbow carrots and minced red bell pepper to the onion and garlic. I doubt that I stirred the flour or cheeses mixture (parm per recipe, assiago, extra sharp cheddar (more than recipe), and mozzerella) as called for, and I used fat free plain Greek yogurt instead of the cream chese. I added lots of leftover ham, cubed/chopped.  I used lots of fresh cracked black and white pepper, but I didn't have liquid smoke and didn't miss it. 

I'll make this again, and think for my family of three, that a half recipe is plenty. Thanks!

This was a great recipe and was devoured by my family. The liquid smoke was a great addition! I did have to add additional half and half and milk to the cheese mixture as it was really thick, but other than that, this recipe's wonderful as is!

I usually follow the recipe the first time and made it for a church function.  I found there was WAY too much cheese - could have probably been halved - and not enough liquid and could not taste the smoke flavor.  I had to add extra liquid just to stir in with the macaroni.  I have a huge wooden spoon and found it very difficult to stir so added more half & half.  I checked twice on the amount of cheese I had actually used and it was correct to the recipe.  Doubt very much if I will make again

Very good and easy to make, too.  Forgot to put the cream cheese in but was still very tasty.  We didn't use liquid smoke as we're not fans of smoked food.

I gave this 4 stars because I thought it was too time-consuming and I had to adjust the ingredients in the end to get it into the baking pan. I didn't have time to read reviews beforehand for insight, so I made it as directed. By the time I got all the cheeses in, the consistency was very gummy and almost impossible to stir in the pasta. I added more milk until the consistency was right. The end result was delicious--my kids loved it. The aroma while baking and out of the oven was so good. There are so many mac and cheese recipes to try, I don't know if I'll make this again for a while, but it is a delicious twist to the traditional.

I improvised with the cheese - I had a pile of leftover cheese from a part tray and decided to use it instead.  I skipped the liquid smoke as I had smoked cheddar in my cheese pile - I think it would have been better with all smoked cheddar, or as the original recipe was written.  I also had a lot of leftover cheese - not sure how creamy this was supposed to be but my end product was good and I had about 2 cups of cheese leftover (used it as a fondue) 
Next time I am going to try adding some cooked ground beef to the casserole as well!

This was my first attempt at baked macaroni. It was good but not great. I would have liked it better if the sauce had been smoother (it seemed a bit grainy), thinner, and possibly more abundant.

THIS WAS AMAZING. (better then my moms!) I made this for my boyfriend and his sister and they definitely agreed with the amazing part. we used a very sharp white cheddar and a salsa jack cheese which gave it a little kick. i would suggest having everything ready before you start cooking so you don't have to run around the kitchen like a chicken with your head cut off like me. mad props :-)

Wow.  It was a little complicated to make because I had multiple things going on.  But I made this as a side for new years and it went over so well.  Left out the smoky flavoring and due to not having enough jack cheese had to up the other kinds and it was still awesome.

I really liked this recipe.  We used mid-sized shells instead of the traditional elbow macaroni.  That worked well.  The cheese mixture, when we made the recipe, was very thick...I agree with another reviewer that perhaps additional milk or half&half would create a smoother cheese.  Ours turned out VERY thick...but delicious.

This recipe was delicious. I added 1 t mustard because I did not have mustard powder, and did not use the liquid smoke because I'm not sure if I really like the idea of using it, but it came out delicious. All the different cheeses were fantastic. I really want to try making it with bacon next time!

I haven't made this yet but, as I am craving m+c, I will.  I will not, however, add liquid smoke.  The idea of liquid smoke always turned me off: it sounds so chemical and I hate artificial flavors.  Instead, I will dice and saute some good bacon or buy some ham ends at the deli for smoky flavor.  Will also cut back on the cheese: will probably eliminate the Jack altogether and may add chopped spinach.

Great flavor, but this was waaaay too rich for me. I prefer a creamy mac 'n' cheese, but this was very thick and goopy, even after adding extra milk. I subbed smoked Gouda for liquid smoke and Jack, and I topped with french-fried onions instead of Parm and bread crumbs. If I made this again, I'd halve the cheese.

This was delicious.  It had a unique flavor because of the garlic, onion, smoke flavoring and dry mustard.  Most macaroni and cheese dishes have pretty much the same ingredients and so, therefore, pretty much taste the same.  I, too needed to add more milk or it would have been too dry.

This was so good.  I've been trying to put together a great mac and cheese for years and this is it!  THANK YOU! To the person who submitted this recipe.  This is nothing like ma used to make and yes my goal it to have a better mac & cheese.  So here are my tips.  (I left out the breadcrumbs)  1.Follow the recipe step by step.  I misread a step before my computer battery went dead and ended up adding the flour tablespoon after tablespoon after I'd added the liquid already.  At the end of the day it was way thick and I added much more liquid than the recipe called for.  I was afraid that it would be too much sauce for the noodles, but it turned out to be perfect. 2.I personally live an apartment and have a wacky oven.  This thing gets hot fast, so I cooked the mac and cheese with foil over the top, then the last 10 minutes took the foil off so that I could achieve that dreamy brown top instead of a jagged hard one.

This was excellent; however, I must say I do not understand why Liquid Smoke is considered optional for "smoky" macaroni and cheese- without it, the dish is simply plain old mac 'n cheese.

This dish had excellent flavor.  I followed the recipe to a "T", but had to make a change.  When I put in the dish to bake, it was pasty...almost dry.  I poured about a cup of milk and 1/4 c of half and half into the dish and it saved it.  I would make it again, but would definitely add more liquid, possibly double.

The cook, and prep time for this recipe is off. I had the whole thing done in 40 minutes. The texture is great, but the liquid smoke makes it gross. I'll make it again (sans liquid smoke).

AWESOME!!  I actually messed up and added the melted butter to the base and had to melt more butter for the topping so was especially fattening - but still VERY VERY good!!  I will definitely make again.

I used Monterey Jack, Provolone, and Cheddar for this recipe.  Makes a ton - cut recipe in half before making!

I just finished making and eating this for the first time and am glad I did.  I used rigatoni instead of macaroni and increased the milk to 2 cups (and still a little dry, though better dry than soupy in my book).

Pure comfort food!  I made this for a side dish to BBQ chicken last night.  Instead of using liquid smoke though, I diced up a chunk of double smoked hardwood bacon and sauteed it with the onions and garlic.  OMG!!!  I too needed to add a bit more milk because it was so thick.  Awesome "adult" mac & chz! Thanks for sharing!

We made this. But doubled it for a Christmas party and it was a hit. Absolutely wonderful. Personally I’d use more liquid smoke because the smoky flavor was hardly there. But other than that. Super super good. Everyone loved it.

Very yummy, I didn't have swiss cheese or straight monterey Jack cheese. I got Great Value Monterey and Colby cheese 2 cups and just used that didn't even have to add swiss, and as for the half and half cream I don't drink coffee and wouldn't have any other use for it so I used whipping cream which worked just fine. Was very yummy

We did not add the smokey flavor.  Very cheesy and easy to make.  Use bread crumbs that are not too crushed for more texture.

I was really impressed with the flavor of this dish. I feel it will make a return In the future only with the parmesan cheese being omitted or substituted for another. A family member doesn't like the parmesan much, so I will need to cater to that preference next time.

This Mac & cheese was good but a little bland for my taste. If I were to make it again I think I would double the onion, garlic and liquid smoke and use more (or all) sharp cheddar in place of the Monterey Jack (which is a pretty bland cheese). I think I would also increase the milk or half & half as it seemed to dry out pretty quickly.

This was an average recipe at best. It was way too dry and the liquid smoke overpowered the taste of the cheeses. When I try this one again, I'll add more milk and leave out the liquid smoke.

This was good! I don't care for smoke flavor so I left that out. After you've mixed the cheeses in, it does seem very thick and possibly in need of more milk, as another reviewer thought. But it doesn't! The end result is a very thick and creamy cheese blend that envelopes the macaroni perfectly.

I had an insane craving for mac & cheese and looked at every recipe listed.  This was my choice since it seemed the most classic,  Yet, I made a few changes for simplicity, figuring I can add back ingredients next time.  First, I eliminated the garlic and mustard, although I usually love them.  Second, I substituted rigatoni for the normal shells or elbows - they really hold the cheese! Finally, I loaded up on cheddar vice Monterey Jack and substituted fontina for swiss as recommended by my chef sister.  I]m really enjoying it now yet look forward to spicing up the next batch!

This is a great starting point!  I add more cheese, variety - yes, we're cheese lovers here.  I also added cooked bacon - slice bacon into small pieces, cook, drain and add to mixture prior to baking.  
I found this recipe here and have been making this recipe for years, but due to the cheese/bacon mix I only make it once a year.  It's my Thanksgiving contribution to any potluck.

I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and  substituted 12 oz of cauliflower for 1/2 the noodles and 1/2 cup of sour cream for the cream cheese -- ohh, it was good! I did use a little less crumb topping since some people said they didn't like it, but we found it added a nice crunch.

I thought the consistency was going to be a little off because when I tasted it before going in the oven, all you could taste was the cream cheese, despite slowly but surely adding all of the cheeses together to blend the flavors in the pot.  Not my favorite mac and cheese in the world but a solid recipe for sure.  Made this with pulled pork BBQ, coleslaw,  mashed potatoes and collard greens.

This was absolutely amazing. A lot of work and not cheap to make but worth every cent and every second of time. Probably the best mac and cheese I have ever had. It is very rich but absolutely delicious. Instead of using the liquid smoke I used half monterey jack and half smoked cheddar cheese which was awesome.

Love this recipe, but it is far too dry as written. I added about 1 to 1 1/2 cups more milk to make it more saucy and I could have used a bit more. I also use more cheddar and reduce swiss.

Loved it! It came out so tasty & was easy to prepare. For my topping I also sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese with the bread crumbs to give it more of an orange-yellow color .

I made this last night, didn't have Parmesan so I substituted Swiss, also didn't have liquid smoke so I used some McCormick BBQ seasoning.  I did use some more milk during the rue process, maybe a cup.  It turned out great!  Probably the best I have ever made and I've made some darn good Mac n cheese.  I also added some cayenne for just the right amount of kick.  I think the ones that are saying it's too dry don't realize they are dumping a whole box of noodles and the boxes are usually 16ounces not the 12 recommended

This would have been great except the onion and garlic flavor was much too strong. I made it for my boyfriend and one other friend, and they both agreed. The smokey flavor was nice, but if i make it again I will add MUCH less onion and garlic (if any at all). It was also kind of dry.

I bit bland. Added Chili paste, that was a nice pick up or horseradish. I thought it needed more salt and pepper.  Added alot of milk to the original mixture..it was very thick.  I also added for more crunch to the top..french fried onions. That make the top nice and crunch. Also added a little flavor.`

My first attempt at making homemade mac & cheese ~ can't thank you enough for this recipe! I made two small changes: doubled the noodles and added chipotle powder (I LOVE that stuff) instead of liquid smoke. Other than that, I followed this recipe to the letter, INCLUDING the times you gave for each step. Initially, as I was stirring in all of the cheeses, I thought, "Holy cow! There's no way we're even going to taste the noodles in this wad of cheese!" WRONG! This is great! It baked up great, was very flavorful, and despite the fact that we could hear our arteries hardening as we ate and then went carbotose for awhile, everyone loved it! Make it! Make it! Make it! Oh, I do agree with Janine's review that you should have all of your ingredients out before you start. =o)

I won second place with this recipe in my work contest.  I looove this mac and cheese I don't use the smoke- it is a true crowd pleaser (the #1 winner was elbow mac and velveeta)

Tried this for Christmas dinner.  We followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Everyone commented on how tasty the mac & cheese was and everyone had seconds (if not thirds) and said they wanted the recipe.  Only downside is that the kids did not care for it (not plain enough for their immature pallets I guess).  Next time I will try with crumbled bacon (didn't try this time as our main course was ham).  Thanks for this yummy recipe Eshel!  :)

Thanksgiving HIT!!! My family loved this recipe.  I took the advice of others and added a little more milk and half-and-half.  Came out WONDERFUL. The liquid smoke is a nice surprise as well!!  The only negative aspect of cooking this mac and cheese is the preparation time; this recipe takes a while to assemble.

I was super-excited to try this - I made it for a shower and was expecting rave reviews.  I thought it was just OK, though - certainly not what I expected for that large number of ingredients.  Of all the dishes I made for the shower (there were 6), this was the only one I did not receive requests for the recipe.  There was a lot left over.

Made this for a potluck and it was a hit, easily serving 11 people with leftovers for my husband's lunch the next day.  Even though I increased milk and 1/2 & 1/2 to nearly 3 cups total liquid, it still was dryer than expected.  I added chopped ham, substituted Dijon for dry mustard (just gave it a big squirt) and increased cheddar as I don't care for swiss.  I might make this again if I get a request for it, otherwise I'll try another recipe.

My family loved this. Wasnt too sure about the liquid smoke but it gave just the lightest smokey flavor. Next time I will decrease the amount of onion I add.

This recipe was okay. It had a decent flavor but didn't have as strong a flavor as I hoped and was a bit drier than I would have liked.  Granted, the flavor may have suffered a bit due to having to substitue extra amounts of the other cheese to compensate for the loss of the the moldy Swiss I had just purchased and had to discard.  For the cost, I think I can find a better recipe.

5+  This was great.  Didn't want to use the liquid smoke so I added 1/2 tsp smoked paprika instead.  My boyfriend said it was the best mac and cheese he'd ever had.  Really great reheated out of the fridge and freezer as well.

A lot of cheese and work for mac and cheese that my kids wouldn't even eat.  Others with more sophisticated taste buds may enjoy it though.  I liked the smoky flavor it had.

Yummy, this was really good. I followed the recipe exactly except used the cheeses that I had being old cheddar, mozza, and parm. Also added about 1 cup more liquid as the sauce looked very thick. I think that using maybe a jalepeno havarti or some other spiced up cheese would be amazing.

I didn't really like this.  It didn't taste cheesy, didn't taste like macaroni and cheese as much as I thought it would.  I was really excited but unfortunately disappointed.  I won't make this again.

Have made this twice and it is awesome! Second time went ahead and used 16oz macaroni. It makes a lot of sauce. Great for potlucks. This is definitely going to be a regular. It is a lot of work though.

This is a great twist on a old favorite.  Definitely the best Mac Bake recipe I've seen/used.  It's very cheesy and works with or with out the smoke favoring.  Great for families with young kids!

Oh my gosh! This was the best thing I have ever made. Even my mom said it was one of the best overall dishes that she had ever had. period. haha. I left out the onion and liquid smoke because I didn't have any. I am planning on making it for my class and I was wondering if anyone had tried freezing it like the night before before you baked it and then baking it the next day?

The recipe did not call for sour cream. It definatelty did not require the 8 oz's I used.   Had it not been for my mistake I believe this would have been perfect. The inital taste of the cheese was great. The after taste of sour cream was not.

I just made this today and it's absolutely delicious!  I didn't add the liquid smoke because I didn't have any.  I did add some crumbled bacon in it though.  I shredded all the cheese beforehand which was very helpful.  I did have to add a little more milk and I didn't add as much breadcrumbs as it called for.  I will definitely be making this again.

If you like the smoke taste you'll love this.  BEST mac and cheese I've ever had.  The kiddos didn't like as much as the adults.

Not the best I've tried.  It was too pasty
