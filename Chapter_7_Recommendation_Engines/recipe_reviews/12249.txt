as an aussie living in the USA some items aren't easy to find.  just remember to grind the sugar finely before use.  also malt vinegar is the usual vinegar used.  otherwise great recipe.  pleasue use heavy whipping cream with vanilla and powdered sugar (beaten) for topping, not the can whipping cream or you really do an injustice to the taste.  the best topping is strawberries and kiwi fruit.
