Adorable presentation. Truly stunning. 

I used sugar snap peas. 
Fresh dill sprinkled on before adding the peas back enhances the flavor and appearance more than dried dill, in my opinion.  

Thank you for posting!

Although the salmon mixture was very good, the process of stuffing each and every one of the pea pods was tedious at best.  Going forward I wouldn't hesitate to make the Salmon dip, but will serve it with pea pods, peppers, and assorted crackers.

Very tasty. Stays freah after you make them for 3-4 hour room temp. if refrigerated 6 hours.
My guested enjoyed them when I servered them fo rEaster.
Will make again.
Tip The larger the snap peas the easier to fill.

These are a hit!  Time consuming to make, but for crafters it is fun!  A fun project together with kids, too. They are delicious and healthy, and here's a cost-cutting tip: use plain salmon in the envelopes you can buy for $1 in the canned fish aisle, and just add 8-10 drops of bottled smoke flavoring!  Yummy!  I had these for our Easter dinner appetizer, made the night before and covered.

Labor intensive but end result impressive. Liked putting fresh dill inside of pod before salmon spread.  I would make again for a small group, not up for a wedding. !
