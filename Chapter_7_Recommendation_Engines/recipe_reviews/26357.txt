I made quite a few changes to this, and boy was it great!  If I haven't mentioned an ingredient in this review, it is because I used what was in the original recipe.  I used 2 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef (I had about 10 people to feed and I like it meaty and thick), so I doubled the chili mix, the kidney beans, steak sauce, green and red pepper, as well as red pepper flakes and cumin. Instead of stewed tomatoes, I used one big (32 oz?) can of organic fire roasted chopped tomatoes with the juice.  I did NOT add carrots or celery.  I added about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper, and about 5 tablespoons of fresh cilantro.  Finally, I shook in some chili powder to taste.  Of course I sprinkle this with freshly grated cheddar before serving and serve corn bread or muffins on the side.

I have made many a chili. All of which I have loved. However, my wife has loved none. This one however was loved by all. I made it last weekend and my wife wants it again this weekend. I used ground turkey (again, the wife) instead of beef. Also, skipped the bacon (wife). Did it a slow cooker for 10 hours. Excellent! If too mild, a couple of dashes of hotsauce (not for the wife) will do the trick. A definate keeper.

My husband LOVES chili and I have had a hard time finding a recipe that suited his picky taste.  Well this one did it!  He and I both really enjoy this chili.  It does taste great re-heated.  To make things quicker we use the Oscar Meyer real bacon bits found in the salad dressing aisle.  It is peices of real chopped bacon in a vacuum sealed bag already cooked.  I thought it may make a negative impact on the taste, but it really didn't.  It cut down our cooking time and also the fat content.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!!!!

Awesome!  My husband and I tried this last night, and we are hooked!  I made the following adjustments to fit our tastes/nutritional menu:  we substituted 99% fat free ground turkey for the ground beef; we made our own chili seasoning with cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper and garlic powder;  we omitted the bacon and tomato paste;  we added half a can of tomato juice (some reviewers suggested water or beef broth, but we like a more tomatoey chili) and a second can of sliced stewed tomatoes;  we added more carrot (we diced 1/3 of a bag of carrot chips), more green and red bell pepper and minced garlic to the mix as well as 2 cans of drained/rinsed organic black beans (in place of the 1 can of kidney beans) and a can of drained white corn.  I also cut down on the parsley to 1/2 tsp and dried cilantro to 1/4 tsp.  Wow!  As the chili cooked, the liquid dissipated a bit, so we added more tomato juice as needed and upped the amount of steak sauce (we used A1) and added more white wine (marsala) to taste.  The result was a very hearty and delicious chili with the most superb taste!  I served it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and chopped white onion for a kick with a side of organic blue tortilla chips.  We can't wait for leftovers tonight, and we will definitely be making this recipe again and again.  There is so much you can do with this recipe to adjust it to your personal taste preferences, yet the end result will always be great.  Thanks so much!

This is a five-star chili recipe, if there ever was one.  We like a meaty chili, so I used 2 pounds of ground beef, instead of the 1.5 pounds called for.  Obviously, that required more liquid be added to this already somewhat "dry" chili, so I added two small cans of tomato sauce--just enough to keep all the ingredients from sticking together like paste.  Every few bites, one catches a whiff of bacon, which is quite pleasant indeed.  I used real bacon, which I think is clearly the way to go.  The 57 Sauce, cilantro, and parsley all contribute their own subtle additions.  This recipe is well planned and I highly recommend it.  It takes a little time but is quite worth it.  Just excellent!

I made this chili and my usual chili recipe for my son's birthday party.  All my guests liked this one better..I have found a new chili recipe!  I didn't add celery or carrots.  At the advice of other reviewers I added a 14.5 ounce can tomato sauce and a 14.5 ounce can beef broth to thin it out.  I also added one whole red pepper and one whole green pepper.  Even my complete "country boy" brother in law raved over this one (and he was skeptical about the wine in the chili!!)  It's not very spicey, so if you like it hot, add a few more pinches of red pepper flakes.  VERY GOOD!!

Easy and darn good! I didn't use the carrots, but definitely used the bacon and may add a bit more next time. The bacon adds a wonderful, smoky base to the chili. Also chopped up a small red-hot chili pepper to spice it up a little. Used Heinz 57 for the steak sauce. The chili lasted all week -- very economical meal planning!

Definitely a FIVE STAR RECIPE!!! I have made this chili for my family many, many times and it never fails to impress! This is, by far, the best chili recipe I have ever found. We like it spicy so we add chili powder and hot sauce. We also eat it with sour cream, chopped onions and cheese. It's even better the second day!

This was a good easy chilli recipe. Next time I will leave out the carrots they add a crunch to the chili that it does not need. also, I might add something to give it some heat!  this version is very mild. We added garlic power and I think it worked out just fine.  Will make again.

Great chili recipe, it was quite thick and needed to have water added to it.  We added about 2-3 cups of water, alittle at a time.  We did not add the carrots or wine, but it was still excellent!

I made 7 (seven) gallons of this amazing chili for a cook-off yesterday. (28 Jan. 2012).  I was competing for our Humane Society, and was up against chefs from some of the best restaurants in town. It was my chili vs. experienced chefs' chili. It was a hit and I took 2nd place! (out of over 20 entries). I made a few adjustments because I was making such a huge amount. I omitted the fresh cilantro, and used dried parsley instead of fresh. I grated carrots into the chili instead of chunks. The carrots cut the acidity of the tomatoes nicely. I used more wine than suggested. (some for me, some for chili). I also opted for fire roasted, jalapeno diced tomatoes and gave it more "heat" by adding pepper sauce with the pepper flakes. I put in celery salt, replacing the celery. I added garlic powder and used a lot of ground chuck. (chili should be extra meaty for competitions). I put the packet of chili seasoning directly into chili instead of with the meat. This is a wonderful chili recipe & I recommend chili lovers to make it.

This is a good recipe if you like a chili that is on the sweeter side. The wife and I do not, therefore it was not for us. Personally, I think that the wine and/or the steak sauce really hurt this recipe from being better. We ate it all, but won't make it again. I would definitely not add the steak sauce again!

My husband loved,loved it - think he liked the bacon and steak sauce flavoring in the chili.  I always make my chili with chuck - stewing meat rather than ground beef. I cooked the beef in a covered skillet longer to get it tender.   I also used red wine, added some water, and used more red pepper flakes - used black beans as well.  I think next time, I would pre cook my onions with some garlic.  I garnished with lime, sour cream, and extra chopped cilantro.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Although I don't care for carrots in my chili, I made this exactly to the recipe instructions so that I could do a true rating.  It is excellent!  I like chili with a good kick so next time I will add extra ancho chili powder but other than that, it is an excellent bowl of chili and has wonderful flavor with a bit of sweetness that I really like.  The steak sauce and bacon and wine come through nicely together.  It is a very thick chili so you will need to add water a little at a time to get the desired consistency, just like the header instructions stated.

I doubled this recipe and made itfor a chili cook-off today and loved it - competition is later!  I followed some of the review tips I read and added 2 spoonfuls of minced garlic, 1/2 bag of frozen corn, substituted marsala cooking wine for white wine, chopped an entire green and red pepper, used A-1 steak sauce, heavy red pepper flakes, chili beans, no parsley, heavy cilantro, splash of beef broth and splash of spicey tomatoe juice.  I decided to cook in the crock pot and then lightly layered with Louisiana Hot Sauce and Zatarain's Creole Seasoning - cooked all night.  I expect a trophy today!

I brought this to our church chili bake off and I did not win.  The winner put in garlic, bay leaf, more cumin, smoked paparika and I used red wine.  The flavors were great, but I think this would help to win and taste even better.

Really good chili. The VERY picky husband said it was the best chili he's ever had. I used the veggies (just sauteed them with minced garlic first before adding the tomatoes, wine, etc). Served with shredded cheddar cheese and the Sweet Cornbread recipe on this site.

I gave this recipe four stars but it's exceptional when you add some more heat. (I omitted the carrots, celery) I added cayenne pepper and a bit of ground chili pepper. Smells fantastic! You will not be disappointed with this recipe. I cooked it a day early to give the flavors time but I had to practically beat my family out of the kitchen from wanting to eat it tonight! I plan on making a cornbread recipe from this site to go w/ it tomorrow. Enjoy!

Wow, what a GREAT chili! I have made this twice now, once for tailgating and once yesterday for Super Bowl party. Each time, EVERYONE requests the recipe. I did omit the carrots (because I forgot to buy some), used Heinz 57, and increased the meat to 2 pounds (we like meatier chili). Everything else, I did as written. For yesterday's recipe, I cooked the meat as directed then combined the cooked meat and all the other ingredients in a crock pot. I cooked it on low for several hours. Thank you, Jennifer for our new chili staple recipe:)

I made this chili last year for the Super Bowl (football), and my guests said that they loved it so, and my brother said it was the best chili he has eaten....and he eats a lot. I have decided to only make it once a year on Super Bowl Sunday. Great chili!

Thanks for making my party great!

I love this recipe. I have been making it on and off for almost 1 year. The only changes that I make are that I cook all of the meat and then place everything in a crockpot on low for 7 to 8 hours. I also dont put in the bacon or carrots all of the time. My whole family loves it and always enjoys when I make it.

Good chili, a little different than your usual chili.  I'm sorry but i can eat the brown bag chili all day, but this is really good.  I like the crunch of the carrots.  Worth the time to make for "company folks" chili

The only reason I gave this four stars was becaus we made a few changes but they were for personal reasons. I consider us to be somewhat of "chili snobs".  We've always just really liked our own chili recipe and may veer sometimes but always come back to it.  but today we tried this and it was kick butt!  I was intrigued at the steak sauce and wine addition and it has a great flavor!  I gave it four stars ONLY because we like spicey chili and I threw in a lot more pepper flakes and three serrano peppers.  Other than that - FAB!  Thanks for opening our eyes to your great chili recipe!

This recipe is GREAT, although I agree with others that it comes out too THICK as it is written here. What I did to thin it out was to add one 14.5 ounce can of tomato sauce and one 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth. I didn't use the carrot or the celery because I am not used to eating chili like that. I also used one large white onion and 1 medium green pepper. I loved the bacon addition and the steak sauce. I used garlic A1. I also added two cloves of crushed garlic in the mix of veggies. Yum Yum!!

I really loved this chili! Didn't use the carrots, but kept the bacon.  Added beef broth to loosen it up as needed.  For the stewed tomatoes, I used a can of "Mexican Stewed Tomatoes," which already had cumin, garlic, and jalapenos.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe (but not the best I've had).  I used baby carrots and chopped them up really small and used celery salt in place of the celery.  I didn't have a good brand of steak sauce so I used about 2 TBLS of worchestershire sauce and added some garlic powder and salt.  Like DREGINEK..and alot of other reviewers, I found this to be a bit dry, so I added a can of beef broth.  Chili isn't meant to be too runny but if you threw this up against the wall it would stick. I enjoyed this, but the real challenge is seeing how hubby likes this.  Thanks Jennifer.  OH... I didn't use the bacon!

This chili is very tasty.  I did find, however, that I needed to add quite a bit of water while cooking.  In fact, I added almost 3 cups total!  Next time I think I will try using beef broth and more wine to keep more flavor locked in.

Great recipe. The family loved it and they are picky eaters. Three minor changes: 1) 2 tablespoons garlic 2) Substitute can of refried beans and 8oz of tomato sauce for tomato paste. 3) Add a small can of green chilies when adding the first batch of ingredients.

This chili recipe came in dead LAST (out of 14 chili's) during an annual chili cook-off this past weekend. I was extremely disappointed in the way this turned out and I followed the directions perfectly. For true chili lovers, DO NOT make this recipe, it doesn't taste like chili, at all!

Excellent recipe - and even better as a base to personalize to your own taste.  The flavors from the carrots and celery help to make it complex, but I opted to grate (large setting) rather than chop to make a smoother texture.  We made a meatless version, so for extra liquid and flavor I added a cup of beef broth.  I thought red wine would be more appropriate, so I used leftover Petite Syrah rather than white wine.  Finally, for an added spike of flavor, try coriander seed, oregano and sage and a 1/4 of a lime cooked with the chili rounded out all the sweet ingredients.  Definitely five star, whether or not you add your own ingredients.  By the way, I agree with a few other posts that it needed some more heat, so we added significantly more red pepper.  Next time I'll consider adding fresh jalapeno and perhaps some cayenne.

I stayed as close to this recipe as I could.  My only change is that I had a 1lbs of beef and 1/2lbs of pork sausage.  Instead of steak sauce, I had hickory, brown sugar barbecue sauce.  The rest was the same.  This was a very thick chili that I had to add some beef stock/water to.  If I didn't add anything, it would basically be sloppy joe mix.  The flavor was outstanding and I personally loved the crunch that the carrots added to it.

Phenomenal recipe!!! I have been making this recipe for a few years now, I use ground turkey instead of beef, and I don't use bacon. My husband can't wait until it's "Chili Season". Everyone LOVES this chili. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing!

This wasn't my 100% favorite, but in all fairness, I didn't have all the ingredients. I used diced tomatoes with green pepper, 1 lb of ground beef, half of a package of chili seasoning (so it wouldn't bee to strong), left out red pepper flakes and parsley. Next time, I wouldn't use any carrot and would consider using more bacon, which added great flavor.

Excellent recipe!  I made this last night, and only strayed as follows: added 1/3 cup white wine, used half Heinz 57/half Lea & Perrins steak sauce, and microwaved the bacon.  End result was winning the office chili cookoff among 8 other contestants.  Thanks, Jennifer!

I always thought that people who didn't like a recipe that everyone else liked, were doing something wrong. Well, I was wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. This chili was by no means "bad." It just wasn't great either. The flavor was fine, though a bit odd. Not sorry I tried it, but will attempt a different chili recipe next time.

Best non-Cincinnati chili I've ever tasted!  Followed recipe pretty much as is.  Used A1 Bold & Spicy Steak Sauce and added just a dash of Emiril's Hot Pepper Sauce(BAM!).  This may be the best recipe on AllRecipes!

WOW! This won an award in our house tonight! Wonderful chili! I ommitted the carrots (as did many others I see), used only 1 lb of hamburger and due to the very thick results of this soup, added 1 15oz can of tomato sauce AND 2 cups water. YUM! As another reviewer noted, I will not use bacon next time...it really doesn't add additional taste. This will be the chili recipe I use from here on! Thanks for sharing it with us Jennifer!

GOOD STUFF! I am not a huge Chili fan, but I loved this and so did my family.  It had a very fresh taste to it.  We omitted the carrots and next time I'll leave out the bacon too (it didn't add to the flavor and so wasn't worth the trouble.) We did add finely chopped smoked sausage that had jalapenos in it (I think that added a nice kick, along with a few pinches of cayenne pepper and a few shakes of celery salt.  Before serving add a handful of shredded cheddar (it'll melt right on) and a sprig of Parsley to each bowl for a nice finishing touch.

My husband and I loved this chili although it was very thick for me. I'll definately add a lot more water next time. It had a great taste with the bacon and cilantro and we'll keep it as our family chili recipe.

"Award Winning Chili" is the perfect title for this recipe.  Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in two days...family and friends loved it.  This is a keeper...all my other chili recipes will be banished to the black hole recipe box.  Good job Jennifer!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  My husband loved it.  I omitted the wine, and substituted ground meat for chili meat.  I will definitely make this again.  I'm eating some of the leftovers for lunch at this very moment.

The best chili recipe ever.
One up on Jennifer.
I took the dish to our local chili cook-off and won 1st prize. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Our family didn't care for this at all, they all agreed it was too sweet tasting. Plus they did not care for the carrots that were included as directed. Not a keeper in our house. Sorry.

My Husband loved this chili!  I added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt and black pepper.  I left out the carrots and celery and cooked it on high for four hours in the slow cooker, allowing the ingredients to blend together.  "Delicious" is the census from my family.  If you like a thick chili, this is the one.

This recipe is wonderful.  My three year even thought it was great and my husband said it was the best chili he's ever tasted.  I liked the fact that the spices were not overwelming.  I just used my individual spices out of the cupboard instead of buying a spice packet.  I used chili powder, cumin, a pinch or so of cayenne pepper and some garlic.  It turned out great.

I am not a huge chilli fan and I've never made it before.  But this was very good and everyone raved about it!  I changed a few things, I used a whole red pepper and green pepper, one jalepeno and a small can of green chillies.  Added two cans of beef broth and a can of tomatoe sauce since all the reviews said how thick it was.  It was award winning in my book!

This was the best chili I have made yet.  I made a few modifications because I didnt have all the ingredients on hand, i left out the cumin all together since i had none, and I added mushrooms and corn since i didnt have any carrots.  Used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  Turned out really flavorful!!  I am making it again tonight!

This was great!  I omitted the celery & carrots, & added cayenne pepper, and more chili powder for some added kick.  The steak sauce added a nice flavor. I love trying new chili recipes, and this is a keeper for sure!

The chili recipe I've been searching for!  My husband and I aren't fans of watery chili so this thick chili hit the spot.  After reading the other reviews I skipped the celery and carrots and didn't miss them.  I served it over cornbread with cheddar cheese and sour cream on top-delicious! *The only change I would make would be cut the steak sauce down to 1/4 cup as the flavor was a little strong*

I'm giving it 4 starts but it might be my fault---I didn't hve steak sauce, so I used barbeque sauce.  Turned out a little sweet that way.  It was REALLY thick, which I thought was great---it is really hard to find a thick chili recipe.   I added a can of Rotel with the juices to thin it up a bit.  would absolutely make again!!!!  PS I also used seasoned pinto beans in a can rather than kidney beans.

Like everyone else (it seems), I modified this a bit. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and a 28 oz can of kidney beans. There are no "packets" of chili seasoning in our local stores. So, I used chili powder and red pepper flakes ( we were out of cumin). There was no wine in the house so I used chicken broth. I also used garlic flavored A1 Sauce and doubled the green peppers ( red peppers were 4$ each!).  After all of that, I thought it was pretty good. My BF's children thought it was awesome. The 15 year old has a great palate and she actually hugged me and that's pretty rare from a 15 year old girl!  Like most chili, it was even better the next day. ******Update- We had an office chili cook off and this won first place so I guess it is award winning chili*******

What attracted me to this recipe was the variety of ingredients used, which I thought was unusual.  I was leary about the carrots and celery, but I used my Pampered Chef Food chopper to chop them small, and it was fabulous!  I made a few revisions to make a more "smoked" flavor.  I used A-1 steak sauce, and Chardonnay wine.  I added 3 tbsp of Hickory Smoke flavor, and 1/2 pound of bacon which made a huge difference.  Most of the reviews for this recipe said it was too think so I did not use the tomato paste and I used 2 cans of Hunts fire roasted tomatoe's (keeping the juices and 2 cans of kidney beans (keeping the juices).  I also added a can of Mexican corn (drained).  My chili was a huge hit at a work related function.

I made this recipe for a chili cook-off in our small town as an entry for our local public library. We won! We took fully 1/3 of the votes.
This chili is easy to make, very tasty, thick enough to eat with a fork, and can be spiced up or down as desired.
I didn't leave anything out - all the vegetables, not overcooked mind you, just added to the texture and the experience. The only suggestions we had was it should have had mushrooms, and one person wanted jalapenos. But, the majority preferred this one over the other entries. Try this recipe - it's great!

Great! I used tomato sauce instead of paste, white grape juice instead of wine, 1 lb beef instead of 1.5, and added an extra cup of broth to thin it out a bit.

This was OK, I was expecting so much more based on the reviews. I think I wasn't thrilled by the steak sauce flavor...kinda weird in chili. My husband didn't have seconds and he LOVES chili. Will stick to my own traditional recipe.

I needed a recipe for my husband's work chili cook-off and I picked this one because it won second place in another contest. The smell of this chili made me absolutely ill and I could smell it in our house for 2 days. My husband thought it was good and talked me into letting him take it to work even though I was so grossed out by it. No joke, it won first prize and 8 vacation hours for my husband. I about died. So, thanks for the recipe even though I'd NEVER make it again. 5 stars for the free vacation day though!

This is by far the absolute BEST chili I have ever had. The only suggestion I have is to double the recipe if serving more than 4 hungry people. It was so good everyone wanted more and I was all out. DELICIOUS!

The carrots keep it from being to acid or spicy, a great little trick.  I made this chili for my family, they liked it so much I had to remake it for SuperBowl Sunday

I have eaten a lot of chili in my day and this is one of the best I've ever sampled! Made a batch for my boyfriend who's a finicky eater and he can't get enough of it. Even better the second day.

This chili is awesome!! I won 3rd place in a chili contest. I would add a second can of stewed tomatoes though and skip the carrots and celery. I also put 2 cans of chili beans in replace of kidney beans. It is super YUMMY!!

I chose not to use the carrot or celery, like others.  I also used red wine instead of white, added a couple dashes of hot sauce, and omitted cilantro/parsley.  I had crushed tomatoes, instead of the stewed, and I ended up using the entire 28 oz. can, because it was a little too thick otherwise.  Also, used a packet of taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning, because that's what I had.  It was great and also quick and easy!

This is awesome. FYI I used Aylmer Accents cracked black pepper and roasted garlic stewed tomatoes and roasted garlic tomato paste. For the steak sauce I used HP Bold and Old-Al-Paso  chili seasoning mix. The bacon was maple smoked. I don't eat meat very often but if I was going to cheat I'm happy it was with this dish! Absolutely delicious!

I give this 4.5 STARS. I followed the ingredients except I added the veggies after slow cooking the meat for 45 minutes. This way I did not overcooked the veggies. I entered it to a neighborhood chillifest contest and earned the people's choice award. I added beef broth instead of just plain water to add flavor and get desired consistency.Put more hot chili flakes and cayenne.

This is a great recipe and won our annual chili cook-off at work.  As others noted, it is a thick chili.  I left out the carrot & celery, and substituted a can of crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes.  I also added a can of tomato sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Hmmmm - curious. There is something VERY delicious about this chili. It could be that it has cilantro, my favourite herb - mmmm. But I think its maybe the combination of onion, carrot, bell pepper, and cilantro really. Its sooo good - and I made a vegetarian version to! ... Plus I didn't even have nice meaty beans like kidney beans and just used borlottis for my protein, but it was - is! - sooo good. Yum, yum, yum!

I knew when reading this recipe that because of some of the odd ingredients this would either be really great or not so good. Unfortunately it was the ladder. Not crazy about the bacon, or the wine, didn't like the huge chunks of tomato, and all I could taste was steak sauce. I will not make this again.

Best chili recipe ever! I love chili and have been trying different recipes.  The only thing I changed was I used black beans because that's what I had the first time I made this.  We loved it so much, I've been doing it this way ever since.  Also, I have used chicken broth in place of wine with great results.   Updated review (2/7/09)- I now make this healthier due to husband's cholesterol and it's still so yummy! I use a mixture of extra lean ground beef and ground turkey.  I leave out the bacon and double the beans by using one can of black and one can of kidney beans.  The other thing I've changed at times depending on what I have on hand is substituting different tomatoes for the stewed ones.  Our favorite is diced tomatoes with green chiles.

This was so good!  I had to do lots of pureeing so my kids and husband didn't know what was in it, but the end result was surprisingly well-received.

I pureed the onions, carrots, celery, peppers and beans.  Also I used ranch beans instead of kidney beans just due to personaly preference.  The recipe didn't specify which type of white wine so I used Chablis.  I made the chili around lunch time and then put it in the crockpot with 1/2 cup of beef broth.  It was the perfect consistency at dinnertime.

The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that we couldn't taste the bacon.  I think next time I'd leave it out altogether, which would make it healthier, rather than try to add more so that I can taste it.

I will definitely make this again, it has a great flavor.

I truly enjoy making this chili. This recipe (with my own touches) has earned quite a bit of notariaty with my friends. I learned early on to double this recipe so all the people demanding seconds wouldn't be left without. I thought at first that the long list of ingredients would lead to a very confused chili, but the tastes blend perfectly. There is a lot of room to work with this recipe. I add an entire extra can of tomato sauce or paste depending on how thick I plan on serving the chili. I also double the amount of peppers used, including the red pepper flakes. To make a yummy vegan alternative, use a ground beef crumble substitute like Quorn in place of the beef. Use Bacon Bits to sub for the bacon to taste. The substitute beef tends to break down as it simmers, so don't use the initial consistancy as a basis for adding more water or tomato paste.

This chili was pretty good. Mine turned out pretty thick so I added about 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of V8 tomato juice and it was better.  We might just like our chili a little thinner than most, I don't know. Also, next time I make this I won't add the carrots.  They seemed a little out of place for me, but again I'm not a chili expert. Overall, its still a great tasting chili.

Excellent chili recipe. I have made this two times and the first time I used real bacon and the second time I used bacon bits, real bacon really makes a difference.  This is definitely a thick chili, so in order to thin it out a little I used 1.5 cups of chicken stock.  Perfect.  Also the recipe calls for 1.5 pounds of beef but I found that using 1 pound is perfect, there is a lot going on in this chili with the veggies that using a little less beef than called for is ok. Also I always serve my chili the day after I make it so that the flavors have a chance to settle. It was even better the sceond day.

This should have won first place! The overall flavor of this chili is outstanding!!! My husband who is a heat freak, likes a spicer chili but REALLY enjoyed the favor of this chili. I used my slow cooker for this and it turned out fantastic! Even without cilantro this is so very colorful. The only thing I did different was added celery seed rather then the celery. After it was all together I realized I neglected to add the acctual celery, so I added the seed, which I like better since it was already chunky enough with the other veggies. Oh, and I added northern white beans since I hate kidney beans.

This chili is absolutely amazing!  I'm so used to making the regular hum-drum boring chili. Instead of white wine, I used chicken broth.  It gave it an unbelievable flavor.  I also used my home-made chili mix with garlic.  Way to go!  Thanks for sharing!

Very hearty and meaty, just how I like it, although I did need to add a little water to bring it to just the right consistency.  Also, it wasn't overly spicy.  A lot of reviewers mentioned leaving out the carrots, but I thought the carrots added a very unique and wonderful touch.  Whenever I make chili in the future, this is the recipe I'll follow!

This was very good.  I substituted turkey burger and fresh tomatoes, increased the vegies, and left out the steak sauce.  I may even leave out the bacon, next time, as it gets a bit lost with the chili powder.  If we're going to eat bacon, might as well tast it.  This one's a keeper!

THIS IS SO GOOD!  I made it for a sick friend of mine with a batch of White Lily Cornbread.  It looks great and I can't wait to give it to her.  I added a full cup of wine and 2 chopped red apples.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

We make a lot of chili, and this just isn't the recipe for us. I think the steak sauce might be the problem.  It turned out ok, but after all of the reviews, I was hoping for more.

So this was the first recipe I have used from this site. After reading some reviews I decided to pick this one & I'm glad I did. This chili was AWESOME! Now Jennifer did a great job of coming up with this but I twicked it a little. Instead of stew tomatoes I went with fire roasted. I didn't go with the carrots(don't really understand why you would use those) I also had some chipotle seasoning that I got from New Mexico so used that instead of the chili seasoning. I did use 1 ca of beans but i suggest using 2 can instead. Last but not least I'm in Kentucky so instead of using the white wine, that's right i went with bourbon instead. I went with Four Roses Single Barrel(no measuring just eye it by taste). The bourbon really ups the spice flavor in the whole meal. Award winning chili, u bet.

Thanks to this recipe I won a chili cook off contest 10-28-11.  I did change it up a bit.  I added 2 parts ground beef to 1 part hot italian sausage.  I also used hot (chili ready) kidney beans as well as hot (chili ready) stewed tomatoes.  This gave it an added kick that was perfect!

I substituted ground turkey and added extra veggies.  I also lengthened the simmer time to make the turkey more tender.  A great recipe!

No doubt the best chili I have ever eaten and I eat lots of chili! It's the steak sauce that makes it! There is no heat in this so I added my own chili extract to spice it up a bit.the flavor is spot on. The last time I made this I added some chopped rib eye steak and it was great! I'm glad I found this recipe for sure. My belly thanks you Jennifer.

Excellent recipe!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and added a bit more steak sauce to keep it moist, I let it simmer for about an hour or so, until the peppers and carrots were tender.  My family devoured every bit!  I am making this chili again this week.

Great base recipe. The first time I followed the recipe fairly close and thought it to be a bit sweet and that it didn't have enough heat to it. This time I used ground turkey, left out the carrots and used beer instead of the white wine. I also added a few jalapeno peppers and put a few extra pinches of red pepper flakes. The final touch was to put in some course chopped garlic cloves. Absolutely love it now and will make again and again.

Wow!! Awesome Chili.  I won FIRST place with this recipe in a chili cookoff.  I did make a few changes...left out the carrot and celery. Added more cilantro, fire roasted chopped tomatoes instead of stewed and topped the bowl off with homemade pico de gallo and cheese. Thanks alot for adding this recipe!!   Unfortunately it didn't make it to the second day. lol

I had never made chili before, and I thought this one was wonderful! The only thing was the carrots took FOREVER to become tender...but I guess that's carrots for you. Cut them super thin. I never thought the steak sauce would be good in this, but it added an extra kick!

This is a wonderful recipe for chili that is a little different. I love all of the vegetables that are included in this recipe, but this recipe as is tends to be too thick. I substitute 1 can of diced petite tomatoes, undrained for the stewed tomatoes. I use Julienne carrots, diced. I also add 1/2 can beef broth and 1/2 medium size jar Prego sauce flavored with meat to the chili. The consistency is just right and it tastes really nice.Top with sour cream !! Wonderful !!

Loved this chili, I joined allrecipes just to review this recipe. Wonderful my wife won her annual chili cookoff at work with this recipe. And trust me for years she made her own chili for the cookoff, and never even received any mention from the judges. We used more bacon and added some fresh garlic, It will be sort of thick so we added some vegetable broth.

my husband has made this several times; this was my first foray and it was delish. the only thing i didn't have was cilantro, but it was still good. i also didn't have any chili seasoning packets, so i (mostly) used the chili seasoning mix II from this site. mmmmm-good.

Ok.  I did modify this after reading other reviews last night.  This is a really good chili (my thoughts) though even with cutting the red pepper flakes down, my BF STILL couldn't eat it (he's a wimp, won't eat anything that has even the SLIGHTEST hint of a kick to it).  I replaced the kidney beans with 2 cans of chili beans (with juices), cut out the tomato paste completely, added 2 cans of mexican stewed tomatos, a full pkg of bacon (per other suggestions), 1 lb ground beef, and 1 lb Jimmy Dean Sausage (I like a really meaty chili).  I used A-1 steak sauce, as it's what he had in the fridge, and didn't have any white wine on hand, so I replaced it with beer (works really well with the other flavors in this dish).  I did add some garlic, salt and pepper and ommitted the veggies (bf REALLY wouldn't touch it if I put them in).  The only other modification I did was to put in 1 tbsp Hershey's Unsweetened Coco Powder, which blends really well with the other mix of flavors in this dish.  Served with homemade cornbread and cheddar cheese.  Awesome.  I'll keep this one for my own personal use (maybe will try and De-Spice it a bit next time so he can eat it....MEN!!!)

I was wary about making this chili because of the steak sauce and the wine, but this chili was fantastic. I used A1 Steak Sauce and I loved the way it tasted. I also used the premade bacon that comes in sealed packages. I used the chopped stuff and could not realy taste it, next time I won't use the chopped stuff. Also added some garlic powder and a little chili powder. I did not use onions (preference) and I took others advice and added about 1 cup of water and the consistency was great. Topped it off with some tabasco sauce (for me) and everyone has shredded cheese and sour cream. Next time I have to make more of it, because there was none left and I wanted some for lunch the next day. This recipe will really feed 2 adults and 3 children. If making for more or someone eats alot, I suggest doubling it.

My kids now have a new favorite chili!  The unique flavor that the bacon and steak sauce provides is excellent.  Also adding a bit of cayenne or "hot" chili mix gives it a bit more spunk.  Great recipe thank you!

This was excellent chili!  I put the can of stewed tomatoes in the food processor and used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste.  I left out the celery, carrots, and bell peppers and substituted a can of chili beans and a can of black beans (both cans partially drained) for the kidney beans.  I also used ginger ale instead of white wine and added additional ginger ale to the chili as it was a little thick.  I served it with Buttery Corn Bread (from this website) which made a great meal!

This chili was great!  I didn't put the red pepper flakes in since we don't like spice.  Added 1/2 cup of water - consistency was perfect!    Topped with cheddar cheese and served with saltines!  DELICIOUS!

My husband and I made this for friends on Super Bowl Sunday, and we absolutely loved it.  We used ground turkey and turkey bacon  (next time we want to try regular bacon.)  When we first started cooking it, we were a little leary, but we let it cook for several hours and it had a great, complex, slightly sweet flavor.  Will definitely make again.

this is the best chili me and my husband have ever had. I added a few of my own ingrediants: diced sweet pickles, green onions, garlic salt, chili powder, sweet corn, and an extra chili season packet for a little more flavor.. I topped it with freshly grated parm cheese..  It was GREAT!

I had very high hopes for this recipe after reading all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and we felt the steak sauce definately overpowered the chili!  My entire family said they liked my chili recipe better than this recipe!  I try different chili recipes once a month, unfortunately this was not award winning in our house.

This is a great chili.  It has a lot of flavor that is not masked by hot seasonings.  There's no need for extras like cheese or sour cream--the recipe is perfect.

The name of this recipe is a misnomer.  It's a *really* thick chili; it's more of a Sloppy Joe's than a chili.

Changes we made: 1) We added 1 extra carrot, 2) twice as much red pepper flakes 3)replaced the white wine w/home brew (Scottish ale) and 4) nixed the celery and 5) we used ground turkey rather than beef.

We didn't eat it as chili.  We ate it inside steamed corn tortillas with irish cheddar, fresh cilantro and sour cream.  Excellent way to eat it, by the way.

Next time, we would add kidney beans and more veggies; we thought there was too much meat.

Altogether it was a good recipe but we made a few changes to make it more healthy.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this a couple of times over the last year and have no clue why I never rated it.  This is my husbands FAVORITE recipie and begs for it often.  This winter he only had it twice because when one is pregnant, chili is not the thing to calm a stomach!  He's looking foward to colder weather so that I'll make this again.  I usually cook it in the slow cooker.

It was very good, but it wasn't spectacular.  I cooked it in a crock pot for 8 hours to blend the flavors a little better, and it was still a little weaker than I would have liked.  We like our chili to be a little spicier, and have a little more depth.  I would use this again as a base to add my own seasonings on top of.  I did have to triple the amount of wine in order for there to be enough liquid.  However, the fresh herbs are a must.  Overall, an easy recipe if you're looking for something different from basic chili.

I just made this recipe for my first SuperBowl party.  I tripled the recipe, only used one can of the kidney beans, and made a huge vat of it.  I set up a "Chili Bar" with bowls of cheddar cheese, chopped onion and sour cream.  There were 42 people in my house and there wasn't one drop of chili left.  I saw people eating 2-3 bowls.  It was the hit of the party.  I agree with my guests when I say this was the best chili I have ever had.  Thanks so much for posting it!

This is terrific! Wonderful flavor and combination, my entire family loves it.  I even had it for my husbands work friends during the Christmas holidays and they wanted the recipe.  We did not add the carrots, nor the green peppers because some of the family do not care for them.  We also had to had about 6 - 8 cups of water.  But it's easy to make and we usually double it so we can freeze it too!  Highly recommend it.

I thought this chili was quite good.  I too was making this for a contest.  After reviewing several other chili recipes on the international chili society website I decided to go ahead and give this one a try.  I decided to stick with the carrots and celery as I thought this was an interesting idea.  I used home grown red chilis and real dried Hungarian paprika (my friend from Hungry's brother is a paprika farmer)which gave it terrific middle and back heat but still not too spicy for my wife.  The only other thing I did different was to use some fresh ground pork to substitute for about 1/2 lb of the beaf.  I tried to find fresh ground italian sausage but couldn't find any in our groceries here (Fort Bragg area).  Oh yea, I also used a bit more wine.  I really thought this chili was excellent.  Unfortunately I didn't when with this one (I got third with a white chili I make) but despite that I found it to be quite good and received many compliments.  I read every review on this website for this chili.  If any of you who made this chili without carrots and celery I suggest you try it.  You really don't even notice their there, but they do add a nice flavor.

First the changes I made: 1 pound hamburger, 3 slices bacon, used 4 teaspoons chili powder plus some other spices (I've never seen chili seasoning packages here), and a bit more tomatoes.  That was mostly to thin this down and make it a bit healthier with less meat.  That said, everyone enjoyed it and you could really taste the flavours.  The big slices of carrot added a nice crunch that isn't in the family chili recipe, and you could certainly notice the steak sauce and the bacon.  This also cooks much faster than my usual chili - you can cook it in 45 minutes for sure - and it will still taste good.  I reccomend trying this, it may not be what you want but it sure is a nice change & not too difficult.

It was very tasty - very thick - I did add a couple of can of tomato sauce to thin it done.
I liked the bacon in it for favor.
I used it for my weekly soup group and it was a hit.

Excellent chili! I like it best with the bacon, but the bacon can be left out and it still makes a great chili. I thought having a lot of veggies in it was going to make it taste diluted or take away from the chili taste, but it's very good with the vegetables and still tastes hearty and satisfying and like chili should. I plan on using this recipe in the future!

Definately award winning - my 6 year old son instantly knew that there was bacon in it, so i won't be leaving it out!  Did add some water to loosen the consistency - great with margaritas!!  Will make again!

AWESOME! My boyfriend raved and had two huge bowlfuls! The only change I made was I added some salt and garlic powder and I didn't have the red pepper flakes so I used cayenne pepper instead. This was even tastier after it refrigerated overnight. It reheated nicely. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

This was the easiest recipe for chili that I've ever tried. However, sometimes easy is not a good thing. My husband and I both thought this chili was a bit bland and have definitely had better.

This is the best chili I have ever made.  It has already gone into my recipe book for those "special recipes".  I didn't use the carrots or the wine and it was still awesome.  Thanks Jennifer!!!!!!

This chili was pretty good--I thought it'd have a drastically different flavor with the cumin and bacon, but it really didn't.  Perhaps it depends on what sort of chili seasoning packet you use--I usually don't use a packet, so maybe next time I'll do everything the same, except flavor it as I usually do with my own homeade chili.  The veggies were great and I just cut up the other halves of the peppers and diced up double of everything else and froze a ziploc with the beginnings of the next batch of chili--which was the time consuming part.  I simmered mine for 3 hours, adding water when it started to look dry.  Thanks though!  I got me to try something different!

This recipe was a big hit with my husband and me. I think the bacon was key to the taste and using the most lean ground beef kept the fat down. I sauteed the veggies in a tablespoon of olive oil before adding them to the sauce. There was plenty for leftovers (it did taste even better the day after) and I gave a quart container to a friend who raved this was the most delicious chili he ever had.  I've been requested to bring a huge pot to the Super Bowl Party on Sunday.  Thanks, Jennifer. for sharing your recipe.

This chili was delicious.  It does require a lot of chopping...so get out the food processor.  Also, I recommend doubling the recipe to 16 servings.  We really only got 4 big size bowls of chili out of the 8 person.  Overall, very yummy - lots of flavor.

A keeper!

I added Allspice for more 'zing'.
Think I'll skip the carrots next time.
Overall though, a good quick recipe.

I entered this at a chili cook off and won, of course. I added more meat, took out the carrots and celery, and used the cilantro as a garnish instead of mixing it in. I also put sherry in place of white wine. There was not one bean leftover!

This was my first time ever making chilli...DELICIOUS! I did add a cup of water for consistency, and I added a can of black beans.  I also swapped out the bacon for a smoked turkey leg.

This is an amazing Chili. I make it all the time and get rave reviews. I pretty much follow the recipe as is and it is always a crowd pleaser. It's easy to make so it's become one of my go to recipes when I am having a crowd for dinner.

This has been my go-to chili recipe for >10 years.  Yes, it's been on the site that long! Over the years, some things happen that make you flex a bit.  Like oops - no white wine.  Fine, use vinegar.  Actually I might prefer the tanginess! The veggies, if I'm missing one or the other, I don't sweat it, but I do definitely try to get them in.  The carrots are different, but they add some color and texture. If I'm missing tomato paste, it's still fine. It's better with the bacon, and it's better with the steak sauce. Family has come over and I've had leftovers on hand, and they have literally told me it's the best chili they've ever had.  Well done Jennifer!

Delicious and easy to make. I followed the recipe and also put sour cream and cheese on top. I used this recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chili-seasoning-mix-ii/) for the chili seasoning mix.

Award winning indeed!  I won 1st prize in against 11 other chilis in our annual office chili contest.  Like others, I "customized" the recipe.  I tripled it, used fire-roasted tomatoes instead of stewed, didn't use the tomato paste but added a whole jar of hot fire-roasted hot sauce, added two jalapanos, substituted celery salt for celery, and did add the carrots BUT pulled them out just before serving (that way we got the flavor but didn't have to explain why there were carrots in the chili!).  Oh...and used a WHOLE POUND of bacon.  And anything with a pound of bacon in it BETTER be good!  Thanks--this is my chili standard from now on!

Chili cook off in the office... I google 'award winning chili' make it and end up the people's choice! I don't even like chili. I didn't use celery/carrot. I cooked my meat with 2 cloves of garlic in additional. Also liberally used Tony Chachere's seasoning!! Thinned out with water and spaghetti sauce.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did use re hydrated pinto and black beans instead of kidney beans. I also added a jalapeno because I thought a pinch of red pepper flakes just doesn't add the kick that chili needs. I probably could have used another. Other then that I followed the recipe to the T and it was really good. I will keep this recipe on hand with the addition of 2 jalapenos added. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was VERY good..... it is not your everyday chili.... the flavor over the top!!! I added a little sugar to bring out the flavor more.... and wow there are amazing flavors here.  If you use a sweet steak sauce, you may not need to add any sugar.  If the chili is too sweet for your taste just add a little more salt.....it all works out.

Love this chili, super easy and super yummy.  I am not a big fan of beef so I substituted with turkey and did not brown it in the bacon fat...seemed way too fattening for my taste, thanks!!

Delish!  My husband and I loved this.  I think the steak sauce & wine give it that extra yum flavor.  I used chili beans with jalapenos for a nice kick.  Will be in my keeper list.  Thanks.

This was good, but not great. I did end up pouring about half a bottle of white wine in and that brought it up to a *thick* chili.  Without it, the chili was so thick it was ridiculous!  As for the bacon, I couldn't taste it so I'm not convinced there was any real benefit to adding it.  Would I make it again?  Probably, with some tweaks here and there, because it is a good base but I am still going to try out some other recipes.

Great chili! Good balance of sweet and spicy. I did not put in carrots or celery, used ½ lb hot Italian sausage with 1 lb ground beef, I used left over bacon grease and did not add any bacon, also used 1/6 cup ketchup and 1/6 cup Worcestershire sauce in place of the steak sauce.  I topped it off with parmesan/provolone/mozzarella shredded cheese.

Very good and very hearty. Next time I will omit the carrots and use less meat and more beans. Other than that this chili was a hit.

This chili is fantastic! I have made many different chili recipes and I think this is the best yet! I made a few changes to the recipe just because I was missing a few of the ingredients.
I did not use the carrot or the celery and I only used green pepper because I didn't have any redbell peppers. I also didn't have any steak sauce so I used 1/3 cup equal parts ketchup and worcestershire sauce.  

I did add nearly 1 cup of water in the last step to reach the consistency I wanted, otherwise it would have been far too thick.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was great.  The only thing different the next time I make it I would put a little less Steak Sauce in.  I did have to add a little water.  The sauce was too thick. This will replace my old stand by Chili.

I love this recipe and get rave reviews on my chili.  I have made this for a few years now and have modified it somewhat.  I used Red Gold's chili ready diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I also omit the steaksauce, add a can of beef broth to make it a little "soupier", and use elbow macaroni instead of beans (husband doesn't like beans in chili).  Everyone always comments that they love it has some many vegetables in it.

Maybe it's ME! I followed the recipe exactly and I'm disappointed to say, I absolutely hated it.  The steak sauce gave it an overpowering flavor, but otherwise bland and dry.  I had to add another packet of taco seasoning, chili powder to give it kick and another can of stewed tomatoes to add moisture - still disappointed.

For me, it was pretty good chili-not the very best as I had hoped. I made it exactly as written.  Note-I doubled it and it doesn't seem that it would really feed the 16 that it says.

I made this chili back in the fall of 2004 exactly as the recipe was written and it won me 1st place at our chili cookoff!! HUGE hit!! It won me 3rd place the following year (omitting the carrots) and 2nd place in 2006... Here's to 2007!!!! This is amazing chili!! I do agree that it can get a little thick, but I just add some water to it to thin it out. Delicious!!!

I loved this recipe! So did my fussy toddlers. I made it kid friendly by pureeing the veggies. They where non the wiser. Even my husband was surprised when I told him. I also added a teaspoon of cumin, it added a warm touch. Thanks a bunch!

YUMMY! I usually make a 24 serving batch and freeze the rest. When making that amount, I add an extra can of  diced tomato and a can of tomato sauce. I also use the Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site instead of store packaged mix.

We liked this...used 2 pounds of ground beef (my beef comes in 1# packages), used two cans of beans (black and kidney), used the carrot and celery but diced very small, added a can of tomato sauce. Served with tortillas and cheese. Will make again - thanks!

I still like my own chili a little better, but I will definitely make this again - was nice to have an interesting spin on chili. Thanks to previous reviewers, this recipe turned out perfect for us. I added 2 cups of beef bouillion, initially, and then an additional cup every subsequent day until it was gone (beans soak up the liquid). In order to cut fat, I rinsed my cooked hamburger under hot water and I used liquid smoke instead of bacon. We like this chili a lot!

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times in the past 6 months.  It's very good and freezes well.  I add a can of low sodium chicken broth and 2 small cans of no sodium tomato sauce.  It's a little too thick otherwise.  Great recipe.

WOW.  Made this for the family tonight and it was AWESOME.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I doubled the recipe and added an extra can of beans.  I also added chicken broth as it was cooking.  So glad I decided to double it so I can freeze some for later!
Thanks Jennifer!!!!

My husband loved it but I guess I should not have left this in a crockpot all day after it has been cooking away the night before.  It got too thick.  But my friends told me this recipe is perfect for the CHILI DOG! Probably because of the BBQ taste!

I don't like giving a negative review because everyone's taste isn't the same, but my family didn't care for the chili. I added what eventually totaled just about a can of chix broth. Adding water would have totally diluted the spices therefore I opted for broth. Try it - you might love it as others did but I would suggest keeping a can of chix broth or water on hand because it's thick. My pride wouldn't let me throw it away so I took some for lunch and it was a little better!

Absolutely Awesome!  

I modified the recipe a bit- I used a rose wine instead of white because of what I had on hand, I used 1 pound of beef, and I added both corn and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Sweet and a little spicy. Throw a little green tabasco on top, yum!  Easily the best chili I've ever had.

This chili rocks! I used brown sugar bacon but left out the carrots - topped it with sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar. Very hearty!

Absolutely wonderful! Especially with all the help and reviews by everyone! Yes, the  thought of all the extra veggies seemed scary to me. I diced absolutely everything, and sauted in olive oil and garlic before adding all the tomatoes and sauces. I didn't have wine, but subbed with weisen beer. I used Lawry's steak sauce by preference, and added 2 1/2 cups of seasoned broth.    I like a little more spice, so just a touch more cumin and chili powder did the trick. MMMmmmm.. a little more bacon didn't hurt either! Transfering everything to the crockpot for 4hrs really brought out all the flavors and elimated any crunchy surprises. My husband requested I didn't add beans this time, which was completely okay. I would like to add the beans, plus some corn next time. Thanks!

One of my favorite recipes! I make this again and again--and they always come back for seconds! I also like to use Lawry's Steak Sauce because it has more flavor. This is the best chili you'll ever have!

This was really easy and a lot better than the one on the $1 menu of that fast food place.  I didnt have chili seasoning so I just added A LOT of chili powder and it came out really well anyway.  Next time I'll add more beans...1 can wasnt all that much.

The chili had much too strong of a wine taste for me.  The bacon & carrots didn't really seem to add anything to it also.  I'll keep looking.

I made this for my boyfriend and my sister one night, and it was a HUGE HIT! They both loved it- I had grated cheddar cheese and finely chopped red onions for the toppings. It was REALLY thick(which is the way I like it) but I put a little extra chicken stock in it to thin it up a bit. All in all, it was a GREAT chili!

After 10 years of making my own chili, I decided to try something new. I was a little nervous at first. Well, well, well! This chili was FANTASTIC! I did have to make a few small changes to suit our needs. Here they go ~ I didn't add the carrots or celery and I used 1 yellow pepper instead of green and red. I also added a small can of tomato sauce and a small can of diced petite tomatoes. Oh, and some garlic too! After cooking on the stove-top, I transferred to the crockpot and have let it cook on low all day. That way my husband could watch football on this cold snowy day and enjoy the chili whenever he wanted! Thanks, Jennifer, for such a GREAT recipe! :o)

This made THE most incredible chili.  It is not like any chili I ever recall having, as it has quite a unique taste.  Kids, hubby, and friends went gaga for it.  I will make this again and again.  Really nice with sides of sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar, chopped green onions, and cornbread.

VERY EASY AND YUMMMY.  I don't even like chili but loved this recipe.  Even better the next day or the day after that.  No one can believe that I make this , they say its better than anywhere else and I agree.I didn't have carrots and I used black beans instead of what was called for.  BIG HIT and freezes well

This is a great recipe.  I modified it a little bit to suit my family.  The key to this one is definately the steak sauce...it gives it a sweet but spicy taste.  Thank you Jennifer for submitting this one.

I really liked this chili a lot but for some reason, nobody else in my family did so for that reason, I am only giving it 3 stars.  It is a little time-consuming, too, so I will probably go back to the recipe I've been using for years.  I thought it tasted even better the second day - I would give it 4 stars.

Excellent, with authentic chili flavor, or so said my guests:) I did add in a can of navy beans, as well as the kidney beans, black beans would also be great. I used HP sauce instead of Heinz 57, and also used a yellow pepper in place of the green, as we aren't big green pepper fans....it was just delicious and was gone very quickly at my party (before the vegan chili, which was also very good). Will make again.

My husband seemed to enjoy this recipe, he has a stomach of steel, and will just about eat anything.  I didn't not enjoy this recipe at all!!  I used to try to make my own chili and the funny thing about it is that it tasted exactly like this one.  Needless to say I stopped making my own recipe and will not be making this one either.

I'm not a huge chili fan but this was a good recipe.  I didn't use the meat and instead added a can of corn.  I made the Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe on this site to go along with the chili and the combination was a good one.  I probably won't make this too often because chili isn't at the top my list, but when I want chili, I'll return to this one.

First time making Chili and it wasn't as hard as I figured.  This was a good dish but I expected it to be better from all the hype it received in it's reviews.

Absolutely delicious, but much, much better the next day!  I left out the carrots as suggested in other reviews and also added garlic.  I didn't notice the bacon flavor and will add more next time.  Thankyou for the wonderful recipe!

This is the best chili I've ever had.
I skipped the dried red pepper and used mild chili seasoning. Mmmmmm . . . Next time I'll make more to freeze in individual servings for lunches.

Absolutely the best chili we've tried!  I used Country Bob's sauce instead of Heinz 57, and added a teaspoon of Country Bob's Seasoning Salt as well.  Altogether, very flavorful, but without the intense heat that ruins the chili-eating experience.  Perfect for a cold day!

My go to recipe for chili. It is requested again by everyone that has tried it. The only change I make is use Heinz Chili Beans (3-4 cans)instead of chili seasoning. It provides a spice and more beans.

ABsolutely the best chili I've made. Great taste. Nice punch to it. I used ground turkey favored with chorizo sausage seasoning instead of ground beef. I added a 1/3 to a 1/2 cp  of the  white moscato wine. Extra half can of beans but in all it was pretty much followed. I had guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheddar with tortilla chips for this batch on the side. I served it for the super bowl game. It was a hit....thanks Jennifer

This is my go to chili recipe. Always get amazing reviews. The steak sauce adds an interesting flavor. I keep it mild and let others add hot sauce to their liking.

Made the day before to allow flavors to meld. Followed the hints to sauté veggies first then the meat. Added a touch of cinnamon. The hot pepper was a bit too much and I tried to pick the pieces out but still too spicy for us.

My first chilli and it was a hit. Good amount of heat. Perfect for a cold day. I did not use kidney beans. I replaced with white canelli beans and chickpeas. I will definitely make it again.

Subbed tomato paste with Rotel diced tomatoes with habeneros to keep from drying out and add some heat. This recipe is full of so many flavors I don’t think I will ever make it any other way. Hubby loved it.

Added bold A1 steak sauce,  used McCormack’s southwest chili seasoning, added 1 extra tsp of chili powder and all of the veggies were roasted in my smoker over hickory at 350 for an hour to impart an incredible flavor, make sure to do extra cause you will start snacking on them and not have enough for the recipe. The veggies dry out but they will rehydrate in the pot and disappear. They are yummy and sweet out of the oven for sure.

This is an excellent dish. DO NOT OPT OUT OF THE CARROT/CELERY/ONIONS. This is a classic element of many sauces and it is necessary to have this mixture to make the chili savory. You won't regret it.

This is truly an all star chili and just like the recipe calls for. A-1 was my steak sauce of choice. It was voted best chili at the chili cook off at the local church gathering. The sweet of the steak sauce offset by the sting of the chili powder made it amazing!

I won a chili cook-off that I entered along with  7 other contestants yesterday.

I made a few changes after reading a lot of reviews.  I used fire roasted, diced tomatoes.  I shredded the carrot and used a full green and red bell pepper.  I used 1/2 cup Hormel real bacon pieces and ground chuck instead of beef.  I upped the kidney beans by a 1/2 can.  I added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1- 1/2 cups of water as it will be very thick and dry without.  I used A.1. steak sauce because that's what I had on hand.  And I used dry, white wine.
You will love this recipe if you add some liquid and a little heat!

I’ve made this chilli many times and my whole family loves it (even my picky kids).  I leave out the carrots so my daughter will eat it.  Fantastic recipe full of flavour!  Definitely start with the bacon; it adds a wonderful smokiness.  Also, I cook everything in one pot for a a faster clean-up.

This was a great recipe.  It has a very unique taste that I loved as did my family and friends.   I made a few changes.  I left out the carrots and sautéed the vegetables before adding to the tomato base.  I used A1 steak sauce.  I left out the bacon and added a pound of Conecuh sausage instead.  I used red beans as we prefer those to kidney beans.  It is really tasty.

The name of this recipe is very fitting. I entered it in a chili cookoff and won 1st prize. I only made a few changes suggested by some of the other reviewers. I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed, I omitted the carrot, doubled the bacon, added 2 chili peppers and used white wine vinegar instead of white wine.  I also sauteed the celery and onions before adding.  Thank you Jennifer for sharing this winning recipe! YUM!!

I usually leave out the bacon in this recipe as I don't find that it adds enough flavour to justify the added fat and calories and I usually add way more beans and vegetables than the recipe calls for.  Regardless, every single time I have made this chili, it has been a hit with the people I serve it to.

Even my mother in law liked this chili (although she is not a fan of beans) and she doesn't like chili in general.

It's nice that you can control the amount of heat from the red chili flakes in the recipe so that you can make a completely not hot chili, or pump up the heat to your preference.

Adore this recipe and highly recommend it!  It's a one pot recipe that cooks up in an hour or two and it's a total hit.  It's my go to recipe for chili hands down.

We liked it a lot but I kept thinking that it tasted more like sweet barbecue or Manwich than chili.  It was very sweet and tasty.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, but I would definitely add less steak sauce or omit it completely next time.  I might leave the bacon in, but I really don't think that belongs in chili either.  I used Worcestershire since I ran out of A1, but A1 would have been too prominent of a taste anyway.  I could taste the Worcestershire way too much and though really tasty, I still don't think it tasted enough like real chili.  I wouldn't enter it into a contest this way, that's for sure.  Way too sweet.  But we definitely scarfed it down LOL!  Oh, and I did end up adding 3/4 cup of water and it was still wonderfully thick.

I followed the recipe almost perfectly. 

I was 10 Oz short on meat (I used angus), dried cilantro (the store ran out of fresh ??), mixed A1 & Worcestershire (I couldn't pick just one!), 7 pieces of bacon (my boys wanted extra), minced one clove of garlic (im italian, we need it) ,smoked paprika, extra cumin to taste, & added extra white wine and water to get the consistency we like.  I have it sitting in my crockpot now. Even after cooking it as suggested my carrots are a bit too crunchy. 

This recipe is great! With my little personal tweeks, this will be my new go to chili recipe! Thanks for sharing!! ??

I've made this several times and it always turns out great!  The only change I've made is leaving out the cilantro (can't stand the stuff!)  I think the key is starting with real bacon as a flavour base.  I've made it without the bacon and it was still good, but not as good as with it.  I serve it with sour cream, shredded cheese and corn chips for topping.

I made this recipe for the first time today.  I did wonder about the white wine as I'd never seen a chili recipe call for that before  but I used it anyway to see.  Also the steak sauce seemed different but it added a nice flavor to the whole dish.   I did include the carrots, celery and onion and for those who commented that the carrots had a crunch that the chili didn't need, you need to slice the carrot more thinly and  simmer until the veggies are all tender.   We do like a medium spicy chili so I used 1/2 of a HOT chili spice envelope and 1/2 of the regular chili spice envelope.  The spice was exactly what we like.  For those that  said it was too dry,  I added the   small can of tomato sauce and was ready to add some beef broth but didn't need it.  The consistency otherwise was perfect to the recipe instruction.  Chili should not be a soup or a stew but it should have just a wee bit of sauce to it.  I think that if I make this one again, I would add the 28 ounce diced tomatoes instead of the 14.5 ounce stewed as I think that would give just the right amount of liquid to the chili as well as a little more tomato to meat ratio.  I didn't add parsley or cilantro and I don't think they would add anything to chili at all.  All in all, the flavor of this recipe was very nice.  I have another chili recipe that uses all the spices individually such as Chili powder and Cayenne pepper and paprika, pepper, salt, etc. and it has a hot & spicy  flavor that is tough to beat.

An awesome twist on Chili! And for the person who asked "who puts steak sauce and white wine" well that put an awesome zip in the flavor. Best chili I have ever tasted. Love it and didn't change a thing!!!!

I doubled this for my family and 13, 13 year olds for a Halloween party and it was plenty. And my husband wanted leftovers.  I DO like sweet food and my husband doesn't but he still liked it a lot.  Kids loved it too which made me happy. When I doubled it, I used  only 1 envelope of the chili seasoning because that's all I had, and it was fine.  I also used 1.5 pounds of ground beef and 1 pound Italian sausage and a pound of bacon.  I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, I can of "Rotel Tomatoes and Chili's  diced" and 1 can of tomato sauce and it was still plenty thick and chunky. I let it cook for hours on the stove on really low.  Everything else was pretty much doubled  to our taste but left out the carrots because we don't like cooked carrots.  For SURE will make this one again!!

Very good, but no legitimate chili competition allows chili with beans in it.  Real competition chili only has meat, onion, garlic, spices and maybe some tomato paste.

This was really tasty. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I couldn't access it when it came time to cook, but I had got all the ingredients to make it so just cooked it by doing what made sense. My 4yo loved it, and my hubby ate it without complaints which is a good rating for him when it comes to any ground meat based. Served with corn chips.

This recipe doesn't need another rave review, but just had to say that we loved it. Made it on Dec. 23 to tide us over during the Christmas preparations - it was a real winner. The thing I liked best was that I was able to modify the ingredients according to what I had on hand, and it was still delicious - a very accommodating recipe! I used a ground beef/pork mixture, had no tomato paste, used red instead of white wine, chopped the carrot, used a whole green pepper (had no red), sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease before adding tomato sauce etc., used more bacon (to finish up the package), used homemade chili mix, had no cilantro. It was fairly mild, but that's the way my husband likes it. It was easy to make, despite the number of ingredients - perfect for a busy period.

This chili was awesome. It's a bit on the sweet side, and not spicy at all. Of course you can add spice. I took it to a chili cook-off at my church. Although I wasn't the grand prize winner, the kids absolutely loved it. My pastor said he's going to send his picky daughter home with me because she won't eat anything at their house for dinner. She even came back for seconds. I did win most Aesthetically Pleasing, meaning the judges thought it was pretty :)

Recommendations: I would use whole strips of bacon next time and pull them out before serving. I cut the bacon into pieces and it literally looked like strips of lard. I painstakingly pulled each one out for the cook off.
Also, I used Heinz 57 for the steak sauce. Perfect flavor.

I've used this recipe on many occasions, and when it says award winning it really means it. I've made some minor tweaks to my recipe, like using venison instead of beef, but that's what is so great about it. This recipe is a great recipe that I plan on using for many many years!

I didn't use the same measurements, only the same ingredients.  I've made it twice and it was delicious both times.  I think you don't have to be exacting in your measurements and it'll still taste yummy.  In fact, I just threw things in there in whatever amount seemed good.  My company LOVED it also.  In fact I made a vegetarian version of it by using veggie crumbles.  Super easy to do a pot of each for food sensitive guests.

WOW, this is a Keeper!

I basically tripled this recipe because as its written, it would be a very small batch.  I only omitted the celery. I used about 2 cups of white wine and about 2 cups of beef stock to loosen the recipe a little, it was too thick as written.  Other than those coupel changes, it was outstanding!  It'll be a keeper in my recipe staples... especially for cold days.

I just want to thank you for this delicious recipe.  I won first place at my work's first ever chili cook-off. The only thing I did differently was substitute stewed tomatoes for fire roasted tomatoes, added one can of mild chili beans, one good teaspoon of cocoa powder, and added chili powder to my desired hotness. I did not add any carrotts. I found that is was a little thick at first so I added water occasionally until I achieved a good consistency, that was my preference.

I'm a big fan of chili but make mine way WAAAY to hot for the average person and thus I've not been breaking the top three in our annual chili cookoff.   I tried this recipe tonight and so far it's delicious.   I used ground sirloin and due to the dryness of the beef I had to add one can of tomato sauce to balance out the moisture.   To give it my signature heat, I added three habaneros.  I did not add the carrots, celery, cilantro or parsley, solely because I know what these judges like.   I'll try to report back tomorrow how the event goes.  :)

I made this and it was awesome!!! Even my daughter loved it and normally she eats one bowl of my chili but she ate two with this time. It was a little to thick for us but I added some tomato juice to thin it out to the way I liked it. I didn't add no carrots to mine and it still came out great. I recommend this recipe. Even your picky eaters will like this. It's also good on nachos and baked potatoes.

This is our go to chili recipe. I have been making it longer than I can remember. Recently, I made another recipe based on what I had on hand....to which a disappointed husband followed. Reminded me of how much we love this recipe and wanted to make sure I came on to give it five stars! I do not make any changes only to simmer longer so the carrots are soft.

Excellent! I was a little skeptical of the carrot, bacon and A1 sauce. We all have our chili recipes and I of course thought, carrots don't go in chili. I urge you to try this recipe as is. All the flavors blend together beautifully and it is now my only chili recipe. I don't make chili weekly, so it's worth a little extra effort. I did thin it with a little tomato juice (that's what I had open in the fridge) as it was a tad to thick for me. Thank you Jennifer!

Excellent recipe!!!  Added about 1/2 cup brown sugar, little extra spices, garlic, and a little more wine to it just to give it a little sweetness.  Won 1st place at our chili cook-off! Tasty...everyone loved it!

Great recipe.  Did it with 93% lean beef and without the bacon (heart healthy) and it was just fine. Poured it over a bed of elbows. Beautiful.

This Recipe was great. First time I ever made chili. I too left out the celery and carrots. They didn't have El Paso Chili seasoning, so I used Carrol Shelby's seasoning. I figured, if he could "spice-up" the Mustang, he could spice up my chili.

I added about an extra cup of water when I used the seasoning on the beef, but other than that it was fantastic. Gave some to my pops who is very picky. I didn't want to tell him about the bacon (used thick sliced Oscar Meyer), but I did. The next day he told me it was great and he didn't mind the bacon which I feared he was going to.

I also used the Tabasco Brand McIlhenny Co. Steak Sauce for that.

I can't wait to bring this to the next Jets tailgate. At least I can look forward to a good chili, because lord knows, I wont be looking forward to a good football game ;)

This turned out more like a stew than traditional chili. It wasn't spicy at all. On the plus side, it was colorful!

Made this for my sister's Super Bowl party and it was a pretty big hit.  I thinned it out a little with some water because I'm not one for a really thick chili.  The next time I make it, I will omit the carrots as I think these turned some people off to it.

We LOVED it!  The great thing about chili is that you don't necessarily have to have all of the items it calls for.  For example, I didn't have the chili seasoning, so I improvised with chili powder, cayenne pepper, and cajun seasoning.  I also added some corn for color.  I'm definately making this again!  The wine adds a lot of the flavor.  If you like soupy chili, this isn't for you.  It's very thick, but that's how we think chili should be.

Very full, well-rounded flavor.  I at least doubled the liquid and the beans.  Otherwise, my recipe for 16 people would have been very thick and much more ground beef than beans.

We did not like this at all.  It was too thick, and too "tomatoey".  I tried pouring some beef stock in to try and make it soupier and, hopefully, cut some of that tomato taste.  No good.  Dumped the whole thing out.  Sorry Jennifer

I followed the recipe except omitted the beans, and added a can of original Rotel and a few cups of water.  It was wonderful!  Got rave reviews from my parents, my husband and son.  I think next time I may use the hotter Rotel - we like our chili HOT!

I doubled this recipe but only used one pound of beef and 5 slices of bacon total, and it was GREAT!  I think more beef would have made it heavy and much less healthy.

it was okay, but it wasn't spicy at all!  i added much more crushed red pepper and still no fire.  also, the family HATED the carrots.  i'm not sure if i'd make this again.  it tasted good, but i guess it wasn't the kind of chili i was expecting.

This reciepe did not have enough flavor until I added some chili powder, jalopenos and garlic powder, I also left out the carrots and celery. I cooked it all in the crock pot for around 4 hours and it was great, the bacon gave it an extra kick. Thanks!

Yummers!  Very flavorful.  I added a diced tomato to loosen it up.  I cooked it, immediately froze it; then heated it up while camping.  Everyone LOVED it.

This chili was delicious.  A different twist to chili - I first tried it at a summer bbq and it was great... a year round chili!  Thanks!

This was a hit in my family  We are not big chili lovers, but the flavors in this chiuli blended nicely  spicy and w/ good flavor, but not too hot. I doubled the recipe using 3 cans of beans instead of 2 and used 2 pkg of chili seasoning 1 hot and 1 texas flavored  otherwise pretty much used the recipe as stated The white wine adds a bit of a difference  I used chardonnay  Am making again today by request  Thanks Jennifer

My husband, who's a big chili-lover, loves this recipe.  It tastes great over rice, noodles, inside a bread-bowl, and by itself!  I added cheddar cheese, extra cilantro, and raw chopped white onions on the top.  It makes for great presentation and makes it taste even better.

I didn't really find this chili to be "award winning".  If I'm going to go through the trouble of preparing a meal, I want it to taste better than if I had just opened a can.  It didn't have a flavor that set it apart from the rest, but it was good.

Pretty good, especially if you prefer more meat than beans.  I liked the addition of vegetables.  I probably won't make it again - I have a chili recipe I prefer - but would recommend giving it a try.

Okay. Made this for dinner last night and it was excellent! I did do some modifications, but who doesnt?? I did not have any white wine, so I dont think that I missed it. I used ground Turkey instead of beef, and could I tell the difference? Nope. I did not add the celery or the carrots. Oh, and I did add some crushed garlic and one jalapeno. I did put shredded cheese and some cilantro on top and it was soo good. I will make again in the future for sure!

I'd only eaten chili twice before making this (yes, I'm wierd).  I've made it three times already!  It's absolutely delicious.  I do add about 3 cups total of beef bouillion, which helps with the thickness and also seems to blend the flavors.  My husband and I don't care for red peppers, so we leave it out; and using a bottle of bacon bits can save time if needed.

I'd warned my husband that it wasn't too hot, and offered to spice it up.  He found it unnecessary and realized it was "flavorful and complex" that he was after, not actually "hot".  And this recipe has it to spare!

great chili! has a unique, sweet yet spicy  flavor... however i did modify the recipe a bit (made for 16 servings), substituting one can of kidney beans with one can of great northern beans, 1 1/2 cubed zucchini in place of the celery, one can of beef broth and two bottles of beer. i also added 4 pinches of crushed red pepper flakes instead of 2, and used 15 pieces of bacon instead of 10. all in all it tasted excellent! best chili i have ever had, the beer took a little edge off the sweetness and complemented it perfectly. i will definitely make this again!

Well this is another one that I liked.  I made this at the Chili cook off at work and won 1st place.  Thanks a lot that meant I had to host the following Annual Chili Cook Off.  I did not add the carrots and put in a bayleaf.  GOOD STUFF!!!

A very good chili - if you like sweet chili.  I loved it!!  But my husband prefers a more savory, meaty flavored chili.  Overall, it's hearty and flavorful.

This was wonderful, and even economical.  I cooked all the meats first, then poured everything into my slow cooker for about 8 hours.  It made enough that I froze half for another night.

This recipe was pretty simple, but I did not care for the taste the wine gave the chili. If I make it again, I wouldn't add wine, but would add beef broth and maybe some add'l spices.

Well, you just received another 5 stars for this recipe. LOVED IT! It was really quick and easy. I used my food processor for the veggies. Didn't have fresh peppers on hand so I used frozen stir-fry peppers (green, yellow and red). It gave the chili a wonderful color. (Made it really easy by chopping them in the processor too). Used cooking sherry instead of white wine and the big can of kidney beans by accident but it was just fine. I only had maple flavored bacon but it worked out perfectly. No cilantro, but oh well - next time! Ended up adding about 2 cups of water in the end. We topped our chili with oster crackers, shredded cheese and sour cream. YUM! Thank you for the recipe. It's a keeper in our household.

This was my first attempt ever at making chili, and it was really easy. It turned out really well, too, though I left out the bacon. (I don't like bacon). I would make this again.

This is a great chili recipe.  I have made it for company as a one dish meal, and served with chopped onion, sour cream and extra cheese.  I have also mixed in a little elbow macaroni to stretch it a little.  It is very tasty, yet a little different tasting than your average chili.  I never have any left-overs with this recipe.

I did a lot of editing to this recipe, I did not add any bell peppers as my spouse will go near them.  In addition I did not add celery or carrots; However, I did add carrot and double the onion.  I took the advice of a previous review and added celery salt, and habenero chilies.  I enjoy heat in chili, but this darn near killed me.  I suffered through it as to not loose face, but it was very hot, maybe next time one chili.  Also, I added sugar to take some of the tartness out of it.  I will not make it again, but am always glad tomake something new.
