this recipe is a great way to get rid of leftover mexican ingredients!  I did not have chipotle salsa, but I had leftover salsa and chile in adobo peppers.  I also added a bit of orange juice for sweetness.  I think there are many add ins that could be used.  

The chicken was very tender and my taco's were fantastic!  Great idea!

My son described this as one of the best things I've ever made.  I prepared it as written except added a small can of chopped green chiles for the last hour.  Next time I'll use hot salsa rather than mild.  Still, it was excellent.  We used it to fill tacos and topped them with a black bean and corn relish.  Definitely a menu to be repeated.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, no substitutions.  Unfortunately we did not care for it.  The meat was use too sweet and not in a good way.  We won't be making this one again.

This was so easy to make, and I love the taste. I served it over rice, and pasta. Its a great recipe when you don't want to spend a lot of time prepping.

Made this just using one 16 ounce jar of southwestern salsa. Loved it! Next time I'll spice it up a little more with some scorpion peppers.
