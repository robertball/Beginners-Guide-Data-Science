Good recipe for people who love pecans! I was not sure how this would turn out but they are good. Very much like a praline candy. Easy to make and few ingredients. Also I used only 1/2 cup of the new Splenda brown sugar blend.

This are so easy...and awesome!  If you love pecans, you will eat all of these before they cool off.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy and a delicious treat for pecan fans!  I love Lamme's famous praline candies and these were the same taste but with a crunchy texture.  The middles were sticky and I don't know if that is because I didn't cook them enough but it wasn't bad.  I beat the egg white by hand but don't recommend it, use an electric mixer if you can.  I also used a cookie scoop which made tablespoon-sized scoops but smaller would have been better so next time I will use a teaspoon as the recipe states.

This is very tasty. However, a little goes a long way.  I would describe it as a candy rather than a praline cookie.

Yum, yum, yum! These are perfect as written. I didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect. I agree with another poster who says these are more like candy than a cookie, but really, that's splitting hairs. They are super delicious and make a great gift for pecan lovers when placed in a mason jar with a pretty bow around the lid at the holidays.

These are fabulous! I might eat the whole batch right now! Update: I mailed these to my husband at training. He said they were gone within 5 minutes. He walked into the room a few minutes later, and his roommate had turned the bag upside down and was shoveling the crumbs into his mouth. This recipe is that good!

One tip I'd like to offer- I didn't have parchment paper and baked them on a greased baking sheet, but once they were done, I couldn't get them off the sheet! I tried everything, but found that if I just put them back in the oven to soften them up for a few minutes at 200 degrees, they came right off. Just thought I'd try and save others the pain I  went through. ;)

These are really good! I was suprised they would turn out - I used whole pecans and followed the exact measurements and they turned out perfectly. I baked them on a baking mat so they just lifted right up and clean up was easy. These are not too sweet like regular pecan praline. I can see using other nuts like walnuts or almonds. I'll definately make them again!

Not sure what happened.  It wouldn't stick together.  It was all crumbly, even tried to roll it into balls.  Baked the crumbs on a cookie sheet and they were delicious.  Decided to use the crumbs for ice cream topping.

These are perfect for the person who loves the praline flavor, but doesn't have the time, patience or weather to make the candy.  It did look awfully liquidy until I added the pecans, and even then was a loose pile of nuts and sugar but bakes out to a perfect cookie with chewy texture. I did only get twenty five or so cookies out of it, with about a teaspoon each of "dough".

This turned out well in the end.  However, and I'm not sure if it's because of being high-altitude/low humidity or what, but when I tried to mix the sugar mixture in, it looked incredibly too dry.  I ended up beating another egg white and adding it in - that seemed to get it at least to the point where it looked workable.  Even then, some of the batter ended up so crumbly I had to discard it.  Everything tasted wonderful, and the cookies had an excellent consistency!

Update: did this recipe again, toasted the pecans first, used two egg whites again, and it came out beautifully...the pre-toasted pecans really make it pop.

I needed to make non-dairy cookies for a friend and I didn't want to add fake butter. These were really good and were exactly what I needed. If I make them again I'll make it into a bar so I wouldn't have to make so many small cookies. Also,If someone doesn't have pecans they can use another kind of nut.

Great recipe, very tasty!  I agree more like candy in texture and flavor but looks like a cookie so loved that!  Couple things, I used our own eggs and we have bigger yolks than store bought so if you have a crumbly batter add another whipped white. Also the only way I could get these NOT to stick to everything was using shortening on cookie sheet. Otherwise they would crumble when I tried to lift them no matter what I tried from others recommendations.

These cookies are OMG delicious!  I made them to take to a cookie sale, and they were the first to go.  My friends insisted that I make them again for a luncheon the following week.  I made them a little bigger, more like a heaping tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  They don't spread, so you can make the cookie whatever size you want, and it will pretty much stay that size.  I think a jumbo egg is called for.  Mine were smaller eggs and when I doubled the recipe the second time I made them, I used three "small egg" egg whites and they held together better.  This is my new "go to" cookie!!

I made this for a cookie exchange and needed 4 dozen (plus extras) so I increased the recipe by 3. I roasted the nuts as suggested and had no problem with "dough" being runny or dry.  Use a heaping teaspoon or else cookie will dry out when cooked for 25 min. Definitely let cookies sit for 5 min. before removing from sheet. The last batch was a little drier but they still cooked up fine. I ended up with 7 dozen.

These are very good and couldn't be simpler to make. Definitely do not over bake, I did 25 minutes in the oven and the 5 on the pan. Anymore and they would have been dry. I also baked on parchment and had no problems removing them from the pan after the 5 minute cool down. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Excellent.  Crunchy and light.  To me they weren't as sweet and sugary as the candy pralines.  I would rather have these than the candy pralines.
