To my surprise, I liked this recipe.  I didn't have bell peppers; instead I used tomatoes and a 1/4 of an onion I had left over.

I am very picky - this was GREAT!  If it passed my pallet, I can assure you it'll pass most anyone's!  Yummy!

If you like this, I love to do diced tomatoes, pineapple, and red onion with Honey Catalina!  Very similar and a personal fav :)

This was ok. I think I would make a few alterations to it. I would add more fruits and a little less pepper. Some green apple and clementines (or any kind of orange) My hubby and I agreed that would have been more tasty!

I really liked this!! I used raspberry dressing and it was really good.  The combo is unusal but works well and looks so colourful in the bowl!! Easy, fresh salad that works with any fruit!!

I've been making this recipe for three years now. I don't use the dressing - it's plenty flavorful without. It's nutrient-packed and the perfect side dish if you're on a diet. Highly recommended.
