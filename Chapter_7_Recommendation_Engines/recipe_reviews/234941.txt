Very easy, delicious and healthy!  I made this exactly as written, well except I used more kale bc it does shrink down quite a bit once cooked. I had the opposite experience as the other reviewer - I felt this had a ton of flavor, especially given that it's only seasoned with salt and pepper! To make blending the beans easier, I removed some liquid from the pot and added that to the beans before blending.  This is a very hearty soup and makes 6 good sized portions. I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for the great recipe sarah!

This was a good soup.  I used frozen collard greens instead of kale which worked great.  I docked it one star because I felt it was a little lacking as is.  I added some oregano, a little basil, and some mini bow tie pasta which I feel really helped make it tasty.  I didn't puree the cannellini beans ahead of time, rather I used my immersion blender to blend right in the pot (I did this step before adding pasta.)

I left out celery but added zucchini & sun dried tomatoes. Substituted apple cider vinegar with red wine vinegar.  This soup is very hearty & tasty!

Excellent flavor. I added some cayenne to give it a little zip.

My guests raved about the luncheon I served! I made this soup per the recipe and added extra kale and carrots, blending in some cooked pasta at the end. The apple cider vinegar added an intriguing slightly sweet finish. 
I served it with crusty bread and Parmesan cheese. As a left over, the soup needs more broth. I'll double the the amount next time I make it!

This was delicious.  We made it with chick peas because we didn't have any beans and added twice the amount of kale.  It was even better left over!

YUM! I love that this soup is so healthy and delicious...simple, too! I used only black beans because I didn't have any cannellini, and I ended up blending up a portion of the black beans. It turned out great! I also added more kale since I had a lot to use up. Next time, I will take the suggestion of another reviewer and use some liquid/chicken stock to blend the beans, since they were a bit dry and got stuck a few times while blending. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is delicious! My husband ate four bowls the night I made it. The recipe is simple and easy to follow. The flavor is great, and I really enjoy the kick from the ACV. I'm adamant about getting more vegetables into our meals so this soup is perfect.

Great, nutritious soup. I followed Lilsnoo comment of adding more kale and using liquid to blend the cannelli beans. I will definitely make again. Soup was superb.
