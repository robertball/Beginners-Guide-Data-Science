I actually made these in small loaf pans and gave them away as gifts for Christmas. It was great! So simple and everyone loved them. I also glazed them with a simple recipe I found on here. 1/4 orange juice, 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract. I warmed it on the stove until the sugar melted then poured it over the top of the cakes while they were still hot. So gooooood!!!
P.S. If you are looking for "BREAD" like you find in the store, this isn't it. This is more of a cake, like banana bread isn't bread, its cake.

I've made this same recipe but in a bundt pan and served it as a cake. It's nice and sweet, more cakelike than breadlike.  I took the leftovers to work, and my secretary went ga-ga over it.  I do use a glaze after letting the cake cool for 15 minutes.  The glaze is 5 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 butter brought to a boil in a saucepan and drizzled over the cake while hot.  It's very good and doesn't taste like it came from a cake mix!

This cake/bread is great!  Whenever I make it, it's gone in a day or two, and it's so easier.  I make an easy glaze for it too.  1 tbsp lemon juice or milk, and about 1/2 cup powered sugar.  I keep adding powered sugar or lemon juice until I get it to a thick enough consistency for a glaze.  I usually make this in a bread pan and flip it onto a plate and then dump the glaze on.  It's easy, fast, and tastes great!

This is EASY and fabulous! Very moist and flavorful. Everyone wants the recipe. Keeps very well, too, if you can manage to hide it!! I did make some changes. First, I used 1/3 cup of oil, the juice of one lemon with water added to make one cup total(rather than plain water) to make it more lemony, and I took the zest from that lemon and chopped it finely and added it to the batter. Finally, I baked it in a bundt pan, and after baking, added glaze made from lemon juice and powdered sugar. This all just kicks the lemon flavor up a notch (to borrow a phrase).

This recipe was easy and delicious!  I changed it up a little bit.  Since I didn't have any poppyseeds, I used dried sweetened cranberries (cut up into small bits).  I also made them as muffins (cooked for 20 minutes).  YUMMY, Lemon Cranberry Muffins! Turned out great and everyone loved them. Thanks!

I've used this recipe three times with great results. It took me longer to bake than the recipe suggests, but that could be because of my oven. A nice touch is to add a 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract.

This turned out great. I baked it in a 9x13in pan because the top is my favorite part. It took 35min. to bake. I didn't add any glaze or anything because this stands on its own!

These are delicious.  Here's an idea that I use and may be helpful to those who don't want to make a full size recipe.  I mix all the dry ingredients together and then divide them into 4 plastic bags.  When I'm ready to bake a few muffins I spray a mini muffin tin w/ non-stick spray.  Add 1 egg, 1/8 cup oil, 1/8 cup water and 1/8 cup lemon juice to the dry mix.  Fill cups about 2/3 full and bake 18-20 minutes.  Yield: about 14 mini muffins.  Perfect for me.

I made this for holiday gifts It was easy and very moist. I already had a almond poppy seed cake so I left out the seeds. For the water part I juiced and zested 4 lemons along with the water to make one cup. I told people it was a secret recipe when they asked for the recipe.  ;-) It was that easy!!!

Have made this twice now, and both times I baked them in my bundt pan.  It's very moist, and the perfect amount of poppy seeds.  I made this the first time as directed, and the second time I made two changes. I used only 1/3 cup oil (didn't affect the moistness of the cake at all) and I added a pinch of ground cloves and a teaspoon of cinnamon, to subdue the lemon flavor.  It was still lemony when it was baked, but the spices gave it a much more home-made taste, in my opinion - less of that 'lemon-cake-mix' flavor.  You can't taste the cinnamon - it just creates a more complex flavor.  I'll be adding the spices from now on, but this recipe is definitely a keeper.

My mother in law has been making this for years, using pistachio pudding mix instead of lemon, it makes them a nice light green colour and the flavor is great. My husband and sons love it. I usually make muffins, no glaze or icing.

I have been making this recipe for several years and I always get rave reviews.  I have made loaves, mini loaves and muffins.  They always come out moist and delicious.  I made lemon poppyseed muffins today and my son asked if I would make chocolate chip muffins too.  I followed the recipe but used a vanilla cake mix and vanilla pudding mix.  I added chocolate chips and topped the muffins with a cinnamon-sugar mixture before popping them in the oven.  Delicious!!

I have made this delicious recipe several times. It's embarrassingly easy and everyone LOVES it! I cut down on the poppy seeds due to our preference.

I've made this bread now for 3 different occasions and all have received rave reviews.  Adults and children alike love this bread.  I've baked large loaves, mini loaves, mini muffins, oversized muffins and bundt and all have turned out great.  Last time I dropped a teaspoon of lemon oil in and I think it intensified the lemon flavor a bit. I use my kitchen aid mixer and mix med-high for 2-3 minutes.  Highly recommended for summer gatherings of all kinds.

These were so good! And simple! I had everything but the pudding mix in my kitchen! I took the advice of another reviewer and added 4 tsps. lemon juice and filled the rest of the 1 cup with water. the second time around i finely chopped almond slivers and sprinkled a chopped almond/sugar mixture on the tops...awesome!!! My husband and I had almond poppyseed muffins on our honeymoon and they were great, we've been bringing them up ever since so this was a nice recipe to reminisce with. I think next time instead of the lemon juice i'll use almond extract with the water and do the chopped almonds in the whole batch! For us that makes this 5 stars!!! Thank you!!!

Easy and so good!  I took the tip from another reviewer and have been making this recipe in mini-loaf pans (makes 5), and baking them for 35-40 minutes.  I also glaze them while warm with 1 TB of lemon juice mixed with 1/2 cup of powdered sugar.  Great for bake sales!

Love this bread! I made one loaf and some muffins to send with my son to college. I have to say, I think the muffins cooked up better. Bread had to cook longer than directions indicated for the center to get done. Which made the crust a little darker than I prefer. But I could have had too much batter in the pan for one loaf.

I prefer a less-sweet cake and a lemon glaze: sub 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice for water in cake. Add some lemon zest. When cool, make glaze of lemon juice, water, pow. sugar, and if desired, lemon zest. We have tons of lemons which I zest and juice then freeze to use the rest of the year. Granted, if you don't have it on hand, this is quite lovely and adaptable (diff mixes, nuts, fruits.) YUM!

Easy, quick, refreshing. I like to make these into muffins and put them in cupcake liners. Bake for 18-20 minutes. I put some in the freezer to grab and go with. We enjoy for breakfast or a snack.

Very good.  Put them in sprayed muffin tins.  Let sit for 20 min before putting in oven.  Otherwise first batch will be flat, second fluffy & puffy.   Could use more lemon flavor.

I make this recipe with yellow cake mix and instant vanilla pudding. Another tip I received from my aunt who's been making this for years, is to make sure the water is hot. This recipe is a sure hit and always gets rave reviews! Enjoy!

This is a great basic recipe. I always mix some confectioner's sugar, milk and lemon juice and drizzle over the bread for even more lemon flavor!

Super easy, super moist, super good.  Used 3/4 C water and 1/4 C lemon juice for extra flavor.  Could have used more lemon juice.

Excellent recipe.  Modifications I made:  - 1/2cup oil = 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce - 1 pkg lemon pudding mix = 1 pkg vanilla pudding mix (no lemon pudding available) - 1 cup water = 3/4 cup water + juice of 2 freshly squeezed lemons  I also added fresh finely grinded lemon zest and a bit more poppy seed. To give it an extra kick, I layered almond slices on top of the bread for the last 3-5 minutes of baking time to give it a nutty crust.  Overall, this cake/bread is good because it is extremely moist, not too sweet and a really great simple foundation for a wide variety of modifications you can use to "spice" it up - a cream cheese frosting, a glaze etc etc.

This is an excellent lemon poppy seed bread recipe.  I didn't change a thing - don't mess with perfection!  I've served this to company twice as a side dish to Chicken Pasta Salad and was asked for the recipe both times.  Thanks for a great recipe Marian!

These are so good!  I made them exactly as written but made 24 muffins instead of 2 loaves.  They are moist and very lemony (but not over-powering). Will defintely make again.

I make this recipe a lot.  I do lower the temperature about 10 degrees, and bake it for a bit longer.  Other than that, I get requests for it a lot!

I'm on Weight Watchers and am absolutely hooked on Lemon poppy seed loaf from Starbucks, so I was looking for a close match that I could modify.  For this recipe I used 1 egg, 3 egg whites and 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup yogurt and made them into cupcakes.  It was absolutely delicious and cured my need for Starbucks 11 point lemon bread :)

I host a monthly musical soiree (house concert) at my home with anywhere from 35 to 70 guests plus the musicians. As a snack for my guests during the break between sets, I always three or four different kinds of fruit and nut quick breads.  i.e., 6 to 10 loaves each month! I first made this lemon poppy seed bread about a year ago and it immediately became a crowd favorite. When I include it in my repertoire, it always disappears first! And if I skip making any, someone ALWAYS asks for it and makes me promise to be sure and include it the following month.

I do pump up the lemon flavor by using a cup of strong lemonade in place  of the water and I glaze the bread with a mixture of powdered sugar and lemon juice while it is still hot. I cook it in two 4x8 loaf pans and it takes about 40 minutes to reach "clean straw" done-ness.

Now if I could just find somewhere to buy poppy seeds in bulk...

The BIGGEST hit I've made from allrecipes.com so far! I made this for Thanksgiving morning, and it was gone the morning after.  I made it as a Bundt cake, it came out great.  For the glaze I used  1 cup powdered sugar and then squeezed a lemon into the sugar until it formed a glaze, and grated the lemon rind to make it SO flavorful!  My family likes a lot of glaze :) You can use 1/2 cup powdered sugar if you want less.

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I needed to make many small gifts for co-workers. This worked wonderfully. One recipe made enough for 5 mini loaf pans (each with about 2/3 cup of batter-and about a TBL left for each from the remnants in the bowl) I baked them for 35 minutes and they were perfect. 
Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe exactly to make mini-muffins.  There was not enough lemon flavor for my taste.  Next time I will add fresh lemon zest as suggested by another reviewer.  Overall, it was well worth the 30 minutes of my day.

This is the best lemon poppy seed bread ever!!!  I used a 1 oz. box of pudding mix and only 3 Tablespoons of poppy seeds.  It was very moist and my boyfriend loved it!
I also made another batch to give as gifts, baked in foil pans and wrapped in a Christmas kitchen towel.  Everyone loved it!

I had to make it without the poppy seeds.  I made 1 loaf and mini muffins and regular size muffins with the remaining batter.  It was a hit.  I got 2 pieces, bui the rest got gobbled up!

Oh yeah!!! I was trying to figure out how to make the same kind of bread that my grandma makes - and this is it!!! The recipe was enough to make two loafs in a 5x9 pan - so I gave one loaf as a gift. It took about 20 minutes longer in my oven - but turned out GREAT!

This recipe is truly amazing. I have made it many times and everytime it is wonderful. It is easy to make and stays moist for days. If I don't have poppy seeds, I like to add frozen cranberries to the batter. Everytime I make it, I have to double the recipe because it goes so fast.

Very moist and delicious! Did adjust cook time -- I put half of the batter into 2 mini loaf pans and those were done in 35 minutes. The other half of the batter went into a regular size loaf pan, and took 45+ minutes to cook completely. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely delicious, I did not change any of the ingredients, turned out nice, moist, and very lemony.  I baked mine in 5 mini aluminum bread pans, worked great! Such cute little loaves, nice for Christmas gift giving, I"M definitely giving friends and family lemon poppyseed bread this year! Thanks for the recipe!

Used a bundt pan as this tastes more like a pound cake than a bread.  Also mixed a glaze using confectioner's sugar and lemon juice.  Would make excellent lemon poppyseed muffins ~ can't wait to try in a Texas muffin pan!

Very easy and yummy! I made this for the girls at work and it was a hit! It's very moist and flavorful. I added a little fresh lemon juice and baked in a bunt pan. I also used a lemon/sugar glaze as suggested by others. A keeper!

Loved it! Very light and fluffy. It would be good on it's own, but I opted to make a glaze for it. I mixed together powdered sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, vanilla and almond extract. I then poked holes in the bread and poured the glaze over it and spread it out with a spatula. Turned out great!

Make recipe exactly as is.  This is a cake bread, or "quick bread."  It is excellent and was the hit dessert at a BBQ!  I did a glaze of 1 1/2 T Orange juice, 1 1/2 tsp. Lemon juice and powdered sugar.  Pour over while bread is still warm.  Let cool and cut into slices and serve.  Make this recipe!!!

This was so moist.  I was only able to make one large loaf as I thought there was not enough batter for two loaf pans.  I had to bake a little longer but not too much.  This was very easy and will now be made regularly  in our house.

Very easy and yummy. I took half of the batter and added craisens to it. The other half, I added the poppy seeds.  Both were lucious.  For a glaze (highly reccomended)1 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 5 tsp. lemon juice.  Mix together and add water if necessary to make glaze smooth.

This was fabulous!!!  I did add the lemon juice confectioners sugar glaze and I added some zest to it as well.  Next time, I will lower the temp and bake longer as mine browned a little more than I would have liked, but I got RAVE reviews from it.  I also sprinkled it with some sliced almonds.

I am always looking for the perfect Lemon Poppyseed muffin recipe, and as simple as this one is, it is a winner. I added about a tbsp of lemon extract, and drizzled some Vanilla Glaze by Jamie Langston from this site on top. Very moist, lemony, and very easy.

I needed to make something with what I had on hand because I was in a hurry, came across this recipe and made it. It was quick and easy. I added 2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice and that made the bread more tart and with a bigger lemon flavor. I took one loaf to MIL and she loved it! We liked it too.

So easy that I'm not sure it even qualifies as baking, and very, very good.    The only change I made to the recipe was to add a tsp of lemon extract.  Next time, I think I'll add some lemon zest, too, and maybe a lemon glaze (I like my lemon bread to be nice and tart).  I did have to cook this for about 15 minutes longer than the listed time, though that may be my oven.  This recipe shot to the top of my "quick, easy, and amazing" list, the kind of thing you can whip up almost any day, no matter how hectic.  Both loaves went so fast that I hardly had time to snag a piece for myself before it was gone.

WONDERFUL!!  i usually don't freeze breads, but because this recipe made two breads i froze the one we didn't eat.  when i defrosted the second to eat at a later date i was amazed at the great taste - almost better than eating the first day it was made! next time i plan on serving this bread i'll  make it a day ahead.

This was a hit at a family picnic, many wanted the recipe. I took one loaf with me and saved a loaf at home in the Frig. It lasted a week and still tasted great. I followed the advice of an erlier review and made a glaze for the top using powdered sugar and lemon juice(tasty) I also had to bake my loaves for 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.Great and EASY Recipe!!!!

I use this recipe all the time and make a lot of variations. For example chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, mini chocolate chips. Also I like German chocolate cake mix, coconut pudding, coconut flakes. I just made a batch using pineapple cake mix, coconut flakes and coconut pudding. I drained a small can of pineapple chunks and leave them on top of the batter in the pans. You must drain canned fruit very well and place on top as it will sink to the bottom. So good!

The students enjoyed making and eating this. I was surprised how much poppy seed the recipe called for. So, we added 2 tablespoons, instead.

Love this recipe - I make this whenever we have overnight guests so they have something to snack on any time, though people especially seem to like it with their coffee. I make it exactly as described except I've found baking at 325 works better for me. 
Note: it is definitely on the sweeter side - more cake like than bread. Personally, I think frosting would be overkill. I do serve it with butter. It's so moist you don't need it though!

For moister cake, use 1/2 cup of butter instead of oil. For stronger lemony taste add 4 TBS dried lemon peel or lemon zest. To get moist top, place in freezer bag and freeze overnight after baking.

I made this recipe for Christmas to give as gifts. it was very easy and quick. actually I quadrupled the recipie to get 8 loaves. the ONLY negative is the cooking time. no way was 25 minutes near enough time. breads always take like an hour and 15-30 minutes, as did this. other than that, it was really good. I put in some lemon peel too to give it kick.

My local small grocery store doesn't carry either lemon cake mix or lemon pudding, so rather than drive across town, here's what I do:  Use yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding, then substitute 3/4 cup lemon juice & 1/4 cup water instead of 1 cup water.  2 drops of yellow food coloring completes it.  Voila!

I have made this for several holiday seasons now. I make it in small loaf pans and give it as gifts. It is AWESOME - especially for those friends who are not into lots of sweets. Thanks for the recipe :)

I've made this recipe twice and everyone loved it. It took a little longer to bake than the directions said, and I added about 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Delicious and easy! This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes.

This is so easy and so delicious!! It definitely takes longer to cook than stated on the recipe, but it turns out great. I debated on adding a glaze like so many reviewers suggested, but it doesn't need it! It is great on it's own!

Very good recipe. I made them in small tins and it made 7 of my small tins. I made them for our church's welcome bread. Very easy also, one of the best quick breads I have tried.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Tested recipe for a bridal shower and it is a KEEPER.    Instead of the 1 C of water.  I used 1/2 C of Real Lemon Juice and 1/2 C of water. I added about 1 teaspoon of pure lemon extract to the water and lemon juice before putting it into the dry mixture.

Really good, I added the zest from one lemon and cut back on the poppy seeds. It took almost 40 minutes for mine to bake. I made a glaze from lemon juice and powdered sugar but I think the bread/cake would be just fine without it. This will be in my kitchen for years to come!

This recipe is exquisite!
So easy that I'm not sure it even qualifies as baking, and very, very good. The only change I made to the recipe was to add a tsp of lemon extract. Next time, I think I'll add some lemon zest, too, and maybe a lemon glaze (I like my lemon bread to be nice and tart). I did have to cook this for about 15 minutes longer than the listed time, though that may be my oven. This recipe shot to the top of my "quick, easy, and amazing" list, the kind of thing you can whip up almost any day, no matter how hectic. Both loaves went so fast that I hardly had time to snag a piece for myself before it was gone.

I brought this bread to a wedding shower and it was a huge hit! I received so many compliments and everyone was begging for the recipe. They couldn't believe how easy it was to make. I will definitely be making this again. Please note, however, that it takes MUCH longer to bake than the stated time (about 50 mins in my oven).

I sooooo hate to be the bearer of bad new bug GAG!  I am sorry this tasted nothing like bread at all.  Cake sure it would have need some tweeking but if you are expecting a bread like taste or texture this would not be the recipe for you.  I am sorry but even the cooking time was way off I even tried to make some as cupcakes and they fell like rocks.??  I try to use the best of ingredents this just fell very short in my book.  sorry :(

Very moist, and super easy, but I found it lacked flavor, even after adding 1 t. almond extract to the batter.  I would definitely add some lemon zest or extra flavoring to this recipe.

We own and operate Piney Hill Bed & Breakfast in Luray, VA (Shenandoah Valley).  We have found this site to be very helpful in providing many different recipes.  We highly recommend the Quick Lemon Poppy Seed Bread.  It is easy to make and we have received high reviews from guests that it is a big hit.  Nobody does it like Sara Lee!

I had lost my mom's recipe for Poppy seed bread and was so glad to find this one. The only difference is she used a white cake mix. I've also tried using a yellow cake mix. All work well. You can't mess this recipe up.

I can't make this often enough - it disappears faster than I can grab a piece. I've been asked for the recipe 5 times, and it's only been two weeks since I first found it on this site. It's yummy!

This was very moist and easy to put together.  I made it for a staff meeting at my husband's office and it went quickly.  I did taste the batter and decided to add 1 tsp. of lemon extract to add to the flavor.  Next time, I will make this in a bundt pan and add a lemon glaze.  Then, I think it will be excellent. : )

I can not get over how easy and delicious that this recipe is!!!! This is more like a cake than a bread, but who cares? I am sure that I will use this many times when I need to throw something together fast with minimal ingredients. I made this exactly to recipe and baked it an extra 5 minutes - a winner!

This bread was so easy and delicious! An instant favorite! I added a vanilla glaze, but it wouldn't have been necessary. The bread is plenty sweet and moist on it's own! Thanks for sharing!

This turned out wonderful!!  A little more cakey rather than breadlike, but delicious.  I had 4 mini loaves and 1 9X5 from this recipe.  I also topped with a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze.  Now I won't have to buy from the coffee shop to go with my a.m. java!!  Thanks!

Made this bread a couple of times for holiday goodie trays and everyone raved about it!  Moist, flavorful and just plain good!  Cut back a bit on the poppyseed though.
