Yum! I'm no expert on chimichurri, so I won't even pretend to be. I am, however, somewhat of an expert on deliciousness - and this has it. Thanks!

So delicious - you can put it on ANY meat. And I like to freeze it in ice cube trays (like pesto) then you can take out single servings when you want.

I didn't have parsley but I did have two bunches of cilantro so I gave it a shot and OMG, the very best sauce on fish, chicken and steak!  
**UPDATE** I mixed a quarter cup of this in with two cups of alfredo sauce and put it on pasta, very delicious!

This was AMAZING. I had never really had chimichurri until it was server at the cafe at my work last week. I fell in love and had to make some at home. I think this recipe is slightly different from the one they used at work (they used grapefruit juice which would also be fun to try) but this recipe is outstanding regardless. I served it at room temperature on top of a pork shoulder that I cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hours with hawaiian sea salt and liquid smoke. This would be fantastic on beef or pork, and plan to try the leftovers on steak this weekend. I'll be making this again!

Ive never had a traditional Chimichurri before, but I found this dissapointingly simular to a salad dressing. However, it was very tasty on the meat as well as our caulifower.

This is a great recipe with some additions, make sure to use Italian parsley. Double the lemon juice and add the same amount of cilantro as parsley. I also added 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. This is exactly the chimmichuri sauce you get at the Brazilian BBQ restaurants.

This sauce was pretty good.  I followed the directions.  This was much better after setting for a while.  My 9 year old loved this.  Tasting it by itself, I wasn't sure I cared for it but after putting on the steak it was good and I would probably make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was very good. I thought it would be good to put everything in my little chopper for a couple of pulses and it blended a little too much, which is my fault. While I liked this chimichurri, I felt it could use a tad more acid and I opted to splash in a tiny bit of red wine vinegar. Just my personal preference I suppose. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn’t think I could match the various chimichurri sauces I had in Argentina but this recipe is incredible. I doubled the recipe and also left out the shallots but added capers.

This was good, but as other reviewers have commented -- it needs more acid.  I added additional lemon juice and a little vinegar as recommended in other reviews.  Went great with some grilled tri tip...

This recipe was good and fast. I unfortunately did not have shallots but used finely chopped sweet onion. It is very good over broiled pork chops. Will make it again!

We've been to several Argentinian restaurants and our kids have found a liking for chimichurri (my daughter in particular), and we all thought that this was a very good home version. It's great drizzled over steak.

My first time making and eating chimichurri, and it won't be my last! We made this to serve with grilled skirt steak and chicken breasts, and it was fantastic! I did add just a tad bit of crushed red pepper at hubs request. Delicious recipe, and will make this one again. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic! First time making this recipe and already everyone is planning the next BBQ so we can have more :)
Used fresh herbs from the garden which I think made a big difference since it was very aromatic as well. Simple and delicious, thank you!

Excellent. I went a little heavy on the salt the first time, but it came out better the 2nd. I also replaced parsley with fresh Cilantro as most of the recipes I have seen say either/or. Definitely one of the best recipes I have found.

Agree with one of the reviews below, this is badly lacking in acidity, I'd suggest doubling the lemon juice and/or adding a tbsp. of white wine vinegar, or white balsamic vinegar. Otherwise the fresh herbs dominate everything else.

This was excellent, and super easy to make.  It was missing something though to make it more like the Argntinean chimchurri I have had.  Possibly cilantro.  But I realize there are many different versions of chimichurri, so I don't doubt that this is authentic... just not quite the version I am used to.  It's great with steak, or toss it with some chick peas and enjoy!

Really this is my favorite thing on steak following the Gaucho version done by Bob Blumer on food network.  Great to dip bread as well.  I also add a crumbled bay leaf and more parsley and 2 TBSP of red wine vinegar.
