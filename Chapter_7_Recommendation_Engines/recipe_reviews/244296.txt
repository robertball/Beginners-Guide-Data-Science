My husband and I really liked this dish. If you want a little bit of a bolder taste and enough for a family, I used  one cup of quinoa mixing it with white cooking wine with water (made measurements according to package directions).  I added olive oil and Bosari salt, which you can get at Whole Foods, to taste. It was great and I made a side of sautéed spinach with garlic, olive oil, and a little bit of seasoning. Great healthy dish.

I substituted water with bone broth and added salt. Very tasty and very easy(I don’t usually cook)!

I liked this.  If I make it again I would definitely either add more curry or the white wine as suggested.  Good enough as it is but a little more spark wouldn't hurt.  Thanks for sharing.
