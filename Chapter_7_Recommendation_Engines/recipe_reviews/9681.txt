Tasty cookies, but I think next time I make them I will decrease the amounts of peanuts & raisins.  When rolling into balls, there just seemed there was not enough dough to make it "stick".  I also used dry roasted peanuts & omitted the salt.

The cookies had just the right amount of spice. I used 1 1/2 c. oatmeal instead of peanuts and only added 1 and 1/2 cups of raisins. I then added 1/2 c. chopped almonds and 1/2 c of chocolate chips. They had just the right texture and flavor :)

Family ate all of the M&Ms out of the trail mix; so, was left with about 3 cups peanuts and raisins.  Used those left-overs to make these cookies. .  Pretty good tasting.
