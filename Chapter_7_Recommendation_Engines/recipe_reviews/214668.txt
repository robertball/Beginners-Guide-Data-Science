This was really delicious. The only issue I had was spreading the paste.. was very thick .. I added a bit of oil to make it easier to spread. Next time will use a little more adobo sauce

Husband loved this recipe!  And he doesn't even like chicken, so that's saying something.

We loved this chicken! It had the perfect amount of spice for us. I didn't marinate the chicken at all and it still worked really well. The chicken was so flavorful! I didn't have a mortar and pestle, so I just used the end of a wooden spoon to mash the marinade together. It did form a paste, but it wasn't easy to spread. Once I coated both sides of the chicken, I drizzled the olive oil and sprinkled s & p on them before cooking them in a cast iron pan (it's winter and I can't grill).  Even though this wasn't made exactly as written, it was excellent and going into my best of 2019 file. Thank you!

I made this recipe only difference was our store didn't have the peppers is adobe sauce. So I just substituted 1 teaspoon of Chipotle sauce for the chipotle pepper in the adobe sauce. Then since I was out of the paprika required I substituted 1 tsp hot paprika in place of the smoked paprika (figured it had to be better than chili powder as a substitute). It turned out awesome for the Spring salad mixed with Baby kale and shredded carrots. I tossed it with our favorite dressing Raspberry vinaigrette. Delicious!!!
