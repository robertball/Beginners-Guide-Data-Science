Delicious! a very pleasant way to get in your "greens"! since i could not find the Seven Seas dressing in my local grocery store, i made the raspberry vinagrette from the "Harvest Salad" recipe. i also used Craisins and golden delicious apples. very tasty as is, but i added a little blue cheese in with my seconds (as suggested by another reviewer). both my husband and i loved it and had heaping portions. i plan to make this often.

I have made this salad for two special occasions and I had awesome results.  This salad is so easy and fun. I used two bags of pre-washed and various kinds of lettuce to cut down on the time, pecans instead of walnuts and Ken's Steakhouse Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette.  It was excellent!!!

I added 1/2 cup of feta cheese and the sweet, salty combination of it with the Craisins was wonderful. Definitely toast the walnuts for the best flavor. I have made it without the walnuts when I wanted to cut the fat and it was still good, but they do add to the salad. I used Girard's Light Champagne dressing since I didn't have the one called for. This is a keeper! Update: If you have a store that sells bulk dried cranberries, try them in this salad. What I bought are so much better than the packaged ones! I also heard a tip on TV that I've used a few times. If you're in a hurry and busy doing other things, put your handful of walnuts in the microwave for one minute. Taste and microwave 10-40 more seconds if they don't taste "roasted" enough.

This salad was quick and easy to make.  It was full of colour.  The only thing I found that guests commented it was not too easy to eat and took longer than your average salad to eat because of the nuts and cranberries.  Excellent if you are in a hurry and need to bring a desert to a dinner party!

I am a dinner salad type of gal.  Give me a tomato, some cucumber, crutons, and dressing and I'm happy.  I usually get nervous with fruit in my salad.  This one was so great!  I took it to a pot luck and we all loved it.  I'm going to make it for my next family get together.  
SinceI was making it early, I dropped the sliced apples into a ziplock with a couple teaspoons of lemon juice and shook.  My apples stayed crisp and the right color.

This was really good.  I cubed the apples instead of slicing them, and just tossed with the salad.  Easier to eat this way.  I also used spinach for the greens since that's what I had.  Very good!

Was a great recipe. I used romaine lettuce instead and let everyone put the dressing on themselves. Everyone was pleasently surprised how much the walnuts added to the salad.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I used mesculin greens and pecans.  I also made my own raspberry vinagrette.  My dinner guests loved it... even the one who didn't like fruit in salads!  He asked for the recipe!

This was an excellent salad and would be a wonderful companion to a Thanksgiving dinner.  

I wish though I had not tossed the entire salad with the dressing, as the leftovers were not edible.

This salad is great and very easy to make.  I love anything that is sorta fruity so the apples and the cranberries make this a winner.  I used Newmans' Walnut Raspberry Vinaigrette and it was delicious!

Excellent recipe!!  I made it for an event for 100 people and it was a hit!!  To cut down on the cost, I used romaine lettuce instead of salad green and shelled walnuts instead of walnut halves.  I also didn't have time to toast the walnuts and forgot to put in green onions, but it was still very yummy.  Couldn't find Seven Seas Raspberry Vinaigrette so used Ken's Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette.  Everyone at the event LOVED the salad, I was very pleased.

This salad is excellent!  I love all the seperate flavors: the green onions, dried cranberries, apples, and walnut, and they compliment each other so well.  A tip: Let each individual add the dressing themselves, instead of pouring it on the entire salad.  And, a substitute for Seven Seas Rasp. vinagrette: mix equal parts of rasp. juice, and olive oil, add a dash of red wine vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, for a quick and easy "homemade" dressing.

I made this with Spianch leaves, 2 crispin apples, the walnuts, and craisins.  I left out the scallions because I didn't have any on hand and used Wishbones Raspberry Hazelnut Vinaigrette dressing.  I didn't put the dressing on until ready to serve.  Was very good.

My friends went nuts over this salad and it was so easy to make!!!!  They all said they could have just eaten the salad as their main course.  Instead of regular walnut halves, I bought the caramelized walnuts, which made it even better.

My husband was skeptical at "fruit in a salad" but he ate a huge portion.  In the end, we both pronounced it fantastic! I used glazed walnuts (but reduced the amount to 1/2 a cup), green apples, and mixed spring greens with baby arugula. I added 1 teaspoon of gorgonzola cheese to each individual salad.  I made the Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing (from this site) and it was a fantastic combination.  Due to the comments from other reviewers, we left the dressing on the side, and were both able to take the leftovers for lunch the next day.   Mmmm.

This was great.  I also added some red onions and used Romaine lettuce and spinach instead of prepackaged salad.  I served it with a raspberry vinigarette.  I'll definitely make it again!

Excellent!  I used all spinach and omitted the green onion and served the dressing on the side.  Many guests didn't need the dressing at all!

I took this salad to Thanksgiving dinner.  I thought that it was really good, but nobody else was all that excited about it.  I used Ken's steakhouse rasberry walnut vinaigrette.  It will be good with some leftover turkey mixed in!  Next time I will make it for a more adventerous crowd!

Was surprisingly delicious. :) I did change the porportions since it makes so much, & I would and will be chunking the apple from now on. The slices of apple are just a tad to fork-awkward and would serve better as a garnish/finish, leaving the bulk of the apple chunked.

We loved this salad.  I made 1/2 the recipe since there are only 2 of us.  I also added some feta cheese which is a great addition if you have it available.  I'd like to make a plug for using Annie's Naturals Lite Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing.  Delicious flavor and low fat.

I love this recipe!!  I've made it several times now, but I add about 1/2 cup of blue cheese to it.  The combination is wonderful!!!
