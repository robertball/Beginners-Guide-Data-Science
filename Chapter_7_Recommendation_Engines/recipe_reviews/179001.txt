I've been making this for years and never knew it was a Campbell's recipe. Just found it! I always use elbows instead of shells. It's quck, easy and we think, delicious! This can easily be doubled! We also serve it with sour cream and grated cheddar. A great weeknight meal!

Good, easy recipe. I boiled the noodles in a separate pot in water instead of the broth. As suggested I browned the beef with some onion, garlic and taco seasoning. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and more pasta. After draining the grease I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chilies, 2 cans of the cheese soup and the cooked pasta. The chilies gave it a bit of a kick, I made add one more can next time.

My friend made this one day during our girls weekend and it was great comfort food!  The trick is to use HOT salsa.  Great served with applesauce!  We ate it up!

Pretty bland as written. I added a couple of cloves of garlic, a small onion, and some cumin while the beef was cooking (taco seasoning would probably go well). I also threw in some frozen corn at the end (heating the cheese soup). It could have used another can of cheese soup, but I didn't have any on hand. I topped it with sour cream and cheese.

Really good & quick. The only change I made was to season the beef with an envelope of taco seasoning while browning. Also, I use spicier salsa than I normally eat for more flavor.

I made some changes based on other reviews including grilling some garlic with the ground beef, cooking the beef with taco seasoning but instead of increasing the amount of soup I added shredded cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  I don't know how it turns out when made as directed but it was delicious with the revisions - thanks to the suggestions in other reviews!!!

ok so this recipe was hit with my husband, i never gage it by my kids because it is always dependent upon their mood.  Anyway,  I didn't have the campbell's soup so i used a basic white sauce and added cheddar cheese to it.  I just boiled the noodles as normal (no chicken broth)  I added the ground beef and salsa to the cheese sauce.  Oh and i added taco seasoning to the meat.  All my kids did eat it and my husband ate it for lunch over the next 2 days.  I will be making this again. I only gave it four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written.

Easy and tasty. Slightly different b/c of what i had on hand: ground turkey, gemelli noodles, and broccoli cheese soup. I browned the turkey w/ garlic and onion, otherwise i used the same proportions for the rest of the ingredients. The whole family loved it.

It was edible, but really not that great. It was like a spicy hamburger helper but at twice the cost. I had to add 2 cans of cheese soup because it was bland otherwise and the only way it tasted even half decent was with a ton of salt on it. Not something I'd ever make again.

I used 1/2 lb cooked macaroni.  This only took a few minutes to make.  I used an extra half cup of salsa to give it more flavor.

Was pretty good-not gourmet quality. Basically it was a quick mac and cheese recipe-quicker than cutting up all the cheese!

I did not care for this recipe. The whole thing was pretty bland, I added some garlic salt to give it more flavor, but I will definitely delete this one from my recipe box.

Love this recipe and have been making it for years.  However I have made a few changes to the recipe.  I use ground turkey instead of beef, 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the broth / water, elbow macaroni works best and 1 jar of mild salsa instead of 1 cup.  The salsa really gives it the flavor. 

It's an awesome quick meal that the whole family loves.

My family loved this recipe!  I added about 1/3 of a bar of cream cheese and used Pace Medium Salsa.  I also used beef boullion cubes instead of the canned broth.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

3 1/2 stars. This is practically Chicken Etti. Non-fans of ground beef in my household, I skipped the beef part and went straight to boiling the pasta (macaroni and penne was what I had on hand) in beef broth. I did not have the cheese soup, and instead added cubed velveeta. For the salsa, I used a brand called Cascade Pride medium that contained beans and corn. My husband dug this meal. He said a dollop of sour cream would have rounded it out nicely.

I thought this was pretty good and easy.  I used Pace medium salsa and seasoned the meat/broth with garlic salt, but otherwise it was the same.  My husband thought it had too many noodles and was too hot.  If I was still feeding a houseful of kids, I would definitely make it again.

Was good, even the kids liked it but, it definitely needs another can of cheese soup or maybe some extra sharp cheddar!

I did not have salsa on hand, so I used about two tablespoons of taco sauce just to give it some more flavor.  I also added some cheddar cheese and mixed in some peas at the end.  Good, quick, one-dish meal.

I added taco seasoning, some garlic and a onion to my meat. Served it with sour cream. Simple, easy and good. Would make again. Great for a quick week night dinner.
