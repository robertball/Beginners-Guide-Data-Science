This was a super simple recipe.  I actually didn't have the same herbs on hand, so after I brushed them with butter and lemon, I seasoned them with pepper, sea salt, onion powder, and dill, and they came out terrific!  I also found that if you don't like them cooked medium (which we do) then you would want to cook it longer that 15 minutes.  I will definitely make this again!

This was an easy week-end meal. I made a few adjustments - I used 1 clove of fresh garlic, oil instead of the melted butter and added 1 tbsp of chopped fresh dill. I mixed all the ingredients together, and put them in a zip lock bag, adding the salmon steaks to marinade for 1 hour before grilling (instead of baking). I basted the steaks with the mixture once about half way through the cooking. Yummy.

Excellent flavor!  Next time, I think I'll try rubbing the spices on the fish, then sprinkle the onions on top.

This was amazing-I make it once a week for myself,I usually cover both sides of the salmon with the mixture instead of just sprinkling it on,then top it off with lemon slices to give it more flavor. I eat this with rice cooked with lemon rind and it is to die for.

Great salmon recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the onions.  I thought I had green onions at home but they had gone bad.  The meal was great without them!  We'll be making this one again.

I made this for my husband for valentines day. He loved it. I did it a little different. I use slice lemons and then i put the slice lemon with the salmon. I did the baking with indivials put each one in foil and put my seasonings and i had a sliced tomatoe and lemon with it. It turned out wonderful.

I rubbbed the seasonings in and then topped it with the green onions.  This was an EXCELLENT recipe and I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!  My husband absolutely loved it.  And, trust me, it's hard to get him to say, "Mmm, this is really good!"

Really was craving some sort of creamy dill sauce on our salmon last night but, made this instead.  Wow!  Really glad I did.  It was so moist and yummy.  Added 1 tsp of dill (only made enough salmon to feed 2) and did everything else exactly as in the recipe. Thanks for posting...it's a keeper!

Prepared this way, the salmon was delicately flavoured and very tasty. Like some of the other reviewers, I ended up cooking it slightly longer than the original recipe outlined.

This was ok.  Not much flavor - I think I will marinate longer next time.

I recently made this salmon and it was delicious. I followed other reviewers advice and marinade the salmon for one hour before cooking it. I tried it w/ dill as well and it too was great. I found that I needed to keep it in the oven for about 22 minutes and it was moist and flaky.

Have had your recipe in my files for quite awhile but only got to making it last weekend.   We thoroughly enjoyed it and my husband said it was even better than our normal  barbecued ones...so that is really good.    I am going to make it again tonight but will add some lemon zest besause we really like lots of lemon.  Thanks for a recipe that will also be used to company....it is simple and deightful

I thought this recipe could use a lot more oomph with the flavor.  Next time I might add some crushed red pepper or something spicy.

The salmon came out DELICIOUS! It came out very moist and flaky. The seasoning added a lot of flavor too. I chopped up half a yellow onion, mixed the onion with celery salt and lemon pepper. Then I sprinkled the onion on top of the fish. The fish came out with a nice "crunchy" topping but the onion was cooked long enough so it did not have an overpowering taste of rawness. VERY GOOD RECIPE!!

I have never made salmon before, let alone salmon steaks, however, my husband loves salmon. I made this dish yesterday and it was a huge hit. I served it with linguini fini in a butter garlic sauce and it was gone in half an hour!!! Thank you, this is truly a terrific recipe! Good job!
