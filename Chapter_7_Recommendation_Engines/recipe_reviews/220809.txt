I made these into full size cupcakes but instead of using canned frosting, I made a simple glaze with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe from this site. Soooo simple to use.. just dip the tops and let set in fridge! I didn't use the cherries, and the cream that I used for the center was a little different.. I infused my cream stuffed cupcake filling: (1/2 c solid vegetable shortening, 1 1/4 c powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3/4 marshmallow fluff, 3 to 4 tbsp milk) with some instant french vanilla pudding. Next time will add some more liquid to it or something cuz it was a little grainy from the instant pudding but everyone still raved about them!! BIG success!

First of all if you use the true Mini Muffin pans this recipe makes lots more than 24. Actually I got over 50 from it using my mini muffin pans. Now maybe it would make 24 regular size muffins?????
Also I would not add 2 cups of milk for the pudding to put inside the muffins. It was way too thin.Maybe use 1 1/2. The thing that I am a bit upset with is I had to make something for a funerl dinner and I am not sure these will turn out like they should. I still need to frost them.

These cupcakes were easy to make but hard to fill without a "tip". I ended uup doing it the old fashioned way, cutting the tops and filling. I also used a whipped (for 3 minutes) ganache and omitted the cherry. I didn't have heavy cream for the ganache but substitued 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cup of milk which I poured over 4oz of semi-sweet chocolate morsals. Whipping the ganache for 3 minutes gave it more of a thickness without having to spread. Great recipe. Tasty results!
