Easy and tasty! I needed a recipe to use up some canned peach pieces and came across this one. I am an intermediate baker and found this recipe to be easy to follow and the end result was great. I omitted the nuts since we didn't have them on hand. We also didn't have coarse sugar -w hich the entire family agreed would have been better than plain old granulated sugar we used on top.  We put butter and honey on them and everyone had seconds. I can see us playing around with the add ins - I'd love to try with raspberries or blueberries. This recipe will go into the recipe box!

The dough came out way too wet, more like a muffin batter.  Maybe it was my fault for using fresh peaches, but I needed to add almost 1 cup of additional flour to get this dough to come together so that I could pat it out and slice it.  They taste fine, but not peachy enough for me.  The texture is more like a muffin than a scone.

I’ve made these many times because in Ontario it’s peach season. I changed it a bit. 

I use 4 peaches. It makes just over a cup of peaches. I add a tbsp of vanilla and cinnamon. The original recipe lacked a bit of flavour for me but when I changed it like this it was delicious and very peachy! I also eliminated the pecans.

They don't really have the scone texture and aren't very peachy.
