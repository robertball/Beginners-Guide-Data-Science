Okay, so I posted this recipe but I wanted to let you all know that I added sauted mushrooms to the mix and it came out even better. Also for those of you wanting a sauce type of pasta dish this is not for you. It is very lite and any of the broth mixture gets sucked up into the pasta while you have it sit for 5 minutes. If it is too bland just add more galic powder and salt and pepper.

Seems like I'm doing these reviews every night lately!  I'm really enjoying cooking, thats for sure!  But what I did was... Chopped the asp. into 1 in. pieces and boiled it in my pasta water for a few while it came to a boil.  Then I drained it into a bowl so I was able to reserve the hot water; then added the pasta back to it.  Grilled my chicken breast seasoned w/ poultry seasoning, s&p. on my little indoor grill for a few,(I like the chix to have a little golden color) then cut it up & added it to evoo that had been sauteeing garlic and onion.  Added the chix, asp., sqz of lemon juice, chopped a few roasted red peppers (out of a jar, "RAO'S" brand.. yum)  1/2 of a chopped tomato, 1/4 cup of chix broth, about 1/4 cup of cream cheese and a spash of milk & parm chz.  That really helped make it creamier, although there still wasnt too much sauce, but thats fine w/ me. Makes it feel "lighter"!  Thats about it, I snuck in a few red pepper flakes & tossed it all w/ the pasta!  Perfect!  My kids gobbled it down w/out complaint!  Although they are pretty good eaters.  Their favorite food is calamari, and they love the tenacles! My friends are soo jealous of how my kids eat!  Guess I'm doing something right!  Enjoy!   Laura from AZ

Yeah! A meal that both the parents and the kids (ages 3 & 5) will eat! I added a can (drained)artichoke hearts when the asparagus was steaming. I didn't have any chicken broth so I threw in a cube of chicken bouillon to 1.5 cups of water. When the pasta is mixed in the penne drank up all of the broth - so there was really no sauce. I offered crushed red peppers on the side for the adults and plenty of parmesan for the kiddos! And everyone was happy!

THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER!!!  I loved this dish.  I did alter it ( I am sure it great the way it was posted, but I wanted something creamier). After I cooked the chicken ( I marinated it in italian dressing before cooking) I cooked the asparagus in 1 c broth, minced garlic, salt and pepper but only for like 3 minutes because I wanted it pretty crispy.  Then I sprained out the asparagus, leaving broth in the sauce pan and added 3 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and about 1/4 cup milk.  I whisked this until smooth then added the chicken and asparagus then coated it.  Then I added the pasta and topped with more parmesan cheese.  I seriously had 3 helpings of it and want to eat more.  I am going to try it the original way next time, but for a wintery comfort food it was AMAZING (if I do say so myself)!

Not bad!  I used whole wheat pasta and also added some broccoli, some red peppers and the mushrooms.  Definitely needs 3-4 cloves of fresh sauteed garlic (not just powder.)

This pasta recipe is simply wonderful. I made only a few changes, I used Mrs Dash seasoning on the chicken and added two tablespoons of butter to the finished asparagus and chicken. I highly recommend this simple and elegant dish.

This was a nice change from all the creamy pasta dishes.  I did use 3 chicken breast and only 12 oz penne pasta.  It turned out perfect for a quick summertime meal that doesn't make you feel like you packed on 10 lbs over dinner.:) Thanks Laurel B!

With some modifications, this was exactly the dish my tastebuds were waiting for.  I read through many reviews before deciding on my cooking game plan.  I wasn't going for "light", I was going for delicious.  I added fresh broccoli in addition to the asparagus (yay veggies!).  Instead of cubing the chicken I sliced the breasts in half so they'd be thin.  I sauteed the salted and peppered chicken with onion and plenty of freshly minced garlic cloves in olive oil.  I also used a lot more chicken broth (didn't use low sodium)- at least a cup.  I also took the plunge and added Philadelphia cream cheese (quite a bit).  Next time I will add even more broth and cream cheese so it has more sauce.  One reviewer recommended added a splash of milk as well and I think I will try that next time.  The creamy sauce is great, and I love having tons of asparagus and broccoli in with the chicken and pasta.  This also froze and reheated well.  It's good stuff, enjoy!

A little bland.  I added sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts when I cooked the chicken to zest it up.  Also added a bit of italian seasoning to the chicken broth when I steamed the asparagus.  Next time I may make it with a bit more of a cream sauce at the end.

This was tasty.  I sauteed onions and garlic first and then added the chicken for more flavor.  And I used frozen broccoli florets instead of asparagus since I didn't have any fresh veggies.  My kids put mozzarella cheese on top and everybody loved it!

Easy and simple recipe with delicious results. I've never included asperagus with pasta before so this was a first and I was pleasantly suprised. We used whole-wheat pasta and followed the rest of the directions as written. It came out great.

This was ok. The consistancy was a little weird and the chicken didn't really have a good flavor. It needed to be marinated in something a head of time that would have comlimented the asparagus. I haven't thought of anything yet.... maybe when I do I will try it again.

This was delicious! I sautéed fresh mushrooms along with the garlic, and then tossed in a bit of feta cheese along with the parmesan. Both hubby and I loved the flavor! I think this dish would do well with shrimp in place of chicken for a change too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was Delicious!!!! I didn't give five starts only because made a few changes. I used Cream of Chicken because I didn't have broth. I used chicken tenderloins since they cook faster. I added salt and pepper, wrapped them in foil (to keep the steam in) and ran them in the oven.  Steamed the asparagus as suggested and combined all ingredients. This is my first review.  I had to share how much I enjoyed this meal.  Thanks Laurel B.

I really liked how light this dish was...I did make a few changes after reading other reviews - added about a TBS of Italian seasoning to the chicken. After removing the chicken from pan I sauteed some mushrooms & onions & added 2 additional garlic cloves in same pan, added an extra 1/4 cup chicken broth (as others suggested) plus about 1/3 cup white wine to the mushrooms & onions...let this reduce for about 5 min before adding the asparagus.  I liked the idea of letting the pasta sit for about 5 min after adding everything - really allowed the flavor to soak into the pasta. Thanks for the great recipe...my husband loved it & the leftovers were wonderful - so be sure to make extra!

I have prepared this several times.  We thought it was a little bland at first but added the juice of 1/2 lemon which was all it needed.  DELICIOUS!!!

Following some of the reviews, I added more garlic, salt and pepper.  In addition, I added about 4 TB. of lite Italian dressing towards the end of the stovetop cooking.  This added a lot of flavor.  The kids put some mozzarella cheese on theirs, and we all enjoyed it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an absolutely good enough recipe.  One of a myriad of these types of pasta dishes available.  I always mess with them a little.  I used more chicken to up the protein ratio with minimal impact on the fat amount, sauteed a mix or Portabella and Shitake mushrooms, onion, and extra garlic with the asparagus BEFORE adding the broth (2/3 can low sodium). As pointed out by author and others...this is a "lite" recipe. Since it's not "saucy", perhaps Penne isn't the best pasta for it?  BTW, this is the REAL Casey. AR has me referring to a husband (I'm a single guy) and no picture...not my review, this is.

Loved this, made the chicken ahead of time to save time.  Used bowtie pasta.  The oldest child protested upon seeing it, tasted it and ended up asking for seconds.  Success!

This was really quite good. Light and flavorful. I did alter slightly based on other reviews, I felt it needed a bit more excitement. I sautéed 3 garlic cloves instead of 1, half a white onion, and half a red bell pepper for color. Added this sauteed mixture back in at time of adding asparagus. I also used about 3/4 C of the chicken broth and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Delish! My boyfriend LOVED it!

I loved this recipe!  I made a few minor changes.  I added sun dried tomatoes which I blanched when boiling the noodles (just threw them in the water for the last five min or so).  I then sliced them and sauteed them with the chicken.  We love garlic, so I used all fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and increased it quite a bit.  I did three cloves with the chicken and two more cloves with the asparagus.  I also threw in some mushrooms with the chicken and sauteed them for the last two minutes or so.  I decreased the oil to drizzling one tablespoon instead of two at the end, and it was still great. I was very happy with this recipe and it will definately make a regular appearance at our table.  For any of you counting Weight Watcher points, the recipe made the way I made it is 6 points per cup.

One of our favorites with these revisions.  Omit nearly all of oil;just spray with Pam, cook chicken,set aside.  Stir-fry asparaqus with diced red bell pepper, few green onions and garlic til crisp tender.  Mix veggies with chicken,add a small amount of the broth, toss with refrigerated fettichini that has been cooked al'dente.  I also use 2-4-tbs. of lite Italian dressing and we like the reduced fat mozzeralla cheese.....good spring time recipe.

Maybe it's our non stick pan but cooking the chicken took a lot longer then we expected.

This version is good, but I like to add an additional 1/4 C. of olive oil to the pan after sauteing the chicken, then add 1/4 C. of flour. Cook one minute, then prepare as usual, adding an additional 2 C. of stock. This makes a nice creamy sauce, otherwise it's very dry. I also add 2 t. of dried marjoram for great flavor.

It was so good!  My picky eater teenage daughter said that this is a definite make again dish!  Mine did not come out dry.  If it was dry you could always add more broth or olive oil.  I used boneless, skinless thighs, I think they are juicier than breasts and my family prefers dark meat.  Only thing I did different was I cut up the chicken ahead of time and seasoned it with the salt, pepper and garlic powder before cooking it instead of seasoning it while cooking.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!  Thanks for posting Laurel!

I used shallot and garlic and it was fast, easy, and "yummy-ier" I also used thigh meat as well- added a depth of flavour.

Amazing recipe.  This is healthy and delicious.  My family loved it from my 5 year old to my very picky husband.  Plan on having no left overs.  By far one of my most loved and used recipes I have found.

Loved this recipe. Was slightly worried when making this because I've never made a "sauceless" pasta before but turned out super well.

Was a good dish, added fresh mushrooms and diced tomatoes to it and it came out wonderfully. Might end up doubling the tomatoes next time though since we liked the taste combination so much.

This turned out to be very disappointing.  I used the exact ingredients listed and followed all directions carefully. My plate looked exactly like the one in the picture!  However, the result was a flavorless, dry pasta dish.  Perhaps a light cream or broth sauce would help it.  It was missing the taste of herbs and spices.

My family loves this recipe!  I have made it with penne and angel hair pasta, both have turned out well.  The only thing I do different is use a good white wine instead of chicken broth, add some crushed red pepper for spice, and double the cheese using freshly grated.  Be generous with the garlic and you will not have a bland dish!  Thank you Laurel for a delish dish that is easy and quick to fix for the work week!

Delicious!  I made this recipe just as written other than adding 1 teaspoon of thyme and thickening the sauce a little with a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with water.  The whole family loved it!

This is a great recipe, although I did dock it up a little bit. I Added baby bella mushroom, extra garlic, and a light Alfredo sauce. Only because with the original recipe, the noodles tend to suck up all the liquid that was added. It turned out delicious!

This dish is pretty good for a light supper.  Adding mushrooms or broccoli helps to make it more interesting, but it needs more of a sauce to really add more flavor.

The worse thing I can say about this is that there isn't any quanity, regarding how much, salt, pepper & garlic powder.  The best thing I have to say is thank goodness I had a left over pork chop from last night.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated but I found it dry and it tasted like 4 ingredients were just dumped together (chicken, asparagus, pasta, and Parmesan cheese) without any sort of sauce or complimenting flavors.  I love cooking and experimenting, this was a fail.  I'd save the ingredients for a better recipe!

This was really good.  I added a cup of onion that I had already had chopped in the fridge before I cooked the chicken. Seasoned it with Paula Deans House Seasoning, then just added everything else. Oh I did add 3 ladles of the pasta water, a tablespoon of chicken bouillon then finished with the cheese and a couple of splashes of cream.  Yummy!  Sorry didn't mean to change it so drastically.

A pretty basic OO/garlic/parm pasta recipe. Even with adding more veggies (red onion, brocolli,  & canned diced tomatoes), more fresh garlic, red pepper flakes and more parmesan, it needed more flavor.

I had some asparagus that needed to be used, so I thought I would try this recipe. I used seasoned salt and added mushrooms. I, also, used whole wheat penne. It was great! I can't wait until I get more asparagus at the farmer's market to make this again. I may try adding spinach and peas next time.

Like the previous reviewers stated, this is a very light recipe.  But I also live in AZ and recipies like this a perfect in the summer when you want a meal but it's too hot to eat something really heavy.  I also made a couple of modifications.  I used a 1 1/4 cup of chicken broth and I also tossed in half a bag of sundried tomatoes and let those simmer with the asparagus and it gave the dish a very subtle tomoato flavor.  My 2.5 year old liked this dish (although he could have done without the asparagus).  Nonetheless, I this recipie is a keeper.

Delicious and versatile!  I usually make a recipe shortly after it’s saved to the recipe box but this one went missing for a couple of years. Finally got around to making it and it was a terrific meal.  The leftovers are equally as good. Only changes were I upped the chicken stock to one cup and added 4 oz. of fresh chopped button mushrooms in step 3.  I seasoned the dish with Penzy’s ® Mural of Flavor seasoning. Blend includes shallots, onion, garlic, lemon peel, citric acid, chives and orange peel.

I have made this twice, the first time I made it as directed.  The second time I switched the garlic powder for garlic salt instead.  I used three cloves of garlic, I also used linguini the second time only because thats what I had in the house at the time.  I liked it much better the second time.

I made this for dinner tonight and my girlfriend and I both loved it.
I did make a few changes, only for personal taste. 
Used vegetable pasta, omitted garlic powder for more fresh garlic, and added some cayenne for a little kick.
Will be making this recipe again.

Very good, simple recipe. I used shrimp instead of chicken. I also added mushrooms and onions in with the shrimp, and added a splash more broth in with the asparagus. I added some Old Bay seasoning for extra flavor. Will be making again.

Probably could be a 4 with a few tweaks to the recipe.  It was a little dry for me so I will try adding a little sherry and may some cream cheese to sauce it up a little next time.

This is OK as a base recipe, I guess, but as one reviewer noted if prepared as presented the dish is a lesson in blandness!  I know the goal is to create a light, fresh, spring-friendly dish, but garlic powder is the only real flavor and everything feels terribly uninspired.

I have since made this two separate ways that I thought really improved the dish dramatically. 

Modified Recipe 1: marinate the chicken in white wine (dry and citrus-y is best) and chicken broth, with copious amounts of minced fresh garlic (to replace all of the garlic powder) and pepper to taste.  You need only marinate for ~30 minutes.  Then, prep as instructed; in this case, I used the marinade to steam the asparagus with delicious results, but fresh chicken broth would also be good if you want to minimize the wine flavor. After combining the chicken and asparagus in the skillet, I added a tablespoon of butter and fresh thyme.  The butter helped to add a bit more substance to the sauce while keeping it light, as well as extracting the flavor from the thyme to add an extra dimension.  Also, I added a few halved cherry tomatoes and just heated them through before serving; added some much-needed color and a pleasant alternate texture.

The second way I made it, I didn't have wine on hand, so I prepared as in the original recipe, except I added dried dill and a couple of tsps of lemon juice to the asparagus as it cooked.  The lemon and dill make the dish taste really bright! I also added the tbsp butter.

I've made this twice and like it enough to make again.  But it is a little on the bland side and I will add to it next time, probably some artichokes and more Parmesan cheese.

Made this for dinner tonight.  We liked it a lot, including our two very finicky granddaughters.  I used broccoli instead of asparagus and added some red and green peppper for color and added flavor.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for sharing, Laurel B!

Amazing ! Nice and light, and fresh ! I love the taste of this recipe !! Definitely will make it again :) 

I did add plenty of pepper and garlic powder for taste, soo yummy! I added just a few pinches of salt, not too much. As well only 1 tablespoon of oil at the end of the recipe. YUM!

This was super easy and a great dinner. I have been suffereing from gastritis which is very painful and leaves me with a very hard diet. I can't eat a lot of things. This recipe was perfect. It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor but it has the natural flavors of the pasta, chicken and asparagus. I added mushrooms and a little more chicken broth. I just loved it and the husband ate it to. Thank you!!!

Light and delicious!  Tweaked the recipe by adding 4 cups of broth and 1/4 cup cream cheese to add more sauce (could have been thickened up a bit more, but I didn't want to ruin it by  experimenting more), as well as throwing in mushrooms and bacon.   We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe for dinner.

Tasty!!! I made this tonight for the family. Everyone loved it. Yes it doesn't have much sauce but it does have tons of flavor. I added mushrooms because I had some that needed to be used and four cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. Easy and wonderful and light!

This is a fast, tasty pasta dish perfect for spring when you want lighter meals.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added a bit more chicken broth.  I also added extra herbs/spices (basil and oregeno, but I suspect that tarragon would be good too) and a few squeezes of lemon juice which complimented the asparagus very well.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

I really enjoyed this.  I, too, made a change or two as I went along.  I broke my salt shaker and salt was everywhere! So I had no choice but to continue on without salt.  After reading the reviews and hearing that it was somewhat bland, I decided to try to compensate that and the lack of salt by using seasoned salt.  I also increased the broth to about 3/4 C knowing that the noodles would be soaking up most of what I started with.  The only other changes I made was using slightly less penne and I used about a cup of cheese and added it into the pan with the mixture and then sprinkled some on top after serving.  My produce department did not have thin asparagus so I had to use thick stalks. I def think the thin would have gone smoother... had to let it steam a lot longer to get it softened up enough.  Definitely a recipe you can play with a bit and takes no time at all once you've done it.

Very tasty! I didn't have any chicken, so i used smoked salmon instead. I also added red and green peppers and a tsp. of red pepper flakes for a kick:). This only took me 20 mins. from start to finish...definitely will make this over and over again!

I made this just like it calls, but I added broccoli and I used the veggie pasta to get some more veggies in here (even if only a little bit), and I thought it was great! It was filling, and yet was light. I would recommend making this if you get a chance.

This is a great recipe.  If you love to cook, then you are creative in your own way and each recipe is a suggestion on which you can create your own taste.  I love that this recipe is light and simple.   If you feel like you want to create something from it, you can add lemon juice, zest and cream, or red pepper flakes, or Cajun seasoning and crawfish (minus the chicken), or just veggies.  Good job Laurel!

This was wonderful. I made this recipe last week for me and a friend and we both loved it. This was a perfect pasta dish for me. It was a light dish but it definitely fills you up without making you feel like you gained 20 pounds. I used Minced Garlic from a jar since I had it on hand and I also seasoned the chicken breast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some Italian seasoning before hand and then cut it up instead of adding the seasonings while the chicken cooked. I served it with some freshly made garlic bread and it really hit the spot. I will be making this again.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. It was amazing! This is a light clean meal. Perfect.  Second time I had some other veggies that I needed to use up. The spinach and mushrooms complemented the dish nicely and will be adding them regularly. Third time I got all fancy-schmancy and added a little bit of orange zest and cranberries. Yum! Will try the cream cheese next time

Great dish!  After reading the reviews I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for about an hour, I added sautéed red pepper & a little diced onion & I increased the garlic.  Superb!  The whole family loved it.

We really, really loved this! It was light and flavorful. I read the review from the poster of this recipe (Laurel B) and added mushrooms to the mix.  I also had read that some felt it was bland. I added some lemon/pepper seasoning and plenty of extra garlic.  Hubby took one look at it and seemed disappointed - he was expecting a creamy pasta meal.  But, after only one bite he changed his tune and asked if we could have the leftovers for dinner the next night!

This is a delicious recipe, we have made it many time. My 10 year old son absolutely loves it and wants it all the time. Tastes great cold, the asparagus flavor is much stronger. For leftovers we had to add more olive oil.

Great basic recipe.  I would advise to season the chicken to the upmost and the asparagus as well.  I added in some crushed red pepper for a little kick.  After I have mixed everything together I had a little bit of sauce and the consistency was watery.  Solution (some of which I borrow from another user but the rest I made my own): 1/4 cup of Chicken broth, 1/4 cup of cream cheese, and about a tablespoon of chicken gravy mix, salt, pepper, and garlic pepper over medium heat on the skillet. I stirred until it was blended and creamy.  I poured the cream sauce over the mixture and mixed it in and it came out great. Its not a lot of sauce but its just enough to keep the flavor in.  Oh and I also added in about a half cup of Parmesan for more cheesiness.

I was surprised how much I liked this.  As others pointed out this is not a saucy dish.  Almost all of the liquid is absorbed in the pasta.  But that just makes it light and refreshing.

?????????? It’s  delicious!! It’s perfectly light and flavorful as it is. Sauce would ruin it. I probably used more garlic and parmesan for personal preference, but other than that I wouldn’t change a thing. ????????

I made it just as the author wrote it.  My six year old and I both enjoyed it.  I wish I had made more to freeze for a quick meal on a busy night! You can add any veggies you want or tweak it to be a cream sauce, but it's wonderful flavorful, light, dish just the way it is written. Also it's a great vehicle for adding any veggies you want into your kid's diet, and not all the calories or fat from a cream sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'm putting it in my permanent recipe box!

Yummy recipe! I am not sure how some people are rating this bland. It is a nice melody of ingredients. It is not supposed to be a heavy, spicy, cream laden casserole. Nice basic recipe.  Good hot or cold. Fantastic as is or tweak it up.

This was a really good dish! I used chicken tenders to make it easier and also added mushrooms to the mix. I used whole wheat penne pasta. Great, healthy meal! I bought the sargento parmesan cheese, and it is well worth it, tastes much better than the kraft powdered parmesan in the green can. Will make again and again! I may add sun dried tomatoes next time as well.

I loved it.  Also added mushrooms, green onions and lots more garlic (personal preference).  I get tired of sauces sometimes so this was a wonderful change.  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks Laurel!

This is a wonderful recipe! I put in 4 chicken breasts seasoned with parsley, oregano, sage, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also increased the amount of chicken broth to roughly a cup and a half and it turned out great! I will definetly be making this all summer long since its so light and the kids loved it!!

This was tasty, but definitely on the lighter side.  I added mucho extra garlic, olive oil, and chicken broth to boost the flavor, but we did like it and I would make it again.

I thought this dish was exceptional. It came together quickly, the ingredients are simple, and it was delicious. I used shells (thought I had a box of penne and discovered too late I did not) and I thought it grabbed up the sauce nicely. I used a bit more chicken broth (about a cup for one chicken breast) and let it reduce down a bit... when I added the cheese it thickened up. I also followed one reviewers suggestion and added mushrooms. I will be making this again!

Overall a very good and flavorful dish, I made this for two people so I only used 4oz of pasta, 2 chicken breast cutlets and still used a whole bundle of asparagus and 1/2 cup of chicken broth to give it a little more "sauce" rather then reducing the "sauce". Even with the reduced pasta most of the sauce was still absorbed so to give it more flavor I added sun dried tomatoes and it added a depth of flavor that would have been missing otherwise.

This dish was simple and easy to make.  The only thing missing was that I think it could have used a little more chicken broth.  It was slightly dry with not a lot of flavor.  Overall a good dish.

This was a pretty good recipe. It had a great flavor...my only problem was the pasta. There was way to much of it. I would suggest using about half the amount of pasta to anyone thinking of making this. Thanks for sharing!

WE have grown to LOVE this dish! My daughter asked for it almost every week while she was back home with us over the last 6 months. I do triple the garlic, and go heavy on seasoning the chicken. For the best flavor, make sure your oil is ultra-hot... you want those chicken pieces golden brown, not steamed! I also prefer this with a bit more chicken broth... when you add the parmesan cheese, it tends to soak up alot of the broth. I have taken to adding a good cup or so.  Haven't tried it with the submitter's suggested mushrooms yet, as DD ran from the room in horror at the mere thought... but will try that addition next time. Thank you, Laurel for this light,healthy, tasty and jammin' dish we've all fallen in love with!

I used a 20 oz. can of chicken and also added in some peas since I knew my 2 year old wouldn't eat the asparagus -- both were great! I also had to add an extra half cup of broth and about a quarter cup of milk in order to have remotely enough sauce to even cover all that pasta. I too added extra garlic (used jarred minced garlic), pepper, and seasoned salt. In the end I mixed about 1/4 cup of parmesan, as the recipe calls for, in the entire dish, but also added a romano/parmesan blend on top of each individual serving. Yum!

I made this for 4 and we loved it!  When I cooked the chicken I just added garlic salt and pepper and kept adding it until it tasted good enough to eat by itself.  It helps that I really like chicken cooked that way to begin with. I also added fresh mushrooms and some artichoke hearts to the asparagus which worked out really well.  This is a keeper!

This fits the bill for a tasty, healthy, easy recipe!  I only give it four stars because there are twice as many noodles as are necessary.  My family enjoyed this very much!  and....I guess we're having penne with ragu tomorrow, lol!

Was very healthy tasting. I would not use as much pasta , and I used frozen asparagus spears, cutting in 1/3 were better also. I will make again with the changes I made to it.

This is a good basic recipe but it needs more seasoning. I browned the chicken with EVOO that had garlic and herbs in it. I also used several teaspoons minced garlic. I cooked the chicken about halfway and then added the broth and other ingrediants instead of taking the chicken out. I also used about 1 cup of chicken broth instead and added basil and more cheese.

This has become one of my all time favorite recipes! I love the simple flavors of this dish and the leftovers are delish. I use 3 chicken breasts, 12 oz of pasta and I replace a little of the olive oil with butter. It kind of reminds me of a favorite side dish I make of fettucini, butter, garlic, olive oil, and healthy dose of parmesan. I think its best in the spring with asparagus at it's peak and with quality cheese and olive oil.

Loved this!  A GREAT change of pace from heavy pasta dishes.  The pasta does suck up the broth, so you might want to add a bit more just before serving if you don't like dry pasta.  Will make this again for sure!  My daughter wants me to try it next time with broccoli instead of asparagus...sound like a plan to me!

Very good, light meal.  I added just a bit more chicken broth and probably twice the parm cheese.  Don't skimp on the garlic this really gives the dish a nice flavor.

Made this to a T and it was just OK. Bland. This is a dry pasta dish and not for people who like a little sauce.  It needs to be eaten immediately, for it gets drier as it sits.  Not good for company.

Awesome!!!!!!!! Light and very tasty. Two year old LOVED it and picky hubby had seconds. I followed the recipe exactly (or so I thought) my asparagus turned out a little more sauteed than steamed but tasted wonderful.

This was quite good.  It was very light with a pleasant, mild flavor.  I added diced tomatoes.

Yummmmmmyyyyyyyy!
We all love it! We are all pasta lovers, and this was a great dress up for us, not to busy, and just right!
Quick and easy! I used pre-cooked seasoned chicken.

As a new chef and college student, I was looking for a quick, easy, healthy, and inexpensive recipe. This was perfect! I left the cheese out because I'm not a big cheese fan, and used half the amount of oil and 1.5 times the amount of chicken stock to make the "sauce" (with generous amounts of garlic powder and pepper) and it was very good. Thank you for helping this budding chef build her recipe book!

I loved this recipe but of course I made little changes. I took bits and pieces from others. I did not use the garlic powder and opted for fresh garlic. A lot of fresh garlic. I cooked a couple cloves with the chicken with half an onion. I also added a couple cloves when cooking the asparagus and used a whole cup of broth. I added artichoke hearts. Before mixing the cooked pasta in with the asparagus I did what others did and mixed a block of cream cheese and a little heavy cream to the asparagus mixture to make a nice cream sauce. Just a little of the heavy cream though. Fresh parm and basil on top and good to go!!

My family devoured every bite! Will definitely be making it again. Added quite a bit more seasoning to the dish and made sure both the pasta and asparagus were cooked al dente. I doubled the recipe for hungry teens!

Very tasty,  I followed the recipe, except  I cut it in half for only 4 of us.  I used the same 1/2 cup of chicken stock just halved the pasta amount.  I would make this again.

This recipe was okay as a dinner. The flavor was very subtle. I’m am going to use the leftovers for a pasta salad by adding some wine vinegar, lemon juice and more olive oil. Hopefully,  this will add the robust flavor my family was looking for.

Very easy meal to make.  I did use broccoli instead of asparagus because that’s what I had on hand.  Also added a little cream cheese for a little creamier texture.  My picky husband loved it.  Made enough leftovers for the next night.  Very good meal.  Will definitely make this again!  Thank you!

Loved it, but I added chopped baby bella mushrooms, used 6 cloves of garlic, no garlic powder, and doubled the amount of chicken broth.  Also doubled the amount of olive oil and  a little more cheese and more chicken. Delicious, easy and it all disappeared.  I was hoping for leftovers.

Great recipe! While cooking asparagus, I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and sun dried tomatoes that had basil seasoning. I also used Italian seasoning to the chicken when I prepared it. In hind sight, I wish I would have chopped asparagus ahead of time because I ended up chopping them after they cooked. Also, I wouldn't use all penne, maybe half because we had a lot leftover.

It is a great everyday recipe. Very easy to make and quite tasty. I didnt add the parmesan cheese because I am on a diet that prohibits consumption of meat combined with dairy products (yes I am allowed to eat carbs. In fact I must eat a cup of carbs when lunching).I cut down the ammount of oil as well. I just roasted the chicken in a non-stick pan that was lightly brushed with olive oil. I did add mushrooms though and it made it taste wonderful. I will be making this one again!

Loved the basic recipe but wanted to "winterize" it and needed to use up some leftover vegetables so I made this my starting point.  Added thinly sliced carrots, onions, baby portobellos, fresh spinach and green beans.  Because my family likes a sauce, I used 3 ladles of the pasta water and a tub of Knorr low sodium chicken stock.  I removed the chicken and veggies and tossed them with the cooked rigatoni.  I sprinkled in a tablespoon of flour  to the stock and reduced to a thin sauce.  Mixed the whole dish up, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with home made garlic bread. My picky son asked to have this every day!  Total comfort food on a chilly day!

I made a few substitutions because of what I had on hand.  I found I was out of chicken broth so I substituted some herbed olive oil and some white wine to steam the asparagus in.  I used pre-grilled herbed chicken because I was in a hurry.  I also added mushrooms, as another reviewer suggested, sauteed with the garlic in butter.  It was delicious!

Very light dish - will make again, but will use more garlic to bring up the flavor profile a bit.  Also, need to use a bit more cheese than called for so the flavor is not lost.

Looking for a low fat meal. This was very good I used rotisserie chicken I think that added a lot of flavor to the meal. Over all very good ! Will be making this again.

Very good, followed the recipe almost exactly as posted and thought it was amazing. Not sure why some said the chicken had no flavor, I thought it was very flavorful but I did add quite a bit of garlic salt to it.

followed recipe exactly and it was ok.  there wasn't a whole lot of flavor and the chicken got dry during cooking.  the asparagus was very tender. i would use more broth next time and cook the chicken half way through then add in the veggies.  the broth would help keep the chicken moist.

This has become a favorite "pasta-night" dinner.  During the summer it is light and yummy!!  I added a tad bit more salt & pepper for flavor, but my daughters love this and its a good way to get protein and a veggie in them!!

This is the second attempt at this recipe and I think I got it right this time. (Last time I didn't have all the right ingredients and was too lazy to go to the store.) This time I got it right and we loved it. Basically I made it just like the instructions say except I also added one sliced red bell pepper, lots more garlic, one large white onion, and a basket of sliced brown mushrooms. I used freshly grated parmesan and romano cheese instead of the dry stuff and substituted the salt for seasoned salt and cayenne pepper. In the end I also added some cornstarch and water to the broth/oil mixture to give it a yummy gravy-like consistency. Fantastic. I will make this again.

Loved it!  Added 1 cup of  heavy cream, and 1/2 cup of Parmesan Cheese to the final skillet to give it the creamy texture I wanted.  Also added sautéed mushrooms, onions, and used a cup and a half of the broth.  Came out perfect!

An excellent dish.  I added Artichoke Hearts, Cherry Tomatoes, Baby Bella Mushrooms, Non-Pareil Capers, basil, and oregano.  I marinated my chicken in Italian dressing before sauteing it.  I served it on a bed of Aji Amarillo sauce.

Added sun dried tomatoes and extra chicken broth to steam the asparagus. Quick, light, and tasty on a busy week night. Perfect with a fresh garden salad. Planning to experiment with a little Chardonnay in the "steaming liquid" next time.

Yummy and easy! My 11 year old daughter made this with only a little help sautéing chicken. We used spinach instead of asparagus because that is what we had, but it still turned out to be a delicious meal! Great easy staple!

Not too bad, but as written would be bland, you really need to season your chicken! I always use a Mrs. Dash blend on mine. With that, pretty good.

We liked this because it was light.  The only thing I added was a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper when I mixed the chicken and asparagus.

We totally loved this!  Of course, I made some slight changes (as I always do;)) but it was great!  I added fresh mush half way thru the asparagus, used fresh garlic for everything, and much more;)  I also added about half a cup of chopped onion half way thru frying the chicken and didn't put it on a paper towel to savor more of the flavor:)  My kids and fiancé really enjoyed it, minus the asparagus..lol.  But that's okay!  More for me;)

OMG, this was amazing! I actually forgot to add the chicken broth, and grilled the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic salt outside on the grill. I used a little less olive oil this way, and no broth. It was AMAZING. I did add mushrooms to the asparagus as it was cooking. My next experiment will be to try it with broccoli.

This can really come together quickly and simply. I cook the asparagus with the pasta for the last 5 minutes to save a step and mess. I left out the chicken once and it was still delicious.

This is a solid base recipe, from which opportunities abound! I jazzed this up by cubing my chicken breast tenderloins and marinating them in house italian dressing in the fridge while I chopped 2 cloves of garlic (I LOVE garlic) and the asparagus. I followed the steps, but threw in a big splash of balsamic vinegar with the full can (10.5oz) of low-sodium chix broth to steam the asparagus. ALSO, because I love fresh garlic oh-so-much, I didn't chop all of the bulbs and actually threw a few un-sliced bulbs in with the asparagus. So delicious. I love that it yields so much food too! 

The photo that was added today in the pics above is my final product. The balsamic vinegar really added a nice kick.

Just finished eating this for dinner. Delicious!  The reviews had me a little concerned it might be bland so I added lots of fresh garlic (skipped garlic powder entirely), some poultry seasoning, a pinch of red pepper flakes, a dash of lemon juice and over 1 cup of chicken stock.   This was bursting with flavor.  Maybe it's not so bland as written after all.  My husband and 4 year old gobbled this up and asked for more!  I'll be making this a lot!  Thank you!

YUM! 
Here's how I changed it a bit.
-I halved each chicken breast so they were thinner. I browned the chicken in a pad of butter instead of oil. This left a nice brown in the pan as well as on the chicken and improved the flavor.
-I added 1 cup of chicken broth to the pan along with 4 cloves crushed garlic and one teaspoon red pepper flakes. I deglazed the pan for 30 seconds and then added broccoli instead on asparagus because that's what I had on hand. I steamed for 5 minutes. 
-I removed the broccoli from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the broth in the pan with the garlic and pepper flakes and added the cut up chicken back to the pan. I covered and let it steam for 1 minute. I then tossed the pasta, broccoli, and the chicken, remaining broth with garlic and pappers all in a bowl and served with a bit of parm cheese on top. 
It was delicious and FULL of flavor. My husband who is super picky had seconds, so that says it all!

This was a big hit with my husband. The kids aren't asparagus fans, so they were not thrilled. They did love all but the asparagus though. I thought it was a bit bland, so I added a bit more salt, pepper, garlic and chicken broth. I also added some butter at the end.

Made the dish according to the directions, the only addition was a couple teaspoons of crushed garlic to the chicken and asparagus and used multi grain penne. My family loved it. Very light dish. Ate two plates and was not bloated.

I boiled only 1.5 cups of WW penne, used 1/2 cup seasoned chicken broth I had left from a crock pot chicken, used some of a rotisserie chicken I bought, added sauteed onion and mushrooms, 1 roasted bell pepper from a jar, about 8 sliced cherry tomatoes, and finally, stirred in about 1/3 cup of low fat cream cheese until melted.  Sprinkled some fresh basil over it, and we had a nice creamy sauce, and 4 nice portions.

This is a great weeknight recipe.  It is great as written, but I added a couple of extra things the 2nd time, and it was even better.  As Laurel B posted later, sauteed mushrooms are a fantastic addition.  I sautee the mushrooms, garlic and asparagus for a few minutes before adding the chicken broth.  Also, I like a little extra sauce, so I added 1/2 cup of wine, and 2 Tbsps of Half and Half, as well as a good amount of red pepper flakes.  I make as directed for 2 of us and enjoy for "lunch leftovers."

This is a great start to a delicious recipe. As the recipe currently stands, it needs a bit of adjusting, in my opinion. It's good, but not great. I added mushrooms to mine but it still needs something more in terms of offering more flavor. Next time I will add artichoke hearts and thyme and probably some more garlic.

The only change I made was to use a store-bought rotisserie chicken with the meat pulled off the bone, rather than cubed. This recipe is bland, bland, bland and was a waste of good ingredients.

Very quick and easy. I roasted the asparagus in the oven for a little extra flavor and color while I boiled the pasta and browned the chicken in olive oil and garlic, then tossed everything together.

I really liked this dish and so did Rosalee, but Ben gave it a 2 because he would rather have all of the parts separately.

I made this recipe almost as-is & the whole family enjoyed it - including my 9 year old son (surprise!!)
The only changes I made were:  I used whole grain fusili pasta,  did not have parmasan on hand.  Added a dash of oregano & basil to the chicken broth mixture.   Primo!

Great recipe! I doubled the broth to add flavor, and let the asparagus cook without the lid on, to rid it of the extra liquid. I also mixed in the Parmesan and some extra mixed cheeses I had on hand while the asparagus was cooking to make a bit of a  cheesy sauce. After the chicken-asparagus topping was on the olive-oil-sprinkled noodles, I did add more Parmesan. Perfect! :)

This is a great light dish. I  added 4 oz of light cream cheese, 1/3 cup Italian cheese blend and thickened it with a little flour to make a sauce. We all love cheese and I wanted to make it a little heartier for the kids. Also added some Italian spices. My 2 and 3 year old boys loved it! I also used bow tie pasta instead of Penne for more kid appeal. Thanks for the great recipe!

Last night was my first time making this, but even so, I couldn't resist putting my own little twist on it. I sautéed 4 cloves of chopped garlic (we REALLY like garlic) with some mushrooms in the olive oil. Cut the chicken into pretty good sized chunks and seasoned with salt and pepper, added the asparagus and chicken broth at the last 10 minutes of cooking and covered ( I like a little crunch in my asparagus.) About 5 minutes before it was done I added some fresh spinach leaves, (I have a hard time getting my 2 year old to eat her veggies anymore) and let them wilt down. Mixed the chicken mixture with the noodles and added some italian cheese mix (about a cup and a half maybe?) stirred it up and plated! Topped with a little parmesan and added some red pepper flakes on mine and my husbands.  So light and so delicious. Definitely a keeper recipe.  You can pretty much add any veggie to it and have a great weeknight dinner meal!

My 6 year old asks for this dish once a week, it is her favorite, even more so than spaghetti. I made some changes to the original recipe that I had read on a few other reviews of this dish.     1 box of mini bow tie pasta (my kids like the smaller pasta, I have also used a box of mini penne pasta)    Press one garlic clove and cook withe the chicken.     Press a second garlic clove and mix with veggies.    2 small or 1 large jar marinated artichoke hearts chopped. I also include the liquid from one small jar or half of the large jar. Dispose of the rest.    A few chopped roasted red peppers.

Great recipe! I sauteed mushrooms with the chicken as suggested. When I went to the store, they didn't have any asparagus so I substituted with 2 cups of frozen green beans (defrosted). I prepared them the same as I would've the asparagus. While the green beans were in the skillet, I opted for 2 cloves of garlic rather than the garlic powder.  I used grated Parmesan cheese in the amount called for but I also used 1 cup of a finely grated white cheese that I had on hand.  The result was amazing! I loved it and so did my guests. I will definitely make it again.... and probably with the same adjustments that I used this time.

I've made this twice now, and I love the recipe. However, for 16 oz of pasta, I use at least 2 bunches of asparagus, 3 to 4 chicken breasts (cut into 1" pieces) a cup of chicken broth, 6 to 8 cloves of garlic, and 1.5 cups of Parmesan. I also sprinkle it with crushed red pepper flakes, then top with lemon zest when serving. Delicious!

Everybody loved this!  I used a purchased rotisserie chicken to speed it up.  It was a great taste.  I added 1/2 c diced onion and 1/2 red bell pepper with the garlic.  We like a lot of sauce so I added more chicken broth and thickened it a bit with corn starch.  Great recipe!

As Randy from American Idol would say, "I'm just not feeling this one." I kept adding more pepper, salt, and garlic, but no matter what, I could just not get enough flavor in this dish. It was way too bland for my family's liking. I didn't have a problem with the "lack of sauce" as other reviewers have commented. We make a similar dish that we really like using Italian sausage, beef broth and peppers and onions. I was hoping this would be the chicken version of that dish.  It wasn't. I won't be making this one again. I'm sure I could tweak and doctor until it came out just right, but that wouldn't be the same recipe at all. If you notice, most of the better ratings on this dish include enough tweaks that make it a different dish altogether.  Therefore, I don't think the high rating on this dish is meritted.

A success at my house. I marinated the chicken in balsamic dressing as another reviewer suggested; I added fresh mushrooms and more chicken broth than called for (as well as the liquid produced when I sauteed the chicken and a little of the pasta water). It was really good!

This was a super fast and simple recipe. The taste is very fresh, but slightly on the bland side.  I served it with red pepper flakes which added a nice kick, but I think it could use a little more garlic, a little more cheese and a squeeze of lemon juice. It's healthy and yummy though.  A keeper recipe!

A nice alternative to the usual heavy pasta dish! The only thing I changed was using fresh minced garlic when cooking the chicken instead of garlic powder. It's a very versatile recipe and you can definitely mix and match other veggies - broccoli, mushrooms, etc. You can add crushed red pepper flakes for a nice kick, too! Thank you for sharing!

Mouthwatering good.  I actually like that there is no sauce.  Next time I make this however, I am substituting the chicken for shrimp.  Can't wait.

Great, easy dinner with ingredients that are generally on hand.  I made the recipe exactly as written plus the addition of some mushrooms and both my girlfriend and I loved it.  As others have said, it's very light and the broth lightly coats the pasta rather than provides an actual sauce, but I find this to be a positive as it keeps the meal healthy.  Has great potential to make frequent appearances on nights where we don't feel super hungry.

This was a pretty good recipe. I added mushrooms, as suggested by other reviewers. I found it a little bland, so I sprinkled a little Cajun seasoning on top and it was yummy! It was especially yummy the next day. I'd make this again and will continue to add seasoning cuz it's just too bland without it. I like my food to burst with flavor!

So simple and so delicious!  This is a great throw-together-at-the-last-minute recipe.  I usually have all of these ingredients on hand, and when I don't have the asparagus, I substitue fresh spinach with equally tasty results.  Thank you!

This recipe is good as written but I used much less oil.  I also added mushrooms per the submitter's suggestion.  The flavor is subtle and light.  It definitely needed the parmesan cheese to boost the flavor.   I suggest cooking the penne firmer than al dente and then adding it back to the pan with the asparagus to heat through and allow the pasta to absorb any remaining chicken broth.  When pasta is at desired done-ness, you're ready to eat!  Make sure you use a pan that's big enough to hold the pasta.  I cut the recipe in half so it was manageable.

So quick, so easy, so tasty! I also added some mushrooms like other users, and it turned out wonderful. For something so simple, the taste was spot on. I also used real garlic instead of the powder. Definitely will make again.

This is BEST recipe I have found on this webpage.  My husband and I absolutely love it. I make it at least once a week. It makes two very hearty meals for just the two of us. It is delicious without making any changes to the original recipe.

Light, but very satisfying.  I followed this recipe, but used three cloves of garlic instead of one.  Next time I will add mushrooms, or perhaps green onions.

Delicious! Light and filling at the same time! Used vegetable broth rather than chicken (what I had) and added a red bell pepper cut up into 1 inch chunks for the last couple minutes of the steaming. Looking forward to having it cold for lunch tomorrow!

We really like this but on it's own it's just too bland.  I do add some cracked black pepper, parsley and whatever other herb/spice hits me at the time.  It's a little different each time I make it.  I believe it's a great base recipe.

Unfortunately I couldn't follow the recipe exactly because all I had on hand was wide egg noodles and broccoli but as it was, my family enjoyed this dish very much.  My husband is not a fan of thick creamy sauces so the lightness of this pasta was ideal for us.  For such a simple meal, I might make it easier on myself next time by throwing the veggie into the pasta water in the last 4 or 5 minutes and then reserving a cup of the water after draining it.  I'll add chicken boullion and spices at this point and let it sit.  Right before serving, I'll dot with a bit of butter and sprinkle with cheese.  A light, (mostly) healthy one-pot meal that couldn't come together quicker!

I was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out. I took the base recipe and followed bizycooker's advice.
I chopped the asparagus into 1 inch pieces and put into boling water for 5 min. I then used a slotted spoon to remove and added my pasta(only 12 oz) for cooking.
I cut the chicken into small pieces and sauteed in evoo with 2 cloves of garlic and 1 shallot. When the chicken was cooked I added lemon juice, 1/4 C of Cream Cheese and 1/4 C of Chicken stock. When the cream cheese melted I added a splash of milk. I reduced for 2-3 min. When I tossed chicken and sauce with pasta I added a handful of freshly grated parm.

This was awesome!  Very easy, use pre-cooked chicken strips if you are in a hurry.  I have made this several times.  I throw in different stuff I have on hand too like bacon, mushrooms, pancetta, etc.  Thanks for the post.

My husband enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe.  As always, I had to fiddle with recipe.  I added a little more broth, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, mushrooms, and some of my Fines Herb blend.  I will definitely make this for him again.  I made a vegetarian version for myself using vegetable broth and adding more mushrooms.

Started by following the recipe, but I had used the Barilla Plus (whole grain) penne.  As I was preparing the asparagus/chicken broth mix, I realized that I was not going to have enough liquid to work with the pasta, so I added another cup of broth.  It improved the final results somewhat, but there was still something missing - I think that the suggestion of using roasted red peppers and onion is a great idea (unfortunately, I didn't have the time to really improvise on this paticular night LOL).  All in all, though, this was a great light dish, and tasted GREAT with the whole-grain pasta.

I thought that this was an excellent dish and my boyfriend loved it too!  If you're looking to make this for two (and have a more than generous serving) cut down the pasta to 2 cups and increase chicken broth to 3/4 cup.  I also used only 1/4 tsp minced garlic, cut the olive oil down to what I thought I needed as I was cooking, I added 2 tsp. butter at the end before I let the pasta mixture rest for 5 mins, and drizzled with approx 1 tsp. olive oil. At the end if you think it's too bland just add some more salt, pepper, or garlic powder.  You won't be sorry you tried this!

Very good. Since it is a little early for asparagus and I won't eat the store kind (there is NO comparison in taste from that and fresh grown) I decided to just make it without. I didn't use garlic powder but cooked one garlic clove and 2 shallots with the chicken and sprinkle fresh chives and a very small amount of fresh tarragon on the top along with extra parm.

I thought this was a nice dish that you can throw together in minutes.  I didn't have penne - had to use spaghetti, which I know took away from the recipe.  Spiced it up with a little red pepper and thought it came out very light - great for the summertime!

This is a great recipe.  I like my pasta to be a bit spicier, so will add some hot sauce or pepper flakes next time I make it.  And I WILL make it again.  Easy to make and could make all kinds of changes - ie bbq the chicken breasts...

Over all the taste was fantastic!s! I didn't have asparagus so added other veggies like stringless peas, green onions and orange peppers. It was a little dry and I had added a little more olive oil. My oil pastas always turn out dryish. Wish I knew how to fix that.

Loved! Loved! I looked at the other reviews and did a combo too- I added the mushrooms ( great idea) Because I'm a huge garlic fan, I went pretty over the recipe- 4 cloves chopped. And I'm glad I did- when I added cream cheese to the broth the garlic didn't get lost in the mix. I also played with the broth and cream cheese till it was nice coating texture.  I added sun dried tomatoes and the parmesan and it was perfect!

I made this meal and it was quick, tasty, and sustaining. I did add another chicken breast with a tad more Olive Oil as we had it for our Sabbath study as well. Great recipe and is filling!

Easy enough, but lacked flavor - and I did add extra garlic and lots of pepper... We ended up adding mayo and a bit of horseradish and pepper to leftovers and ate as cold salad.

I added some button mushrooms with the asparagus.  And would cut down the amount of pasta (hope Grandma doesn't hear that) next time.  Overall, it went over well.

After reading the reviews and knowing my hubby's taste, I decided we needed a little sauce. I mixed some broth and wine with about 1/2 can of Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup.  Also reserved some pasta water just in case, but didn't use it.  I did add mushroom, onion and a little chopped red pepper and some Italian seasoning.  It was good...hubby pronounced it very good.  We will do this again with a little refining...maybe more veggies and less pasta.

It needed bacon or something to enhance the taste.  I did have to omit the garlic because my guest has a sensitive tummy.  I added it at the table but even then it was not worth keeping for another meal.

This was a nice dish, easy to make and I'm sure we'll have it again.  Only thing that kept it from being 5 star in our opinion was that it was somewhat bland.  We plan to season it up the next time we make it.

I made it last night with the following changes. I substitued a basket of grape tomatoes for the pasta and after all was cooked I added two tablespoons of butter. 
We had leftovers but they were gone by lunchtime today.

I took this recipe in the Greek direction, spicing it with Greek Freak and switching out the recommended cheese to feta because I needed to finish a bottle of Retsina!  I added mushrooms as one reviewer recommended.  It was delicious, and I'm planning to try it a second time, but going Italian like the original recipe suggests.

Pretty easy to make. Good. But do use fresh garlic and fresh parmesan cheese. The fresh parmesan cheese made a big difference.

Great dish! I had to stop myself from eating too much of it. I added some fresh spinach and increased the broth to keep it from being too dry and served it over brown rice pasta. Definitely will be having this one again!

I cut back on the pasta to lower the carbs and also added crushed red pepper for a little kick! Very good! While cutting back on the pasta you could add more asparagus or chicken or both, and not increase the calorie count, maybe lower it some!

As there are only two of us, I half size or quarter size every recipe.  The first go around was okay but not great.  The second time around I used chicken broth for cooking the pasta and added the cut asparagus  in time to steam.  While the pasta is cooking,  I browned the chicken in garlic infused olive oil and added a clove of chopped garlic as we like garlic. 

I combined all the ingredients and added a couple tablespoons of green onion and chives cream cheese.  Serve with pesto and fresh grated parmesan or cheese of your choice.

Those who complained it was bland:  add 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil. The basil gives it a peppery note.  I have a similar recipe that I made tonight. A touch of white wine also makes for a bit more flavor. Great light recipe.

This was excellent.. Here is a tip! I made the Slow Cooker Lemon Garlic Chicken from the Allrecipes site earlier in the week. I saved the juices/broth and all the leftover chicken in one container. Later in the week I cooked the pasta for this recipe...Then I cut up the leftover Lemon Garlic Chicken from previous dinner and put it on a plate. I put the broth from the previous dinner in a pan and continued to follow this recipe since most of the ingredients were the same from both sites this was a super easy weeknight meal!

This recipe is delicious and easy to do. I used 4 tbsp of cream cheese and doubled the amount of Parmesan cheese. The asparagus adds a nice texture and color to the dish as well.

This was a good, light pasta meal.  I also added sauteed mushrooms, a can of drain artichoke hearts, and sundried tomatoes.  I also grilled the chicken breasts then cut them up and added later.  I did also have to add some more chicken broth.  A warning that there isn't much flavor in terms of spices, but all of these ingredients have such great natural flavors!  Will definitely make this again.

I liked it but it was nothing special.  Needs more veggies and extra broth.  I added peas  and a little broth when I reheated the leftovers.  Otherwise I made as is except added a few mushrooms.  I would make this again and add some peas.

Very good! I did add the mushrooms as the original poster of her recipe revised it. I cooked the chicken and removed it to a plate. I added the mushrooms to the pan and sauteed them along with some sundried tomatoes. I then added that to the chicken. Added the broth to the pan and the asparagus. Once that was cooked I added the chicken, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes back to the pan with the asparagus. I added a splash more chicken broth and add the pasta to the chicken mixture and warmed it all through. Very tasty!  Oh, and for the chicken I marinated it for about an hour (while waiting for hubby to come home) in oil, lemon juice and minced garlic. Will make it again!

I made this the other night and it was delicious.  The asparagus cooked just right and the chicken was tender and juicy.  The only things I changed - I used an entire can of low sodium chicken broth and I did so because of how the pasta would absorb the liquid.  I did thicken up the broth with 2t of corn starch and I added the zest and juice of one lemon.  The dish was light, fresh and comforting all in one.

This turned out so good I had to comment.  I changed it just a little to make it creamier by adding a little more chicken broth than recipe called for (about a cup) and a can of cream of mushroom soup (after asparagus is steamed).  Also added a little onion while cooking the chicken and used Rotini pasta instead of Penne.  Oh…also a little white wine to deglaze the chicken skillet before adding the broth.  Absolutely delicious!

I was worried when making this dish as I'm not normally a white type sauce person.  But wow, I was so surprised how delicious and flavourful it was.  I read some of the reviews and added a little more garlic and that did it.  Definitely will make it again...  (plus I've shared it multiple times since I had it)
Thank You for sharing it with us...

Made this last night for dinner.  From the reviews, it seems people either love it or hate it.  It has simple ingredients that my kids love seperately, so thought I'd give it a try.  I made it as the recipe stated, except used thighs instead of breasts (bc it's what I had), and I added frozen brocoli to it since my kids love brocoli and I wanted to up the veggies.  I also forgot to add the extra oil and parm cheese at the end.   Both of my kids (11 and 5) and husband had seconds.  They loved it.   I thought it was very good too.  I used fresh garlic and garlic powder but that was the only 'extra' herbs since I wanted it to be true to the recipe.  My husband thinks it'll be even better with an Alfredo sauce, and my entire family said it's a keeper though.  If you go into it knowing it's a light tasting dish, then it's perfect.  If you're expecting a rich creamy dish, you're gonna be disappointed.  I will definitely be making this again. Going in the "Keep" pile.

This recipe is pretty good. I tweaked it a bit by adding 1 TBSP butter to the olive oil & 1 tsp cornstarch to the chicken to thicken it up a bit. After cooking the asparagus, I added pancetta with 1/4 tsp of truffle oil & 1 TBSP heavy cream,  a couple dash of Rosemary and Thyme seasoning once all ingredients are combined.

Yum. Also added some crumbled feta on top of mine!  Used 2, 1 lb chicken breasts halves.  Made lots

Second time making this I added chopped opinions to the garlicwhen cooking the chicken, a lot more seasonings (extra chopped garlic, red peppers, Italian seasoning). Also ended up adding most of the rest of  can of   Chicken broth that was leftover to the dish as it sat and soaked up most of it.   Yum again!

Love it!!! I marinated my chicken in the Olive Garden Italian dressing and it was to die for!! Also I added Parmesan to the asapargus in the skillet and it was great. Good meal for the family. I would suggest prepping it all first before cooking anything instead of doing things in the order listed in the original

This is a tasty and healthy dish the way it is. For people like me on a carb,protein, fat rationed diet you can change the ingredients to your diet. I used 2 lbs chicken, 8 oz whole wheat penne, and even used less olive oil to equal 4 portioned meals( I'm a big guy). Lunch for the week! Easy recipe to manipulate carbs and protein. 
The olive oil helps to absorb all the nutrients of the asparagus. Excellent pairing. I spiced mine up a little extra with Cajun seasoning,add garlic and oregeno. Will be a future staple. Thanks Laurel!
Oh yeah didn't use chicken broth. I used the remnant broth from cooking the breasts. Chicken out; oil n asparagus in.

This was awesome & gobbled up by my 16 month old granddaughter...  with a few changes. She doesn't like asparagus  but loves broccoli & spinach so I substituted those.  I wanted more of a cream base so I did as several other posts & added cream cheese. I also wanted a little more spice beside salt & pepper so I sauted onion & garlic before putting in the chicken.  After the chicken was done, I pulled it all out & added broth & the veggies to the pan to cook (spinach didn't go in right away)  As it was cooking, and knowing the amount of Penne I had boiling, I added another 10 oz can of broth & used the full 8 oz of cream cheese.  I also threw in some Kickin Chicken spice ( a little! )  I added it all back together with the pasta & let it cook on low for a little bit to help the sauce be absorbed into the pasta.  My granddaughter was helping me & she couldn't wait to add the parmesan cheese!   She asked for seconds!!  Thank you Laurel !

I make a few adjustments to the recipe. I tripled the amount of fresh garlic, added ½ cup of cherry tomatoes halved to one-half the original serving size, which I adjusted to 4.

AWESOME pasta dish and healthy too!  Here is what I did.....  After steps 1 and 2, I removed chicken to paper towels and in the same pan I sautéd sliced mushrooms, the asparagus, and 3 cloves of garlic (minced) for about 5 minutes.  Then I added 1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth, and 1/3 cup white wine, and a can of drained artichoke hearts.  I covered and simmered all for about 5 minutes, added back the chicken and simmered another 5 minutes.  I then stirred the chicken mixture into the pasta.  I did not add the additional olive oil, because I added a little butter to the pasta after it cooked. And don't forget fresh Parmesan cheese!  Next time I will add a little red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick, although it was still very tasty!  The entire recipe makes a lot, so there's plenty for lunches during the week!

Delicious, and my 3 year old ate asparagus willingly for the first time! My DH struck his nose up and ate plain noodles for dinner...his loss!

We are sauce lovers here, so I whipped up a cheese sauce. After cooking the chicken, I added 1  1/2 c. Water and a cube of chicken bouillon to the pan, simmered until the bouillon dissolved, then drained all but half a cup from the pan before steaming the asparagus. Then I removed the asparagus, returned the rest of the broth to the pan and added about 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese (the powdered kind, it's all I had on hand) and about a tsp of flour. I whisked that together over a medium heat and let it simmer until thickened, then spooned it over the chicken/asparagus/penne. It was delicious! 

If I had to do it again I'd probably have real parmesan, but I really didn't feel like running to the store just for cheese!

Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this for my husband and he loved it. I tweaked it a little by sautéing the asparagus in 2 table spoons of browned butter and a squeeze of lemon before adding the chicken broth. Then I mixed in 1 tablespoon of cornstarch after I added the chicken back in. This gave it a creamy texture.

I'm always scared to cook chicken, but this looked good so I thought I would give it a try!! So glad I did, it was super delicious and very light, but most of all easy to prepare and cook!! I even added, as suggested, sautéed mushrooms and someone else suggested throwing in a can of artichoke hearts so did that as well and was so pleased with the taste!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, will definitely be making again!!

I modified this recipe by marinading chicken thighs (2 or more hrs) in the following: 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil,4 large garlic cloves, minced, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1-1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, zest of 1 lemon. When the pasta is about done, I cut up the chicken and cook in a skillet. When cooked, I remove the chicken, add 1/2 c of chicken stock to pan, scraping up whatever goodness is left from the chicken.  Add the asparagus and steam until tender. When the asparagus is done, combine w/ the pasta & chicken. Top w/ cheese.  Delicious! I might add white wine and/or a little butter to the sauce next time.

This was good, but bland.  I think next time I will add more veggies and some sort of sauce.

Oh my gosh, so good!  And I'm a BIG gravy and sauce gal, but this was off the charts delicious.  After reading most the of reviews, I marinated the cubed chicken in Italian dressing while I prepped the rest of the food, added a pinch of crushed red peppers and sauteed mushrooms and it was simply delicious.  Even good cold right out of the frig the next day.  A definite 'must have' in the arsonal of good meals!

Loved it!  My daughters (ages 7&4) loved it, and even asked for seconds. AND we didn't have to bribe them!  My husband and daughters added parmesan for a garnish, while I only added salt and pepper.  It was a hit!

Really tasty recipe. I added portabello mushrooms along with the artichokes and chicken...flavors blended really well together. I used a little more than half the pasta and doubled the chicken broth. I think the dish would have been too dry otherwise. I skipped the garlic powder and went heavy on the fresh garlic. I also added the juice of a lemon and crushed red pepper to the cooking veggies...really good.

Great recipe! Make sure you adjust salt and pepper as needed and it really is flavorful, without a creamy sauce. I added sun dried tomatoes and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It is a great way of incorporating pasta to your meals and still don't pack too many calories ( like everything else, portion control is the key). My husband tends to like richer, creamier foods but he really liked it, i sprinkled just a little more olive oil on his plate and voila

I just tried this tonight and actually liked this a lot.  I didn't think it was bland at all.  The only thing I did different was added a shallot and also mushrooms.  Emailed it to my mom as well and this will definitely be on the menu again.

I have never submitted a recipe review..but this was fabulous. We had this for dinner last night...it was absolutely delish! I did cheat and use already cooked chicken, (do this with a lot of my dishes as a time saver) still cooked it with the spices and followed the recipe..just didn't cook as long, heated it thru. It was a nice lite pasta dish, full of flavor, and super easy and quick. My kids loved it as well. A great dish when you are pressed for time and want to put something quick and simple on the table, yet full of flavor. Will def be adding this to my "go to" recipes!

I loved this delicious and simple dish!! I didn't know what to expect with the chicken broth and asparagus but myyyyyyyy goodness!!! It was so yummy!! I adjusted the recipe just a bit, added garlic salt to the chicken - just a dash and I added some cherry tomatoes to give it some color and sweetness. I'll definitely be making it again!!

It was very good; however, I felt it was lacking in flavor.
The next time I would add white wine to the chicken broth and a little lemon juice, and more garlic.

I found this recipe about a year ago and it's now my husbands favorite dish. It's light , unlike many pastas, and tasty. I sauté mushrooms with butter/olive oil and seasonings and add those in last minute with asparagus , chicken and pasta. The extra mushroom sauce adds flavor :) enjoy!

This was a light,healthy dish that my boyfriend and I enjoyed. I  did make a few changes such as using fetuccini pasta instead and added mushrooms,small jar rof artichoke hearts, red peppper flakes and fresh lemon juice. My boyfriend suggested adding cherry tomatoes, olives  and capers. Hmm...maybe I'll try that next time or just add sundried tomatoes. So many options but still great as is!

This is the second time I've made this.  I follow the recipe exactly and it's great.  Of course you can add extras.  I don't bc my kids like it the way it is, asparagus and all!  I will add other veggies as they start liking them, adding more broth and parmesan as needed.  Thanks Laurel B!

I made this last week, it was incredibly awesome! love the taste of chicken and asparagus. If you're a big fan of asparagus you won't regret try this recipe. I used spaghetti since it was on hand by the time but still fabulously delicious. Super easy, and super yummy!

I really liked this recipe--very easy! I didn't have penne so I used spaghetti and I didn't have asparagus so I used frozen Italian green beans. I'm trying to limit salt intake, so I didn't add much salt. As a result, it came out a little bland. Next time I'll add more garlic to compensate.

Good, basic recipe.  I used rotisserie chicken in order to save time, and then also added mushrooms in with the asparagus as suggested by the submitter.  I took another's advice and added in some cream cheese.  I also started the pan by sauteeing some minced garlic and sliced onions.  Nice for a quick fix in the evening.

This was so very delicious. Hubby thought it needed a bit more liquid, so I'll just add more chicken broth next time. We both thoroughly enjoyed it, though. So easy, too! I followed someone elses suggestion and added some mushrooms. I'm very glad I did.

I had to add my comments as my family devoured this dish tonite! After reviewing everyone's helpful hints, I compiled them all into one recipe: I liberally seasoned the chicken but added Italian seasoning and cooked the chicken with sliced garlic. I added mushrooms and sliced red pepper along with the asparagus and put in about 1 c of the chicken stock and shook in some dried red pepper flakes. Straining the vegetables from the liquid when they are crispy was also a good idea. I wanted to ensure the sauce was super tasty, so after I strained the veg from the broth I did mix in 1/2 c milk with the parm. (Some also added cream cheese for a thicker sauce - but I wanted to keep this recipe as healthy as possible).  The end result was fabulous! A definite keeper!

THIS WILL BECOME ONE OF OUR FAVORITE REPEATS. Made a few adjustments - added sauteed mushrooms and onions. Also increased chicken broth quite a bit since other reviews hinted that it could end up kind of dry. Doubled the garlic (we like). We used linguine this time but any pasta will probably work fine.

Made it with double the serving suggested. Fed 6 people and had leftovers for lunch at work tomorrow. We added a bag of cooked shrimp. Put it in with the chicken and asparagus for a few minutes and then let it sit a couple minutes after cooking! Really great suggestion for the sautéed mushrooms. Definitely will do that next time I make it.

I felt this was bland... plus I had to about a 1/4 cup more broth, since most of my liquid cooked way down.  I think if I added more powdered or minced garlic, this could have been a 4-star recipe...

Pleasantly surprised.  Added mushrooms, but the rest was as originally written.  The flavor is delicate but very nice.  Will make again.  May try a little white wine next time.  Definitely will add to our dinner rotation.

Quick and easy and fresh. I coated the chicken with a tiny bit of flour prior to cooking which helped make a slightly thicker sauce.  other than that, no changes and it was delicious!

This is definitely a 5 star recipe to me!  I loved the lightness of it.  I didn't change much - used two cloves of garlic through a garlic press not sliced, used 3 good sized chicken breast halves and added 1/2 cup of pasta water after mixing the pasta with the garlic asparagus mixture.  I did use the chicken broth to steam asparagus and garlic - was fairly generous with the sea salt, pepper and garlic powder (not overly though).  My husband and I so enjoyed it.  Looking forward to trying it cold.  Will definitely make for company.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I coated my chicken with Italian dressing before frying it in the olive oil. I also added some extra veggies I had in the fridge (mushrooms, peppers). I accidentally cooked the penne all the way so there was extra broth that didn't get soaked up. But I thought it made a good sauce. Loved it, and will make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was pretty darn bland, as other reviewers have said. Also, I would add more chicken and more asparagus next time; I only used a 12-oz box of penne (whole wheat), and even with that, it was still rather noodle-heavy. I think to eat all the leftovers, I'll add some italian dressing (my friend's suggestion).

My family loves this recipe! It's a very quick, easy and light dinner to prepare on week night.  I like to use the rotisserie chicken for this because it's less dry. Also, I add about 1/2 a can of low-fat cream of mushroom soup to thicken up the broth.  I add baby bella mushrooms, 3 cloves of garlic and onion powder during the simmer process and then add fresh basil and parmesean cheese on top when serving.  It's whatever you like but my recipe is still very healthy.

It seems that the only time I review is when I find a recipe that is mainly 5 stars, but upon further detail, realize that the 5 stars does not reflect the original recipe. If you have to add more spices, cream cheese or cream soup, etc...it is no longer the original recipe!  So, this recipe as it is written is light, filling without adding rich bulk, and good with the addition of asparagus.  However, it is otherwise bland and in need of more zing, pizzazz, etc.

This was really good. I marinated my chicken in italian seasoning before cooking it. I added a little extra sliced garlic and used 1 cup of broth in stead of 1/2. It was just moist enough. I also added a 1/2 can of artichoke hearts, but it really didn't need it.

This was a very tasty dish. However, I used the 1/2 cup of chicken broth AND another 1/2 cup of fresh chicken stock to my version. I think that's why mine had SO MUCH flavor. I also used already cooked, leftover roasted chicken instead of sautéing it like the recipe called for.

I like the flavors and textures of this meal. It is very easy to follow for beginners like me. I would recommend this for others to try.

This is a GREAT recipe!!! Fixed just as written and all of the family was in agreement... it is a keeper.  IF you are looking for one with sauce, this does not have sauce but the drizzled olive oil and parm. cheese is all you need!!!  Happy eating!!

This is a great recipe! I used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and added a little bit of alfredo sauce to the penne, otherwise seems a little dry. Will definitely make again!

This is super easy and yummy!  Not only did my two year old eat it, he asked for more!  The only thing I did change was add some fresh dill to the chicken and the only thing I would change is add more asparagus.

Very simple to make and I enjoyed it. The wife was not as thrilled. She would have like an Alfredo sauce and doesn't enjoy Parmesan though which I think is a big part of it. I used mushrooms with mine.

I loved it and it was really simple. I sauteed white onion with the garlic and added carrots and kale. I also used a spice from Penzey's called "Mural of Flavor" instead of adding salt.

Thought I would try the creamier version that was mentioned by another reviewer first and it was absolutely delicious.  I think the original version would be just as good and will try it soon.

Easy and awesome. I never follow spice directions on here though I always spice to our tastes which means a lot of garlic powder. :)

You can throw tons of stuff into this- sun dried tomatoes are amazing as well as red peppers or any other sweet pepper- mushrooms are a go too. 
I always serve it with whole wheat or brown rice pasta.
Thank you for sharing- this isn't bland at all but light and healthy.

I thought this was a bit bland but the pickiest member of the family raved about it. I added extra fresh garlic, mushrooms and extra freshly grated parmesan. Nice way to use asparagras and it's easy. 
probably will make again.

This is not only a fantastic and easy meal to make, but I like the the fact that it was very quick to throw together. A huge thumbs up! I did deviate from the recipe slightly and added sliced carrots and just a touch of heavy whipping cream.

I thought this was a good foundation recipe - I followed the advice of other reviews and added a little bit to it to give more flavors that I like.  We sauteed some thin sliced onion and 3 cloves garlic then added in the chicken to cook.  Put in the chicken stock and some red pepper flakes.  Added very thin asparagus at the end to saute quickly, then added the pasta in (only used about half a package of penne as that's what we had).  Added the pasta in with parmesan and mixed together and served.  It was spicy from the red pepper flakes, and light.  Not my favorite dish nor my least favorite - a good way to use up leftovers, but would probably not make again.

This was really good! I made the recipe as instructed, but in addition to that I added some white wine, thyme, portobello mushrooms, extra garlic, lemon juice, truffle salt, and ground red pepper. This recipes was super easy and easy to variate according to taste. I love all the vegetables. My husband loved it, too.

I marinated the chicken in garlic, olive oil, basil and onion flakes for about an hour. I sautéed onion in butter until tranlucent.  I then added mushrooms and the marinated chicken.  I didn't drain the chicken but kept the juices.  Cooked the asparagus in 1 cup chix stock and added all to pasta. Might add kalamata olives next time. Over all, quite yummy!

FANTASTIC! I made this last night for a couple of friends. It was a big hit. I used whole wheat penne. I used double the amount the garlic. Perfect. Leaves you feeling satisfied and not eck as some creamy pasta dishes do. Very flavorful if seasoned correctly. I did add mushrooms and sauteed them with the asparagus. I can't wait to eat leftovers for lunch today! Thanks for sharing! YUM!

This was really good so I gave a four star. I made it a five star by adding another half cup chicken broth, and adding philadelphia cooking cream_Savory Garlic. I also added 1 tbsp of milk. This was a big hit with my very picky eatter. He is usually won't eat anything mixed besides spagetti and he will not eat any of this. To my shock he tried it

Everyone in my family loved this and ate at least three helpings each. I did not use garlic powder as I didn't have any on hand and used puréed garlic instead and I added sautéed mushrooms.  Delicious.

I found this recipe to be VERY bland and found myself substituting things just in search of some flavor. I suggest adding spices of your choosing and perhaps, broccoli also.

When I had this as a hot dish, I thought it was just ok.  Very bland.  But when I had some later, cold out of the fridge, I liked it *much* better.  Would add a little more of the chicken broth next time, just for more flavor, and I added some capers.  I had this with a nice CA Chardonnay and some toasted bread.

Very light flavorful pasta for the summer. I did add mushrooms and a bit more fresh garlic.

Great light and tasty filler. I workout a lot, so I added a little extra chicken. I also used minced garlic instead of garlic cloves due to availability. But it still added the bold flavor.

Made this randomly one evening when I came across the recipe. Both me and my husband fought over the left overs because it was so good. The lack of sauce actually made it feel lighter and not as heavy which was refreshing. It definitely did not lack flavor and I will be making this again and again! So delicious!

I tried this recipe last night and it was delicious.  I did substitute the garlic powder and I used fresh minced garlic 3 gloves instead of 1 and sauteed in the pan before I added the asparagus, mushrooms, and broth.  I also used whole grain penne pasta.

If you are looking for Chicken, Asaragus, and a quick easy meal- this is it! Very easy...prep time is more like 25 min to cut up all the chicken and asparagus. The only change I made was that I had whole wheat penne. Very good, easy, and healthy.

Love this recipe..my family devoured it & asked to make again next week. A few changes I marinated the chicken in olive oil, fresh minced garlic, lemon zest / juice, salt and pepper over night and added a red bell pepper with the asparagus I also doubled the amount of chicken broth and added a hand full of Parmesan cheese @ the end along with a tbsp of butter.. Wow amazing

Excellent!!  I did however, change it up a bit...I added red onion, red pepper and broccoli and increased the chicken broth to 3/4 cup.  Everything else the same and it turned out so good!  Thank you for the recipe!

pretty good!  I added a bit more chicken broth after as it seemed a bit dry.  I added chopped mushrooms (enough for my kids not to detect) and For my kids, I added corn and used different pasta.

Very simple and delicious!  This was plenty to feed my family of 5 as a main course.  I did add the mushrooms, which are in the picture, but strangely not in the recipe.  I used more garlic and more parm than it called for in the recipe which gave it more flavor.  Besides that I followed the recipe and it came out perfect.  Keeper!

I made this yesterday and loved it! The only thing I added was some baby spinach to the asparagus and sauteed it in extra virgin olive oil before adding it to the pasta.

SOOOOOO good and light and EASY! For a non cooker like me, if I say it's easy, then it definitely is. Probably like cooking mac and cheese for real cookers haha. I love all the items in this so I was so excited to try it out and it came out sooo good. 

It's only my husband and I so I didn't want to make the whole box of penne, but I'm glad I did because we have tons of leftovers, some he took to work today and me today as well! I am so happy I stumbled upon this recipe. This will DEFINITELY make it in my weekly dinner routine.

WOW! An amazing dinner with such simple ingredients.  Daughter (6) and Husband both give this 2 thumbs way up.  When it was almost finished I had the urge to add about 1/3 cup of cream.  The sauce was still on the thin side (not like alfredo or anything), but it just made it so comforting.  The original way would be great for a summer meal, I think.  But for a windy, grey day the cream was a perfect addition.  We all had seconds!

I know this will sound weird , but as I got into this recipe, I suddenly turned it into an alfredo recipe by adding half and half, white wine and corn starch.  It just seemed like it was lacking something thick to make it all stick together.  I did give it five stars though because the base recipe was perfect for converting to an alfredo.  It was so delicious.

This was a great light meal. I made a couple of changes just based on what I had in the house. I sauteed the asparagus with the chicken and added 5 cloves of garlic, 2 small red bell peppers and half a pint of sliced white mushrooms. Added a couple tablespoons of butter with the chicken broth and threw the whole mix over some tricolor rotini. Excellent the day after for lunch too!

I enjoyed this dish. I made some changes. I seasoned the meat with OBay. I used broccoli and mushrooms instead of asparagus. Overall it was tasty, and like some comments I read, you can add a little more salt to your liking.

This was incredible... I tweaked the recipe a little though. I took a head of garlic and cut it in half. drizzled some olive oil on it and wrapped it in foil. I baked this in the oven for 30 min at 400 degrees. I then took this out and used the olive oil from the foil to cook the chicken in. I removed the cloves of garlic and mashed them up (after roasting they are tender and easily mash). i put about 3 cloves with the chicken instead of any garlic powder. I used about 1/3 - 1/2 of the remaining garlic mush in the garlic and chicken broth sauce (made extra of the sauce). didnt use any garlic powder at all.  after making the pasta i added the asperagus and chicken on it without adding the sauce. I then let family decide how much sauce they wanted on it (some like heavier sauce than others). Also added sauted mushrooms to top it off with. Overall an amazing meal!

We really liked this. We even ate it again for left overs. I saw that some reviewers complained that it doesnt have enough flavor. If you need more flavor make sure to add enough of the seasoning, & parmesan, or more garlic. I also added just a little red pepper flakes. I thought it was good.

This is the first time I have written a review on a recipe. This dish is AWESOME with a few tweeks. I marinated the chicken breasts and threw them on the grill. While they were resting I started my water for the bow tie pasta and sauteed about 4 cloves of garlic because they were small with some diced onion, sliced mushrooms, some red pepper slices, and the asparagus. After draining the pasta returned it to the pot with the sauteed vegetables and diced chicken and the chicken broth and some fresh parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Hubby though it still needed something, so back to the pot it all went. I added a little of some light alfredo sauce and it was as my daughter says, "the bomb dot com". I will make this over and over again! Thanks for the ideas Laurel.

Penne with Chicken & Asparagus Haiku: "Thought this would be bland. But was pleasantly surprised! (Don't forget the parm!) As I was preparing this, all I could think was, "wow, this is going to be a yawn-inducing meal", but we ended up liking it for its simple, clean elegance. I used homemade chick stock that I'd had frozen, along w/ additional minced garlic that I cooked alongside the chicken, but otherwise, was faithful to the recipe. With a sprinkle of parmesan and crushed red pepper at serving, this was a nice light pasta dish, a tasty alternative to heavy, creamy, or tomato saucy, pastas, especially during the hot summer.

I too added mushrooms to this. Since there was no sauce I drizzled some olive oil over the noodles before serving. Once everyone had their playes fixed I put a fried egg on top of each serving and used the yolk as the sauce. It was very good!

I thought this recipe was fast and easy and healthy!  However, it did not have enough flavor for my family. We did add red pepper flakes that helped a little, but I think if I try it again, I will try to make the sauce creamy.

This is the first recipe that I've tried on Allrecipes, and I have to say I couldn't have been more pleased.  I have some pretty picky kids, but all four of them (and my niece and my husband!) LOVED this dish!  It was quick and easy and so yummy!  I made it for my best friend's family and her daughter's response was "It's so good I'm going to eat until I'm stuffed!!"  Can't get much better than that!!

Made this for a dinner party for 4, and there were almost no leftovers.  Everyone was thrilled as to how healthy it was.  I used whole wheat penne and added the mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes as suggested by others.  Red pepper flakes added a nice subtle kick.  I will be making this again with what I have available - whole wheat rotelle and broccoli rabe.  A definite one for the rotation.

Followed recipe and came out with what seemed like plain flavourless pasta with chicken and asparagus.  Wouldnt make again without doing so many changes it wouldnt be this recipe at all anymore.

This was ok..on the bland side and I even changed it up by adding a tsp of Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic, along with Seasoned Salt and balsamic vinegar to the chicken.  I added yellow squash, double the chicken broth, a splash of white wine and another tsp of Garlic Garlic to the asparagus.  Increased the parmesan cheese to a heaping cup.  It wasn't bad, just needs more flavor.  Marinating the chicken overnight in balsamic vinegar or Italian Dressing and adding mushrooms might help.

THis was a good recipe. A little bland, but healthier of course. I guess i need to back away from the heavy-duty sauces and stick to olive oil based sauces like this one. Oh, i added mushrooms. GOOD!

The recipe is truly easy to follow and rather healthy considering there is no cream added. However, it came out really bland despite adding Mrs. Dash and red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

This was amazing.  Who knew yummy came in such a low calorie form.  It also made a great leftovers!  I already have friends taking this recipe home for their families.  One vegetarian  friend is leaving out the chicken and substituting veggie broth for the chicken broth.

I really liked this recipe.  It is a good base to create your own masterpiece.  For instance my asparagus wasn't looking great, but my fresh green beans looked perfect as a replacement.   I added a little onion and used fresh garlic.  As I plated my food I added some fresh diced tomato then the cheese.  The tomato was the perfect compliment to the dish and added some color.  My son who is allergic to dairy was still able to enjoy what I was eating without sacrificing a whole lot of flavor.  You should be prepared to add salt and pepper after tasting, but I like added salt at the table to my preferred to taste.   The best part was this was a one dish meal, carb, protein, and veggie all in one.  Took less then 20 min. to make.

Second time I have made it.  Very tasty! This second time was more flavorful with use of just a bit more of the favorings.  I sautated the chicken in the olive oil with 1/2 t of minced garlic, lots of ground pepper and some salt.  When chicken no longer pink, added asparagus, another 1/2 t minced garlic and more pepper, a sprinkling of garlic powder and chicken broth.  Steamed covered for 3-5 minutes till the asparagus was tendercrisp.   Once done, added that to my already cooked pasta.  Stirred in Parmesan cheese.  Yummy!  Everyone loved it!

This dish was lacking something for me.  I have been making a variation of this for years.  Saute 3 - 4 cloves of minced garlic, with some red pepper flakes over low heat until soft.  Add chicken and cook until tender.  Add blanched brocolli and then toss with cooked pasta.  Add "lots" of freshly grated parmessan cheese and pepper and you will be in heaven.

First of all, let me start by saying that I have three children -- 6, 8 and 15, and it is very hard to make a meal that they will all eat without complaining. I was browsing recipes and stumbled upon this one and thought that i could doctor it up so that everyone in my house would like it -- I was right! I did make it as written the first time and I really enjoyed it.  My kids have requested it again -- but with broccoli (instead of asparagus) and by doubling the cheese, glorious cheese! I look forward to having this recipe again next week....:) Thank you for posting it!

Awesome recipe! I made it for dinner and it was a big hit. Only thing I changed was that I added some fresh chopped parsley with the cheese.

Really good! The only reason I'm rating 4 stars is that I would just suggest either putting less noodles or more chicken and asparagus. Unless you like a big ratio of noodles to other stuff! :)

I made this for dinner last nite and it was awesome. The only thing I did different was add broccoli instead of asparagus because we do not like asparagus. The children which are very picky eaters loved this dish. Will make again. Thanks for a great recipe

really good and simple to make. I boiled the asparagus in the chicken broth mixed with water, then using the same water (adding liquid as needed) cooked the pasta. this gave a harmonizing flavor throughout the meal

Easy to make, but bland and dry.  I used extra minced garlic and olive oil, but it was still not that great.  Too bad because I love chicken, asparagus, and penne.

This is a GREAT recipe. So easy to prepare but tastes like you spent hours. The only change I made was I upped the broth to 1 cup and used roasted garlic infused evoo (maybe 3 tblsp total, 5 tblsp seemed excessive). Oh and I added broccoli and mushrooms to the asparagus sautee. Yum yum!

This is a great and simple one dish meal I was so thankful to have after a ridiculously busy day.  Didn't have chicken broth on hand so I did it the old fashioned way and used a cup of the salted pasta water in addition to the chicken juices that were left in the pan.  It was tasty and simple and much more nutritious than ordering a pizza--which I was tempted to do because I thought I was too gosh darn tired to cook for my family of 5.  Kids were happy, husband was happy, and I was happy especially seeing the kids eat chicken and asparagus.

This is an excellent base recipe.  I followed it 90%.  I marinated my chicken breasts first in balsamic dressing, substituted fresh asparagus for frozen, used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 1/2 cup, and at the end when I put in the 2 tbsp of olive oil, I also added two tbsp of butter as well.  Instead of parmesan, I used romano.  I will make this again!

This was great!! I made it for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it!  I did cheat and buy a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking chicken breasts, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Probably because I didn't cook my own chicken breast, skipping step 3 all together, it was a little drier than I thought, but it didn't take anything away from the taste! Thanks, this is a keeper for us!

This is a wonderful quick and easy recipe! I substituted a white wine for the chicken broth and it was delicious! Also, for those you want a little more flavorful 'sauce' (as opposed to just tossing it with EVOO), try just a little vinaigrette dressing. I just made up my own with balsamic vinegar. Either way this dish is wonderful!!

I've made this about a dozen times now, always with mushrooms, and I have to double and triple this recipe because, not only does my family make quick work of it, my kids ask for this in their lunch for the next day. I use whole wheat pasta, and it doesn't deter from the flavor. I also LOVE how easy this recipe is, when it comes to taste and health, I couldn't ask for a better meal!!!

I loved this recipe so much I was thinking about making it again while I was eating it.  It got a thumbs up from my husband and my kids (9 & 7).  I added sun dried tomatoed, pine nuts, and artichoke hearts.  Yummmy.  I can't wait to eat the small amount of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was very light, delicious, and easy to make. The only thing I did differently was to add lots more Parmesan cheese at the end - it probably took out a lot of the healthiness of the dish, but it sure made it delicious!

This was very good. I put a lot of seasonings so it won't be bland, but only used what was written in the recipe. I added mushrooms with the chicken so that was good. only fault... too dry. I don't like my pasta swimming in grease either, but this could use SOMETHING. not sure what goes with it though...  this makes a lot of food! i didn't realize the recipe was for 8 so we have a lot of left overs. It barely fit in my 12" deep skillet. i had to be careful when mixing it... and even then things fell out :D next time, i'll half it. anyway, 4 *'s because it was a little too dry for me.

I made per the instructions and then later went back to review others (which I normally do before hand but was under time constraints) and would definitely add in mushrooms or portabellinis, plus veggies that are in season. Agree with others that it needs more garlic - maybe 3-4. I used whole wheat pasta from trader joes which contributed to some of the blandness, but overall with some tweaking makes for a good and healthy dish.

AWESOME!!!! I am totally a new cook (hence the name "novice"). My husband LOVED this recipe and actually went back for seconds which is rare. I did take the suggestions of other viewers and added cayenne pepper, 2-3 garlic cloves and extra garlic powder. I increased the parm to 1 cup. Wonderful filling but not "heavy" pasta dish. Will be in a regular rotation at our house!

Very bland, even after I marinated the chicken in soy, fresh thyme, salt, and pepper. Added mushrooms and onions to the mix, but it still lacked taste.  I will not be making this again.

Marvelous!  Followed others suggestions by halving pasta, upping garlic & broth, adding mushrooms & green onions.  Will definitely be making this again when I have fresh asparagus.

I really enjoyed this.  It is light and simple, but still filling.  As far as specific tips and/or ingredients go, I am not sure because I had to stay at work late and my boyfriend made it...maybe that added to the taste? :)

I'd say I amplified the flavor of this recipe a bit by adding 1/4 onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the chicken while it cooked.  Yummy simple dish!

It was a little bland.  We did enjoy it, but had to continue seasoning after serving.  I even marinated the chicken in balsamic dressing for about 2-3 hrs prior to sauteeing.  Added red peppers and add'l garlic to the saute, too.  In the broth, added frozen spinach and peas.  Extra parm at end.  Still, a bit bland.  I suggest (and will try) including shallots or onions with the garlic next time.

Wow, what a great dish! I worried that  it might not have enough flavor, but I was so wrong! I love things cheesy so added more cheese than was suggested. My husband added red pepper flakes for an added kick. This moved to the front of my recipe box!

This is a really good recipe. Very light and not heavy at all. This recipe does not have a sauce but that is what makes it so light and healthy. Just what I was looking for. The only changes I made to the recipe was adding extra garlic and adding other veggies that I love. Added frozen broccoli and mushrooms to the aspargus and cooked as suggested by recipe.  WONDERFUL-WONDERFUL. This will be a new staple in my home! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Family "disappeared" this one. Next time will use a little more chicken and asparagus if available.  Expect that green beans would work also.

i would definitely make this again. it was so light and yummy and i barely felt any guilt!!! i did add some crimini mushrooms, delicious! i do think the pasta had little flavor because the sauce was really light, but the veggies and chicken had tons of favor so try everything together before u salt it again. i found that the perfect proportions was for 16 oz penne, 2 whole breasts of chicken cubed, 1 cup of broth, a bunch of asaparagus, and a whole bag/box of precut mushrooms.

This was an easy and light meal. Since it's just my husband and I, we had plenty for leftovers the next day. At first I was worried about the chicken to pasta ratio (only two breasts to a whole boxx of pasta), but it was perfect. I used whole wheat penne in place of regular.

As written, tastes pleasant;as expected -nothing fancy.   Decided to add bit of butter, onion powder, chopped onion, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and additional chicken broth.  Picked it up a bit.

I did end up marinating the chicken for a bit beforehand in a garlic and herb marinade. That added a bit of nice flavor. Instead of asparagus I used broccoli and steamed that in with the stock and garlic. The end product yielded a perfect dinner for two and leftovers for lunch tomorrow! The taste is very light, like mentioned, but it is very good!

This recipe was OK, but I prefer saucier pastas. To make it a little less dry, I added half a block of cream cheese. This created a creamy sauce.

BORING!  This recipe really lacked taste.  I really had to doctor it up to get it worthy for the table.I roasted the asparagus to start, after adding the broth & asparagus I had to do something to jazz it up.  I wish I had some white wine- but I didn't so I added more broth after the penne was already in the pan & added some red pepper flakes and some sun dried tomatoes.  After that, it was really good.

This recipe was good.... and was much enjoyed. I haven't made this exact recipe again, but have used it as inspiration to creating my own similar dishes, and experimented with different veggies, seasoning, and cheeses.  I give 4 stars because the original recipe was very good, but didn't quite make it into my favorites.

This was a good starter, but it needed quite a bit of tweaking.  I make a similar dish with zucchini & mushrooms, doused with a healthy helping of pesto mixed in.  It adds a wonderful flavor.

This was a delicious recipe! Since it's just my hubby and I, I really downsized the recipe.  I only used 1 large chicken breast, less than half of a 14.5 oz box of pasta (I used Ronzo Smart Taste, it's a white pasta but 6 grams of fiber and 6 gm of protein). Everything else I downsized a bit and did add a little red pepper for pizazz.  I didn't have any onions, but used onion powder and minced garlic. We even had a little left over for a snack the next day and it was better the next day! Thanks for a great recipe, I'll definitely make this again! **Update, I made this the other night and skipped the red pepper, sauteed some fresh mushrooms and onion, and added some frozen peas. Delish!**

I really enjoyed this dish, and follwed the suggestion to saute 1/2 an onion, chopped, after cooking the chicken and adding the broth right to the onion.  I thought it lacked a little in flavor, but by adding extra parmesan cheese, you can make up for this.  Very light and delicious!

We really liked this easy recipe. I added mushrooms and a little extra chicken broth. I also used whole wheat penne. We did not find it dry and the flavors were just right. 
I will make this again.

My daughter & I both loved it!
This is definitely a keeper.

This was a lovely recipe, that looked and tasted like a good restauarnt pasta dish.  I made a few changes, substituting salt with seasoning salt and using crushed garlic.  I also used 12 oz of whole wheat pasta, and just because I thought it would add nice colour, I added a diced tomato, though I don't think it made much difference to the flavour.  I will be making this often.

I made this for dinner last night because i wanted to do something healthy & light. It was just perfect! To give a little more flavor, I added half a can of diced tomatoes and doubled the chicken. My boyfriend (who is a very picky eater) seemed to very much enjoy this!

I thought this was a good recipe...I made a few changes though.  I added balsamic vinegar to the asparagus when I steamed it, used LOTS of fresh garlic, and melted in some feta cheese to the chicken/asparagus mixture before I tossed it with the penne.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not a big asparagus fan!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I changed it up a little, and made it as a side dish instead of a main replacing the chicken with fresh mushrooms.  I also sauted fresh minced garlic in the oil before adding the veggies.  This was nice and light and something I will be adding to the keeper file.  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to looneytoons for the recommendation.

Very easy and very tasty.  I fed this to my incredibly picky children and they ate it up.  I normally don't use frozen vegetables, but for this recipe I used frozen asparagus.  You would have never known there was a difference.  Also, I had to add and extra 1/2 cup of water.  There was one thing I didn't like.  It wasn't hot (temp).  After I added cooled chicken to the asparagus and then added the noodle and finally letting it sit there for 5 Minutes.  It cooled down a little more than I would have liked.  Overall a great recipe...I'll definitely make it again.

Reviewers comments were very useful for this recipe. I ued half the penne pasta, used entirely fresh garlic (and added three cloves all together - one when cooking the chicken, two when cooking the asparagus), increased the chicken broth to 3/4 cup and added 1 tbsp lemon juice at the same time. This variation was very good.

I thought this was great, but I made a couple of changes.  I just made it for myself but I like leftovers for lunch so I made 2 cups of pasta.  I only used 1 Tbls of Olive Oil to cook the chicken.  I put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chicken.  When cooking the asparagus, I put 1 cup of chicken broth and 2 garlic cloves( I did not find it dry at all).  After I put the chicken back in, I drizzled a little bit of fat free greek dressing and I thought it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe, I hope this review helps others!

Mmmmm, just okay.  It lacked savory flavor.  Not nearly enough seasoning and spice for me.  It was pretty weak.

This was very light and delicious.  Easy to make too.  I did find that it needed a bit of salt to liven it up and I will add an extra clove or two of garlic next time.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  Even my picky 3 and 4 year olds ate without complaint!

This was easy and delicious!  My family gobbled this up and the fresh asparagus was a delight!  Very fresh and light.  I would use fresh garlic for a stronger garlic flavor next time.  Great dish.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  The only change I made was to take another reviewer's suggestion to add 4 T of Italian dressing towards the end of stovetop cooking.  I'll be making this one again!

Good,but a little bland for us. It was better when I reheated the leftovers and added a teaspoon of "better than boullion" chicken base.  I'll probably add this if I make it again.

Very Good, scaled down for 4 servings, added sauteed red pepper, onion & mushroom, added the asparagus to the pan for a few minutes, then added the broth, and continued with the recipe. Bread & Wine made it a complete meal.

This is good for a throw together quick dinner. I am going to try different toppings instead of parmesian. Maybe orange juice and soy sauce. Or Lime juice, soy and garlic. Or maybe olive oil and lemon juice.

Okay. Make sure to brine the chicken first! A little dry. Not much sauce. Next time make it with a creme sauce.

This was just ok.  I made it for dinner last night and was disappointed.  I thought there was way too much pasta for only 2 chicken breasts and 1/2 c chicken broth.  Though my husband liked it, i think it would be better with about half the pasta.

Great recipe!  However while simmering the olive oil I added fresh garlic to flavor it rather than garlic salt or power.  Worked like a charm and tasted great !!

This recipe, believe it or not, was the first time I have eaten asparagus (and I am 42).This was simply delicious!! I did use 3 diced chicken breasts and put the chicken broth, that was left in the can, into the pasta and I believe that kept the pasta moister.  This is the PERFECT recipe for a hot evening when you don't want a heavy meal and feel very good about eating healthy.  Kudos to Laurel!

I really liked this for it quickness and basic ingrediants.  I didn't have penne so I used small shell and didn't have the cheese so I will try it again with all the ingrediants but I can definatly see this as something you can play with depending on what you have on hand.

I made this for my husband who has heart disease. I put less salt, and parmesan cheese, and I made it with whole grain penne instead of the white noodles. I served it with a hearty salad, and he was thrilled, I will for sure make this again...

My whole family likes this recipe.  I use either protein enhanced pasta, or lentil pasta with it, and green beans work just as well as the asparagus.  My picky meat and potatoes husband enjoys this recipe, as does my 12 year old son.

Made this for dinner and discovered I need to modify to a lesser scale for two people.  What a great and simple recipe.  My husband felt it was a little tame for his taste and asked if I could make some type of sauce to put on it.  Oh, the possibilities!  I think I will try making an alfredo type sauce and see if he likes that.  Thank you.

Thanks, Laurel. My husband has had to switch to a lower sodium diet, so I have been looking at a lot of recipes. I like to read the reviews but find them confusing.  People rate the recipes,  but cook them totally different. Every review has a change made to it. Some change up the entire recipe. I cooked this as is and really liked it.

It was great, my dad says, “one of the best meals I’ve ever had!” Since I am twelve, I needed something easy to cook for my family, and this fully fit the description! Definitely be careful with the pepper, it was a tolerable spice, but could’ve been better.

I will make this again, it was wonderful. I added a little heavy whip cream and a splash of white wine. And, I think the key was the pasta, good quality dried pasta made this dish even more amazing.

This recipe sounded so plain to me, like it would be "boring", but it is quite good as a week-night recipe.  Since I wanted to make it without meat, I used Quorn Chick'n Tenders in place of the chicken breasts called for, and the Quorn was really good.  Only other change I made was to add a little extra chicken broth--about 1/2 cup more.  I used a 1-lb bundle of asparagus, using the top 2/3 of the spears.    Would have used more asparagus if I'd had it!

It was very fresh tasting, full of flavor & fabulous.  I will definitely make it again.  The only thing I did differently was to omit garlic powder & use minced garlic only.  I also threw in some fresh stringless pea pods along with the asparagus.Hubby loved it too.

Healthy, quick , and easy but not much flavor. 
I added a sesame dressing and was much better. 
Would suggest adding any dressing that you like. 
Otherwise, way too bland.

I enjoyed it but lacked in flavor. I added mushrooms and broccoli with a lot more garlic. I also added a lot more chicken broth. Will I make this again.? Yes. Definitely.

I really like this dish.  I had a red bell pepper and an onion that needed to be used up, so in they went with the asparagus.  I love garlic, so I used 4 cloves.
I needed more broth than the recipe called for,  so used an additional half cup.
Very tasty. Don’t be afraid to be generous with the salt and pepper.

I do not like pasta sauces containing pieces of chicke, This reminds me of a pasta dish you might find on a chalk board on an Irish-American pub restaurant. Yhey have to do something with leftover chicken. It's not very good, sorry.

While this was not terrible, we didn't find it to be extra great either. It felt unfinished. Will not make again.

I enjoyed this last night for dinner and again today for lunch (good leftover!)  I made it as directed, increasing the garlic.  When I make it again, I will not add the browned chicken until after the pasta has soaked up the broth.  The chicken looked (and tasted) so delicious (golden brown), but after sitting in the broth and pasta mixture, the golden brown disappeared, and it looked like boiled chicken.  Still tasted good, I just think it would look more appetizing with golden brown chicken chunks.

Very flavorful. Since I'm eating very healthy, I baked a spaghetti squash instead of cooking pasta.  Super healthy. Will definitely make this again. Was thinking of adding some angel/cherry tomatoes next time.

Good starting point, we went with boneless skinless chicken thighs which give it a lot more flavor.  We also went with smaller pasta (large rings) which we also liked better.  We plan on jazzing it up next time adding things like sauteed leeks  or shallots or maybe a few sun dried tomato or red pepper for color.  Overall a good tasty dish.

made this with the mushroom addition tonight.  The only change I made was using cauliflower rice in place of the penne.  it was a hit!  Even my husband who is not an asparagus fan ate it and said it was worthy of being made again.

Yum! 
I used sheep's milk pecorino cheese instead of parmesan because we do not tolerate cow's milk. 
Precooked, shredded chicken made it super easy - I did saute the meat with garlic and Italian herb blend. 
Ended up needing more than 1/4 cup chicken broth.

Quick and easy! I cut the pasta in half as we like a higher proportion of meat. I used white wine instead of broth and added italian seasoning.

The dish looked and tasted very bland.  I had to add diced tomatoes and tomato sauce to get it acceptable for the group I was going to serve it to.

This was a SUPER easy meal to make and is a new family favorite.
I cannot say I followed the recipe to the letter(I view them as suggestions, a reference point) but it really did produce a savory meal that had family asking for seconds!
Tank you for sharing it with us.

I made this exactly as written (Can't really rate it if I've changed it, now can I??).  It was a nice, pleasant meal, but nothing spectacular.  I think if I were to make it again, I would add 1/2c heavy cream - although, that would negate the "light" portion of the description.

We enjoyed it, but I made a few changes. First of all, I only used about 10 oz of penne. I also added mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, extra Parmesan, extra chicken broth, and some milk. Tons of leftovers, but we love leftovers!

I made this using whole wheat penne and extra garlic, just because we really like it. It came out very well. I did remove the olive oil from the skillet when the chicken was done, because it didn't specify to do so, but there was still a lot in the skillet. I'm not sure if I was supposed to do that or leave, but I am glad I did. I used a lot of pepper and a fair amount of salt and garlic powder to give it plenty of flavor. I also used a parmesan wedge and grated it and I think that gave it a much better end result than the pre-shredded or grated stuff that is a powder-like consistency would. My husband is kind of picky, but loves asparagus and he liked it and my step-daughter who is pretty picky and doesn't like asparagus much still ate it without complaining so that's a win for a slightly healthier meal in my house.

This was very good. I did make a few changes, though to spice up the chicken.  I sauteed about a cup of chopped onion and 2 tbs  minced garlic in olive oil before adding the chicken. I added the chicken to the onion mixture with a little dried basil, oregano and parsley. Very good! Thanks.

Was ok. Needs more spice. Added crushed red pepper and used Italian seasoning and fresh rosemary and redStill missing something. Next time, going to add mushrooms, and sugar snap peas. Added can of cream of chicken soup with the pasta with 1/4 cup lemon juice and smoked paprika.

We love this recipe! The only thing I do differently is I use boneless/skinless  chicken legs and thighs instead of breasts. I bread the meat with a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese and pan fry in olive oil. I always use more Parmesan at the end too-usually at least a cup.

The recipe calls for way to much Penne!  I used only about 1/2 of it.  It was tasty but I sure have a lot of pasta left over.  I didn't mix all of it together.  It tasted good though.

This is quick and easy and very tasty. I used twice the recommended number of breast halves (4 or 5 oz per serving), and that was a nice amount to make this a hearty one-dish meal. I cooked the chicken and asparagus while the pasta was boiling, and then dumped the chicken and hot pasta into the sautée pan with the asparagus, which was cooked to perfection after 5 minutes of steaming. The meal was ready, start to finish, in 15 or 20 minutes. This didn’t have the real wow factor required for 5 stars, but it was great, given how quick and easy it was to make. It would be good with a tomato or creamy alfredo sauce too, so next time I will change it up a bit with one of those.

I followed the recipe as written just substituted the asparagus with broccoli and used whole wheat pasta. This was just what I was looking for. I’m trying to change my eating habits and this lite version of pasta was perfect.

This is actually a great dish for my high blood pressure. I made it for my wife and she in turn made one for me for my birthday(mine was better, don't tell her that). I will implement it with this diet plan that I am currently using now

I made it, absolutely delicious.  I didn’t have any chicken breasts thawed so I used Tyson frozen chicken strips. When they were cooked I cut them into bite size pieces.  Will definitely make again.

On a low-sodium diet so I made a few changes to this recipe: marinated the chicken first with lemon, black peppers, olive oil, and garlic; no salt added; no cheese added

I mostly followed the recipe, but I happened to have some fresh baby vidalia onions, so I add some of the white part.  I also used gluten free penne.  It was delicious!

The problem with this recipe is that there are not ample measurements of  asparagus, chicken, and flavoring ingredients to carry a full pound of pasta.  Even doctoring it as some have suggested to make a bit of moistening sauce was to no avail.  It was difficult to find the chicken and asparagus in that huge pan of pasta and the flavor was lacking.   For me, a waste of time and ingredients.  I won't make this again.

It was great! I added pepper to the chicken for more seasoning. I also substituted Manteca for butter for more flavoring.

Very good. Wife just made it tonight, chicken and pasta were done very nicely. Suggestion:  a nice spice like oregano, basil or rosemary. it could use a bit more zest.

Very easy to make and very tasty. I mad a few changes like adding more shredded parmesan and whole grain penne noodles. Next time maybe half a box of noodles as I was only feeding 3 and now have a lot of leftover pasta.

My family loved this light pasta dish and I loved the ease and simplicity  of one dish meal that was ready in less than 45 minutes ! It was a nice change from the pasta dishes with cream, cheese sauce or any other pasta sauce... Most of the flavor is supposed to come from the garlic, broth and Permesan cheese, but I couldn't  help adding some herbs too.

Add some andouille sausage and a little more spices (red pepper flake, smoked paprika), and it's awesome.  I also top with mozzarella and fresh basil and broil till cheese is melted. Super good.

This was very easy, but I thought it could have used more flavor.  I  made it pretty much as written, sprinkling the salt, pepper and garlic powder frequently.  I used 8 oz of broth only because I didn't want to throw away the rest of the container, but it may have been too much.  I used about 1/3-1/2 a large bag of asparagus and wished I had used more.  I do like a creamier sauce but my husband does not, so this light broth worked well for him.

I made this for myself and my husband last night--we both loved it. Instead of olive oil, I cooked the chicken in garlic oil which gave it a little bit more flavor. I used slightly more broth with the asparagus and added probably way more Parmesan... turned out great for us! Next time I make it, we may add some sauteed onions or tomatoes.

Super yummy! I sautéed the chicken in onions and added paprika, oregano, and basil to the seasonings. I also added mushrooms to the dish (sautéed them after removing the chicken and before adding the stock and asparagus). A hunk of butter mixed in at the end also added a nice touch - will make again!

We have made this 2 times so far and it turned out great both times. It's a pretty simple recipe. I add a little extra Parmesan because we like it. Our boys don't care for asparagus too much so they eat some and then pick around the asparagus. We will definitely make it again.

I did some altering of the original recipe due to the ingredients I had on hand. I decreased the measurement of olive oil to 3 tablespoons. I used 10 oz of Penne, and Italian 6-cheese blend. My 13-month old granddaughter LOVED it! I think it was yummy too, and I will be making it again! I do intend on adding fresh mushrooms the next time.

This was super easy to make and delicious!  I added a bit more garlic and the other spices and used a bit more parmesan cheese than what was called for, and it turned out awesome!

Made a couple changes form the recipe.

1. I used white wine instead of chicken broth.
2. I used bacon grease instead of oil.
3. I used bacon (from previous step).
4. I used mushrooms.

It was really good. Especially after rendering all that bacon fat and sauteing both vegetables and chicken in.

This was a favorite amongst my little sister (who is an extremely picky eater). The only suggestion would be for a sauce, cream of mushroom perhaps.

Love to read reviews and after reading many  of  these it became clear that this is basic recipe that it  can be dressed  up with anything? you have on hand. I personally changed it up by putting on chicken prior to cooking  paprika , Mrs Dash,  white pepper, onion powder and of course garlic powder then added a dash of Italian dressing. When it came time to veggies i sauted  some mushrooms in the chicken pan when wilted I added broth garlic and asparagus, as instructed covered it for five minutes. Added a TBL spoon of butter before adding the  chicken veggie mixture. Tasted really good and it was fun to make!

It was good. I agree with some others, it was a little bland and no creaminess or sauce to speak of. I substituted shrimp for the chicken.

A wonderful dish!  I provided my own personal touches as follows:
I used 4 large garlic cloves instead of one. Added fresh crimini mushrooms, thick sliced, as well as made it creamy with 1/3 a package of creamed cheese and a little milk. White wine was also added and more of the chicken broth as I like it more moist than the original recipe.  I also gave a couple shakes of red pepper flakes and probably a quarter teaspoon of tumeric for a little flavoring. Made this twice and it was superb!!  Not hard at all, just a little chopping. Try it, you'll like it!

I liked the asparagus addition to this dish.  I added 1 1/2 c. sliced mushrooms at the end and also increased the broth to 1c. with 2 TBSP of cornstarch to thicken it.

Wonderful as it is, but I did add a couple things. I used some Mediterranean spicings on the meat and squeezed the juice of a half lemon over the dish and tossed prior to serving up. It added a nice dimension to the flavor.

We liked the dish overall, but I made some changes. I added broccoli because it's a big hit in my house and it helped extend the recipe a bit. I added a few extra garlic cloves, lots of seasoning salt, and it was still pretty bland. We're trying to figure out what to add to flavor it up a bit. Overall, a great base to start from

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.   I made it with wheat rotini (all I had on hand) and it was very good!   I the followed recipe exactly and just added a splash of milk to make it a bit creamier.  Topped it off with some crispy, yummy bacon......DELISH!  We will make this again!

Left the servings alone and made with one large breast, added Italian seasoning, montreal and extra garlic.  Didn't saute in the oil since the chicken was still a little frozen, drizzled just a little olive oil on it at the end, good flavor

This was very good but of course, we made a few changes.  Cooked the chicken breasts immediately before cooking the pasta.  Heat pan to medium high heat.  Add some Olive oil to the pan.  Sear the (washed, salt & peppered) chicken for 4 minutes, turn, then sear for 3 minutes.  Turn off heat and cover pan. Allow to finish cooking while completing the other steps.  We used the chicken drippings along with the entire can of chicken broth.  

We didn't see much thickening so we used a small amount (2 T) of cornstarch mixed into 1/4 c cold water.  Added to the dish at the end and simmered for 10 minutes.  

So that the chicken wouldn't be overcooked, we cut it into bite sized pieces and put them at the bottom of each pasta dish. 

We placed the asparagus in hot, boiling water for 3 minutes. Then dipped it into cold water so the asparagus remained bright green and not over cooked.  Chopped the asparagus into bite sized pieces. Stirred it into the pasta.

Then we covered the chicken with the pasta/asparagus mixture.  

Sprinkled a small amount of parmesan on top.

Chicken remained tender. Delightful meal. Family loved it. No leftovers.

Very good pasta dish. Added Mrs Dash to chicken before cooking and added a squeeze of lemon at the end, besides that, followed the recipe exactly. Awesome recipe!

It wasn't very flavorful in my opinion. I ended up adding viniagrette to give it some punch. Won't be making it again.

We loved this!  However, we did make a few modifications after reading the other reviews.  We added mushrooms, artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and onion.  It had great flavor without a heavy sauce.

Made this today and I was sampling as I cooked it .. to me as a non professional chef by any means I have to be creative with a family of 5 here to feed ... i generally I use the initial recipe as a guideline only I felt this one needed a bit of customizing on my end so I added a tablespoon of ginger, garlic and chile  to add a little heat as well as I added an additional cup of the broth ...and peppered to taste .... the spice was just perfect

I used frozen cubed chicken, but frozen chicken strips with seasoning might taste good also.  Could add some petite diced tomatoes also for a little more flavor and color. Everyone in the family loved it and went back for more...including my grandkids!

I forgot to get broth, but since I like my asparagus slightly mushy, I just tossed water, cubed chicken, and asparagus in the pan and simmered it with about 2 tsp. of olive oil, five cloves of pressed garlic, salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme. The water, of course, became the broth, and everything took on a nice flavor. Near the end, I added diced summer squash for some extra flavor, then I added the Parmesan and pre-cooked penne at the end. And though it was 'close but no cigar' to the original, it turned out great.

I would start  steps 2 thru 4 when the water starts boiling for the pasta, otherwise the pasta gets a little too cool.

It tasted like a restaurant dish. 
I read through reviews and made adjustments where they made sense. 
I would definitely make it again, however, I would use less oil next time.

Absolutely wonderful, so fresh and tasty.  I was liberal with the chicken broth and added a couple tablespoons of butter.  I didn't put anything on the penne but I had more than a cup of liquid with the asparagus.  I let that rest for a bit then put the parmesan directly on the platted pasta.

Followed the recipe as is.  First, I'd like to say this recipe makes a ton of food.  I should have cut it in half for three people.  The taste was good,  but it really could have used some kind of a sauce.  We ended up with a plate of good food that was dry, think of it as if you was eating a plate of penne pasta  after it was drained but without any sauce or moisture added.   Tonight I'm having leftovers, but I plan to make an alfredo sauce to add when I serve it, hopefully that will give it the moisture it needs and add more flavor.

My son-in-law nearly ate the whole meal by himself !  I did add a handful of low fat grate/shred mozzarella. I loved it!  I agree with marinating the chicken before cooking. Next time, I will marinate.  Thanks Lauren!

We loved it. However I did adjust a few things. I made a very light Alfredo sauce with 4 oz of light cream cheese,  1/2 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup broth, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, garlic and pepper to taste.  I also added mushrooms. I was very happily impressed with this recipe!

I made this with olive oils instead of chicken broth and it was REALLY good. I also replaced the penne pasta with orzo.

Love this recipe exactly as it is. If you're looking for a light meal with excellent flavor. The asparagus gives a wonderful flavor to the pasta.

Tasty, simple, light dish. My wife and I have it regularly. Good as written, but for our tastes I replace the garlic powder with more fresh garlic, use 10-12 ounces of pasta rather than 16, and steam the asparagus for 4-5 minutes rather than 5-10.

Delicious! Great summer night's meal. Light, fast, easy and tasty. If you like a little more sauce in your pasta, add 1/2 cup of cream to the asparagus mixture for extra moisture.

I marinated the chicken in the broth and Italian seasonings overnight and added chopped artichoke hearts for a little more zip. Very nice but next time I'll cut back on the pasta as suggested by others.

This was an excellent recipe. I was a little nervous about the asparagus but it all paired well together. I did make the sauce creamier as other reviewers had mentioned and it was amazing.

This is fantastic!!  My children ask me to make it at least once a week. I used better than bouillon soup starter mixed with water in place of the chicken broth to add more flavor.  I also use the shredded Parmesan cheese.

I  added mushrooms and a few halved cherry tomatoes to add more color. Cut back on the pasta .. ratio to chicken seemed off.  This recipe is easy and the flavor is amazing! Even  better the second day.

After reading the other reviews, I took some of the suggestions. I added onion, extra garlic, fresh mushrooms and halved grape tomatoes to the asparagus. Then, I added about 3 oz. of cream cheese and a little milk/flour to thicken the sauce a little.  

Don't skimp on the salt, pepper and garlic...next time I will add a little more. I will also add some red pepper for added flavor and color. Then, it will warrant a 5 star rating!

I LOVED this recipe and will definitely put it on my rotating roster of meals!  I followed some of the suggestions by adding lemon juice (about one lemon squeezed - half while veggies were cooking and the other half to taste after everything was mixed together), more garlic, and mushrooms.  I eased up on the olive oil - maybe used 3 tablespoons total, and most of it was used for cooking the chicken.  I also used spiral instead of penne pasta.  It is not a heavy recipe, so there is no sauce, but I read the reviews and knew what to expect.  The best part about this recipe is that it makes fantastic leftovers - it's like a stew that tastes better the second day after all the flavors have time to really melt into each other. I read a review that said it didn't do well as leftovers, so maybe the addition of lemon juice helps? I'm really weird about leftover chicken, but I reheated it all in a pan with just a little chicken broth and it didn't have that leftover chicken taste at all.

My first review!

Made it with veggie penne pasta.  Followed most of the recipe, with just a little less garlic with the asparagus and added lemon pepper to the spices.   My two teens demolished it and asked that it be added to my dinner rotation!

I marinated chicken in Italian dressing for a short time. Used only 12oz of pasta.  Added mushrooms and cooked them with the chicken.  Then I followed the review by tinmanfrisbe.  THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER!!! I loved this dish. I did alter it ( I am sure it great the way it was posted, but I wanted something creamier). After I cooked the chicken ( I marinated it in italian dressing before cooking) I cooked the asparagus in 1 c broth, minced garlic, salt and pepper but only for like 3 minutes because I wanted it pretty crispy. Then I sprained out the asparagus, leaving broth in the sauce pan and added 3 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and about 1/4 cup milk. I whisked this until smooth then added the chicken and asparagus then coated it. Then I added the pasta and topped with more parmesan cheese. I seriously had 3 helpings of it and want to eat more. I am going to try it the original way next time, but for a wintery comfort food it was AMAZING (if I do say so myself)!Cooked asparagus in 1 cup of chicken broth, garlic, salt pepper.  After I removed the asparagus from the liquid, I put 3 oz of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese stirred till smooth and then put pasta, chicken, mushroom and asparagus in and tossed till coated.

I added a leek and a shallot after browning the chicken. Also I tossed my homemade pesto sauce over the penne before adding the chicken mix to it.  I think some sauteed mushrooms would be nice to this too.

May be the best 'first time made' pasta recipe I've ever made. Cut back on pasta quantity, but kept all other ingredients at 8 serving recommended quantities. Wonderful, easy to make, easy clean up, hit with others. Was very cautious to not over cook any ingredient. Excellent.

I made this for my husband who likes asparagus. This is what he calls comfort food. I liked this also and I don't really like asparagus. This is a recipe that,will get the pickiest eaters to eat their  veggies.  Thank you Laurel B. for the recipe.

This is a bland dish for  simple palates. The sauce disappears once the dish is finished. Next time I will use at least 1 cup of broth. Also I used a lot of seasonings but it was still bland. Use very thin asparagus for this dish. Consider adding red pepper flakes

I thought this was a great dish.  I added Kraft's Parmesean, Romano and Asiago schredded cheese for a little bolder flavor and some crushed red pepper which I add to any pasta. Reading the reviews, next time I will add mushrooms and maybe a light cream sauce.  I like this dish because of the limited number of ingredients and its simple.

Delicious! I cut way down on the oil and just used enough to cover the bottom of the pan for the chicken, and didn't add any at the end. Also used feta instead of parmesan, and it definitely added some nice flavor.

I used the basic recipe and then incorporated others' suggestions - sautéed mushrooms, onions, doubling broth, adding white wine, adding feta as well as parmesan.  It exceeded our expectations and I'll make pretty often.  Also, I cut the oil down to about half.  Thanks, everyone, for the recipe and your suggestions!

I would definitely make this again. I marinated 2 chicken breasts in garlic Italian dressing all day. Seasoned the breasts wiell with Emerils Poultry seasoning. Cooked the chicken in olive oil for about 5 minutes and then cut it up. I added it to the asparagus broth mixture while it was simmering with the fresh garlic. It smelled wonderful. Then tossed all that together with the penne pasta. It was so tasty! the hubby got seconds so that tells me this is a keeper and it was so easy. the Parmesan cheese on top really adds a great flavor.

I thought this was a great, fresh recipe.  I tripled the asparagus and doubled everything else.  This would be great with an alfredo recipe, but I just sprinkled a good amount of mozzarella on each dish.  My whole family enjoyed it.

This was the first time making this dish.  It is very easy and makes a fast meal.  That said, we found it bland.  After reading all the other reviews I found that just about everyone altered it in someway.     We will try this again but will definitely try some of the ideas posted.

This recipe was fabulous.  I used 2 cups Penne.  When the pasta was drained, I poured a little olive oil over it and mixed in the parmesan cheese.  Served it with plenty more parmesan cheese shredded over top along with fresh cracked pepper.  Cooked the chicken with garlic as well.  Also added mushrooms as suggested by the author of the recipe.

I had to beef up the seasonings so I added extras of what's on the list plus a generous helping of Italian seasoning and lemon.  I also added extra olive oil and parmesan cheese before serving per suggestions.  Family only picked at their dinner.  So disappointed.

This recipe sounded very good but it was so bland that I had to add so much extra spices and garlic for it to be edible. It was so dry with no sauce that I added extra chicken stock and spices to the pan with flour to make a sauce. Then I mixed the sauce in and it was good. Instead of giving it 5 stars based upon the changes I made, I'm rating it based upon what it was like before I improved it in order to serve it to my family.

I just made this and boy did it go over well!!  Let me start off by being honest and telling you that I am not a good cook. I don't particularly like cooking, and I'm not particularly good at it.   This recipe was so nice and easy though that I actually enjoyed making it and I really enjoyed all the raves I got from the results. My husband said about 5 times that it was delicious. Then he said it was one of the best things I have ever made. My five-year-old daughter also raved about it. I had all clean plates tonight!   I typed in "asparagus and chicken recipe" online and this was the second recipe that came up.  I made it just like the recipe says except for I didn't have any chicken broth so I had to use bouillon, and I didn't have any penne pasta so I used a long macaroni.   It turned out absolutely delicious. I will definitely make it again. My family loved it, I loved it, and it was easy. I think next time I will try fresh Parmesan cheese if I can remember to buy some. I only had the grated, processed Parmesan cheese in the shaker can,  so that's what I used. It turned out great, but I bet fresh Parmesan would be just delicious. The only other problem with this recipe is that it wasn't enough. I'm going to have to double up next time. Thanks so much for a new great easy recipe that I can make for my family.

This was pretty good, and my 2 year old twins liked it a lot. Next time I would add more asparagus, and add onion. I did add mushrooms and some yellow peppers to add some more Vegies that worked well.

Loved it! The first time I used a bag of frozen broccoli instead of asparagus and my daughter, who tends to not eat chicken or green veggies, gobbled up a big portion. I used half the amount of pasta it called for and it was the perfect ratio. The second time I used asparagus and she was less enthused. I thought it was great though. I used five ounces of whole wheat penne and it was plenty. Way too many carbs with a whole box of pasta.

Was great! I added red bell pepper and onions to the mix. And some lemon pepper to the chicken. Yummy.

Absolutely a hit with everyone here, from ages 3 - 60.   Mixed half the chicken/asparagus with whole grain penne pasta and half with gluten-free pasta.  Each was delicious.  
The beauty of this recipe is not just the ease of making, but the very healthy ingredients.  Some reviews suggest adding things that negate this attribute.  Not a big deal, but be aware.  I highly suggest leaving the basics as-is at least the first time you try it, so you'll know if you need tons of not-as-healthy additions.  Because I know our taste buds, I did double the garlic, and added a dash of crushed red pepper when returning the chicken to the pan.  I also used homemade chicken bone broth (fat skimmed off first) that is very reduced for a rich, full flavor.  I truly appreciate this recipe.  I'd give it more than five stars if I could!

I love this recipe, although I confess to making a slight change at the end.  I made it as written the first time, but  I prefer a creamier pasta dish, so I added a bit of cream cheese and milk (I also used cream in a pinch once) at the end.  Really delicious recipe.

Needs more flavor, maybe more cheese and/or capers.  Would make again with some slight modifications to suit our tastes.

This was pretty good, we'll be making it again. Added some broccoli from our garden and had garlic bread on the side, and it turned out really well. Definitely makes you feel like you're having a healthy dinner! (Oh my god I just realized we forgot to add the Parmesan cheese at the end, oops. Well, next time I'll remember, and maybe it will be a 5 star when I actually remember all the ingredients!) EDIT: It's way better when you remember the Parmesan cheese, haha, 5 stars! (Second Edit:) We've been making this a lot, and now that I've got the hang of it, it's easily my favorite recipe from this website. It's so fun and easy to make, it's great for left overs, and it's delicious with garlic bread (one my favorite side dishes). It even looks pretty when you're done cooking it! Don't miss out on this one, give it a try!

My wife made this...and it's my new favorite meal! It made ALOT which meant I had plenty of great leftovers.  The family kept picking out and eating the asparagus so we did add fresh asparagus to the leftovers...but I sure didn't mind.  Thank you for posting!!

I mix my own Italian salad dressing mix (dry herbs and sugar) and sprinkle that over the veggies as they cook. I use asiago cheese when I have it and mozzarella or Parmesan when I don't. I double the amount of cheese because I always throw in sliced sweet peppers. The family likes it best with fettuccine pasta cut into pieces. The whole family goes gaga over it!

A nice light dish but as another reviewer suggested I cut down the pasta amount and slightly otherwise I would have had too much pasta overwhelming the dish.

Awesome healthy pasta dish. I doubled the chicken broth and thickened it a bit with cornstarch at the end. For contrast I added a small amount of chopped sun-dried tomatoes (not the kind in oil). Will definitely prepare again; thanks for a great recipe.

Nothing fancy or memorable, but a good staple to keep in the recipe rotation.  I tried to use a little less olive oil, but it needs the moisture of 3-4 tbsp.  Asparagus steams perfectly.  Warms up well for leftovers.

This is a great, quick, weeknight meal.  I used Veggie Penne. Get the pasta and asparagus going at the same time and the prep time is less than advertised.

This wasn't bad, exactly as its written.  Will need to modify some things if I was to make it again. I like what one person said about putting the chicken on the indoor grill, will incorporate that idea. I personally like garlic, so I'll probably add more.  Also some more seasonings, like the red pepper flakes suggested by one person. We did like that this really did feel like a lighter meal, which is much needed after the holidays! With that in mind, I won't change that aspect of the recipe. 
But everyone here really needs to rate the original recipe, not one that you've altered already.

I followed the recipe exactly and was satisfied with the results!  This was my first attempt at cooking a light meal and was surprised with how tasty it was. Now I'm sure if you add a few ingredients to compliment it all like a creamy sauce it would be even better, but that isn't why I'm trying to cook light haha.

After reading everyone's reviews I changed it a bit.  I sautéed the chicken with crushed garlic to give it a little flavor.  Then when mixing everything together I added sautéed mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and cherry tomatoes and let it cook together until the tomatoes were ready to pop, plus more chicken broth when everything was warming together.  Right at the end I added fresh basil.  Plus I only used about 2/3rds of the pasta, otherwise it would have been a very boring pasta dish.  This is a good base pasta recipe but needs additional items to give it some more flavor and color.

This was a great recipe. I used andouille sausage instead of chicken and added 1/2 cup of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of skim milk to the sauce instead of the chicken broth to make it a bit creamier. I ate 2 helpings and wanted more!

I was worried this would be bland, but I went with 4 cloves of garlic instead of one, about a Tbs of butter instead of olive oil for the last step, and a hearty sprinkle of red pepper flakes and I was pleasantly surprised!

I made this without any alterations except for a generous squeeze of lemon at the end.  The addition of mushrooms is on my list for the next time.  Very tasty!

This is delicious. I followed the recipe, but I ended up adding more liquid as needed. I also added mushrooms (as suggested by the submitter) and a splash of white wine. The recipe is healthy and easy to prepare. I know the ingredients seem simple but give them a try.

Some changes, but this produced an very tasty casserole! I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and about 1/2 cup of frozen peas. Also sauteed 2 cloves of fresh garlic (instead of garlic powder), and about 1/4 cup chopped onion along with the asparagus (used leftover roasted chicken, so didn't put in the sautee pan). Put all into a casserole dish, baked for 30 minutes, and topped with the cheese. We're huge fans of chicken casseroles, and my family said this was among the best I've made.

This recipe was ok...I liked it, but nothing over the top!  I had to change the recipe, which I never do and I hate too, but I broke my foot and could not drive to the store to get asparagus so I needed to use broccoli instead.  In the end I needed to add a lot of Parmesan Cheese.

Delicious!  Tasting along the way, I decided to add a 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil.  Gave it a light summery taste.  We'll make it again for sure!  Thanks for sharing.

This is quite delicious and just the kind of pasta I love, not too creamy but lots of flavour!!  I upped the garlic, 5 cloves and I used 1/2 the pasta, since were cutting back on carbs. Overall this is was awesome, I will make it again for certain.

I give this recipe 4 stars only because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain remaining chicken broth from asparagus... SO I kind of ran with it especially after reading the "bland" and "dry" reviews.  :)  I added the remaining chicken broth from my 32oz box to the steaming asparagus (I was cooking for hubby and his guys from work so I was already stretching the serving size plus, I really like things saucy!) I added juice of 1 fresh squeezed lemon ( if too lemony add half cube of chicken bouillon to sauce) At this time the sauce is pure liquid, obviously... so in order to thicken it up a bit in a separate dish I added 2 tbs of the sauce and mixed in 2 tbs of corn starch and 1 tbs flour (bc im never quite sure if the cornstarch will actually do its job...) stirred the thick concoction into the sauce, stirred until right texture then added chicken to mixture. Mixed with penne pasta. Man.... zesty fresh and just a bit heavier to satisfy the "men folk"  ;)     PS. Also added mushrooms.  Just delightful!

Just made this and it is fantastic!  I used 2 breasts from a rotisserie chicken and added a couple of T of butter instead of more olive oil at the end, but other than those 2 changes made exactly as written.  I was waiting on the pasta to finish cooking the prep time was so easy and quick!  I also put fresh ground pepper on our plates, just because I like it, but would be good if not.  You could add many more veggies: tomatoes, squash, mushrooms, whatever, but be sure to use the asparagus, it's perfect!  A nice light quick meal that looks a lot more sophisticated, it's a keeper!

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments after reading the reviews. I also added Mrs.Dash, Garlic/ onion seasoning as my first taste was quite blah. I used portabella mushrooms, used about 1 1/2 cups of broth so  I could thicken the sauce. For sure will be making this again!

I made this vegetarian by subsituting a 14 oz block on extra-firm tofu for the chicken and vegan boullian to make the broth, andn it turned out awesome. I thought the pasta was too dry with only the original cup of broth that was already mostly steamed out, so I made an extra cup of broth and added it to the penne mix, and it made it super moist and yummy. It did triple the garlic, but I usually double or triple with any recipe as my family loves garlic.

I tried this recipe with whole-grain penne and stirred in pesto (a la Costco) instead of the remaining olive oil at the end. It was a hit, even with the fussy eaters in my family (I've never seen my 9 year old devour dinner so quickly!). I really like what the steaming method did to the asparagus -- just the right mix of tender and crisp. This one's a keeper.

Tried this recipe right away.  Sounded good.  Found it very dry and not tasty. Too much pasta for veg and meat ratio.  Taking out of recipe box.

This is very delicious ! I made this with extra garlic, chicken broth and added fresh mushrooms. I also marinated the chicken in Italian salad dressing prior to cooking. Part of the fun of cooking is tweaking recipes to fit your likes, this would also be great with any number of fresh spring veggies. So experiment  with your recipes and definitely try this one !

Two words: cream cheese.  Just 4 oz, cubed, and added to the asparagus and broth after vegies are tender.  Doesn't thicken it (which I like), but gives it a lot of flavor

The first time I made it, it seemed a tad bland. Also, even for 2 servings (scaled down), it used too much olive oil. When I made it again, I cut the olive oil in half, added a small pinch of dried french oregano, and added a Tbsp of light butter at the end, when I tossed in the pasta. 
It had more zip, and I might even add a tad of paprika or a smidge of red pepper flakes next time. Nice Spring recipe, though!

kind of boring.  I added a little wine and balsamic vinegar to give it a little more kick.  Might be good with some shredded asiago cheese as well.

Kids really liked it. I added more garlic, garlic salt, pepper.  Blandish but fresh. Use 3 chik breasts.  Broccoli instead of asp good.  Others suggested sauted mushrooms and onions. Offer rep pepper flakes for heat.

Good dish.  We liked this one.  My toddler actually ate asparagus!  Whenever I serve it he sets it aside.  Not this time.  He picked them out and gobbled them up.

I just made this for dinner and yum!!!!!!!! If you season it properly, it will not be bland. My suggestion is to season it to your taste. I sautéed the garlic, onions, mushrooms and asparagus in a little olive oil first. Then I cooked my chicken in a little olive oil and added Italian seasoning with a little seasoning salt on the chicken. Everything else I followed as listed. Delicious and not a heavy dish.

I really liked this, light but yummy tasting. I added some mushrooms, but you can add any other type of veggies you like. Also, I drained some some of the broth/juice out after cooking the asp., otherwise I think it would have been too soupy.

Nice light recipe. I added asparagus and mushrooms; definitely needed the flavor of the mushrooms.  For the leftovers, I actually saute more asparagus and mushrooms (with lots of garlic) and added it.  I'd make again.

OMG, found something that everyone liked! I did add the roasted peppers, crushed red pepper, and I never have chicken breast so I used skinless chicken thighs instead, oh I love fresh garlic so used a lot more than a clove :-). Thank you so much for this recipe, it's a keeper!

I read various reviews and used whole wheat penne; added a diced red pepper, 4 cloves garlic, and some sliced crimini mushrooms.  I added a dash of Italian seasoning and some red pepper flakes and it was perfect.  As noted, this isn't a "saucy" pasta, though I think it would be awesome with a creamy sauce as well as this way.  Great recipe, I'll be making it again.

Love!  Steamed asparagus in 2 cups chicken broth before adding penne and chicken.  Added a scoop of whipped cream cheese and dash of milk before serving. Also no need to add more salt for the broth and parm is perfect!

I love this recipe!  I found it because I had the asparagus and chicken.  I guess the asparagus is in season now as it was on sale at the store.  Like another reviewer said, I used fresh garlic instead of powder too, which is more tasty in my opinion.  I will definitely make this recipe again and add sauteed mushrooms next time! YUM!

I can't give this recipe five stars because it doesn't go well with pasta. The chicken broth is the only ingredient that makes it 'saucy,' and I feel like even that isn't enough. I cooked the chicken and asparagus according to the recipe, and it came out rather flavorful, but instead of using penne, I just ate it with whole grain rice. I would rename the recipe rice with chicken and asparagus =)

This recipe is pretty tasty and a great summer recipe. I'd add a bit more garlic powder, salt, and pepper than you would think- because it's pretty much the only flavor in the sauce.

I really liked this recipe, it was very easy to make and didn't involve a lot of ingredients.  It has a light flavor but it is still filling and makes a great lunch for several days after.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my husband didn't care much for it, but I will definitely be making it again even if it is just for my lunches.

This is the kind of recipe that I've been trying to find more of!! I recently became a stay at home mom and have been struggling with diffrent foods to feed my family. I substituted zucchini for asparagus it was good. Next time I will use more seasonings and possibly more veggies!!

loved it! but I wasnt a fan of the pasta-to-veggie ratio, so I added red, orange, and yellow bell pepper, as well as sun-dried tomatoes and lemon juice. I also seasoned the chicken with just a bit of lemon pepper and threw it on the grill. its my new favorite recipe

I found this a little too bland, despite adding extra garlic and garlic powder, and extra parmesan. Good recipe base for building off and adding too, though.

Very good, a nice change from tomato sauce with spaghetti. The asparagus really soaked up the chicken broth and had tons of flavor, yummy!

I wouldn't change a thing, although I will make my 11 year-old son eat it when it's done instead of an hour later when it all tastes like asparagus.

Overall this was a good dish but like many of the other reviews it was alittle bland if you follow the recipe exact. I had to add alot more garlic powder to give it more taste. I also used an Italian blend of shredded cheese which made the dish complete. My family did not like the idea of no sauce but I really liked it.

This was a great recipe - I used thin spaghetti instead of penne - it didn't overwhelm the asparagus.  Also, I sauteed the garlic along with the chicken and added the juice of 1/2 lemon to the sauce -- delicious!

This is delicious and light! After reading some reviews that the chicken was bland, I used my favorite seasoning salt whenever it called for S&P and would definitely recommend that. Mushrooms are a nice little addition as well:)

This was really light and yummy. A great pasta dish that doesn't leave you feeling like you gained 10 pounds when you're finished. I seasoned my chicken with Montreal Chicken Seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper before cooking (added a ton of flavor!) I also added some mushrooms and a few extra cloves of garlic to the asparagus and chicken broth. Finally, some re-hydrated sun dried tomatoes toward the end - these were a must have and added tons of flavor as well. Delicious and a great base recipe!

This is a great light tasting pasta dish. I did make a few adjustments based on our preferences. I added broccoli, 3 total garlic cloves, and used canned white chicken meat since it was what I had on hand and was faster. By using the canned chicken you avoid step 2 in the directions all together and use less oil overall.

I used whole wheat linguini. Because there were several comments on it being too dry, I used the whole can of chicken broth. Topped it off with finely shredded cheeses. Great change from a tomato based sauce.We really enjoyed it.

This was wonderful! I added some rosemary, thyme, and marjoram to compliment the garlic and chicken. I also used bow tie pasta because it was what I had in the house. Delicious! We'll definitely make this one again!

I made some adjustments... I added sliced mushrooms with the asparagus once the asparagus was almost tender. I also added a can of cream of mushroom with a half a can of milk to add some thickness to the pasta. The pasta turned out great, but was a little "sweet"; I am guessing this was from the asparagus. I might try it next time with brocolli instead so the outcome will not be as sweet. Overall, my husband and I loved it and would eat it again :)

Fantastic recipe!  Made this with the Baked Asparagus in Butter Balsamic recipe and it was perfect!  Made it straight to the original recipe, substituting chicken stock for chicken broth and will make it again without a second thought.  Thank you!

We tried this recipe last night and really enjoyed it.  I didn't add all the pasta because it seemed like too much for the amount of chicken I had.  I didn't season the chicken enough but now I know for next time.  Overall, this is a great dish!  Thank you!

Definitely a light dish, but I found I had to add more olive oil and Parmesan cheese topping in order to add a little more flavor the dish.

This recipe is good but does need some tweaking.  I added mushrooms,more garlic, herbed chicken broth (added alot of flavor) & used more broth because the pharm. cheese soaks the broth right up. It's a good base recipe.

I loved how easy this was. The only changes I made were to add some sliced mushrooms to the asparagus while it steamed, and using 3 cloves of garlic instead of only 1. This dish wasn't 5-star amazing, but it didn't take 5-star effort, either. This recipe doesn't require anything I didn't have on hand anyway. I will make this one again.

Yummy, although I don't think it would have been as good without the 2 tablespoons of pesto and 1/4 cup of shredded parmesean I added to it. Thank you for the recipe =)

It was good, it's missing a little something though. I think It was a little dry. Next time I'll use a little more broth to coat the noodles.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. As suggested by other reviewers, I added sauteed mushrooms and seasoned salt (Lawry's).  My husband added crushed red peppers to his as well and my whole family enjoyed it.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I found this was a very basic recipe so I made a few modifications and it was a definate hit with the family. I fried up some fresh mushrooms & red peppers and seasoned it up with Roasted Garlic & Red Pepper seasoning.  I added a little extra chicken broth as well. A great light pasta dish!

This really was pretty good, but I felt like I needed to alter the recipe a bit before it would have tasted just right.  I marinated the chicken in italian dressing and sauteed chopped onion with the chicken. I added extra garlic to the broth/veggie saute and added pesto and quite a bit of crushed red pepper to the pasta mixture. With this alterations it did taste good, but without them...it would have been too bland for out tastes.

I really liked this dish.  I added some jarred sundried tomatoes to it. For the fresh garlic, I just crushed some and put it in with the penne (after it was cooked and drained)as I waited for the other part to be finished. I think the pepper flakes would be a nice addition, but I used tabasco on my serving and it was good.  I had it again for lunch today and enjoyed it and I will want to make this again.  I was fine with it not being saucy...I did add a small amount of chicken broth in the batch when it was all done right before I added the extra olive oil. Thank you for the recipe.

Definitely a healthier option than most out there.  I found it to be okay...very light, not a lot of flavor but certainly something I would try again.  With the leftovers, my husband added some red pepper flakes and seemed to enjoy it more.  I also tried adding some cream cheese with the leftover portion to make a creamier sauce and it was okay but I did like the original better.

This was a perfect meal for me as I am trying to eat healthier. I don't understand the reviewers who thought it was bland because I thought that it was delicious! The trick is to use ALOT of garlic, maybe twice the amount that the recipe calls for. I also chopped up some sun-dried tomatoes out of a jar and threw these in at the same time as the asparagus. This was my fiancé's suggestion and it really did add extra flavor, but I know that I would have liked this just the same without them. I also used whole wheat penne as we are trying to eat healthier. I will definately make this again!

This was a very delicious and light recipe.  I used turkey sausage instead of chicken and increased the amount of chicken broth.  I also added a little more garlic powder as well as minced garlic.  It was a great change from the thick, creamy sauce of alfredo and your run of the mill marinara sauce.  This recipe can also be changed to suit anyone's tastes.  Great recipe!!

I put 3 cloves of garlic in this recipe, plus added a lot of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper and there was still a lack of flavor. I put mushrooms in this recipe, as was suggested by the person who posted the recipe + other reviewers. My husband liked the recipe and there are a lot leftovers, which is nice. But I have to think of some ways to add some flavor to this dish. I actually would have preferred it without the chicken at all.

I usually don't like asparagus but my family needs to eat healthier so I gave this recipe a try, and the asparagus was actually tolerable.  Everything else in it was just great!  I added a can of diced tomatoes and some sauteed mushrooms.  It was delicious and colorful.  Also, there's really no such thing as too much garlic with this; I added 3 cloves and it still could have used more in my opinion, but it was still good.

Awesome! We loved everything about this. It's really light and delicious. It isn't a heavily flavored dish, but it's still great. I scaled the recipe way back, but wished I hadn't, as we both would have wanted leftovers! Thanks! :)

I used 3 chicken breasts. I thought it was good--not the best though. I'll have to figure out what to add to spice it up just a bit. Overall its tasty and I would make it again.

Great light recipe! thanks! I changed it up slightly by grilling... I sprinkled the chicken breasts with Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb Blend and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. I drizzled about 2 tbls. olive oil and 2 tbls. minced garlic and black pepper onto the asparagus and wrapped it in foil and grilled it with the chicken. Grilling it gave everything a nice smokey flavor. I also used whole wheat pasta and low fat parmesan. My picky kids loved it too! (:

Great base recipe. I used asparagus and mushrooms. I am not sure why this recipe asks for 5 tbsp of oil. I used pam. Just at the end I drizzled a little olive oil on the pasta, maybe 1 tsp. This recipe is very adaptable. I bet it tastes good with bell peppers or zucchini.

I changed the recipe slightly. For instance I dredged the chicken in flour and fried it instead and also I added onions and a little white wine.

This is a good recipe, but as others have noted, can be a little bland if you don't spruce it up somehow.  Last night I used scallops instead of chicken, in addition adding lemon juice, pine nuts, and a little half-and-half to the sauce at the end. Rice can also be substituted for pasta, although that begins to be a whole different recipe...  In any case, great way to keep the recipe light and healthy; and the scallops really work well with the lightness of the dish.

This recipe was just okay. I used fresh garlic along with garlic powder, and also mixed in parmesan cheese before serving, but still found it bland.  I also added sauted mushrooms and onions. Maybe if I tweak it a little more, it could be a keeper. The base is there, it's just missing the oomph.

thought this recipe was just ok.  even used fresh garlic instead of powder...added some white wine when cooking the chicken as well as shallot.  perhaps should of halved the pasta like other users recommended.  i did up the broth like others recommended.  added some fresh parsley at the end.  i wouldn't throw recipe away...but most probably would not make again.  just no 'wow' factor to it, but decent enough for making a quick meal

Great light meal, with a few modifications.  As others did, I sauteed the chicken with garlic and spices to add flavor, added mushrooms and onions, and increased the amount of parmesan to 1/3 cup and mixed it into the pasta before serving.  Filling but not heavy.  We'll add this to our regular rotation.

I agree with previous reviews that this is a great base recipe to add to and is better suited to someone who already cooks or reads the other reviews first. I used whole wheat pasta, almost half the olive oil, cooked the chicken in several cloves of garlic and lots of onion. Even added some seasoning. Then at the end I added lots of fresh parsley and a tsp of crushed red pepper. I also added a bit of extra Parmesan. I didn't have asparagus so I used broccoli. It was great but I will try again with asparagus. My family loved the final product but I couldn't have done it without following previous reviewers advice.

I was really looking forward to this dish, but was quite disappointed.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and sampled it before serving (you have to make sure your food is good before you serve it:) I thought it was extremely bland and too dry for us, so I decided to throw a few more things in before I served it, without adding a ton more calories (after all, we are going for healthy...thus the making of this recipe). My tweaking it made it surprisingly more delightful than anticipated.  In fact, I'm eating some right now as leftovers for lunch. Here's what I did:  After tossing everything together at the end, as it calls for, I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of 1% milk, another handful of Parmesan cheese, and a small handful of fiesta blend shreeded cheese, as well.  I turned the burner back on and stirred that all together until cheese was melted (the milk just kind of soaked right up...made it a little bit creamy).  I'm not one to change recipes, but this one needed help.  It was probably a 3 1/2 after it was all said and done...and still healthy.

This was easy and delicious.  Only changes - I quickly pounded the chicken breasts (I used 3) and upped the liquid to 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Everything else was as written - Kids and adults enjoyed every bite.  Great recipe!

I had never put asparagus in a pasta before, so this was an new experience. I was surprisingly delighted--as were my husband and kids! I highly recommend this meal. I only used 14 oz. whole wheat penne, and still had plenty!

Even though this dish had great reviews, I was hesitant because it sounded a little bland. Not the case! This dish has a light feel (not covered in sauce or anything) and is so satisfying. Just make sure you add enough spices and flavor to the chicken. Very good!

This is a nice base recipe.  After I doctored it up.  My family loved it.  In all fairness to the recipe my family does prefer a more saucy pasta.  The aspargus  tasted great and this  was a wonderful way to get my kids to eat it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic and hearty!! You can also use canned salmon instead of chicken which is also fabulous! Just de-bone and remove skin and flake in with rest of ingredients. Yum!!!!

Thanks Laurel!  This turned out really well!  I started out half-ing the receipe because it was just for me and my bf but I kinda kept adding to it (chicken broth).  I used egg noodles because that's what I had, and I also added some chopped mushrooms just for a little something extra.  I also added some dried basil leaves in at the end and it added a light hint of the herb flavor.  It indeed is an easy recipe to follow and had a nice light flavor.  Right before serving, I threw on some parmesean (as stated in the recipe) and some red pepper flakes.  DELICIOUS!  And my bf loved it.  Thanks!

Yummy & light.  I added mushrooms & used turkey instead of chicken.  I also didn't put enough salt in while cooking so it was bland until I added extra at the end along with extra parmesan.

This was a good recipe.  Did make some changes to it.  I used the trio italiano pasta instead of penne.  And used the can asparagus instead of fresh.  Added roma tomatoes for more color and it turned out great.  The only thing is since I used canned asparagus I added it at the end since its already cooked so it wouldn't get all smooshy.  And also used 1 chicken bouillion instead of the broth.  I marinated the chicken breast in orange juice since I was going to use it for something else, but my husband wanted for me to try out a new pasta w/chicken dish.  Maybe that helped it to come out really soft and juicy.  Also added feta cheese on top.  Do recommend this recipe to others.

This was a delicious, easy recipe.  I took others advice and added a few more ingredients:  mushrooms, fresh basil, roma tomatoes, and broccoli.  I only did a few sprinkles of the red pepper flakes.  It was perfect -- nice kick!

This was amazing! I made it tonight for dinner and my fiance couldn't believe it, he thought it was from a bag. :) I didn't have any chicken stock, so I used a chicken bullion cube and one cup boiling water from my pasta. And there was no need for me to use the extra olive oil at the end, it was perfect already! Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved it!  I added additional seasoning to the chicken (crushed red pepper and all seasoning) and mixed the parmasean cheese with asiago cheese.  Came out great!  I will be making this again and again!

We loved this recipe!
What I did different- I used chicken breasts I had already cooked.  Sauteed garlic and onion in olive oil.  Added cooked chicken, salt and pepper, and italian seasoning.  Added chicken broth, then frozen broccoli (all I had on hand). Added cooked penne, then an asiago cheese blend.  Delish!

I added a lot of veggies to mine along with lots of garlic and onion for flavor. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor. I like the idea, just think its missing something.

I combine this recipe with anonther on this site and add a diced tomatoe.  Makes for a PERFECT meal.  uUse only 3 Tablespoons of olive oil (2 for cooking and 1 for drizzling) then use 3 boneless breasts use 4 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper (maybe a little more) and 1 tomato diced.  Add the red pepper and tomato to step 3.  PERFECT - I am telling you PERFECT!  My teen  boy asks for this!

I sauteed the cut-up boneless chicken legs and drumsticks with olive oil and thinly sliced red onions.  Added white white, several diced cloves of garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Put in my asparagus which I had steamed separately. Added generous amount of chicken broth.  Put in some red pepper flakes for a little pizzaz.  Sprinkled a combination of parmesan and romano grated cheese on pasta and mixture.  Topped with parsley flakes.  Truly a light summer meal.

This recipe is good, but some nice additions: Chopped onion (sauted in pan after chicken, add broth directly to softened onions), white wine (add half a cup with the chicken broth), sundried tomatoes in oil (add a few chopped once you add the chicken back in.)

I love this recipe because it is a good base and you can do it with many other green veggies.  Thank you!

A tasty light meal.  Makes a HUGE recipe though, so you may need to cut in half.  Can't wait to try it with mushrooms as another reviewer suggested.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I have an in home daycare and I am always looking for good healthy things to feed the kids.  They LOVED this one!  I did make a few changes, I didn’t use fresh garlic rather just a little garlic salt.  I used a 12 oz box of Rotini as it was what I had on hand and I used broccoli instead of asparagus as I thought the kids would be more incline to eat it.  Even my pickiest eater LOVED it!!!!  I will make this often!

We are obviously in the minority here, but this dish did not impress my family.  Even with following the suggestions of others to season very well (including lots of red pepper flakes and crushed garlic), use extra broth and add cream cheese to the sauce, it was very unremarkable.  I very much enjoy simple dishes and while this was very easy to create and definitely edible, it was also plain and unmemorable.  I am disappointed, especially after the raving responses this dish received from so many others!

This was fairly good.  I wasn't jumping up and down about the flavor. I even boiled my asparagus in both chicken stock and in the pasta water before boiling the pasta (half and half).  I used some of our famous basil and oil mixture in place of some of the olive oil.  That definitely added flavor - I wonder how much more bland it would have been without it!  In all, it wasn't a bad dish, but I would certainly add some herbs and spices next tiome to give it some added flavor.

We have this at least once a week.  And I make it in a smaller portion with some grilled chicken for lunch quite often.  It's a simple recipe that even my 5 year old will eat.  My whole family loves it.  I do variations with whatever is on hand.  Adding spinach if asparagus is out of season, mushrooms work great too!  Low sodium broth adds flavor and spares fat and calories.

Very good and very light.  I also used 3 chicken breasts and 12 oz of Barilla Plus Penne.  Don't be shy with the seasoning of the chicken. Simple but surprisingly flavorful.

If you didn't salt, pepper, and parm cheese this to death it would have no flavor at all.  An oily catastophy.  Maybe take the chicken and the asparagus which were good and rework the sauce completely.

Loved this recipe and only added a little extra garlic and extra parmesean cheese at the end.  Still was very moist and light - not dry at all!

Good base, but a little bland.  Add additional spices.

Easy and enjoyable meal.  I added a little extra parmesan cheese and mixed it through the dish before serving and served it with a side of garlic bread. Thank you for the recipe!

I used a different pasta than on the ingredient list.  Husband liked it, but I was a little disappointed.  I will try it again and maybe use a whole grain penne pasta.

Followed the directions exactly. My entire family enjoyed it, including my husband who does not like Asparagus.

I really like the recipe. Although I found it to be a bit dry even after putting in a full cup of broth. I think it's a wonderful base recipe that has many possibilities. Next time I will probably try cream of chicken soup instead of broth.

I made this recipe for company and everyone loved it!  For a very simple recipe, it was very tasty.  I added lots of fresh garlic when sauteeing the chicken, an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and 1 tsp of Mrs. Dash Tomato, Basil, and Garlic Seasoning Blend to the broth.  I might reduce the pasta to 1/2 lb next time.

I made this last Sunday and it came out really, really well!
I made a whole box of pasta which I thought was way too much though, and I also didn't use the whole bunch of asparagus I bought... if you follow those directions you will make A LOT!
I was also pretty liberal with the garlic powder and I think that made it even more tasty.
Would definitely make again!
