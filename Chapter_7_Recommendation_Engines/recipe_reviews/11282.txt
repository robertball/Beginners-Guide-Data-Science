I baked these cookies for a party and I was disapointed when the first guest took one and pratically broke a tooth bighting into it (and I made them that day too!). But after I put them in a container w/ bread (which softens them up) they taste pretty good. I think they could have a stronger butterfinger taste though.

I found the exact same recipe in a recipe book from Indiana...the only difference is that it used shortening instead of butter chilled the dough and baked the cookies at 350 degrees instead of 375. I think those changes make a difference on the texture of the cookies.

Really crispy I prefer soft cookies better. They got eaten up at the family gathering but I probably won't make them again.

This recipe was easy and quick. Personally I thought the taste was way to sweet for me. The recipe would work for my daughter's "Easy Bake". Not very good for me but my kids liked them.

I had some problems with these. Too thin and flat and they were overbaked at 8 minutes. Took another reviewers advice and chilled the rest of the dough and baked them for 9 minutes at 350 with better results.Too much trouble to make them again. Thanks for sharing.

This is a nice recipe! It's very sweet and crunchy. They turned out a tad flatter than I would like but they tasted great. I will definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe exact. These were very dry and crumbly difficult to eat without them falling to pieces. I won't be making these again.

These cookies sure do taste good. They spread out a lot while baking causing them to come out too thin. I baked them in a 350 degree oven used parchment paper and took them out a bit under-baked. Used my cookie scoop floured because the dough was sticky. The cookies are thin so I thought not the prettiest but nonetheless we ate them right up.

Tryed this recipe wasn't pleased with it because the cokkies stuck to my cookie sheet even though I used non-stick cooking spray they were real hard to take off of the cookie sheet I even let them cool before removing them and they spread out really big using a tsp todro them on the sheets. But they do taste good. Doesanybody have any suggestions for me to keep them from sticking to my cookie sheets I even tryed using non-stick parchment paper and thatonly made it worse had to them in the freezer just to get the them to release.
