This is AMAZING! I substituted beets for the peas and used purple cabbage.  I put in about 4 jalape√±os to give it some zip. 27 lbs is one half of a bushel.  Good stuff!

This doesn't appear to meet the minimum standards for tomatoes for shelf safe acidity. Which recommends 2 table spoons of Lemon juice per quart just for canning tomato  juice.

Most of the added veggies aren't acidic, so even more would be needed to be 'shelf stable'.

Made my first batch as indicated. Year later is still good.  Second batch I added beets which I like with everything.
