I found a simple way to add the perfect amount of lime.  I changed the re pie by adding a box of lemon frosted cookies and the grated rind of one fresh lime to the mix. I adjusted the tequila until the mix was wet enough.  The final touch was to mix one box lime jello with 1/3 cup powdered sugar and 1/3 cup whit sugar to roll the balls in.  The lime jello gives just the right kick!  I was asked for the recipe several times!

I used the back end of a large ladle to pulverize the wafers in the wax bag they came in - kept things from getting too messy.  After considering other reviewers' comments, I elected to add a shot of Cointreau to the mixture (for additional moisture and more orange flavor).  I found them to be delicious and the smell was wonderful. I also found that the mixture was easier to work with when making the balls on the smallish side, and to dip my fingertips in water about every Â½ dozen or so (the extra moisture helps when forming them!)  I'm bringing them to a Cinco de Mayo cocktail party tonight and will give a couple dozen of these as a hostess gift. Thanks for a unique and tasty treat.

I make these every Christmas to give as little gifts. I think the most important thing is to make them at least 4-5 days before you plan on serving them. Store in fridge.  The longer they sit, the better they are. I also always add a little extra tequila to the mix!

I thought this recipe was good, not amazing but good. I didn't have any problems with them being crumbly or dry. I used my blender to crush up the cookies very fine, and my pampered chef chopper to chop up my sliverd almonds. (I think getting these ingredients very fine is key) I added a shot of Grand Mariner (didn't have Contreau as suggested)and I used 6oz of white choc. (the whole box- hey why not the more chocolate the better right I dipped them in colored decorators sugar (green, pink & white) they were pretty & sparkley. Everyone loved them. I wraped them up in celophane and tied them w/ a pretty bow and put them in a fun martini glass (didnt ahve a margarita glass) and gave as gifts. they got rave reviews!!

Several people told me that these were wonderful. I followed the original recipe, but added a squeeze of lime and a shot of cointreau- delicious! Also, as someone else suggested, I let these sit in the fridge for 5 days and they DID get better with time!  yum yum.

Awfully "liquory", but generally an interesting treat for an all-adult party.

These were a smash hit at our Pre-Mexico vacation Fiesta party!!!!  There was just a nice hint of tequila.  I dipped them in lime juice before rolling in sugar and this gave them the hint of lime.  They were eaten up very quickly!  I would definately make these again.

Really not worth the effort and ingredients.  It was sweet, but none of the flavor came through. I tried doubling the marmalade and the booze...but nothing. I was afraid to add more because they would be too mushy.  Also added some lime juice and salt as a last desperate measure.

They did not particularly taste like margaritas (no lime) to me but I thought they were scrumptious nonetheless.  I think I prefer them to the usual rum ball recipe.

Excellent recipe....the only thing that I changed was adding (approx.) a tablespoon of lime juice. It just gives it that extra touch!

These were just OK. I made them and refrigerated them for about 4 hours before tasting them (I didn't see that other people said to make them way in advance.) I did do as others suggested and dipped them in lime juice before rolling in sugar. At the 4 hour mark I could not taste anything except vanilla wafers and sugar. I saved them and ate another one after 24 hours in the fridge and they were better. I could slightly taste tequila. My husband said he could not taste the tequila, but could now taste the lime juice. I am going to taste one every 24 hours and see if they get better over several days. I will update my review after 5 days total.
UPDATE: I agree that they are MUCH better after 4-5 days stored covered in the fridge. I am keeping the 3 star review because as-written they were not very good and because they needed the lime flavor added in.

This is a superb morsel of a cookie! I used Grand Marnier, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and lime zest. After I rolled the mixture through powdered sugar I wrapped each one in plastic and refrigerated for four days. I presented them in an oversized margarita glass, rimmed with colored sugar. This is my new "wow-em" cookie. Thank you for sharing.

Looking for a Mexican themed dessert, I came across this recipe.  I made it for my May, Girls Night Out, event.  The reactions were totally mixed with this dessert.  A few ladies had one bite and a few ladies ate two of them.  I rolled half of them in sugar as the recipe calls for.  The other half, I dipped in lime juice and then in the sugar.  The ones dipped in lime juice were the preferred ball.  Something fun and different, but won't be making them again.

Seriously, one of the best  recipes I've made from Allrecipes. Easy to make, I used my food processor to do whole roasted almonds .  I used a fairly good grade of agave tequila and these are absolutely delish.   I will definitely be making them again.

While vaguely tasting like liquor, they didn't have any distinct taste. Mixture was on the dry sideâhard to keep them together. I won't make them again. Bummer!

Very disappointed in these. I followed the recipe as written except I used lime marmalade instead of orange because orange is not really a flavor I associate with margaritas. Even so, there was not much margarita flavor and I could not taste the tequila at all and I used Patron. (Always use the best liquor you can!) Will have to do more tweaking to this to get it up to par.

Made two(2) batches for a party, and my husband is telling me the Margarita balls do not taste right,and he can't even taste the tajeuila. After checking out the recipe again, the lime juice or other sour ingredient is missing, lacking the taste in the margarita balls. will remake them adding lime.

Just OK ... followed the recipe exactly ~ the balls ended up crumbly & a bit dry.  I thought they would improve over time (like rum balls do) but they just ended up getting drier.  I think these would be improved with more tequila & orange flavor ~ they didn't have any "oomph".  Disappointing.

Love the flavor, hide from children.  The small amount of alcohol packs a kick.  Good fresh or after a few days, freezes well.

These are so good.  A little harder to make than I expected, but well worth it.  They are now in the refrigerator getting savory.  I will definitely make them again as they are such a nice change from rum balls.

Look closely at the package of vanilla wafers.  Nabisco's used to be 12 ozs, but changed now to 11 ozs.  Found out the hard way when I made some Jack Daniels Balls recently...they came out mushy.  SIGH!!!!

Going to try making these this weekend.

These are so good! I was a little impatient when crushing the nilla wafers and nuts...make sure they are crushed as it is harder to form them into balls when there are big pieces of either!

These were a big hit the time I made them.  I plan to make them every year at Christmas  during those hot summer months.

Made this for a house warming party & serious Tequila drinkers.  This was a great hit and very easy to make.  I used pecans instead of almonds.
