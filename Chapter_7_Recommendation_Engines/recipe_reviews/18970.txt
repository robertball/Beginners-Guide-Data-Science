HUGE hit for a baby shower I had on Sunday!  FYI, there are 4 pints to a half gallon so for each half gallon of sherbet, you need 4 two liters of soda.  I used raspberry sherbet since this baby is going to be a girl and it was a gorgeous pink and frothed up beautifully!  Wouldn't mind drinking it every day!

I was looking for a SUPER easy and QUICK punch...  Found it!  I made this for a Mother's Day party and used ginger ale instead of the lemon-lime soda.  Yum-mee!!!!  Everybody loved it.  Can't get easier than this!

I made this for my son's birthday party but doubled the recipe. I also added a 2 liter of fruit punch. The kids had a blast putting chunks of sherbert into their cups with some punch! LOL!!

This is a definite favorite of mine that my mom has made since I was a child.  However, I can't say that it's perfect without ginger ale.  The lemon-lime soda just makes the punch too sweet, but the ginger ale will give it a little sass--in a good way.

This is such a great & easy recipe! We had a Hawaiian themed end-of-the year party for my 3rd grade son and served this punch. I purchased paper drink umbrellas (parasols),put pineapple chunks & marachino cherries on each & stuck one in each cup. Huge hit!!

This is good. Can't get any easier. I make individual servings by just putting 7Up in a glass, adding a bit of sherbet and just stirring.

this was a VERY pleasant surprise even for those in the house that didn't LIKE soda! i made these individually in a glass with just half a glass of sherbet and then pouring the soda over. INSTANT hit!

This is an easy punch.  I needed it really quickly, and the soda from the store was warm. I just put the sherbert in first, and poured the soda over it and it was just the right temp! Very delicious, I'm using raspberry sherbert for my friends Bridal Shower because it's pink! Great for a baby shower too!!

This is the same sherbet punch you have had at a party at some point in your life. Its a never fail always yummy. This was my 8yo sons contribution to our Memorial Day dinnner. He was able to to it all by himself and the family got to enjoy a yummy punch.
