I made this cake for years with a recipe on the back of a cake box.  I lost the recipe and it's not on the cake box any more.  I was thrilled to find it here.  Easy to goof on but it is so delicious, it's worth the care it takes to get it right.  And it is beautiful.  Something special happens to the cake baked with the meringue on top even though there are no whites used in the cake.

Excellent "grown-up" cake!  Kids didn't care for it, but adults all loved the cool, creamy filling and interesting blend of crunchy nuts and meringue and soft cake.  Thanks!

I made this cake for a new daughter-in-law for her birthday. She is a pinapple lover. Today she asked me to make it for her again. It is good, and I'm not a pinapple lover. Try it, it's different.

Fabulous!  I used a quart of strawberries instead of the pineapple and doubled the whipping cream.

Love this, but I use walnuts instead and leave out the rum!

I was pleased to find this cake!  I baked this for our wedding anniversary as I was looking for something different and interesting.  I did not have pecan nuts on my cupboard at the time so I used some pine nuts and it was an absolutely delicious cake .  It is definitely on my list of To bake again and again cake!  Thanks.
