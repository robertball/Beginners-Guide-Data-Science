I tried this tonight, it was outstanding, and really easy.  The only thing I did differently was use frozen pepper and onions instead of fresh peppers as I had a bag in the freezer.  My only recommendation would be to double the recipe, as you will want leftovers!!!!

This is not how I would cook Jambalaya, but it was an easy start for me to teach someone else who thought Zataran brand Jambalaya was the best.  We added onions and celery sweated in bacon fat, both andouille and kielbasa, bacon, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, canned stewed tomatos,  chicken stock and worcestershire.  The broth was awesome, but the addition of the rice packet seemed to darken the flavors of the dish.  A dash of sugar helped, but I think in the end we made gumbo instead of jambalaya, and if I had to do it again, I would just use about 1/2 cup of short grain rice.  Overall, a good starter recipe.  My roomie learned some prep technique and some important flavor combination techniques.  Make it again?  Sure...with changes.

Easy and delicious.  I saw there was a Jambalaya rice so used it instead of the Spanish.

This was really good and extremely easy to make! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five, is because my family thought the spanish rice gave it too much of a mexican food flavor. I will definitely make this again, but next time will either try to find a cajun rice, or will make my own. Thanks for this tasty recipe!

This recipe was really easy to make and took no time at all  I made it for a New Orleans themed ladies night, and got great reviews from everyone!  I added some celery and onion, and some cajun spices to raise the heat a little.

This is a great recipe and so easy to make! Iused pre-cooked shrimp, and I cooked plain rice in a rice cooker with one cube of spanish rice flavouring. When rice boiled I stirred the rest right in the rice cooker. I also added a couple of chopped sun-dried tomatoes with a table spoon of their oil, and about half cup frozen green peas, and kept the the rice cooker on "warm" for about 15 minutes.  My teenage children were ecstatic!

This is the second time I used the recipe and both times it was a hit.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Good, but spicy.  I used a Jambalia mix and it made it too spicy to even eat, and I love spicy!

...it was good for being such a quickly made dish, but the weakest link was the pre-packaged rice, which inadvertently gave the entire dish that "pre-packaged" taste/quality.  Will try other recipes again before reverting to this one, but I would not rule out making it again.

Delicious! I didn't have Knorr's Spanish rice so I used Mexican instead & added salt, pepper, paprika & a smidgen or cayenne. Next time I'd reduce the water & remember to add the shrimp in at the end! Wonderful recipe!!

Really easy, quick and tastes great!  I add onion and pepper flakes (to get it hotter) to the peppers, increase the garlic to 3 cloves and increase the shrimp to a full pound.
