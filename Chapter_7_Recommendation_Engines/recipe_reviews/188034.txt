This bread was  easy to make and very flexible in it's rising time which is nice!   The only tip I have is begin braiding in the middle of thethe loaf and braid out to each end (I find it easier to make a good looking loaf this way!) My only complaint was that the bread was denser and heavier then I expected Challah to be but that is because of the whole wheat flour... I shouldn't have been surprised :)   Thanks for adding a good whole wheat bread recipe that is pretty enough to grace any dinner table!

This is our favorite challah! I only made two other types before but once we found this recipe, well, it's always a winner. Sure, it's dense because of the wheat but it's SO tasty. I like to add some extra honey and sometimes add honey to the egg wash.

Absolutely delicious and healthy too!  I wouldn't change a thing. Makes great French toast and croutons, but trust me, it won't last that long. Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous challah recipe. I used agave as a reviewer suggested. Light sweetness, crumb and texture just right.  I used my Kitchenaid with paddle for the first mix, then used dough hook for 5 minutes for kneading. Beautiful smooth dough after 1st rise.  I braided from the center which was a great tip.  3 lovely yummy loaves to bake on a very cold winter day.

Love this bread! It's so delicious! I used warm milk in place of water, added a bit of brown sugar in addition to the honey, used 4 egg yolks plus 1 whole egg, and used more whole wheat flour than called for. I also made it into a six-braid instead of just three; this required it to bake for about 50 minutes. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

After many years, I have started making Challah again. This recipe works very well for me. The one change that I make is that I use agave nectar instead of honey, which is a little sweeter and easier to work with than honey. I prefer to make two large loaves instead of three smaller ones from this recipe, but it works great.

This was absolutely amazing!!! Just one thing, could you put in some more honey? The flavor of it seemed to kind of disappear... But it was fantastic!

I am a mediocre bread maker but this turned out really great.  I did have to about 1 cup more of each flour but thats how it goes sometimes.  I sort of deflated one loaf when I brushed on the egg wash so make sure you take your time and apply is carefully.

Great recipe!  Bread has a lovely texture.  I usually use 2/3 c of honey to give a little more sweetness.

I had to add quite a bit of bread flour and wheat flour at the end to get the right consistency, but it worked out great. I used agave sweetener rather than honey. On my smaller bread I added about 1/4 cup of raisins.

Trader Joe's Everything Bagel spice makes a great topping.  

For a sweet loaf, add raisins when you are mixing in the flours, egg, oil & honey.  After braiding, brush with egg, and sprinkle with sugar for a bit of a sweet crunch.

Add spices to the dough like cardamom, saffron or cinnamon.
