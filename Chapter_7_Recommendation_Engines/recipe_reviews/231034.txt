I am constantly trying to replicate the homemade sauces that my mom used to make when I was a kid. This one allowed me to do so! I finely chopped all the veggies and let them cook in the tomato sauces. I didn't need for it to simmer on low for 2 hours. I think about 1.5 hours was more than enough. The kitchen smelled great after the sausages were done cooking. I would definitely say this sauce recipe was a keeper!

I did not have diced tomatoes with chilies or sausage, so I used plain diced tomatoes and just ground beef.  The family scarfed it down - no left overs that night!

Doubling the recipe, I used one lb ground beef and one lb Italian sausage. Then about a tsp of each spice, 2 tsp of salt, and 2 tblsp of sugar to offset the acidity. Added a bay leaf for depth. I think that the vinegar adds the pleasant surprise in this sauce. Will definitely be making this one again.

Very rich and hearty meat sauce. I cut back to 2 TBS of the vinegar just to be safe next time I will up the amount.

Loved the recipe. Although, I didn't add much of the vinegar and I added more of the other spices to give it a more Italian taste.

It was good. But it wasn't anything to write home about. I tried this recipe because although we like spaghetti, we are not huge tomato lovers, and I'm looking for a good homemade sauce that I can make in large batches and freeze. I did double up this recipe, and it will feed my family of five 3 different meals, with leftovers. I liked the peppery taste, but I like peppers. My family weren't such big fans. I almost added some garlic to this, but didn't in the end because I wanted to test this as is. I missed the garlic. I found I was out of both oregano and thyme, but had Italian herb seasoning, so I used that (a full 1/4 tsp per batch).  Like I said, it was good. I would eat it again. But I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again. I would rather just buy it premade from the store.
