Delicious cake!!! The Jello takes the easy, ordinary cake from the box and makes it extraordinary! The cake is moist, fresh and so yummy with the whipped topping! I've made it for two parties now and all loved it. I make it with strawberry Jello. So good!

I made this cake yesterday and it is so easy to put together.  I thought it could've been a little more flavorful.  I used strawberry gelatin and I was really hoping to taste more of the strawberry gelatin but I have to say it is a very moist cake and it does look pretty!  I also like the fact that it's a refrigerated box cake so it's nice and cold on a hot summer day.  My family enjoyed it.  Next time maybe I'll reduce the water a little bit to make the gelatin flavor more concentrated.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!!

I love this cake, it's so refreshing and looks so pretty. I have had it with various Jello flavors, my mom made this for us when we were growing up. Red jello and the new pink strawberry Cool Whip would make a beautiful dessert. Kaye

Ahhhhhh, reminds me of my grammy's "jello" cake!  She used a yellow cake mix baked as directed.  Once cooled, poke holes throughout the cake with the back of a wooden spoon.  Make the jello as directed then pour over the cake.  (She always used cherry jello).  I don't remember if she let the jello set before topping.  I don't and it sets just fine in the frig.  For the "icing" -she'd make pistachio pudding with 1 package of dream whip added in then make as directed on pudding box.  When the pudding was ready, she'd "slather" on top of the cake then refrigerate.  This was my 2nd most requested food item (the first being her peach cobbler).  I  hovered around the frig until time to get it out.  LOL  I've made a few times for my kids but they don't care much for it.  I've used various flavors of jello but prefer cherry / pistachio combo - just like Grammy made.

I made this for my daughters bday party as an alt to the super sweet kids cake. The adults loved it!!! The whole cake went in no time. I used strawberry cake and fruit punch jello. I also used the cool whip topping but also used diced fresh strawberries (lightly coated with lemon juice and sprinkle of sweet n low) then added chopped vanilla wafers at the very end. It was incredible!!!!

Love it, so moist.  I mix vanilla whipped icing with the cool whip before I frost the cake....makes it easier to spread and tastes delicious.

They used to serve this cake in the cafeteria when I was in highschool, and I had been craving items from my highschool lunches.  I know it sounds weird, but I loooved cafeteria food.  Especially these things called fiestadas, but anyways, this cake hit the spot! It's simple to make, but sooooo good!!!

Made a lemon cake and used lime jello to pour over the cake. Frosted with lemon dream whip frosting which is made by beating 1 (3.9 oz.) lemon instant pudding, 1 envelope of Dream Whip, and 11/2 cups of milk until stiff. Keep refrigerated. Nice summer dessert. UPDATE-next time I will double the jello because I didn't feel there was enough to fill in the holes but will probably only use about 1 1/2 of it.

I MADE A PATRIOTIC FLAG CAKE Great!  I made this in a 13X9 cake pan and used TWO flavors of jello.  I used strawberry and blue raspberry and chopsticks for the poke hole.  I alternated rows of red and blue...next time I am going to try using a turkey baster to do that.  Anyway, the finished product was red, white and blue on the inside and was the perfect patriotic cake!  It was delicious and so moist and looked so cute!  I topped it with sliced stawberries for the stripes and blueberries for the stars section.  You might be able to see it on my facebook page....I have two pics so if you get there, click on the pic for the second pic, which shows the inside (sorry, I didn't cut it real clean to post on this, LOL, but you'll get the idea!).  http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs262.snc3/27769_400812022932_527342932_4229073_6572447_s.jpg

Light and Refreshing!  My 15 year old son made this (I tried to supervise) for dad's birthday yesterday! It's didn't quite turn out looking like the photo but it didn't matter. We've tried orange, raspberry and lemon flavored gelatin.  It's their favorite cake!!!

This cake is so easy, it feels like you're cheating, but it tastes great and it's perfect for summer! I made it with raspberry jello. It was a huge hit with my sister's boyfriend, who apparently doesn't usually like desserts! It's easy to customize using your favorite flavor of gelatin. I haven't tried it with fresh berries on top, but I bet it would be good!

Made this for dessert tonight and it was really good, but i think next time like a reviewer said use less water so the gelatin flavor will be more defined. Other then that, its a keeper.

Finally made this after having it in my box for awhile.  I enjoyed how simple it is to make, but how it dresses up a regular cake.  BTW, good with the blue jell-o.

I love this recipe. It doesn't matter what flavor jello I use, it always turns out great. The cake is always nice and springy and the cool whip bring a freshing break from the heavy frostings.

not sweet enough for my family....would use bigger object to poke holes in the cake- like an unsharpened pencil covered with plastic- the gelatin didnt fall deep enough into the cake.  It was "ok" but I dont think I will be making this again.

We really like this for a summer dessert.  I like to put it in a bundt pan just because it looks prettier, but if you do, be sure you don't poke down too far, otherwise the cake will stick and be almost impossible to flip out of the pan.

My family loves this cake.  I like to experiment with different flavors of jello.  I like to top it with the pudding frosting recipe from this site.  Really good!

I remember eating these as a kid, my mom would make these for cook-outs and family gatherings.  So when I came across the recipe I decided to make one. I used the strawberry jello and it was very good. My whole family enjoyed it.  I even made a sugar-free version for my diabetic Uncle and he loved it!!

I made this for a birthday party last month and it went over really well. Last night I tried to lessen the calories, I used the diet soda cake (white cake mix and instead of oil use 10 oz diet 7up and 2 egg whites). I also used sugarfree strawberry jello and then topped with sugarfree cool whip. I took this to work today everyone and it was a hit. Will be making this cake several more times this summer!

We love this recipe!!!  I have also made it with two flavors of gelatin and vanilla frosting.  They froze very well and when we brought them out they were still really cold in the middle....delicious!!!

This is an easy & fun variation for a cake! It's great with lemon jello and I've even used pudding mixes (of course I like chocolate.) Try it, you'll like it. It's really great for hot summer get- togethers because you can store it in the refrigerator and when it's served it's a cool and refreshing treat!!

I make this several times a year.  Raspberry Jello with fresh berries on the Kool Whip for Valentine's Day, lime Jello with green sanding sugar for St Patrick's Day, Orange Jello with orange and black sanding sugar for Halloween, and Strawberry Jello with navy blue and red sanding sugar for the Fourth of July.  The recipe has been around almost longer than I have and it doesn't require any baking skills.  That's my kind of recipe.

I love it. My grandma and mom used to make it a lot growing up. I make it with strawberry jello. Then I mix one small tub of strawberry cream cheese with one tub of cool whip to makes an amazing frosting for the cake.

A definite family favorite! Good with many combinations of cake flavors and gelatin flavors. An unusual one is spice cake poked with coffee gelatin, spread over top with chocolate pudding, and frosted with cool whip or whipped cream.

we do a lemon cake mix, use butter ( real butter) instead of oil, add I more egg than box calls for, and add 1 pkg of lemon instant pudding (dry) bake it as called for on box, then use lemon jello, we use a kabob sticks to make the holes, then I put 1/3 lemon icing with a tub of cool whip to frost it... my family LOVES THIS and its sweet but not so bad my husband still likes it, I have also done this with orange creamsicle cake mix, orange pudding and orange jello....

I rated this a 4 because of the Whip Cream.  I am not a big fan of Whip Cream so I make this cake w/Pistachio Pudding for the frosting.  It's a popular cake at family gatherings. I usually use strawberry/banana jello since that is my favorite.

Oh yes! Tastes like summer. Cool, not too sweet and so easy to make. Lots of jello and cake combinations. I made it with strawberry cake and strawberry jello for a party recently. This went faster than the fancy cupcakes someone else brought.

Simple and delicious! I made it for my husband's birthday last night. There were only 6 of us and it was gone! Lots of vartiations that can be tried for this! Can't wait to try some others. I make the egg whites version of the cake mix. Very moist!

This is a pretty good cake. It's definitely refreshing (which is good for those HOT summer days!). I changed a few things, but otherwise followed this recipe exactly. Like Traci B did, I too used a "funfetti" cake mix (i.e. Betty Crocker rainbow chip). I used sugar-free strawberry gelatin because I was baking for a diabetic friend (my fiance picked up a very small package - (4) 1/2 cup serving size) and it was just the right amount. I frosted my cake with cool whipped frosting (shirleyo) using all "light" or fat-free ingredients. It was the perfect complement to the cake - not too heavy and very similar to plain 'ol Cool-whip (which this recipe calls for anyways). For a finishing touch, I used rainbow sprinkles! The Bday boy (and gal) were very happy :) Thanks for this neat recipe. I will be trying the Zinger version next time!
