I could not keep these in the house and not expect them to disappear. The only thing I changed was I added spices 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of cloves it really gives it that winter/ holiday kick!

These cookies are so far beyond delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly, except for the proportions of the glaze.  I used 2/3 c. powdered sugar with just enough orange juice to make it into a thick liquid, then added the orange peel.  Butter is unnecessary, and this was just the right amount for the number of cookies.

These are delicious cookies.  Except for using walnuts instead of pecans, I followed the recipe.  The orange glaze is what makes these cookies unlike most oatmeal cranberry cookies, so don't skip that part.  These are moist and chewy and still good a few days after making them.

Mmmm! The biscuits in themselves are excellent. What is up with the glaze??? Like water consistency and enough to cover 3 batches. Next time I think I will halve the quantities of this and add a little more confectioner's sugar and zezt to make the glaze more flavourful if slightly thicker. Can't fault the biscuits!!!

Yummy! I was snacking on some cranberries, and thought- this would make a DELLICIOUS cookie! so i went on ahead onto allrecipes.com and looked it up, and found this recipe, I tried it out, and my whole family finshed the plate! I personally don't favor nuts, so I did not use the pecans, and it satisfied my tastebuds anyhow!

These are crazy yummy!  Very easy to make.  I took them to work, and even the very picky ones loved them.  The only thing that I would have changed is the amount of glaze, I ended up with a lot left over.  Give these cookies a shot, you won't regret it!

The dough was too thin...so I added another cup of oats.  I substituted dried blueberries and added 2 t. of Chinese 5 spice.  My orange was not all that juicy so instead of the fresh OJ I added the OJ from the Diary case and it worked just fine...it may have had a bit more flavor.  Oh yes,  the cookies spread so much in my oven that I could only bake 9 on a standard cookie sheet.  They are GREAT!

I changed the recipe by adding the orange zest and some orange juice to the dough and omitted the glaze.  These were a big hit and were easy to store.

Outstanding cooking flavor bursting with citrus from glaze. Recipe made 27 medium cookies. I followed recipe exactly for cookie dough and had no problems. Like others my glaze was way too thin. It soaked into first cookie and just looked wet. I added 1 more cup confectioners sugar and chilled until thick. I like someone’s suggestion to simply add enough juice until thick. I’ll try that next time.

Dion, I will always love you. I made these because I wanted a cookie to keep on hand that wouldn't be too sweet and would feel healthy. I love these. I used the cranberries I had on hand, which were not sweetened, and before I made the glaze, I tried one. My mouth went into ecstasies.  I did not make the glaze. They were simply grand without it. I adore you. I adore these cookies. I'm making them for what I call "home" cookies every time from now on.  And I'm NOT sharing them.

Yes! Crazy Yummy indeed! I didn't make the glaze, but I did add white chocolate chips to the mix, which added plenty of sweet! Definitely will make these again!

These are pretty tasty cookies as is, but a little too sweet and lacking in flavor depth, in my option. Next time I make them I plan to make a few adjustments to suit our taste; less white sugar, add cinnamon and nutmeg, skip the glaze and add the zest to the dough.

Totally yummy in the tummy.  Would not add or change anything in this recipe.  A moist and chewy cookie.  Used this for a  couple of cookie exchanges this year and it was a big hit.  This one's a keeper for sure!

Great cookie!  I was looking for a way to use craisins as I had long forgotten why I bought them as my family doesn't eat them. I came across this recipe and tried it.  I always follow the recipe exactly the first time but always tweak it next time around.  For glaze I used the "simple orange glaze" from this sit.  This rest of the recipe is perfect as is--the sweet "cherry craisins" and pecans blend so well together and the orange glaze absolutely makes this over the top.  I made these to take to a friends becuase my husband does not eat nuts or craisins.  He devoured them and was upset I took them to a friends, leaving him only 4.  High praise indeed!  I would never had made these for him, but clearly now I must!  Thanks for this delightful recipe.

So very good! The glaze is key! Used sliced almonds because I didn't have pecans. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Soft, chewy with crispy edges.  Sooooo good!

Cookie was good even before putting on the glaze. my experience with the glaze is that it was way too thin and just ran off the cookies. While the recipe says to apply to "still warm cookies" and the glaze itself had come to room temperature it just ran off. Suggest less juice and butter if you want it to appear as a glaze and not just a moist top.
