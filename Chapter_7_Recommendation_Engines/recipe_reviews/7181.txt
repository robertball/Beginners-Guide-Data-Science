These doughnuts are GREAT & really pretty easy to make!  This was my first time making doughnuts and 'yeast' ones are supposed to be harder to make, but by using the dough cycle on my bread machine these were a snap!!  

I had trouble rolling them out the first time & had to re-roll them which made me worried they would come out tough, but they were fantastic!  Just the right amount of crispy on the outside, to chewy on the inside . . . these will become a family tradition!!  Thank you!!!

Made these jelly doughnuts for the first time manually without the use of the bread machine. They turned out beautifully. My kids love them! Next time I make them, I'll dust them with icing sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We used this for our Channukah Jelly doughnuts, a tradition.  What a breeze!!!  The kids loved making them after they came out of the machine and eating them even better.  The taste was fabulous. I fried them in hot peanut oil.  It freed up time do do other holiday things. and   We used orange marmalade one day and loquat jelly the next day.  Tomorrow, poppy seed or almond cream!!
Thank you to the person who submitted this one!!!!

Excellent recipe. I found that you really need to wet the pastry edges to get both pieces to stay together in fryer & not lose jam everywhere but a success first time & will definately make again. Even better is they freeze & can be re-heated in about 30-45 secs each depending on microwave strength.

lots of work, not sweet enough and pretty messy.  I would add more sugar to the dough and cut way back on the nutmeg. 3/4 tsp would be better.  This was my first time making this style of doughnut so perhaps with practice i would not be so messy.  My 5 kids thought they were delicious but maybe should be sweeter.  I used jam and wished I had a can of pastry filling instead on hand.  That would have held up better in the doughnut and made less of a mess.  So, 4 stars for the recipe and 3 for me LOL -

The doughnuts were very good.  One thing however it needed a glaze after cooking.  I sprinkled some sugar on it after cooking them, and my husband, the experienced pastry eater liked them that way.

These doughnuts were great!  I had to use jam instead of jelly so it got a little messy, but otherwise I thought that these were perftect.  My husband is a HUGE doughnut fan and he loved them!

I did everything wrong, and these still came out beautifully. I made them by hand, instead of with a machine. I forgot to mix the yeast and the milk before I mixed everything else, so I added extra water to start up the yeast. I had to add extra flour in order to stop the dough from sticking, and made them too big. We fried them by sight rather than timing them, and used blackberry jam. Some of them we didn't fill at all. We glazed them with Alton Brown's recipe (.25cup milk, 1t vanilla, 2cup powdered sugar) and they were marvelous! These were an after-dinner dessert, and the rest will be breakfast. The centers are a little doughy around the jam, and that's how I like them. Absolutely perfect, and apparently fool-proof!

The dough turned out amazingly well, better than bread usually turns out in this machine. Not too sticky (unless I halved the batch) and beautifully seasoned. (I did use cinnamon instead of nutmeg and  2t instant yeast instead of active dry. However, I had a problem when it came to frying them. Perhaps it was just me and the fact that I didn't have a fry thermometer, but whether I made doughnut holes or full on doughnuts, they were still doughy in the middle by the time the outside was done. The jelly ones turned out a little better because we had to stretch the dough out and that made it a little thinner. Like I said, maybe that's because I've never really deep fried anything before. Because the ones that were all the way cooked were WONDERFUL.

My 9 year old granddaughter and I made these today.  We substituted Splenda sugar blend because
my husband is diabetic.  We filled them AFTER we fried them with sugar free strawberry pie glace and bavarian cream I bought at an Amish bakery this spring in Michigan.  It was so easy.  She did everything except roll the dough.  She even fried them (with my supervision)  I recommend this recipe whole heartedly.

Needs a little more flour in the bread machine pan, or at least in mine.  I left it a pretty moist batter because I didn't know what I was doing.  I used a metal measuring cup to make my cuts.  I got 16 donuts and they are delicious!!!

I made this using my stand mixer, and it  was pretty good.  I did need to increase both rising times, and I wished that the recipe would have specified the number of packets of yeast - I guessed it was about two packets.  I needed more flour while mixing - at least a full cup more. Perhaps next time I'd cut out the water. It made a big batch. My frying time was 1:30, flipping halfway through., otherwise they got too dark and absorbed too much grease.  

The biggest  issue  I had was with the method of filling it.  I have never heard of donuts being filled before frying. This could cause so many problems with the donut separating during frying, and the filling would probably not be enough and would also be double cooked. I've always filled mine after frying , either by using a flavor injector filled with jam, or using a  plastic medicine syringe from pharmacies.  If those are not options., you can slit the donut in the side, move the knife around in the middle to create room for jam,  and use a  pastry bag of jam and pipe it in, or a spoon to fill it. Overall, good recipe though.

Yummy! I followed the directions for a stand mixer, since I don't have a bread machine.  I filled a few with Holland cream (from this site) and made doughnut holes rolled in cinnamon sugar.   I had Holland cream left over from Cream Horns (on a baking binge here) We preferred the ones rolled in cinnamon sugar.  I'm the only one who likes jelly filled, so I didn't do that since I'll eat them!  I recommend reading the Allrecipes article on frying doughnuts.  If you like fluffy, chewy, light yeast doughnuts that are easy to make, this one is perfect.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

We used APF and put the jam in after it was fried. My son decided to make a chocolate glaze to go on top which made it a perfect balance of sweetness. I thought they were a little bready but the rest of the family loved them.

Pastry was lovely but I just couldnt get the rings to join. They kept splitting in the oil.  I did wet around the rim and then experimented with wetting the whole area around the jam but no difference. Please help??

The only change that is a more practical one and one that commercial bakeries use is filling the doughnuts after being fried. That can be done cheaply by using a pastry bag with a larger round tip or maybe using a empty squeeze bottle like the ones used by those fancy crepe makers doing those fancy drawings out of the batter. Well anyway just poke a small hole in the side of each cooked doughnut and squeeze filling inside. Just be careful to not squeeze too much filling or it will just explode out through another side or bottom of the doughnut.

We made these for Chanukah in place of traditional sufganyot. The only minor substition was to use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour because we had it on hand. We followed the editor's note and used the standing mixer (not bread machine), and it was very easy! 

Be aware that they take a long time. There are several steps of long waits while the yeast rises, so plan accordingly. 

Doughnuts were glazed with a mix of Peanut Butter Glaze and Chocolate Glaze I.
