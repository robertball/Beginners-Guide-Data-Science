These awesome cookies couldn’t be any easier! I formed the dough into a log shape and refrigerated it while the oven preheated. I then just cut rounds instead of rolling it out and using cookie cutters. They didn’t change shape or spread out at all. They have a true shortbread texture- with a bit of crispness to them. They are perfect for dunking in your tea because they don’t fall apart. Thank you, Manella, for another great recipe.

I am the submitter of this recipe. I have found that Natrel makes a lactose free butter that works very well in this recipe.

I made these exactly as directed, including the margarine brand. As another reviewer suggested, I rolled the dough into 2 logs, chilled it and cut into rounds with sugar crystals on top for added flavor. They look nice and have a good texture, but they taste awful. I WANTED to like them because I was taking them to a party but, now I really can't.  I wonder if it's the flour blend or the vegan margarine? Perhaps more sugar or some vanilla would help....?

Thanks for an easy to make cookie that will offer something for those restricted from most choices at the reception's dessert buffet. I made these per the recipe, but rolled them for a 'slice and bake' version.  I sprinkled some sugar sprinkles on the top for some visual interest and appreciated that they did not flatten during baking. They have the initial texture of a standard shortbread cookie, but dissolve a bit too easily on the tongue (probably because of the Gluten-Free blend). Pairing them with coffee or tea is a great idea! I will likely make these again, but will add some lemon zest to the batter, I think.
