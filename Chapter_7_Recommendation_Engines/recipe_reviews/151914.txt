Very nice. Because it's baked in a springform pan, it's a very attractive coffee cake. The cinnamon is quite pronounced, but it's perfect for a cake of this type. I didn't use the almonds or the almond flavoring, prefering a simple teaspoon of vanilla so as to get the pure, buttery flavor of the cake. The cake is moist and delicious but I found that the pears didn't contribute much in the way of flavor, so that when I came across a blueberry I found I wanted more of them. Therefore, if I was to make this again, unless there's some real flavorful pear I'm unaware of, I'd skip the pears altogether.  I'd maybe substitute apples with the blueberries instead or maybe just use blueberries, but a lot more of them.

Just made this last night and it's great!   The cake is a nice moist cake with bits of pears, blueberries and almonds.  I was worried the almond extract would be too strong but it mellows ut quite nice.  Doesn't need the whipped cream but is nice to add a little more flair after for serving!  Thanks for a new taste!

Delicious. I made this for my husband and I because my pears were gonna go bad, but I will definately make this if I ever have a bunch of my girlfriends over, it is the perfect coffee cake for company. The cinnamon-sugar topping is sooooo good.

Pears have a very delicate flavor and slightly grainy texture that identifies the cooked pieces of fruit in this cake as pears.  I loved them together with the pieces of almonds.  I increased the blueberries to 1 cup of frozen and liked them in the cake more for color, contrast and health benefits.  I did NOT add the cinnamon sugar topping and am glad I didn’t. I was quite sweet enough without it for me.  I prefer a mildly sweet coffee cake.  Ate with a dollop of real whipped cream but then liked it better alone.  My hubby who doesn’t eat fruit liked it and said it made him feel like he was eating healthy lol!  Will probably be a regular at our house.  Will try using white whole wheat flour next time.

---> After making it a 2nd time: 
Either ripe or unripe pears are fine - however if pears ripe and sweet then reduce sugar!  Cake was a bit too sweet the second time, maybe because of ripe sweet pears.
Tart blueberries make a nice contrast to sweet pears and sugar in cake.
Test cake for done-ness at the very center.  Mine was a little raw in the center and had to go back for 15 more min.
White whole wheat flour works just as well as white.
I used 3 pears and 1 cup of blueberries and 1/2 cup of almonds - this is a very moist fruitful cake ;)  Almost like eating pie with the crust mixed in.

7.15.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/151914/pear-and-blueberry-cake/ ... I accidentally reduced sugar in topping to 1T - & only white.  I added the third cup milk to the sugar mixture.  Then, the combined flour mixture with the addition of 1/2t salt &  a full cup more blues.  Batter smelled strong w almond extract n looks so cinnamony w a t in  & on, but wasn't.   Surprised me.   Coffeecake-ish.   I liked it more than I thought I would, but still prefer a less fruit & different fruit type cake.

I liked the flavors of the cake and thought it was a perfect coffee cake for breakfast.  I did think my cake had way too many pears resulting in too much moisture which resulted in the cake portion having a gummy texture.  I wish the recipe listed how many cups of pears to use  instead of stating 3 pears because my pears must have been larger than the recipe submitter.

I received pears in a gift basket and decided to give this recipe a try. I am so glad I did. Very yummy. I substituted vanilla instead of almond extract only because I didn’t have the almond extract. Thanks for sharing.

I made it but used 2 pears and 2 cups of blueberries.  I also mixed the sugar mixture in the cake mix at the last minute instead of putting it on top.  I did sprinkle a little white sugar on top.  It was delicious!

Have been making this recipe since 2010.  It was my husband's favorite dessert.  It all started when we received Harry and David pears as a gift.  Made no additions or changes to the recipe.  Use fresh blueberries when in season and frozen when fresh not available.  Serve topped with whipped cream.  Delicious and easy!

I used apples instead of pears because that's what I had... delicious!  Looking forward to trying it with pears.  (I also borrowed from another recipe and added toasted coconut to the topping.. yum!)

I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I omitted the almonds and added and extra 1/4 cup blueberries.  I had to bake it for about 60 minutes for it to be fully cooked in center.  It is flavorful, but I think there is too much almond flavoring.  It overpowers the pears and blueberries.  Even with cooking that long, it is still very moist.  Yet it is a weird texture.  Almost like a spongecake.  Not what I expected and kind of turned me off.
