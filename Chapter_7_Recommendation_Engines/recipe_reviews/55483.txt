For DAYS before I tried this out, I salivated!  Very tasty cocktail!  Tad too sweet for my taste, but that can be rectified!  Great concept to use limeande conc.!  Will keep some in the freezer!  Tried this out last "Margharita Monday," when a friend joined me for a happy hour  afternoon.  Thanks much for posting this recipe!

I love amaretto and am always looking for good recipes!  Thanks for this one.  I made it on the rocks because my daughter was sleeping and I didn't want to wake her with the blender.  I sugared the glass, then measured the ingredients in equal parts then added handfulls of crushed ice from my fridge to the sugarline and stirred it a bit then topped it off with a little more amaretto and a splash of cointreau!  Yum.

Whew Lawdy!!  This is wonderful.  Had this at Olive Garden last night and couldn't wait to find a recipe that is a close match.  This is it.  It is a bit more on the lime flavor than OGarden but it's close enough that I'll not need to order this again at the restaurant.  My husband and I are both thrilled with this recipe.  Can't wait to make this for my family next week during Thanksgiving eve appetizer dinner.

Absolutely wonderful!  I had several friends over for my monthly dinner and drink party.  These exact margaritas are served at Olive Garden.  The only thing I did different was put the amaretto in a shot glass on the side for everyone to put in their drink like Olive Garden and sliced an orange for the side of the glass.  Thanks it went very well with Spinach Tomato Tortellini from this site.

I make one similiar to this but on the Rocks.  I use the  large can of frozen limeade - then use half a 'can' of water; half a 'can' of tequila; and then almost 1/2 'can' of triple sec.  Pour over the 'rocks' then add a shot of the Ameretto.  It's awesome.  I usually use salt - but will have to try the sugar.  Thanks.  I want one now but am at work - dang it - LOL

This was our New Year's Eve drink & they were fabulous! We used the Amarretto I made off this site, fresh-squeezed O.J. from my tree & DH contributed the Cabo Wabo that he received as a gift awhile back.  A little taste of heaven for the tastebuds! Don't rush past "rimming" the glasses-that "makes" it!

Love these  margaritas!  We were searching for a recipe for our favorite margarita "The Italian Margarita" served at Olive Garden.  This margarita matches it.  I added Cointreau a touch of Triple Sec and topped it off with Disaronno.  Perfect!!!

This recipe puts every restaurant margarita I've ever had to shame!  

I am going to try to make it healthier by substituting limeade for equal parts sugar substitute and fresh lime juice.  Still using real sugar on the rim though!

Love these!  One of my favorites!  The combination does sound like it would not go together, but they taste awesome!  Whenever we go to Olive Garden, I, too have to always have one!  Now a great recipe to make at home!

Very good!  We really liked this italian version of a margarita.  The amaretto gave it a unique flavor.  Along with the limeade, I like to squeeze in a lime to give it a fresh lime flavor.  I used about 2-3 tbs. of sugar to mellow out the tartness.  The sugar on the rim gives it a nice treat!  If you prefer salt on the rim, it is great as well.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is my favorite recipe for margaritas!

Doubled the recipe for a Memorial Day family reunion and it didn't last long! These are absolutely delicious and my new favorite drink. I wouldn't change the recipe at all.

This was very sweet!  You wouldn't want to use your very best tequila on this because the taste would get lost in all the ingredients.  I will try it again, though, using maybe different proportions.

Very good- I wasn't sure how well things would come together, but it was very good! I added a dash of grenadine, bc I didn't feel like sugaring the glass rim. A great alternative to a standard margarita!

Yummy!

I love amaretto and I love margaritas and this recipe was perfect.

Made it for some friends for cinco de mayo and even one who doesn't like tequila - loved it!

I thought this sounded interesting to serve with a cannelloni dinner I was preparing and it turned out even better than I expected.  Great flavour!  The colour is a bit off-putting but even the non-tequila-drinker in the crowd enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious!  Always looking for new drink recipes and this is a keeper.  Not very figure friendly, but sometimes you just have to splurge and this is worth the indulgence.

I made this on the rocks and thought it was a little sweet.   Next time, I'll increase the tequila and limeade a bit.

I recently had an Italian Margarita at Olive Garden and I came home with a huge craving for more. This recipe made me so excited. Not exactly the same but JUST AS GOOD. Thank you!

Good cocktail. I was sceptical about this combination: tequila and amaretto, but it turns out good.

This margaritas were amazing!  You definitely have to blend with ice though - it's very concentrated.  I put the entire pitcher in the freezer.  It was cold, slushy and DELICIOUS!

One of the best Margaritas I've ever had!  If you like amaretto, this is one for you.  I used Patron in mine to keep it smooth & because I am not a big fan of the taste of tequila, it was perfect!

I loved these, and because my husband didn't, I got to drink his as well! One of my favorite drinks is an Amaretto Sour, and this was very similar. Thanks for the recipe!

OK...not sure what the one from the Olive Garden tastes like but this one is fabulous!  We did add a bit more Amaretto because I love the stuff and people really enjoyed this.

This recipe is awesome!!!!Even my husband, who does not like tequila but loves amaretto raved about the drinks. The only change that I made was to add a little sugar(1/4 cup) and I used premade limeade and alot of ice. THanks!!

This is a recipe I didn't care for very much. It was ok but won't make again. Could really taste the amaretto. It seemed like like a sweeter margarita which I didn't care for.

Made them exactly according to the recipe.  I couldnt drink mine, was a bit too strong. To me, it didnt taste like the Italian Margaritas I've had in restuarants.

I didn't taste the amaretto as much as I thought I would.  It was pretty tasty, though.  I'll try switching around the amount of amaretto and tequila next time.

A nice change from regular margaritas.  I've made them twice now and, after reading the reviews, added some cointreau, which made this even better.
