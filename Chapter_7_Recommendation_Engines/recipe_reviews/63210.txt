My boyfriend loved, LOVED it!  I really liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Note--to make pumpkin pie spice if you don't have any, mix 1 Tbl. cinnamon; 1 Tbl. ground ginger; 1 1/2 tsp. nutmeg; 1 1/2 tsp. allspice.

This was wonderful and sooooo simple. I was all set to make a different recipe when I saw that I was missing a key ingredient. So I did a quick search and found this one. The only thing I left out was the pumpkin spice because I didnt have any. I will be making this alot. Im so glad I "stumbled" upon it.

Made this the other night and it was fabulous. I used a 2'' thick ham steak so i basted and grilled each side one more time than the recipe stated. Also for the glaze I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon bc that was what I had onhand. I thought the flavors blended together wonderfully, but the ham itself was a little too salty so next time I'm going to play around and see what I can find to cut that even more. The only complaint I had was from one person who said it was too smoky, but I thought the smokiness lent great flavor. oh well can't please everyone

The glaze gave the ham a wonderful flavor. I used the Pumpkin Pie Spice II from this site to make the spice. Will do this again!

I had to change the way I cooked the ham since I didn't have a grill handy but I basically boiled the ham in water in a skillet till it was cooked then I basted one side and broiled it in the oven for 1 minute. Then I basted the other side and broiled that for another minute. Turned out wonderful and juicy. I've decided that I want to try a whole ham glazed in this sauce sometime!

Very good! This is a great way to change up the flavor of a ham steak from the traditional styles. I used an ale rather than apple juice, and the combination with the dijon, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice was fabulous. I will make this again.

I made this recipe this evening.  We enjoyed it.  I read the reviews prior to making it.  I think those who said it was bland may not have applied the glaze sufficiently.  It was very easy to make and I had all the ingredients the recipe called for.

Not bad.  I think I'd use the sauce as a marinade next time--I've just learned that I'm not a huge fan of basting!  I felt like I wasted a ton of the sauce.  It was quite easy though, and the flavor was pretty good.  Bf never noticed there was mustard in it.  Score!  ;o)  I'll make it again but use the sauce as a marinade.  thanks for the recipe!

It was OK . Nice change, but our family prefers Doreen's Ham Slices On The Grill recipe , found on this website.   May try again in a few months when we are looking for a break from our favorite glaze recipe.

Wow, this was great! Grilled as written, made sure to baste the last 4 minutes of cooking..and coated it for about an hour before hand..how people said this was bland is beyond me..so tasty and good!
