I thought this cake had a good taste to it. It also gave my kitchen a great aroma of cinnamon while it was cooking! It didn't rise as much as I wished it would, but it was pretty easy to make and my family and I still liked it. It also took only about 20 or 25 minutes to bake.

i read all the comments and thought that this would be a bland, flavorless cake. It really isn't. I actually thought it was pretty good and my family liked it too. I would suggest that you add a little bit more brown sugar, cinnamon, and milk. That's it. Don't change the recipe all around and then say that its bad cause its not if you just follow the recipe. Lastly, DONT SHORTEN THE COOKING TIME!!!!! Mine came out perfectly in about 40 minutes.

I was disappointed to  find this cake flat and a little bland.  It came out more 
like an overcooked pancake.  The topping on it was nice but the bake time on 
is much too long.  Keep an eye on it and take it out when an inserted toothpick 
comes out clean from the middle (more like 20 min).

I read others' comments and before putting it in the oven, I added an extra dash of baking powder (to fix any problems with rising) and I added 3 dashes of salt, one egg, I doubled the amount of vanilla, i added a dash of cinnamon to the cake mix, and I only cooked it for 15 minutes. It turned out pretty good and it has a lot of good flavor. I didn't have problems with it being rubbery or flat like a pancake. I would definately recommend atleast adding one egg to boost flavor! Good luck!

I made this because I wanted coffee cake but didn't have any eggs on hand.  I took the suggestion of others and used butter instead of shortening.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon, a pinch of cardamom and a dash of nutmeg to the batter.  Instead of the brown sugar and cinnamon on top I made a crumb topping by mixing 1 c of flour, 4 TBSP melted butter, 3/4 c brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled it on the batter before putting it in the oven.  This won't become my favorite coffee cake, but it is very good and I would make it again.

This came out great for us. I didn't read any reviews until after I made it. I made CupCakes instead of a cake and didn't have any rising problems. I did substitute butter (real, no salt) for the shortening. I did add more topping of brown sugar and cinnamon. Yum, great with coffee or milk. It's really a 'coffee cake' like taste/consistency and it's not too bad for breakfast, hence the name it was given. Enjoy!

I like it! Turned out well, although I only baked it about 20 minutes and it was fine. Also I substituted butter for shortening, and for the topping I used this recipe: 3/4 cup flour
             1/2 cup dark brown sugar
             1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
             4 tablespoons butter
Very good, will definatley make again.

Try adding 4 Tbsp Butter to the top, cut into small pieces over the top before baking.  This adds moistness to the cake.  It also allows some of the brown sugar to melt down through, and really adds to the breakfast cake!

It isnt bad, it just isn't that good! I baked this twice in one day. The first time, followed recipe exactly. Came out with a lumpy dry glob that no way could POUR into any baking dish! It tasted flat, too. And the baking time was waaaaaaay too long. Second time, I used 3 tbs of oil instead of shortening and a dash more milk, increased brown sugar topping to 1/3 cup. That was a lot better. Still reminded me of a cake shaped pancake, with cinnamon topping.  But actually went well with coffee and I know all the ingredients in it, unlike the boxed/packaged junk.

Chose this as I was looking for something withou eggs for breakfast. Seriously lacking depth of flavor - very sweet - perhaps use butter instead of shortening, cut back on the sugar a little, add a pinch of salt and cinnamon in the batter?  It was rubbery after 25 mins of cooking but the sugar on top hadn't melted so am eating uncooked cinnamon with every sweet rubbery bite.... don't think I'll make this again.

Positives:  It's light on calories, easy to whip up, requires very few ingredients (and no ingredients that are obscure), and requires little time to bake.  Negatives:  The topping is good, but the cake itself is flavorless.  I might do a cinnamon-brown sugar swirl inside to help.  Or, as others have suggested, add more vanilla.  Also, in a 9x13 pan, it came out kind of flat.  Either you need to 1.5 the recipe amounts, or try a loaf pan 3/4 full (doesn't rise much) or possibly an 11x7.

I thought this recipe came out good and it didn't take too long to make. But I did make a few adjustments. I used unsweetened apple sauce in place of the shortening, healthier substitution. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I didn't have any vanilla extract so I ended up using maple syrup instead. And used 2 teaspoons of baking powder based on other readers suggestions. You know adding some cinnamon and nutmeg in the mix is a good too.

This is the WORST mess I ever tried to make. Went together fine, but OMG it is the most tasteless "cake" I've ever made. Won't make this again and would discourage anyone else from trying it too...don't waste your time, seriously.

If you make this recipe expecting a cake, you will be disappointed. It's really more like a bread sort of thing.  If you have that in mind, this recipe isn't bad. Following the reviews of others, I blended an egg into the creamed mixture (in which I used margerine because I didn't have shortening). This did make it rise a bit, but it's a very dense kind of cake. I put a dash of lemon juice into the milk to thicken it a bit with traditional coffee cake (which uses sour cream) in mind. I baked it at 350 for only about 20 minutes. It's not too bad, in the end, but again, not like traditional coffee cake.

The recipe itself was OK. I tweeked a few things and got it to where I liked it. I added apples, much more cinnamon, nutmeg, more baking powder, some baking soda, and some lemon zest. The cooking time was also about 20 minutes.

I took everyone's advice on the butter instead of shortening-that was fine. Added some honey, chopped dates and walnuts (great extra flavor!) But in the end, I wished I had put it in a bread pan.. very flat and not too much taste. But- good for an eggless  sweet bread! Smells great in the oven!

Well I know the batter tastes awesome!!! So the whole thing better be killer too..lol. I changed things of course as that is the only way I cook. I made the basics per the recipe..but I dont like shortening so I used Smart Balance 50/50, and added one egg to sugar, butter, vanilla mixture..I also added one additional tsp of baking powder. I didnt measure the brown sugar and cinnamon and pretty sure I made more than double. I put half into a bowl and added 1/3 cup of batter and stirred it until smooth. I then dotted the top of the batter in the pan with that and swirled it in. I then topped it with the remaining brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and put in the oven. When it comes out and is cool I will also drizzle with some powdered sugar glaze. I cant wait to eat it!!!

I made this cake today and I used a 9" loaf pan.  It rose beautifully.  It took the full 45 mins to bake fully.  I took the advice of others and added an egg, and more vanilla plus I added about 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter.  I think you could add a little more cinnamon to the batter but overall it is really good.

A light and soft cake with a lovely crunchy topping.  I think sifting the flour is very important in this cake to add air to the mixture.  I will make this again and will put a little cinnamon in the cake itself because we love cinnamon (I doubled the amount in the topping this time because of that) but that is all I'd change. This really is a great cake for when you've not got an egg in the house. Oh, and I cooked mine for exactly 40 minutes and it came out perfect!

I made the mistake of following the directions as written. :-(  End result was an overdone, flat, tasteless brick.  It frustrates me when people take a recipe like this that is fundamentally broken. FIX IT, then rate 5 stars, so a moron like me thinks the recipe is actually good.  Needs to cook for half of the time stated  Needs twice the baking powder  Needs something in the dough for flavor, other than sugar, flour, and a few drops of vanilla.  Pan size is incorrect for ingredients listed, needs a much smaller pan.

Wish I would have read the other reviews before making this. Baking time and temperature were WAY too high. Ruined the whole thing. The flavor is all right, though. I also was hoping the cake would rise more.

I read the other reviews before I made this, so I did make some changes. I added 4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice with the flour and sprinkled it on top with the brown sugar. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. The flavor turned out great, but like many others said it is thin and a bit rubbery. My kids will eat it, but we won't be making this again.

I changed it a little but it was delicious! I used 1 egg creamed in with the sugar and butter (instead of shortening) I topped with almost twice as much brown sugar and cinnamon. I get it to a bunch of kids after a sleepover and everyone gobbled it up

I doubled the topping and cut in 4 Tablespoons cold butter before sprinkling it on the top.  The topping was amazing, but the cake itself was a bit bland.

It did not rise at all and it was bland.  It seemed like that there was something missing.

Wonderful starter recipe to do what you want. I chopped/pureed up some fresh frozen strawberries and swirled them onto the top and let it bake right in. Very refreshing. I added approx. 2 cups.

i was in a pinch and needed breakfast but didn't have eggs, so i tried this. i used mayo instead of shortening (also not on hand) and it turned out fine with that. I also doubled the brown sugar for the top. It doesn't rise much and comes out like a dense but moist cake about an inch thick. baked for the time stated and it was fine. also, i just mixed the wet, mixed the dry, then combined the two and that was no problem either. Good recipe :)

The taste factor was great, but this cake is very dry and really dense. I followed the instructions with one exception - I had to substitute the shortening with butter. As I have read from others perhaps adding egg to this recipe will help with the flat outcome.

My family and I enjoyed it. I added more shortening, which I replaced with margarine. I also added cinnamon to the batter instead of just the top. I added a very generous amount of brown sugar topping topping. Delightful. Next time I may add a bit more sugar...but we loved it.

Changed up the recipe and it was a nice light cake. 1 1/4 cup of milk, 1 1/4 tsp baking soda, one egg, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and of cinnamon to the batter. Made a topping with 2 Tbs butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to top it off.  35 minutes was a little long for a ceramic pan, though.  Will try 30 minutes next time.

This breakfast coffee cake could have been better. It had to much flour taste to it. It was moist but tasted to much like regular bread and not coffee cake. I even followed other reviews advice and still would prefer another type of coffee cake.

Loved this! Super moist and delicious. I used coconut oil in place of shortening, threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips and a dash of cinnamon in the batter. I also baked it at 350.  Will try it with frozen blueberries next time.

Very easy and simple. Very nice if you just need something settling. Family loved! I thought they were pretty good.
