Man we Loved this recipe. We tweaked it a little bit by adding a mixed cheese blend and leaving off cilantro. Next time we'll add black olives as well. This will be in our rotation for sure.

I made this recipe last night for my April Allrecipes Allstars? campaign. I gave it 4 stars and here is why. Chorizo is a very strong flavor and it took over the bites. There are not enough other flavors here to compete with it. I did end up adding shrimp to some of the bites. I sauteed them quickly in the remaining chorizo fat and cut them in half prior to assembly. I feel that in the directions they need to be much more specific. It tells you to divide and flatten the dough. I feel they need to add to either roll the dough thin or use a preheated pizza stone. I encountered an issue where, because of the size of the bites, the cheese was brown before the dough had a chance to cook fully. This may be partially a preference thing as I like a very crispy crust when eating thin crust pizza.

These are perfect for race day parties. I used homemade chorizo because I couldn't find the tubed variety. I also used gluten free pizza dough. These are definitely a snack to prepare with the kids. Thank you for the recipe.

Simple and fun to make. Get the kids to help making these flavor packed pizzas. Instead of the Monterrey Jack I used a Mexican four cheese blend.
