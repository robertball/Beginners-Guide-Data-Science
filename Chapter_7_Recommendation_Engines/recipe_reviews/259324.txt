First time I made this it worked out perfectly! Super easy and delicious! I loved how the crust wasn't super hard or too crunchy, even after being frozen. It ended up being almost fudge line in consistency. I topped the ice cream with chopped up Heath bar candy and then drizzled with hot fudge and a little whipped cream for each slice. This time I made it slightly different. Instead of the chocolate chips, I used peanut butter chips and topped the ice cream with chopped Reese's peanut butter cups. Can't wait to try it!

Yummy desert!! Just make sure that you don’t make it too watery and not too fluffy or else you won’t be able to put the ice cream on top. I had to cut the top off and put it back in the oven. Other wise yummy!! You should also top it with crushed chocolate chip cookies!!
