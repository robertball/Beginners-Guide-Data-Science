Good recipe.  I topped it with some a cherry on each piece of cake.  I also reduced the sugar to 3 1/2 cups and increased the cocoa powder by 4-5 tbl spoons.  Just to give it a more chocolate taste.  It is a quick and easy topping for cakes....I will make again for sure.

I have made this at least 20 times

I add cocoa to sugar and mix together.  Pour hot melted butter over it.  Mix with mixer.  Add other ingredients and mix until very smooth.

I've been using this recipe for many years to top the cola cake.  Since it is so sweet we usually cut cake pieces very small and put a dollop of whipped cream on top.

We used Dr. Pepper and poured it over Cola Cake made with Dr. Pepper.  Most kids liked the icing, but a couple said they would have preferred regular frosting, which is the only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars.

Really good quick recipe. We use this on top of the cola cake. I leave out the nuts due to an allergy and leave the rest the same.
