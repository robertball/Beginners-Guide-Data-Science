I made this recipe for congee ( jook in Cantonese) exactly as written. The consistency and flavors were spot-on for this style of Asian comfort food. It differs slightly from the recipe that I make by using short grain rice. I use 1 cup of long grain jasmine rice and 1/2 cup of sticky rice. I gave this recipe 5 stars because the authenticity and taste were there. Thanks for your recipe.

This congee is pretty good though I had to add a ton of salt. The cilantro added a nice bright flavor. Next time I would leave the peanuts out, but that's just my preference.

This is a good base to follow.  It is not thanksgiving but I wanted to make the congee.  I used the ingredients that I had at my home.  I did not have left over turkey but u used the chicken from Costco.  I peel the chicken to add some into the congee.  The other meat I will use for a salad.
