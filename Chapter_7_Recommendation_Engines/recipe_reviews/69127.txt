This recipe seemed like it would be a nice taste departure from my usual way of preparing tofu stir fry with Asian seasonings.  But I found myself adding Asian flavors: a little soy sauce, rice vinegar, and hoisin sauce.  I did use tofu that had been frozen (the first time I've tried that) so possibly it had a stronger taste that overpowered the gravy???  Sorry, but next time I'll go with my usual preparation.

I thought it was good because the vegetables weren't overcooked.  I don't like mushrooms so I left that out.  I also cooked the tofu separately first because I like mine with a more chewy texture.  It was very light and fresh tasting.  My child loved it.

Yummy, it tasted almost like a tofu soup!  I made it with udon noodles, and really loved it.  My broth didn't come out as thick, but I liked it as it ended up.

I used soba noodles instead of rice and also kept the gravy separate.  We loved it!  One of the best stir frys we have ever eaten.

I like it. It did taste like a tofu soup. It is an interesting take on the classic asian stir-fry because the taste of it is very different from what you would expect. It's pretty fast to make though so that means it's a keeper in my book.
