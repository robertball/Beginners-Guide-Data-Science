Cinnamon rolls never disappoint, and this recipe is no different.  I don’t use a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast in the milk, added the rest of the ingredients, with the exception of the flour which I added a cup of at a time using my KA mixer.  I don’t use margarine, only butter, and I added chopped walnuts and raisins to the filling – it’s the law in this house.  Baking time was 20 minutes.

Excellent!  I cut corners by using Rhodes frozen whole wheat bread loaf and using 2/3 the  cinnamon/brown sugar mix inside.   There was plenty of sugar already for the Rhodes size loaf ... Turned out gooey and delicious.

I loved how these came out! The only thing I did differently, was use Fage greek yogurt instead of cream cheese(didn't have any) in the icing. It had the perfect texture and flavor! Also used a little vanilla Natural Bliss creamer to make it the right consistency for us....Yummo!

It was ok. Not much "healthier" really. One person rated this recipe 5 stars without even having made the dough - but used store-bought frozen bread...if you're not going to make the actual recipe or change it up so much that it's not the actual recipe, please do not post your false results. Silly.

I could not have used the full 4.5 cups of flour without ruining it.

my dough seemed a little tough and I've made the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe many times with great success.....shouldn't there be some salt in this recipe??

How the heck are these healthier!?! Use full fat, use butter and enjoy the TREAT! I’ve had better and they certainly are not healthier. Margarine is garbage and toxic.
