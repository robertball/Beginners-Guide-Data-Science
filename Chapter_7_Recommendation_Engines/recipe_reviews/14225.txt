Wow!  I am a self-proclaimed tuna hater and only made it for someone else.  Well, of course you must sample prior to serving and my only regret is that I didn't make enough for me.  It really only makes two hoagies worth.  But hey, it won me over anyway.

I don't really care for tuna, but even I liked this!  I added maybe a tablespoon of minced dill pickle to the mix and served it on multi-grain toast.  My husband liked it so much he asked for seconds in his lunch the next day!

Made this last night and enjoyed it quite a bit. The flavor is much different than your run of the mill tuna salad- it tastes much more "fresh" and healthy. I really liked that a lot. I used dried dill instead of fresh and not quite as much. Was excellecnt in mini- pitas, but I bet it would be better in hollowed out tomatoes. Thanks so much for the recipe jessica!

I also substituted light sour cream for the yogurt, and added just a dab more of mustard and use low-fat miracle whip.  I used a 3 oz tuna packet in place of the canned tuna.  Great lunch recipe -- is very light and tasty!

Good basic recipe, but I used 1 1/2 tsp spicy brown mustard, 1 1/2 tsp dried dill and 2 tsp dried parsley. I also added 3 hardboiled eggs, chopped, and adjusted the mayo/sour cream after adding. Depending on your brand of tuna, you may want to add salt. Took it to church in little cream puff shells- came home with an empty plate!

Dill certainly adds an interesting kick to this tuna salad.  I loved the combination, and will make it again for the upcoming party.  Thanks!

My two star rating, I believe, speaks for itself. But to elaborate, I had a number of issues with this unappealing tuna salad.  First, it was mushy and gushy…and I used only part of the juices in the can. My suggestion? Eliminate it altogether.  With the exception of the celery, this was waaaaay too “green”… and I used probably less than half of the parsley, dill and green onion called for. (Curiously, chives were mentioned in the recipe’s description but green onion called for in the ingredients) The yogurt added nothing positive in my judgment and, since a bunch of canned tuna liquid is already included, only served to make this even gushier. The immense amount of parsley, green onion and dill overtook the tuna altogether, not only in taste but in sheer volume – one almost had to hunt and peck to find the specks of tuna before I added another can to adjust. The Dijon mustard was a nice idea, but there wasn’t enough – again, it was clouded over by the “green.” One would have thought this would have been packed with flavor, but instead it was lacking.  A little pepper helped but was a trivial correction.   Finally, because of all the green stuff it was just plain unattractive – it does not make you want to dig in.

Great tuna salad - I used light mayo instead of fat free and added a bit of fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I let this chill for an hour before serving on whole grain toast.

Very lite and fresh. I have added 1/2 cup of boiled rice and substituted mustard for lemon juice and black pepper. To my taste,it was OK.

Not bad.  My girlfriend felt that the dill was a little too strong but I loved it.  Not very mayonnaisey which, for me, is a GOOD thing.  Took awhile to chop everything up.  Still leaves a bit to be desired...

I must say that this is the tastiest tuna recipe I've had in a while!  So easy and quick too.  Can use dried herbs but the fresh ones are better.  Thanks for the great recipe Jessica.

I used doubled the recipe and used albacore tuna, drained.  I will try sour cream next time, I thought the low fat yogurt made it a little runny, but overall it was delicious and I will definitely make again.

Dill is a great addition to tuna.  However, I drained the tuna and substitute sour cream for yougart.  It was very good and not real mayonaisey.

One suggestion, those who are going to try this recipe may want to save the juice and add the juice to the tuna accordingly.  Too much juice may make the salad watery; otherwise, this is a "cool" recipe for the summer.

Nice flavor - the mustard brings out the tanginess in the dill.  Nice alternative to boring mayo and relish :-)

Excellent!  This is a fresh-tasting tuna salad that is quite yummy.  I used white albacore tuna and added a little lemon juice and a dash of garlic tabasco sauce.  I also used regular mayo and sour cream, because that is what I had in the fridge.  One note--it really only makes enough for two servings.  Thanks for the delicous recipe!

My husband and I eat tuna sandwiches quite often and this was a great change up from what we normally make.  I used double the recipe amount of dill because I used dry.  It turned out good but I think next time I will stick with the fresh dill to give it even more of a kick.

I love this! I will use a little less dill next time though. I added a whole minced dill pickle, used about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a couple of light shakes of garlic powder. Great on well-toasted bread and topped off with bean sprouts.

Very good, fresh tasting filling for tuna sandwiches. I read the reviews ahead of time and drained the liquid out of the tuna can, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I am looking forward to trying this in a tuna melt.

I wanted to like this a lot, but I felt it was just okay. I put it on rye bread for a sandwich, but maybe that was where I went wrong. I was attracted to this recipe because of the yogurt - a very good idea to keep things healthy and low fat. That said, because of the yogurt's tangy-iness, I think it would be much better on a bed of lettuce and/or other greens. Perhaps I did not use enough dill.

I like this recipie ALOT everything mixes perfectly its so fresh and delicious. I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt because of watery issues and fat free mayo. Taste incredible, sour cream is a great sub for the plain yogurt. However if you do want to use yogurt i recomend FAGE 0% Greek Yogurt for this recipie as that yogurt is not watery at all.

Excellent!! I'm giving it four stars only because it was very runny when I finished - almost like soup - a really good soup. I even added three chopped hard-boiled eggs, and it was still runny. I will drain or at least save the juice to add once the other ingredients are mixed together. One good thing about being runny was not having to add salad dressing when eaten with salad greens.

Possibly the best tuna salad ever!  I used fresh tuna b/c I cannot stand canned tuna and it was wonderful - got rave reviews from guests who tried it.

this tasted way too green/herbal and hardly like tuna.. after reading the reviews i decided to make a few changes.. i never leave in the liquid from the tuna can so i drained as i normally do.. i halved the celery and green onion.. used all greek yogurt.. and then stone ground mustard for the dijon.. but i had forgotten the dill when i mixed everything together (doh!!).. i began tasting and felt the tuna was completely overpowered by the celery/onion/parsely (i used cilantro).. i immediately added about a tbsp of yellow mustard, then a tbsp of bottled lemon juice and still feeling it needed something to overcome the green i decided it would be better if i just added some mustard with horseradish in it.. after eating about two thirds of it (5 servings.. really?) i realized i had forgotten the dill so i added about 1/4 tsp of dried to the bit that was left.. i ate this over a piece of toast.. bf said he liked how "fresh" it tasted but it was just too much for me.. i could only imagine how it would have been if i added everything verbatim

I really liked this but made a few tweaks that I felt brought it up to a five star recipe but since I am rating it as written I felt I had to give it a four.  I upped the dijon mustard to a tablespoon and also added some lemon juice, salt and pepper. Those few minor changes made a huge difference and it was fantastic!

Used 1 TBSP of sour cream in place of the yogurt because that is what I had on hand. It was very good! The leftovers were even better because they were fully chilled.

I didn't add Yogurt, so I used just Mayo (olive oil mayo), and did not add the celery. I did add some dill pickle relish, as I love pickles.

Was good enough to make again, but nothing special. I might add some diced hard boiled egg next time.

I did a lot of things different with this, but it turned out amazing. Used regular mayo, used french onion dip instead of yogurt (this is amazing by the way!!), doubled the celery, and left out the juices from the cans of tuna. The mustard and the dill definitely make the difference though. Highly recomend this no matter how you make it.

This was even better than I expected. The dill was perfect with the tuna and made for a different tuna salad. I also like the balance of the mayo with the yogurt. This will be my go to tuna salad from now on!

Delicious, flavorful recipe! I made mine into a tuna melt, I toasted the bread and put a slice of cheese and melted it first. I didn't have celery so I put pickles in it instead. Yum!

I made this for my mom who is on a pretty strict diet.  I used a no sodium white albacore tuna.  I added a little garlic to it just to jazz it up a little.  She was very happy with the results.  Thanks!!!

A delicious and refreshing way to have tuna salad.  Definitely different from the traditional version--the fresh dill gives this familiar taste a unique but delicious twist.  The only changed I made was omitting the yogurt completely  and adding slightly more mayo (maybe a tsp more-I don't like my tuna salad too creamy).  I also used reduced fat mayo and it turned out great. Next time, I might try adding a little lemon juice.

This recipe was great.  I am not a big tuna salad lover at all, but I decided to try this recipe, since I know that tuna salad can be a healthy way to have lunch. I used Mayo with Olive Oil and low-fat yogurt instead of the fat-free varieties. I also used a dash of lemon juice, dried parsley instead of fresh, and a dash of cayenne pepper. Delicious!

Didn't love it, didn't hate it. My biggest problem was that it was too thin. Next time, I'll add another can of drained tuna. I scooped it up with potato chips.

Have been on a tuna salad kick of late. (: Wow---this was REALLY good! Loved the dill (it seemed to over-power other flavors, including green onion, which was fine with me since I don't really like onion). I didn't think I was going to like it, but it was really tasty! I loved the addition of yogurt to this. Yummy! Oh, used celery salt instead of the real stuff---don't much care for celery.

Way, way too much dill. Fresh is OK but I would recommend 1/2 of stated. Hubby and I both agreed. Perhaps it was just too overpowering in a sandwich style and maybe stuffed in a tomato would be better. I also used Miracle Whip instead of the fat-free stuff and the mustard seemed un-noticed. Probably won't try it again.

Between the yogurt and the dill, this ended up tasting more like ranch dip than tuna salad. The flavor is good but not what I was hoping for from a tuna salad.

This was excellent! I am not a tuna fan so I'm not even sure what possessed me to try this recipe but I'm so glad I did. I did make a couple of alterations. First, the store was out of fresh dill so I had to use dry. I can only assume fresh would have made it even better so I will certainly try that next time. Second, I was afraid of it tasting too..tuna-y? So I did add some very finely chopped onion. It was great, tasted just like my chicken salad. I would have never guessed it was Tuna. Definitely a keeper.

This was my first time making tuna salad and my husband loved it! I did tweak the recipe a bit by using tuna packets (since that's what I had), no dill weed (since I didn't have any), one boiled egg, 3/4 tsp of dijon mustard, and 1/4 tsp of onion powder. Everything else I kept the same. Definitely let it refrigerate for a while to bring out the flavors. Delicious!

This was yummy althought I did change it around.  I used a whole can of tuna and a whole package (6 oz) of plain greek yogurt.   I also squeezed 1/2 lemon and used about 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard.  I skipped the parsley and the green onion.

Very tasty. A healthy alternative to traditional tuna salad. I doubled the recipe and it still didn't make much. The only changes I made were that I drained the tuna liquid and used less of the fresh dill that it called for. The dijon gave it a really good kick.

What a great twist on basic tuna salad!  Based on what I had, I used a large can of drained tuna, lite mayo, low-fat sour cream for the yogurt, sweet vidalia onion and added one hard boiled egg and kept the other ingredients the same.  The fresh dill and parsley really made the difference.

Loved this recipe! I doubled it but didn't put nearly that much dill in, bc I just couldn't see anything requiring 1/2 C of dill. I also used white onion bc I didn't have green onions.  Will definitely make again!

We liked this a lot! I used ranch dressing in place of the mayo & yogurt mixture, and used less of it for a drier filling. I then used this filling inside of buttered sheets of phyllo dough, rolled up like egg rolls, baked at 425 for 14 minutes. This is my new favorite tuna salad filling, thanks for sharing!

Delish! I added some fresh basil as well as some dill relish. Topped with fresh tomato slices on wheat bread - sooo yummy!

This was delicious. I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I used dried.  I also doubled the recipe in order to have several servings. Such a great variation on plain ol tuna salad.

I left out the celery and yogurt, used chives instead of green onion and added a little fresh basil, too. Yum-O, an excellant lunch sandwich! Maybe I make my sandwiches a little too big, though, because I only got about 1 1/2 servings out of it.

Oh so delicious!  Used 10 oz of tuna (cans were 5 oz each) because I like it with less mayo.  Dill is amazing!

I very much enjoyed this recipe. It is very light tasting and perfect! I really liked adding yogurt, not only did it cut the fat, it also added a delightful tang. This is going to be my tuna salad recipe from now on!  Note... I didn't have fresh dill s I had to sub with dried, still wonderful though.

This is very tasty, although the 2 TBS of parsley was too much.  I will add only half the amount next time.

Healthier spin (especially if you omit the mayo) on tuna salad.  Very bright and fresh flavor.  Would be lovely in finger sandwiches for a shower or luncheon.

Don't like to over modify a recipe, but this one i did. I think 1/4 cup of dill is too much. I used 1 can tuna, about 1/4 cup onion (love the onions), 1 tbl dill pickle relish, 1 tsp dill, 3 eggs, 2 tbl olive oil, mustard, and a squeeze of lemon. Super yummy and very good for you!

I loved this!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used greek style non-fat yogurt in place of mayo due to my low fat diet requirements.  This is a great recipe.  I agree that it would be great on a sandwich, or stuffed in a tomato or just plain good out of the bowl with a fork!  Thanks!!!

i really liked this.  i did drain the tuna first even though the recipe said no to.  something about leaving the tuna juices in just did not appeal to me.  but even so, the result was a perfect mixture and a healthy low fat low cal dish.

This tuna salad is awesome, I did add a little garlic salt, but other than that, I made it as is.  It was quite a hit!

This tuna surpasses anything you could get a gourmet deli :).  I drained the canned tuna, and I didn't have any celery or scallions so I added shredded fresh spinach and a dash of onion powder.  Thanks for the recipe!

One of my favorite tuna salad recipes from this site. The reviewer that complained about the tuna being overshadowed by the herbs, didn't probably notice the recipe editor's note. It mentions that the original recipe called for 6 oz can of tuna and that nowadays the can is only 5 oz. So, it advises to adjust  the  rest of the ingredients. 
My tuna was in olive oil so, I drained most of the oil out and added little bit of lemon juice to the tuna salad. Also, I didn't  have fresh dill. so I use about 1/2 t of dried dill. This amount is   only enough for 2 good size tuna salad sandwiches.

1/4 of a cup of fresh dill is ridiculous and overwhelmed the whole recipe. There is also too much parsley. Why are there so many wet ingredients in this?  Tuna juice, mayonnaise, yogurt.   The flavor and texture profile do not come close to working. I gave it 2 stars cause I did manage to eat it. I was hungry.

Made it according to recipe first time, except for sour cream instead of yogurt.  Drained tuna.  Next time I'll mix all wet ingredients together first and taste, taste, taste.  Wonderful taste with dill from my garden.  Will be my recipe now.

This tuna salad is awesome! Thanks for the recipe. I doubled everything to make a little bit more and used ground dill weed instead of fresh since that's all I had (used 1/3 ground for the amount of fresh). The flavor is so fresh and different from other tuna salads.

Very enjoyable salad. The only change I made was to add 2 eggs. I liked using yoghurt instead of mayo only.
