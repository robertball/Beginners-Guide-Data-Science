This is the first recipe I've tried that hadn't yet been reviewed, but I was intrigued.  This is delicious!  The only thing I changed was to use penne instead of lasagna noodles (personal preference).  This makes a lot, so plan on feeding a crowd or having a lot of leftovers.  I don't mind, though, it's even better the next day!  Thanks.

I love lasagna so it's no surprise that I love this recipe. the sauce is wonderful! I had to modify it for my childrens preferences (no mushrooms, mozzeralla cheese instead of swiss) but I think it would have been great as written. I used broccoli and spinach. I made one pan for dinner and one for the freezer. definately a repeater!

Me personally, found this a bit lacking in the "saucy" department.  I should've doubled the sauce.  Plus, I thought it was too hammy.  (Even upped the chicken to five shredded breasts) Nixed the 'shrooms.  Added in White wine, Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle, gobs of garlic, oodles more Parmesan and some parsley.  The crew (After a few him's and haw's about the broccoli), however, thought it was pretty darn tasty, and the entire pan was cleaned out.

My family loved it - but I did take several of the suggestions made by the other reviewers. I doubled the sauce, used half and half rather than milk, and added spinach instead of broccoli. The extra sauce was definitely a must. It was very filling and made plenty for a crowd - my 13x9 pan overflowed.  My husband, who does not do leftovers, offered to eat the lasagne again the next night!

This pasta dish has some of my favorite flavors mellowed together: ham, bell pepper, mushroom, parmesan cheese. We're looking forward to the leftovers. The only thing I would change about it is that I would make the uppermost layer something moist, like one last layer of the white sauce. Making it as the recipe indicates creates a wasteland of pasta and somewhat dry-looking chunks of meat on top (not terribly attractive). Or you could do as Scrapbookworm suggests, just use penne pasta and mix it all together -- no dry stuff on top!

Great recipe! Made some changes however. Used spinach instead of broccoli. Left out the chicken stock, used hald and half instead of milk, added about a cup of havarty to the white sauce, used lots of garlic, and some white wine. I cut this recipe in half, and it still made enough for myself and my boyfriend to have 2 nights in a row. SOOO tasty! :)

This was the first time I made lasagna and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. It came out really tasty and even tasted better as it sat longer. I'm am definitely adding this to "my recipe box".

Really great flavor, added 3 minced garlic cloves to the vegi's. Would be MUCH better with a noodle vs. lasagna noodles, penne or something!

This lasagna was okay.  There are some things I will do differently next time--if I make it again.  I wish it had been creamier.  It had a good flavor, but I guess I was expecting sloppy, rich lasagna.  Overall, it was good though.  Maybe next time I will use colby jack instead of swiss.

I kind of used the recipe as a guideline, used the same amount of spices, milk and broth. Only made it with ham, Parmesan and mozzarella. I also used bow tie pasta and just cooked it on top of stove! It turned out really delicious

I made it without broccoli because broccoli is evil.  :D  Instead I used peas.  Also, I used the recommended penne pasta as well because I preferred not to have it as lasagna.  It turned out very good.  The flavor of the sauce was excellent.  I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to speed up the prep time.  I most likely will make this again.
