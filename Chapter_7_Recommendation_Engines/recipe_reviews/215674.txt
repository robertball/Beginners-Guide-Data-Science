I made this for Recipe Group. It was very good! Next time, I would use a HOT cast iron skillet. I used a Cuisinart Stainless pan with just a touch of oil and just didn't get the blacken results, though it browned nicely. The flavor was great, however, I used 1/2 the cayenne called for and that provided enough heat for me. Cotija was not available so I used a Mexican blend. Thanks! Nice side to compliment any Mexican dish!

I left out the bacon and forgot to add the garlic.  This dish is a great option as a side for any mexican or southwestern meal.    Add a squeeze of lime for the perfect final touch.   I look forward to trying this with bacon & garlic next time.

This dish was excellent as a side for fish tacos with cilantro and lime juice.  My wife and 2 year old daughter enjoyed it as well.  Using the bacon is a must and I used a little more cayenne pepper.  Will definitely do again.

Made this for Recipe Group:  16, April 2011  Most definitely 5-stars!  This corn is awesome!  I could not get it to truly "blacken", but it browned nicely.  I think a cast iron skillet would work well for this, but teflon worked fine.  My corn was fresh corn that we had froze, so I can't wait to try this with corn just cut from the cob.  The flavors blended well together.  I didn't have a red bell pepper, so I used a yellow one.  I added some diced tomato right at the end to add the red color.  Thanks CaliforniCajun for submitting this recipe - it is a keeper!!

Made this for Recipe Group. I made this is a nonstick skillet and never could get the corn to actually 'blacken', all it seemed to do was create a fond in the bottom which when the beer was added dissolved onto the corn turning it brownish. I ended up trying several times to blacken it dry and just adding more beer. It does have a good flavor though and I couldn't resist eating it straight out of the pan. Maybe the winter fresh corn doesn't have enough sugar to it yet. Not having easy access to the cotija cheese I subbed a Mexican shredded mix. Didn't use the cilantro, not a fan, just sprinkled some sliced scallion on the top. Good flavors though and I finished the beer off. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for the Recipe Group, loved this!  I just sauted the bacon until about 3/4 cooked, then added the other goodies.  Doubled the cumin, love the stuff.  I found the cheese at a Mexican grocery.  I used bi color corn, so sweet and tasty.  Like others I found this only browned, but no matter, it was delicious.  Nice side for upcoming summer events.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was better than I expected. I used green instead of red pepper and only had mozzarella.  The bacon was fantastic.  All in all, a good side.

I had to use frozen yellow & white corn b/c fresh was not available. I did not add beer nor could I find the cotija cheese at Target. I used Montery to sprinkle over. With my substitutions, it was still great. Great new side dish I am thankful for trying! It goes great with enchiladas! Yum!

Recipe Group selection of 4/16/11.  After reading other reviews, I used a cast iron skillet.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did get very small blackened bits, but I am sure that was from the bacon, which I cooked in the same pan.  If I had cooked it any longer the corn would have become mushy so I stopped at golden brown.  Color aside this was tasty, the cayenne gave it a nice subtle zing.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this side with margarita chicken and black beans. (Picture will be posted.) I used three cans of sweet corn, rinsed thoroughly, 1/2 a red bell pepper, 1/2 red onion, garlic and Budweiser beer. I didn't measure much of anything, and threw it together to taste. Turned out pretty good that way. I also did not use any cheese or bacon, only cilantro. We loved it.

I made this last night. It was such a great, light, fresh side dish. I didn't add the bacon or cheese and it was still excelent. I think using fresh corn makes a world of difference. I used a cast iron skillet and it worked great. The only beer in my fridge was PBR!! Not the tastiest beer to drink but you couldn't tell the difference once it cooked off.  Will for sure be making this again.

Highly recommend this.  Hubby is not a big Mexican fan as food is "too hot".  Made this as is and he loved it actually had a second serving and was disappointed that there were no leftovers.  Made this as is but could not find cotija cheese so subbed with Kraft Tex Mex.  I used a little hot sauce to give mine a little more kick.  Good recipe served it with Black Beans & Pork Chops from this site.

I loved this.  I've been making a similar version of Mexican corn for years, but the beer and cotija caught my eye on this one and they were fantastic.  The beer (I used Corona) adds a really interesting flavor and I'd never had cotija before but it's like a Mexican version of feta cheese (maybe a little less salty).  Will definitely make again!

Thank You, CaliforniCajun for a delicious and easy recipe!  I made it just like the recipe called for with one exception...I didn't have the Cotija cheese.  I substituted a very small amount of feta cheese (the container was nearly empty) and a little Colby jack. It worked out fine.  My husband couldn't wait for it to finish cooking so he made me give him a spoonfull for "quality control" of course!  lol   It's a winner in this house!

This was good.  I doubled the recipe, used a whole red bell and half a yellow, and skipped the bacon because I didn't have any.  Used a full Newcastle for the beer.  Very tasty, thanks.

super yummy.. i wasn't patient enough to get it blackened.. but it still tasted good.. i would reduce the onion just a bit next time.. but leave everything else the same.. ty for the recipe.  UPDATE: this is such a delicious versatile recipe.. this time i left out the red bell pepper and reduced the onion.. i used a combo of frozen corn and zucchini.. rarely do i keep cotija in the house so i used a mexican shredded cheese blend.. ty again for such a flavorful side dish

This was fantastic, thank you! I made it in a cast iron skillet with a hefeweizen, and I could've eaten the entire thing by myself. I used queso fresco rather than cotija, but I'm sure the other is delicious as well. I can't stress enough that this should be made in a cast iron, though. It blackens up beautifully that way. I would definitely make this again, next time it's going cold on a salad!

This recipe is amazing!!!  It's a fantastic side dish to our mexican dinner.  I can also see us making it just as a side when we grill out.  We made this last night and didn't use the bacon and it was still insanely good.  I added just a tad more garlic and it was perfect.  The cotija cheese is a must as is the cilantro.  We used this dish instead of the rice and it was a fantastic call!

This was so delicious! I didn't have fresh corn so I used about 1.5 cups frozen.  I didn't have the cheese either so I used a mix of marble and Parmesan.  I was also serving to kids so I left out the cayenne and let everyone sprinkle on their own amount at the table.  We had this with a simple BBQ pork tenderloin, rice and simple green salad.  This is one of those keeper recipes that's so versatile.  You could add beef or pork to it and serve it with tacos or wraps, serve it cold as a salad, overall just a great recipe!

YUM!  I used smoking cast iron skillet to char corn.  Previous review suggested this and I always do when I want to char corn.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It was great!  Many people with different tastes liked it!  To try to make it a meal, rather than a side, I added black beans.  I highly recommend it!

Hopefully the timing doesn't scare people off from making this! I just noticed it says 1.25 hrs!! I didn't notice that and it certainly didn't take that long to make! I happened to have some extra bacon from Sunday brunch, so that helped... BUT! multi-task! You don't have to wait for the bacon to finish before starting the rest of the dish! I used the recipe as more of a guide... skipped the red bell and replaced with diced chiles (extras from the other night); skipped the beer (wasn't necessary and I doubted I'd enjoy it since I'm not a fan of beer); skipped the cheese since I didn't want to use it (there was enough cheese on the enchiladas I served with the corn). If you keep your heat high enough and occassionaly stir the kernals, this tasty side dish should NOT take 20 minutes! The bacon was nice, but not critical. Give this a shot and tweak to what you have on hand or to your flavor preferences!

Excellent!  Made it for a dinner party and everyone had seconds and commented how great it was.  I couldn't find the cotija cheese, so I used feta cheese.  Also, served at room temp.  This recipe is a keeper.

I couldn't find the right cheese so I used shredded cheddar. I used a cast iron skillet and still could not get the corn to blacken.  It  was good.

I made this as per the recipe and used a cast iron pan to cook the corn. It took quite a while but it blackened very nicely. I let the corn sit for long period of time without stirring to get the appropriate coloration. It was all coming together but I noted a burnt smell near the end of cooking, like it stayed on the heat a couple minutes too long. It did (which was well over the prescribed time). So I'll give the recipe 5 stars but my skill cooking it 3 stars... The corn left a really hard crust on the pan that I had to scrape off with a razor... time for a re-seasoning!

The bacon is not optional! Also did not use bell (fake) pepper, used poblanos, much better.

Excellent! The only things I changed was using sweet corn on the cob and adding everything into the pan just before it began to grill. Then after I added everything and the beer, let the beer cook off and let the dish cool off just a bit before adding cilantro so it is fresh and doesn’t get soggy.

I made this to serve alongside barbacoa tacos and it was delish! I was out of bacon so I used prosciutto and it was fine. This really had a nice flavor and was a yummy addition to our taco bar.

I subbed out capsicum for carrots . (for allergy reasons here). cheddar cheese as it was all we had in the house.

I used one can of corn  .Half a yellow onion and no bacon. We had leftovers at this portioning.

We had as a side dish to burgers where the meat patties was "Mexican flavoured beef" and we had a green salad. It worked well.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! We made it just as written, but added a squeeze of lime just before serving, which helped to bring all the flavors together.  We doubled the recipe & topped taco salads. Everyone loved it, and we have been craving it ever since the last bites got eaten! You've gotta try this recipe :)

Loved this dish.   I used canned corn .  It was the right volume, but it was very difficult to get the corn to blacken, it kept sticking to the pan, had to keep using more beer :-)
The bacon really added wonderful flavor.   
Next time I think I'll use frozen corn and butter on the skillet to see if I can get that blackened look and flavor.

This was one of the favorite dishes at our Christmas table.  We had two vegetarians (no bacon) and two recruits from the U.S. Coast Guard at our table.

The blend of flavors was loved by all and went well with our traditional turkey dinner (No, we did not force feed the vegetarians the bird.  They had a field roast.).

This is so easy and adaptable that I am sure it has just become a tradition!

I made this last night for a family dinner.  Everyone loved it.  Using a couple suggestions from others, it turned out great.  I used a cast iron skillet and mexican 4 cheese and can corn instead of fresh.  Turned out great.  Thank you for the recipe.

Followed the instructions, Double batches it. Like previous reviewers, I just couldn't seem to get the corn to blacken until onions started burning & sticking to frying pan (Non-stick coated). I kept sampling corn, but it didn't taste like it had thoroughly cooked until stuff started burning.   Maybe a tad bit less cilantro. My wife loved it, I thought it was good.  It's labor intensive unless you have serious knife skills.  BTW I used a bundt pan to hold corn cob and catch kernels (my wife's idea)
