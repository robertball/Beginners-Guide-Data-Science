DILL! I cut the dill back to 1/2 teaspoon for 6 eggs and it overpowered the eggs, the salmon, and left me tasting nothing but dill for 15 minutes afterward. Some of the people at the reunion managed to choke down half an egg, but most took one bite and discretely threw the rest of the egg away. I should probably have tried this recipe out in private first.    Using fresh dill might have salvaged this. One teaspoon dried dillweed packs about as much punch as 4 teaspoons fresh, so it would be a lot subtler, but fresh dill has a delicate top note that the dried lacks. It cuts the chalky aftertaste dill can have.

I hate to be the first to review a recipe and give it a poor rating but this was not a hit with my family.  It came out very dry and the flavor of the salmon was overpowering.  I attempted to add more mayo but nothing seemed to help.  Four family members tasted it and none liked it at all.

Made these without the dill weed and absolutely loved them.  Will try sprinkling a little of the dill on top of one next time I make to see if it will convert me to liking dill with eggs...Thanks for a great idea!

Used lump crab meat instead of salmon. I also omitted the dill and used dijon instead of yello mustard. This was okay. A different flabor than what we are use to.

We were looking for a different way to jazz up deviled eggs for New Year's Eve and this was it.
I even signed up just to leave this review.

If you like dill and smoked salmon, this recipe is the one you need.
I subbed fresh dill due to availability and miracle whip.  Fantastic.  24 deviled eggs gone in under 24 hours.

I loved this!  The flavor of the salmon is not hidden at all, therefor the more you like smoked salmon the more you'll like these deviled eggs. I used salmon that I caught and smoked myself in Alaska, which may be part of the reason I enjoyed them so much!  If you plan to make them for a group of people, make sure they are marked as smoked salmon... Some people don't like seafood or would simply expect a different taste from a deviled egg. I am certainly going to make these for my family get-togethers.

This recipe was fabulous!  I couldn't believe the bad reviews for this recipe!  The only thing I changed was to add more mayo and more salmon!  The amount of dill was fine!  This is a keeper!

this is delicious.  we love dill, and i am glad we used the full recommended measure.  i used grainy mustard and garnished with ultra-thin lemon slices.  next time i might add a sprig of fresh dill, also! this joined grain-free cinnamon rolls (i'll submit the recipe!), and fresh hot coffee, along with mimosas, for the perfect brunch-with-friends!

It was very tasty if I ignored the salt. With out the salt it would have been five stars. Maybe it was so salty because the salmon I used already had plenty of salt, more than most brands. Other than that it was delicious. I substituted fresh dill for the old, and Dijon mustard for the yellow. I also decorated the eggs by making them into chick shapes with carrot noses.

I loved the recipe and was a big it with everyone who tasted it. I did make some small changes. I left out half of the yokes, no salt and no dill. Came out great.

Wonderful! However, the mustard I bought was more ‘wasabi’ like than I expected & so the final product was a bit too ‘mustardy’ or hot than I prefer. My guests said they liked it, however!
