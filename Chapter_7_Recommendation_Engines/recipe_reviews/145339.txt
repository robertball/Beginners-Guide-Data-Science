Excellent! I'm an admitted peanut butter addict and will eat just about anything with the ooey, gooey, nutty stuff on it. Peanut Butter and bananas are a great combination in my book, but sandwich the two between some tortillas and heat them up a bit to get the peanut butter a little "melty" and well....you have yourself a really nice little treat! I love the addition of the cinnamon sugar -I wouldn't change a thing!

This made a wonderfully sweet and easy treat. I was looking for something breakfasty when I found this recipe and while this is more desserty it could work either way. This came out crisp and crunchy outside from the carmelized sugar and ooey gooey inside, so they can be  a little messy. I had a couple of banana slices fall out when removing this from the skillet so maybe letting it cool some would have helped. I did let this stand for a couple of minutes before cutting so the peanut butter would thicken back up some as hot PB can be runny. Slice the bananas thin though as a couple of my thicker slices were all hot mush and I didn't like that texture at all. I used 6 inch tortillas as usual. Serve this with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for a really great treat!

These are sooo good! I used whole wheat tortillas. The cinnamon/PB combination gives a nice touch.

in a moment of pure desperation, this is what i ended up making for my girls for dinner one night last week.  after insisting for 20 mins that the only thing they would eat for dinner was pb&j, i gave in and compromised by preparing this.  i omitted the cinnamon and sugar - so basically just pb and banana grilled on a tortilla.  they definitely enjoyed it, and with the fruit i at least felt they got some nutrition out of it.

I really enjoyed this meal, I did use crunchy peanut butter which was great. I left out the regular sugar...I just sprinkled the cinnamon on the outsides.  I ate it for lunch so I didn't want it too sweet.  I really loved it and I'll be making it again!

Honestly I found these kind of boring and the filling a little too mushy.
