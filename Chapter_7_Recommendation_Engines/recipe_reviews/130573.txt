I've made these 2 times so far using a frozen puff pastry. The filling is great, I substituted 1tbsp honey for sugar, and added 1/2tsp of baker's spice mix to give it that Devon House spiced flavour. 

Filling is great, only 4 stars because I haven't tried the pastry.

Really tasty!  Made these for an island themed party and they were a hit.  You don't even need to serve them with ice cream.  Also I decided to add cinnamon to the plantain mix and I sprinkled a little on top along with the sugar...made a huge difference.  Definitely add some cinnamon to balance out the nutmeg.

The dough was crumbly and could not be rolled. I had to add an egg and some more butter to it. The tart ended up very bland and not sweet at all.

Wanted a taste of home and this did the trick. I did add a splash of white rum and cinnamon, so good.

Great recipe! But to get the plantain filling the customary pink that is the tradition, use way more red colouring - 10 drops for 3 plantains is about right.

I made this and it came out perfectly!! Just as I remembered from childhood.  I was worried because I used less flour and more water in the dough that the ingredients recommended. It came out perfectly tho. I let it bake for about 35 minutes. Came out great!

Filling is delicious but pastry was a chore to roll out! after hours  in the fridge was difficult to roll and kept tearing. Realized less tearing if I rolled the pastry a bit thicker.made about 12 not 24.

The plantain filling was perfectly balanced in flavour, no additional sugar was required. Lots of compliments!
