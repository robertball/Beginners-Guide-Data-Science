Just tried this tonight! It turned out great! Very tender pot roast and veggies and it made a great gravy. I used my enamel lined dutch oven instead of a roasting pan and foil. I used Kitchen Bouquet for the browning sauce. I did use 1 cup of red wine and 2 cups of water for a deeper flavor and color. I will be using this recipe again- delicious!

i have made many roasts over the past few years, and just reading this recipe i can tell you that you should ABSOLUTELY NOT just throw everything into the pot and throw into the oven, YOU MUST PRE BROWN YOUR ROAST TO LOCK IN THE FLAVOR, and a roast must be cooked low and slow and for a long period of time. also after you pre-brown the roast, you need to deglaze the pan with the wine or broth. i never use wine, i always use broth.

This is a very simple, traditional recipe for pot roast, and it yields tasty, tender results. I also like using the cornstarch and browning sauce -- it makes a silky, flavorful gravy. My only suggestion is to add a little more seasoning; it might be a smidgen too bland without it. Also, try making it in your crock pot for 8-9 hours on low or 5 hours on high!

Very tender and moist pot roast - no knife needed.  I added red pepper flakes, cabbage and some mushrooms since I did not have celery and used 2 cups of chicken broth and water (along with carrots and red potatoes).  House smelled wonderful. Easy prep and clean up too.  Thank you for this great recipe.  Also just served with juice from roasting pan which was delish. Next time will try to make the gravy.

I replaced some of the water with red wine.  I also added in some thyme and some bay leaves.  The more important thing was that I browned the meat in a frying pan before ever putting it in the oven.  Then, when the time comes for making the gravy, I just heat the broth and add in some flour mixed with water.  It came out great and the family loved it.  Next time around, I plan to chop up a few cloves of garlic to toss in with the veggies.

Good recipe. I usually make my pot roasts in my slow cooker, but I grew up with it always being made in the oven, and sometimes I miss the crustier roast beef that you get in the oven, so I tried this last night. We are a family of five, two of whom are teenage boys, who very much love their meat and potatoes. So I doubled the weight of the roast beef, as well as doubled the amount of potatoes and carrots used. I kept the onion, celery, and water the same, and eyeballed the seasonings, adding some to the veggies as well as the meat. I also added a bit more of the seasoning to the gravy, as well as added some bouillon. We enjoyed this very much, but there are a few things I will change next time: I will season and braise the meat before adding to the roasting pan. This helps get the flavor into the meat, as well as produce that crust I love. I will triple the amount of carrots (we love carrots!) I will use beef broth instead of water, and reduce the amount to two cups, adding an additional cup when I make the gravy, if needed. The veggies got a bit too mushy for my taste, and I think it was because there was too much liquid. I will make my gravy with flour rather than cornstarch. This is just a personal preference. I was raised on flour gravy, and I just like it better.

So very good! The next night, I used the shredded leftovers rolled into corn tortillas stuck toothpicks to secure, fried in oil for taquitos, served with guacamole.  AWESOME

I used twice as many veggies as listed here, skipped the water, used a quart of home-canned tomatoes with juice instead, and subbed garlic powder for garlic salt, using that liberally. I also had a 3 lb roast. 

For gravy, I subbed searing flour for corn starch, so needed about twice as much, and made a roux with about 1/2 skim milk instead of water after browning the flour. 

Worked great. Tasted yummy.

I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of baking the roast an hour before I added the carrots and potatoes, since other reviewers said theirs got too mushy. Next time I will only bake them for a hour, as I thought they were still a little too over done.  Other than that, the chuck roast was very tender and tasty.

Good, basic pot roast recipe. I substituted 2 cup of red wine and 1 cup of water for the 3 cups of water and also did not bother with the gravy. This is an easy version of pot roast since the roast is not browned before putting it in the oven. I roasted it in a covered cast iron roaster. Came out very tender and tasty.

Thank you for sharing a great and easy way to cook pot roast! The meat was tender and could be broken by a fork.Yes, indeed, the aroma, as it was cooking, was so wonderful! It turned out very, very well. The second time, I used Lipton French Onion Mix instead of water just for something different! This recipe is in my keepers box!

Like others, I made changes.  I doubled the amount of veggies, since I want veggies with the leftover pot roast.  I always season and sear the roast before putting it in the oven.  I let the roast cook for an hour before I add the veggies.  I also add Lipton's French Onion Soup mix as a base for the liquid since my mother always used it.

Fantastic! Seared meat w/ Emerils, salt, pepper and flower. Added more veggies and shrooms, also used beef broth for the water and better than Bouillon for gravy!

I made this for the third time last night. My changes: seasoned the meat with pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and a little salt; seared the meat in a Dutch oven with 2T olive oil for about 5 minutes per side/1 minute on each edge; used low sodium beef broth to deglaze the pan; simmered for 5 minutes; returned the beef to the pan; added vegetables; and covered the pan before putting it into the oven. Cooked for about 1.5 hours at 350. Came out delicious. Definitely will make again. Appreciated all of the helpful comments from others!

The is the perfect basic prep for Pot Roast..imo!  I roasted my chuck roast seasoned with pepper only without a cover for the first hour, turning the roast at the half hour mark; this browned the meat  nicely.  (no salt..beef has plenty of natural salt in the muscle) Then I add the onion, celery and double the carrots with broth and wine to finish for the remaining 2 hours.  We like mashed potatoes so I don't use potatoes in the roast.  I also roast a whole bulb of garlic separately in foil drizzled with EVOO to add to the potatoes (and a few in the gravy!) the last hour.  WoW..what a meal.

I agree with some other raters that the roast has to be browned first.  This was definitely lacking in flavor and the large amount of corn starch made the gravy a really funky consistency.  Would also use beef or chicken broth instead of water.  My 1 3/4 pound roast was into the 180 degree range at 2:45.  I would start the gravy with a flour/fat roux browned in the sauce pan before adding the de-fatted cooking liquid.  That way you can do away with the corn starch altogether.

this is so delicious.  I made some add on. I used white wine because I didn't have any red.  Than I browned all sides of the roast with some butter with onions & garlic.  Than I added spices that I really like.  oregano,  basil,  black pepper,  thyme & salt.  Once everything was at a nice simmer in the Dutch oven I added water with broth.  everything came out so delicious.

Wow! Our 5 year old had seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths of this! I cooked it in my calphalon metal Dutch oven with a glass lid. I stead of water I used 4 cups of beef broth. I only had potatoes so that was it! I seasoned it with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper. After 2hrs and 10 minutes in the oven at 300 it was well done but still so tender! I made the gravy by just pouring the beef broth in a sauce pan and using 4 tbs of corn starch and a 1/2 cup of cold water. We served it with broccoli. It was amazing! Every one loved it.

This turned out great! I seasoned and seared the roast before adding liquid and veggies. I used 1/2 water & 1/3 chicken broth though. Also made the gravy from the juices, and used the 3 TBSP cornstarch that it called for, but this was way too much. Next time I'll use the cornstarch sparingly. All in all this was a yummy dish! ??

Pot Roast made the way it is supposed to be made.  Just the basics and flavors melting together to bring back fond family Sunday Lunch.  Only substitute made was a steak seasoning for the Salt/Pepper/Garlic spices.

This is very good and very easy to make.  Not too many ingredients.  I like cooking with wine when possible so I reduced the water by 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup red wine.

A really excellent recipe.  I did use a lot more veggies than called for that I added an hour after the meat cooked and they came out beautifully.  The gravy was a nice surprise and the crowd I fed really enjoyed everything served that day.  I’ll be making this again.

I really wanted pot roast, but I don’t have a Dutch oven or crock pot. After searching I can across this recipe and let me tell you, it is SO YUMMY! The roast just fell apart so tender and moist! I found it to be flavorful with just the salt, pepper and garlic pepper (I used garlic pepper instead of salt to reduce sodium.) I also cooked mine in an oven bag which I felt licked in the flavor well. I will definitely be putting this into one of my classic dinner recipes!

I put in one and a half cups of water and 1/2 cup of dry vermouth.   I also used kosher salt instead of regular salt.  This recipe is so simple yet so, so delicious!

I made the recipe pretty much as written. I used beef broth instead of water. I think next time I will put in more carrots and cook it maybe only 2 1/2 hours. I omitted the celery because I didn’t have any.  It was great.

I added Lipton French onion soup mix with the 3 cups of water and added way more potatoes and carrots (family goes crazy for 'em) and it came out great. Used a basic McCormick dry brown gravy mix in with the juices n stuff n it was to perfect

I've tried this recipe several times and have never had it turn out properly.  The 145 internal temperature is rare and not realistic if you were to cook this roast at 300 for 3 hours.  Sorry, but this is a bad recipe.

Boy did this turn out "Very Good"....followed instructions to a tee in slow cooker.  I am a retired sailor of 26 years.  I had my son dig into it the first night along with a renter....they both dove into my pot roast and asked when will be the next time the I'll cook in my slow cooker.  You I am not known for my cooking, but now this has changed things a bit.

I put the pot roast in a rectangle aluminum pan. I put carrots, celery, and onion. There hours later, we had an amazing, juicy, melt in your mouth meal! I’ll definitely be making this again!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner for something different.  It came out  wonderful.  The entire house smelled delicious.  I used a can of beef broth to  replace 2 cups of water.  I received several compliments from family that is was such a flavorful roast.

Used 14.5 oz can beef stock  and  1 1/4. Cups water  instead of 3 cups of water.  When I made the gravy I used 1/2 cup of the meat juice instead of water with the cornstarch.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was  the best post roast I have  ever prepared. After years of  trying to fix a good roast I had almost given up . This recipe is going in my permanent family cookbook and will be a regular at our home. Great recipe !

This is a keeper.  I browned the meat prior to baking and skipped the browning ingredient as we avoid non-food ingredients but the roast was delicious, tender and flavorful without.

Delicious! I used 2lbs of beef stew meat and added fresh mushrooms. Left out celery because we don't care for it. I added 2 chopped cloves of garlic, and threw in a couple of bay leafs as I always do for any pot roast recipe I make. I cooked it on high in the crockpot for 4 hrs. Served this was th Amish bread from this site. Awesome Sunday evening pot roast dinner to come home to!

Fantastic recipe!  I read the reviews and instead of water used beef broth and wine.  I cooked it in the oven to get the old fashioned feel of a New England pot roast.  Also, I increased the amount of vegetables and spices.  The juice/broth was so tasty I didn't feel the need to add cornstarch or flour to make gravy.  This is  a great versatile recipe.  Thank you!

Made it for the first time and followed the recipe pretty much as written. Added an extra potato and some carrots. Overall it was very good but I will likely adjust the seasonings just a ittle next time.

It has been a while since I decided to make a roast. This came out great! The whole family like it!  The two pound roast was not large enough for my family of 4, I would try a 3-4lb roast. (We love our leftovers for lunch the next day).

The pot roast was a hit and the gravy was just right and not too thick. Two days later I cut the meat, potatoes, mushrooms and any other larges pieces of food and put the leftovers in a crock pot on high with a cup of water mixed with one beef bullion cube dissolved and it was a great beef stew lunch after it simmered for a while.

Not falling apart but good with meat slicer. Used 1 cup red wine to deglaze and used red wine for gravy after removed.

This was very good and easy to make! I did not change a thing.  I am sure the secret is in getting a non-fatty pot roast which sometimes I don't notice until I get home, but this time I did. Thanks for sharing.

Came out great, my family loved it ! I used chicken broth instead of water and didn't make the gravy part since with that it was tasty enough. Definitely making it again as a regular quick dinner to prep.

The recipe as smelled amazing but waking up the next morning and tasting it was overwhelmingly meaty in a strong not so good way. So I added red pepper and brown sugar and let it cook on low for several more hours and it was amazing. I also added mushrooms.

I tried this and it came out tough and dry.  I am guessing that the temperature of 300 degrees may have been too much since I took the roast out after 1 1/2 hours.  Veggies were overdone as well.

My first time making a pot roast. Only thing I did different was that I added a little extra of the potatoes, carrots and celery. I just loved the gravy, the roast turned out delicious! Will be making this again soon!

Loved this recipe for the first chilly Fall evening!  I added extra veggies to this recipe; broccoli and asparagus.  I like to "Shake it up" a bit.  VERY yummy served with warm sourdough bread.

I added oregano and garlic a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. I loved that it was a one pot meal with the added veggies. I would make this again.

Followed the recipe and the beef came out tough.  It was my first try with a pot roast, so possibly I missed a step.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the roast was extremely tough and veggies were overcooked.

I thought it was very good, traditional pot roast recipe.  I think I will add a little cayenne pepper next time to give it a little "pop", but will keep the basic recipe.  Thanks Linda C!
