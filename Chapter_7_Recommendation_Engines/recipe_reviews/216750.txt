I used this recipe. I used seasoning salt and kikomannan sauce instead of other seasoning and served it over rice. It is like a delicious seafood gumbo, very tasty and worth the time it takes to make, w/o over-cooking anything.

Yum - this is good...if you don't have the creole seasonings you can google the brand noted and it gives you the recipe for that seasoning.  When I made it it got thick fast add broth iif you want it soupier.

Not a fan! i love oysters, and I'm sorry to be a hater. My husband didn't seem to mind it, but i could barely eat it. Was way too salty for my preference, and the taste left in my mouth was not a good one, i had three glasses of water with the one bowl :*( Sorry, wish i could of enjoyed it more!

My wife and I just finished our second bowl for the evening.  This was AWESOME!  Served over white rice, I made no changes or alterations other than using red bell pepper simply because that's what I had.  Thanks for the recipe.  I just noticed the Add photo button but there's none left to photograph...lol.

A big fan of AR, this just wasn't good at all.  I used the name brand seasoning which made it way too salty.  A waste of good seafood  (We added shrimp)  I should have known better,  always look for a recipe that has individual spices, not a mix..

I used 4T butter and omitted the celery and bell pepper because I didn't have any.  Used Old Bay instead of Cajun seasoning.  Ate with rice.  This is the ultimate oyster lover's comfort food.  Yum!
