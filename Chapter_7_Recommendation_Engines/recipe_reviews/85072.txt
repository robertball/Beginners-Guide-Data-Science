Sooooo good.  I was expecting a little more "kick", maybe I'll add some cayanne or something next time.  I am sure I will use this recipe again and again.

I didn't make the asparagus, but I thought the scallops were perfect! (this was my first time cooking them too)

Made for Father's Day 2009.  Everyone raved!!!  Used fresh dry pack scallops from the fish market so they were not soggy but perfect.  Was afraid the spices would be overpowering, but they complemented perfectly.

Quick, easy and delish.  For the xtra kick a reviewer would've liked, a spicy paprika is good.

I love this recipe. It was so incredibly delicious! I made it as is, even though I had never heard of old bay seasoning before this, it really hit the spot. I used a very dry chardonnay and it complimented the scallops perfectly. I would suggest this recipe to anyone!

Oh wow, this was really good! I made it exactly as the directions stated and it turned out great.  I used a pinot grigio for the wine.  Will definitely make again and thank you for the recipe! :)

This was my first attempt at scallops and what a hit!  It was absolutely delicious.  Instead of regular Old Bay seasoning, I opted for the "Blackened" version to give it a little more kick.  In addition, I added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up further.  We like spicy in my house!  I will definitely be making this one again.
