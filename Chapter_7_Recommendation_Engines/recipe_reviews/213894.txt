Obviously the person who submitted this recipe has never eaten a fish taco and/or never been to Baja Cali. This is just tuna salad on top of chips.  I don't even know why I tried this recipe.

I agree, I wouldn't call this fish tacos, but as someone who is rather fond of tuna, this was easy and delicious. I'm on a diet, so I cut back on the mayo, which was more than plenty. I use Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero Salsa and sometimes use wheat crackers in place of tortilla chips. I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.
