This was great for a cold day comfort meal. I halved the recipe and added 3 sliced of cooked diced bacon. Cooked the chicken chunks in a bit of the bacon grease with half the garlic powder and a clove of fresh. I also added salt and freshly ground pepper to both the chicken and cheese sauce while cooking (highly recommend).

The oven temperature given (450 degrees) is out of WHACK! I kept questioning to myself; surely this is WRONG!! and It Was!. The top was burnt to a crisp after only 20 minutes of cooking! I thought I was going to have a creamy mixture, but the macaroni had absorbed it all. It did not turn out as I had hoped for. :-(

Wish I had read the reviews first. Should have trusted my instincts and set the oven for 350 not 450. 25 minutes in the oven and the top is black! Seems like the person who submitted this could edit it or contact allrecipes to have it fixed.

Hi... I'm the one that made this recipe. I have no idea why it says preheat to 450, it should be 350!!! Please, only preheat your oven to 350... it'll come out perfect!!!!

The recipe is simple & easy to follow. It went great until the suggested baking time. I set it for the lowest recommended 35 minutes. I got busy, not paying attention, & the top burned. It needs to be more 20-25 minutes. Once the burnt top was picked off, it was pretty good eating. (I didn't have any whole milk so I added a good couple spoonfuls of plain Greek yogurt to the milk to give it the fat needed.)

450 was a too hot, I set my oven to 350 and cooked it just until the crackers were golden brown.

Taste was ok, I think it could use less garlic.

If I made it again I would try 1.5 teaspoon (.5 tablespoon) for the chicken and 1 tablespoon for the crackers.

I just tried making this and when I went to melt the shredded cheese it just clumped into a gross mess. So use to just layer the cheese and noodles then add the milk. I think I am going to stick to this technique but add the garlic with the milk.
