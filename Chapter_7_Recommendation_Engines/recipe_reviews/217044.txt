We made this dressing for the first time last week and have made it 5 times since then.  We have shared it with so many people and everyone LOVES it! It is VERY spicy with the habanero in it, but I like spicy.  If you didn't want it too spicy, maybe use half of a habanero or a jalepeno instead.  I also want to try it as a marinade too.

I did not have an habanero pepper, only a jalapeno, so that's what I used.  Next time, I will be sure to buy the habanero because what I made needed more heat.  I didn't have black seseame seeds, so I used regular, and I don't think that affected the taste too much.  The one negative I have is that I think the peanut butter taste dominated too much, so I'd use less the next time, and add more if necessary after tasting.  Served this with the recommended chop chop salad.

Loved the fl;avor for this but we used as a dipping type sauce fro grilled veggies that I made. I put it on a garden salad and the taste did not seem to work all that well so maybe a different type of salad would be better. I really did love it as the dipping sauce and willmake it again for that for sure.

I really did like this! It grows on you. I can't even say I like it on it's own, but on salad it's great! However, I did make changes. I sauteed the garlic and pepper (jalapeno instead of habanero) before blending and used white balsamic and some apple cider vinegar. I really liked the texture and the flavor was good but I think could be improved by using the right pepper and vinegar. I will saute again. I ate an entire plate of greens so it served it's purpose! It is creamy, a little sweet with a little heat- just about the perfect dressing!

I really like this salad.  I didn't find rice wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Just found out that I actually needed rice vinegar.

The flavor is great. I followed the recipe pretty much as it is except I used sesame oil because it's what I had in the pantry. The two tablespoons of peanut butter was a tad too much, so I'll be sure to cut back on that a little next time. Other than that, this was a wonderful habanero dressing recipe.

I used a bright orange habanero and removed the seeds and all of the white pith (while wearing gloves and glasses).  I chopped it finely before putting in the processor. I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the black sesame seeds.  I substituted 1/4 teaspoon of sesame oil.  The dressing was wonderful, special in fact.  It had some heat but not too much for me and I usually get a 2 star (of 4) at a Thai restaurant.  Peppers do vary though so suggest tasting dressing before inflicting on guests.  The 12 servings are very small.  I think 6 servings is more accurate and that's a bit of a stretch.   Great dressing!

I thought this was great.  I had to change a bit due to personal preference and pantry limitations.  I used half sesame (untoased) and half roasted peanut oil instead of olive oil--personal preference--and a red serrano pepper from my garden--what I had on hand.  I also used a natural peanut butter so I added a bit of honey, too.  I love the idea, and the taste is great.  Makes a great sauce for pasta or other grains, dip, marinade, etc.  It's definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks, Soup Lover-Sue!
