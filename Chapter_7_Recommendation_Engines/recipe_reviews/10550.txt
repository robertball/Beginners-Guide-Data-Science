A good cookie, but I like the snap of a crunchier cookie.  2 things for this recipe--first, go to the oriental food section of the grocery store and you can buy the TyLing brand crystalized ginger for $1.99 for 3 OUNCES which is about 1/6th the price of what they sell in the spice aisle.  Second, for a real spicy sweet bite, I added a TBS of cayenne pepper to the recipe--and everyone went crazy for them!

I couldn't find crystallized ginger in the local grocery store, so following one of the earlier reviews, I skipped the crystallized ginger and added extra fresh ginger (THANKS FOR THE ADVICE!). To reduce to amount of fat, I used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce, I don't think this changes the taste very much, 'coz it's still excellent. I extended the baking time to 15 mins though since I find 10 mins baking leave the cookies too chewy. Thanks for the recipe!!

If you love ginger, these are the cookies for you! They give you the full, spicy bite of ginger by using it in all three forms. I had to cook them a little longer than instructed to get them to the crispy "snap" stage, but they are equally good if you make them chewy.

This recipe is good, but it can be seriously pumped up into an adult taste treat.  Use 1 cup fresh minced ginger in addition to 1 cup crystalized ginger, decrease powdered ginger by 1 teaspoon and replace with fresh ground black pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon cloves.  Amazing.  If this is really for adults, macerate the fresh ginger in a couple of tablespoons of vodka, brings out yet another level of flavor.  My next twist will be to add cayenne pepper, haven't tried it, but just wait....

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because they just aren't as good as my grandma's. 

This recipe makes a humongous amount of cookies. I will definitely half it next time. 

When reading other reviews I noticed people talking about the expense of candied ginger. It's really easy to make at home. Cook 1 cup pureed ginger and 3 cups of sugar over medium-low heat. After the sugar melts you can add some ghee (clarified butter, but regular butter will work too) and spices such as cardomom or allspice. Let the mixture boil for a few minutes while stirring constantly then pour into a shallow pan to set. YUMMY! We keep it on hand all the time for upset stomach.

This is truly a wonderful ginger snap cookie.  It is soft and very flavorful.  The crystalized ginger is expensive - but it adds a lot of zing. I used less than the recipe calls for simply because it is expensive.  I made several batches of these for Christmas.  I rolled the dough into balls, rolled in sugar and froze uncooked.  They bake up beautifully right from the freezer and make for a lovely plate for company.

Crystallized ginger is expensive, I first made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and didn't want to go to the expense of the crystallized ginger, so feel free to leave it out,  it is "non-essential",  don't skimp on the powdered or fresh ginger to give them a nice "snap" and decorate with a confectioner's sugar (a little water and white confectioner's suger to a pasty consistency)piped on in stars, swirls or whatever suits you...they were a hit! (Ginger tends to be an adult taste but kids like em too!)

One of THE BEST cookies I've ever made. I made these for a friend of mine that LOVES gingersnaps. She now claims these are the BEST ones she's ever tried! My boyfriend who stated that he does not even LIKE gingersnaps...can't stop eating them. I usually don't even really crave my own baking..and i can't keep my hand out of the cookie jar. I wouldn't skip out on any of the steps or change a thing. These are very special made EXACTLY as the recipe calls for! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

These were very good.  If you like ginger they are the cookie for you. I did find however that they were quite soft (no snap).  I will try to decrease the flour a bit next time to get that snap.

Tasty, but "Ginger Snaps II" is a prettier cookie and simplier to make. (I made both for Christmas day, since I needed to make lots of cookies.) We love the flavor of ginger around here, but I found the three types of ginger to be consuming unnecessary time. These were good, but not great so I'm giving it a 4

These cookies are fantastic!  My boyfriend's favorite cookie from a local specialty store taste just like these.  I preshape balls and freeze them and just make small batches.  These are absolutely the best ginger cookie.

I was so surprised to find this recipe soooo delicious.  They lasted only a few days in the house.  I especially loved the chewiness of the recipe, not the hardness which usually is the typical "ginger crisp." I agree with another reviewer that this will become one of my regular cookies to bake.  So different than the "toll house" types. Highly recommended!

Yummo!  Love this recipe, cut the baking powder by 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 tsp of ceyene pepper.  Scooped using 1TBLS scoop made 92 cookies.  Zesty, hot, sweet and spicy, many thanks.

I was looking for a  ginger cookie recipe for a special friends' 90th birthday and this was it.  I did add 2 teaspoons of ground cloves and rolled the balls in turbinado sugar. Delicious!!  Also, I found crystallized ginger available at nutsonline.com for a VERY reasonable price.

Yummy!  Crisp edges with a soft, chewy middle, and so flavorful!  I made them exactly as written and they're delicious!  My kids love them too.  (I had to hide them till after supper).    I never knew there were different types of molasses.  I used the "backstrap" type, which is supposed to have a stronger flavor.

Tastes delicious but I think it calls for too much baking soda. Next time I will reduce to 2 or 2 1/2 T and see if that improves the taste and texture.

These turned out fantastically! I wish I had read the 'replacing crystallized ginger' with fresh ginger before making them ("my bad!") - I live in the Middle East and have to import crystallized ginger - it's so expensive even in Canada, importing it makes it even more so!  Fresh ginger is extremely cheap here and in huge abundance, so I will definitely be making these again skipping crystallized and upping fresh! Great recipe, it's going in the recipe box for sure.

These cookies are fantastic! The three ginger was the key and smelled wonderful. They are such a wonderful alternative to those rock hard, break your teeth, dump in milk for an hour to soften store bought gingersnaps from my youth!

I was looking for a very 'gingery' snap and this is a good one.  Some of the suggestions I've read could add variety but this recipe is very good on its own.  I can see how cayenne or regular ground black pepper would add to the 'heat'.  As for the baking time, it's just a matter of taste whether a person wants a bit chewy or a 'snap'.  You can trust this recipe!

I haven't made these yet. I like the idea of cayanne pepper! Has anyone had the gingersnap cookies from "Clarke's Bakery" in London? The best in the world! Searching for the recipe. I know they use baking powder instead of soda! They are a bit hot and spicy.

These were so good! I am 8 weeks pregnant and they are the perfect morning sickness cure. I used black strap molasses to get all I could out of a cookie. Easy and delish!

Very good gingersnap recipe!  I didn't have the crystallized ginger or fresh ginger so I just added 2tsp cinnamon.  I also rolled these in sugar before baking.  Excellent!

These cookies are simply delicious! I iced mine with lemon icing (fresh lemon juice mixed with powdered sugar). The lemon flayor goes so well with ginger. I will definitely being making these again.

Being a ginger snap cookie lover I found these to be fantastic...having no molasses I added maple syrup and instead of the powder ginger I added pumpkin pie spices. The cookies came out great and enough for an army

First of all, do not add 1 Tbs. of cayenne as someone said before.  They were way to spicy even for the adults.  I had to throw the whole batch away.  These came out very doughy.  Not chewy or 'snappy'.  I am cooking at high altitude, but I made adjustments.  I was disappointed.  I tried them three times hoping for success, but they just weren't what I was looking for.

These are really good!  I got tired of grating ginger so I did about half fresh grated and half bottled ground fresh ginger.  I chopped the crystallized ginger as small as possible so there woulnd't be any big bites of spice.  My kids absolutely love them!!  Using a rounded teaspoon, the recipe for 48 cookies actually yields close to 120 cookies!

These were good, but maybe not quite as good as I wanted them to be. I rolled them into balls and then rolled the balls in Sugar in the Raw, because it was a snow day and that sort of thing occupies my preschooler. The finished cookies had a nice soft, chewy texture, and were very crackled and pretty, but I found them a bit one-note: sweet, but without much depth. The sugar I rolled them in didn't help, I'm sure, but I think it was the cookies themselves. I was surprised, considering how much ginger is in them! Anyway, they might improve as they sit, and if that happens I'll revise my review. Thanks!

the taste was phenomenal but the constituency was poor.  they were very soft, thin, gooey and floppy.  I wasn't going for them to be hard like actual ginger snaps, but they needed more flour or something. I'll have to play around with the recipe and see if I can get the consistency right.  but the flavor especially with the crystallized ginger was perfect.

This recipe is a great and delicious way to use all that fresh ginger you have left over! These cookies are easy to make and oh so tasty! I followed the advice of adding more fresh ginger instead of crystallized ginger, since I had none on hand - that worked great!

I added the dry ingredients in the wrong order and they still came out great. Didn’t have enough crystallized ginger on hand so I just dumped in some more grated and powdered ginger and it did the trick. I. CAN’T . STOP. EATING. THEM!

I didn't want to "waste" my expensive crystalized ginger on a batch of cookies-- but this recipe was popular enough I might consider it next time and there will be a next time. I even felt a bit lazy and was out of molasses, so I subbed that with honey. IMHO, this is a very forgiving recipe. Mine came out great and were popular with young and old. I added some spiciness for my family's tastes. Cayenne did not work out so well in my test batch, but adding black pepper and/or ground mustard (I know it's weird but I always use it with ginger so I gave it a whirl) really spiced things up, in a good way-- I also used cloves and allspice, but not much. I used more fresh ginger to compensate for not using my crystallized ginger, and as someone else noted, it's better to grate when frozen-- otherwise the fibrous bits are tough and awkward, and you waste the juice. I added vanilla, too, because duh, it's a cookie. But the basic ratios in the original recipe are PERFECT, so adaptable. If you want chewy, take them out when "golden brown on the edges" as the recipe calls for. For more "snap", just leave them in a bit longer. I did a little of both and they were a huge hit with the addition of cloves, allspice, pepper, and ground mustard. Also this looks like a smaller yeild than it is, this makes a LOT of cookies. I had plenty of batches to experiment with and the ones I just mentioned were the best. Add some icing for the kiddos. What a keeper.

This recipe is double the recipe "Triple the Ginger cookies", without doing the chilling overnight step. So if you wanna do half a batch, just switch to the other one!

This was a snappy little cookie.. follow directions and remember it's a spicy cookie not a ginger bread or ginger cookie.. IT'S A SNAP!! I liked it as the recipe says but the second time I didn't add the crystallized ginger but added an extra Tbs of fresh grated ginger and a tsp of cayenne pepper and VOILA!!! AMAZING!! Just like Nanny used to make! :D

Really good cookie. Was looking for something with a BIG ginger taste and this is it. I did bake 5 mins longer in hopes of having a crisper cookie but still got soft centers.  Thanks to Teri in 2005 who suggested getting crystalized ginger in the asian section of the grocery saved me a bunch. Just wasn't snappy enough to get a 5 star.

These cookies are amazing.  Very gingery.  They aren't crisp, but instead came out with the perfect chewy-yet-firm baking.  I got crystallized ginger for cheap from C-mart.

I wouldn't recommend making these if you don't have the fresh or candied ginger. Also, like some of the other reviewers said, they aren't crispy or snappy. Next time I'll probably try a different recipe.

These are excellent! There is so much dough that I divided it up and shaped it a few ways- dropping, rolling balls, and cookie cutters. The dropping made uglier cookies, so from now on I will roll them between my hands for a second. Also, these cookies aren't too sweet and since I had royal icing on hand I put some on and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.

Definitely a different twist to the traditional ginger snap!  My boyfriend thought they were too gingery but everyone else loved them.  I left out the fresh ginger as I couldn't find any.
