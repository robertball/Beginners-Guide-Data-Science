Wonderful recipe! My husband said he had never had such tasty brussels sprouts before! Because of what I had on hand, I used part shredded mozzarella and part parmesan in place of the cheddar. And I also used crushed corn flakes in place of bread crumbs. Thanks for a recipe that I'll be using often.

WOW. I can't believe people will rate a recipe with less stars if it does not look "pretty". I'm sorry, but what matters to me most are what the food does to my TASTEBUDS...not my visual pleasure..It is nice for food to be pretty, but I for sure wouldn't lower the rate because it is not pretty!! Loved it, thanks much for sharing!!!

I didn't think this was unattractive... I used halved fresh sprouts but should have cut them smaller. I also left out the butter and it was fine. Overall very comfort food-y.

This was okay ~ not something I'll make again, though. It just didn't look very pretty and was kinda hard to blend well. I think I'll leave the *casserole* type things for broccoli. Thanks anyway!

It was great! I used spiced bread crumbs and I really liked. It is very filling. I'm going to make this dish again.

This is the first time I have eaten and cooked with brussel sprouts. I was pleasantly surprised with the dish. I followed it as written except omitted the butter as cheese on its own tends to be oily. Not bad! Thanks for sharing!

This was barely edible. The texture was somewhat spongy and it was not flavorful.

The recipe was okay, I could eat it again. I think, 1: I'd refer to let the brussel sprouts thaw instead of boiling them in water, they are pretty tender as it is. 2: Cut the brussel sprouts in half before mixing all the ingredients together, they were rather chunky in the recipe. 3: Mix the can soup, egg and 1/3 cup of bread crumbs together, because I saw that the egg thrown in, didn't incorperate very well and got clotty in some areas of the dish. 4: mix the butter and brussel sprouts together before adding to the soup mixture. And 5: more bread crumbs on top...like that crunch. However, as is, the recipe was fine. It tasted okay. I think with those improvements for myself and my family, and some added pepper and little salt, the recipe will be improved better for our liking.

I was trying to think of something new for Christmas day and came upon this Brussel Sprouts Bake.  It was excellent.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and I wouldn't change a thing.  Everyone gobbled up the not so popular veggie and loved them.  Wonderful!!

A favorite!  Best brussel sprout recipe I've made.  Not quite as healthy as some others, but very good. I used a bit more butter and topped it with some melted butter.  I also used 28 ozs of baby brussels sprouts instead of 20 oz. Would have been good with some cheddar cheese in it too. A keeper.

I also made it with corn flake crumbs as someone else suggested, which gave it a little bit of a crunch.  Tasty recipe!  Will definitely make again.

This was a pretty tasty dish and it made for fairly big portions at three consecutive dinners. It'd been years since I'd had Brussels sprouts, and I'm pretty sure I'd never cooked them, even from frozen. I always try to make recipes exactly as written, and almost did here. I used up all the dry bread crumbs I had on hand, and it measured to a little less than the half-cup specified; no big deal, though, as I thought there were plenty to go around. I see that several other reviewers mentioned using halved or quartered sprouts; I assumed I was supposed to keep them whole, and that worked just fine, in my opinion. I might've given this dish a 3 or 3.5 rating for flavor alone - it's good but not great - but I bumped it up to 4 stars because the simplicity of the dish takes ordinary Brussels sprouts to another level, without much effort.

I usually love bussel sprouts, but I did not love this recipe.  I don't think that the flavors mixed well and that sprouts are much better with simpler and lighter ingredients.

This was a very easy, tasty and versatile dish. I adjusted and used 1 can cream of mushroom/1 can of cream of broccoli/1 small can sliced mushrooms and panko   crumbs because I was short on bread crumbs. Will definitely make this again.

An ok dish, I think that a can of cheddar broccoli and using stove top bread crumbs would have made this  a better dish.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I halved the amount but used a whole can of mushroom soup.  I also added tin mushrooms and used crushed brettons instead of the bread crumbs.  I think some fried onions and garlic would add to this recipe.

This is only my personal taste but while it sounded yummy, cheese and brussels sprouts just taste bad together.  No offense to the author honestly.

I'm torn on this rating, as the sauce was good, but I didn't like the taste of the sprouts.  The reason I'm torn by this is this was the first time I had had sprouts, so not sure if I didn't like the sprouts because of the recipe, or because I don't like taste of sprouts, so thus, 3 stars.

It's OK-not too exciting, though. I thought the same thing as other people:There's just not enough liquid. But instead of adding another can of soup I just added some water since those soup cans are meant to be mixed with water anyway.

I only had one bag of frozen brussels sprouts so I added a bag of frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower.  I added 1/2 cup of milk and omitted the butter.  It was delicious!

I don't even like brussel sprouts but I'm trying to eat more vegetables. I thought, what the heck,  I'd try this. AMAZING!!! I used frozen baby sprouts. I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs as I prefer them. I did use Kraft Mexican 4 cheese blend and added a little bit of parmesan as well. I love this dish! I could eat a ton of them! Thank you so much for giving me a recipe that makes brussel sprouts something I look forward to eating!

This was quite good! I made slight adjustments to allow for pantry items on hand:
- used fresh Brussels sprouts and precooked them to tender crispness
- substituted Tex Mex shredded cheese for Cheddar, adding all to the soup mixture, then topping the casserole with bread crumbs reserved and shredded parmesan cheese (about 1/3 to 1/2 c.)
Hubby loved this and he's hard to impress...especially with veggies!

loved the way the brussels tasted in this bake. i did use fresh brussels not frozen, so i let the bake cook for an hour instead of half and hour.

I followed the recipe for the most part.  Used only one pkg of sprouts and still used whole can of soup.  I substituted French
Fried onion rings for the bread crumbs.  It was delicious!

A+ Recipe!!!
About five years ago a brought Brussels Sprouts to an annual potluck as a joke (thinking that most people HATE Brussels Sprouts).  Come to find out they were actually liked by many people.
Well, the Annual Event happened again today.
I doubled the recipe and added a little Parmesan Cheese to the top.
I had everything ready and put it into the refrigerator overnight.
I put it into the oven this morning and cooked it and brought it to the annual potluck event.
I had no idea if this turned out well or not.
I went through the potluck and (of course) put some on my plate.
I sat down and ate and WOW!  This turned out great!
This was this big hit at todayâs potluck!
Thank You for the GREAT recipe!

Yummy! I used fresh brussels sprouts (rather than frozen), and subbed a sour cream mixture with lots of spices , dry mustard, etc. (rather than the cream-of-mushroom soup). Turned out excellent! :-)

Overall, a very good tasty dish. I'm making it again today for Thanksgiving but think I'll add some additional water with the condensed soup.

We made this recipe today for lunch! We loved it! I read the reviews first and decided I would make a small batch of the original and then a big dish of what I thought it needed. I added 2 cans of mushrooms, boiled three chicken breasts and mixed them together. I mixed the butter with the Brussel Sprouts. I replaced the shredded cheese wiith Veleeta cheese I just cut it into small cubes and mixed it in. I added noddles as well, and on top I added another can of soup and topped with bread crumbs and a few more cheese cubs covered and baked in the oven for 45 minutes. Also used fresh brussel sprouts and did not boil them. Just mixed them in!! It was yummy!!

These were good, but not everyone likes brussel sprouts.  I would make it again, but not a very big batch.

This is different for brussels sprouts, but there definitely isn't enough of the mushroom sauce. I followed other's advice and doubled it, but it was still dry.  I think if one did not add bread crumbs to the sauce mix, it would help in this respect.  While it was okay, I probably will not make this again.
