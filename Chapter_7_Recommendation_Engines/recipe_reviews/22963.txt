I made a few changes to the recipe to use things I already had in the pantry.  Didn't have powdered soy milk, so just used  a bit of regular milk.  Also didn't mix this in the bread machine; did it by hand.  Dissolved the yeast in warm (110) water and let stand until foamy...then proceeded.  Allowed to rise approx. an hour, punched down, put in loaf pan, rise again for about 35 min and then baked at 350 until golden.  My boys absolutely devoured it  and I actually only got one small taste of it.  The texture was perfect for toasting or a sandwich and had great flavor.  Having another batch in rising so the rest of the family can enjoy some.  Will be a keeper and probably a staple bread recipe for a long time in my house!

This bread is fantastic!  We don't have a bread machine, so my husband makes it the old fashioned way. Also we didn't have powdered soy milk so he used regular powdered milk and added about 1/8 cup flax seeds. This recipe is worth 10 stars.

This is an excellent bread.  I made it in my bread machine on the pasta/dough cycle, and baked it in my convection oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  I didn't have soy milk powder so I substituted skim milk powder.

I increased the serving size to 20 and followed the recipe exactly and yet my bread didn't turn out that well.  I did bake by hand, but that shouldn't make any difference. The main problem was that the bread mainly tasted of yeast.  I'm used to baking with fresh yeast, but did use active dry yeast and the required quantity and yet, the bread turned out too yeasty.  Any ideas?

A keeper! It was healthy without being too heavy. I used nonfat milk instead of soy, and next time I would double the recipe because it makes a small loaf.

Excellent flavor.  Very filling bread.    I doubled recipe and made it by hand. Great with soup for dinner. Looking forward to toast tomorrow morning!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a hearty, dairy-free bread for breakfast, and this was perfect.  I made the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  The only change I would make is scaling it to make a larger loaf.

Decided to substitute equal measures of whole wheat flour for the soy flour, and likewise the powdered soy milk for Carnation skim milk powder. The loaf turned out very well, with a nice crispy crust (on medium crust darkness) and a very tasty loaf. Definitely would make this again! Thanks.

to Nana, bread can taste “yeasty” when it is raised at too warm a temperature. (doesn’t matter which yeast that you use,)

Pretty good bread. Very dense. I used grapeseed oil instead of canola and fat free dry milk instead of soy milk and may have had the breadmaker on the wrong setting for this, but -- I'd make this again.
