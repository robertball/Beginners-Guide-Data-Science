A WINNER!  This recipe is definitely worth making.  Easy to put together, your family or guests will love this salad as a welcome change from the lettuce/tomato version.  The crunch of the hearts of palm, fresh watercress  and onion compliment the smoothness of the avocado and mango.  The dressing, slightly acetic with a hint of sweetness, enhances the palm, avocado and mango.  My gang couldn't get enough of it!  I'll  be making this one again very soon.
