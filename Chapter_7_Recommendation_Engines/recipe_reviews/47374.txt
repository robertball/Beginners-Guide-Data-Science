Very tastey.  I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa. (that's all I had on hand).  I poured some sauce over the top before baking and I put the cheese on about the last 5 minutes of baking.

This is EXTREMELY easy and very good. It was a little rich. After reading everyone's reviews this is what I did: 4oz of LF cream cheese, 3/4 jar of salsa, 1 small can green chilis. Also, I was running REALLY late so I used the pre-cooked perdue chicken short cuts and they worked perfectly. You can make this ahead, roll and refrigerate until later.

This recipe was the best.  I have made enchiladas before that took much more work and didn't taste this good.  I did use enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and on top of the enchiladas as was previously suggested.  Aside from that I would change nothing, they were great.  Will definitely be making these more often.  For a really quick meal I also used chunk chicken in a can.

This was great when I used enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and then covered the casserole with enchilada sauce before putting on the shredded cheese.  I also took the advice of others and decreased the amount of the cream cheese to 4 ounces.  Thanks for this posting.  We definitely make again!!

This was delicious! I made it for a Mexican-themed party, everyone loved it! Since I was making it for a large crowd, I marinated 6 chicken breasts in a store bought Fajita marinade and then cooked it on the grill...before cutting it up. Also added twice as much salsa than called for and a can of Mexican corn. Topped it with Monterey Jack cheese and Jalapeno peppers. Served it with Mexican Rice, chopped lettuce & tomato, and sour cream. Yum!

This was good and extremely easy.  It was lacking some zip though. Next time I'll add a can of green chilis just to pep it up. But if you're looking for easy enchiladas this is the way to go. This recipe is worth trying.

These were very good.  I substituted reduced fat cream cheese and corn tortillas.  Those parts of the tortillas that weren't covered with cheese turned hard.  Next time, I'll poor a can of enchilada sauce over the top (but under the cheese), both the alleviate the hard spots and because I think it will taste even better.  I served these with chopped lettuce and tomatoes, taco sauce and sour cream.  Also, this made either 10 or 11 enchiladas which I was able to squeeze into a 9x13 pan quite easily.

Turned out great. Make sure you use "Chunky" type salsa in my opinion and maybe try one of the Kraft, Sargento, etc. 4-cheese Mexican style shredded cheeses. But still, it was fine the way it's written here. As for those wannabe "experts' on here who leave snobbish and rude comments 'Sorry, it's made with corn tortillas...whine...whine" Make it your way and leave your rudeness somewhere else.

A good, quick meal. It was easy and my kids really liked it. Instead of sprinkling on the cheese before baking, I'd bake first and then sprinkle cheese for the last 5 minutes or so.

This was such a hit with my family. So easy and quick to prepare. Delicious! The only thing I changed was to use 4 oz. of low fat cream cheese. I was able to fill 7 (8 inch) tortillas. I think it had a wonderful flavor. I will definitely be making these again and again.

A perfect fast & easy recipe that everyone really liked!  I used the quantities of ingredients as written including using the full amount of 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese.  My only addition was to add 1/2 c. frozen corn into the filling for some texture and I'd do that again.  Next time the only change that I see as essential would be to use UNSALTED beans.  The purpose of this recipe is to be easy and it's so good exactly as written that I wouldn't fiddle with it too much.  However, if I had an extra couple minutes, I would add some fresh cilantro on top and some chopped onions and frozen corn inside.  I wouldn't alter the ratio of salsa and cream cheese as some others recommend, as increasing canned salsa just adds more salt...I think some fresh tomatoes would be a better choice if you want more stuff inside.  It's hard to believe that a recipe this simple could be so great, but it is...try it with confidence as written. It is also easy to customize to your preferences with just an extra couple minutes of prep time, but you really don't need to change a thing, just watch the salt.

My fiance and I love to try new recipes, but we have a short list of "go to" recipes that we frequently repeat. These enchiladas will probably be added to that list. They were quick, delicious, and the ingredients are cheap. We cooked our chicken on the George Foreman with a bit of poultry seasoning, cumin, and chili powder before dicing them up to add to the sauce. Very quick cooking method and it provided some added flavor. 

But if you're some sort of enchilada snob who is looking for an "authentic" enchilada recipe, keep looking. These aren't traditional enchiladas, but for those looking for a yummy Mexican-inspired dish, you will probably enjoy these. By the way, people who drastically alter recipes should not rate them. Ricotta cheese has a completely different flavor (and texture) than cream cheese. No comparison. To use ricotta and then give this recipe a 1 is a bit unfair.

This was sooooooo good. I did do a few things differently, only because I used what I had on hand. I have hungry, hungry boys to feed, so I doubled the recipe, for starters. Instead of salsa, I used large can of rotel. Instead of pinto beans, Iused a can of Ranch style beans, rinsed(essentially pintos) and a can of black beans. Added shredded Monterey Jack.  I used corn tortillas, instead of flour. And the change that I think had the biggest impact, was a used a can o green enchilada sauce. To make this recipes even easier, I made it more like a casserole, and cut the tortillas into quarters, layered the bottom of the dish with two layers of tortillas, then covered them  with enchilada sauce(about half the can.) Next,  I put the mixture to cover the tortillas(Iused all of it.) I like onion, so I sprinkled minced onions over the mixture, as well as some garlic powder.  Add, enough quartered tortillas to cover the mixture and poered the remaining enchilada sauce tocover tortillas. Finally,  I covered with cheese(any cheese will do.)  I have tried literally hundreds of recipes from this site and this recipe just went straight to the Number 1 spot!!! Thank you so much for adding this one!

Good recipe. Like other reviewers I halved the cream cheese and replaced the salsa with enchilada sauce. I mean they are enchiladas, why not use the right sauce. I sweated some onions and then added my cream cheese (onion and chive was all I had on hand) and half the 10oz can of enchilada sauce. Once this was all melded together I added the chicken(3 cups) and half the contents of a small can of diced green chilies, I thought about using diced jalapenos but my wife would not have approved. I then spooned this mixture into six tortillas and arranged them in a casserole dish. The remaining enchilada sauce was then poured over them along with two cups of a Mexican blend shredded cheese and some diced onions, then into the oven they went. This came out awesome, I can't wait for leftover-lunch today!

I liked the flavor of these enchiladas more than one other top rated chicken enchilada recipe I tried (That was actually more work involved) So, kudos! Thanks for shariting.  Also, I added montery jack and queso cheese with cheddar instead of the colby. I also added freshe sliced green onions.

I love this recipe!  I have been making enchiladas and using this recipe exactly as written for over a year now.  Just yesterday I tried to make it a bit healthier by substituting the cream cheese with greek yogurt.  It tasted great..the only thing is that the yogurt is thinner so the consistency was a bit different.  If you are going to use greek yogurt, use the Chobiani 2% because the 0% will be too thin...even though it's not fat free, the 2% is still way healthier than reduced fat cream cheese.

I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter, though I used "Mexican blend" cheese on top. Hubby told me it's the closest thing to authentic Mexican that he's had in a while, reiterating "Delicious!" while regaling me with tales about "real" Mexican food that he had while based out West. The cream cheese was subtle, and even though my salsa was hot, it wasn't particularly spicy. But it was creamy. His only suggestion was to grill the chicken after marinating, while I only boiled it, but he actually put two thumbs in the air and told me to keep the recipe.

I tried your recipe tonight for my husband who loves mexican food. I followed the directions almost exactly, except what most people said about using half of the cream cheese. I used enchilada sauce on the bottom of the dish (which did help soften the tortilla for rolling) and still used the salsa like the recipe called for. The verdict: he gave them 10 out of 10! I was sso happy! Thank you for sharing.

I have made this many of times, I add my spices to meat as it is simmering and use refried beans instead of pinto beans, and a can of drained corn. I think it cuts down on the richness. When added it makes about 20 mini enchiladas so I usually freeze half for another meal.

My family LOVES this dish. I use 4 oz cream cheese. Add a can of chillis, a can of enchilada sauce, 3/4 can of sliced jumbo black olives and I toss in a lot more chicken. I use another can of enchilada sauce and pour some on the bottom of the casserole dish then the remaining on top of the enchiladas once rolled and in the pan. I put the cheese on top the sauce and the rest of my can of sliced olives on top of the cheese. I have made this almost weekly for my family. SOOO GOOD! Because of all the extra stuff I add I get 9 tortillas.

If you don't want to eat something awesome, than don't make these. These are fabulous. I boiled my chicken in water/enchilada sauce. I used refried beans, corn totillas and I dipped the tortillas in enchilada sauce to maek them easier to roll. The filling is amazing on it's own as I kept going in for more with my corn chips. the husband had 2 servings, which is rare since he is worried about his weight, this is definitely my new standby recipe. Talk aobut easy and quick!

Easy is right! I use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, which gives you around 3 cups of chicken. I also use black beans instead of pinto. With the extra chicken I use all 8 oz. of cream cheese and 1 whole bottle of Herdez hot salsa. Add a couple teaspoons of taco seasoning. This will fill 8 large tortillas. Top with shredded pepperjack and you're good to go! My husband said it's his new favorite meal of all time.

These are so quick and easy--perfect if you don't have a lot of time.  I used reduced fat (not fat free) cream cheese and they turned out great.  I will add this to my dinner rotation.

This recipe is a definite keeper!  My husband and I both really enjoyed these easy and delicious enchiladas.  I made one little change, which was seasoning the chicken with taco seasoning before adding it to the cream cheese/salsa mixture.  I can't wait to have it tomorrow for lunch!

I am Scottish so this was scary for me. It was easy I used re fried beans and enchilada sauce that has been in my cuboard for ages as I did not know what to do with it! I had made an organic whole chicken the night before so had a good wee bit of chicken left which I used, this  was super because no one in my house ever wants the left over chicken and everyone is very fussy.  OMG I think I am Mexican lol. This recipe may not be authentic, but no one in my house would know that.Everyone LOVED it. I am well pleased with myself.

It's a great recipe. Not complicated and easy to cook. I did made a slight change. Per other reviews I only added 4 ounces of cream cheese, but substitute the other 4 with Sour cream, actually I add more the 4 ounces, more likely 8, it made the Enchiladas juicier and more tender taste. My family loved it.

These... are...amazing!  I did however substitute browned beef seasoned with taco seasoning for the chicken.  I know this completely changes these into beef enchiladas, but they turned out delicious!  I made a little extra of the cream cheese/salsa mixture to layer on top and bottom of the enchiladas.  Next time I will try it with chicken.  :P

I changed a few things.  First i used a can of green chili enchilada sauce instead of the salsa, which gave it a lot of flavor along with a can of green chilis.  i also used light cream cheese.  turned out great but next time i would put a 1/2 c of the green chili enchilada sauce on the bottom first, so that the tortillas wouldn't brown.  but this recipe was quick and delicious, very filling too!  also made more like 9 or 10 enchiladas, not 6

These were quite good.  I will probably make again because they were not only good but very easy to make.  I think I will leave the beans out next time, though.

I did not like this recipe as is, but it does have some potential. I changed a couple of things. I did not use the beans or cream cheese. I used a three-cheese mexican blend of cheeses. I cooked the chicken in a frying pan with 1/2 cup salsa, 1/3 cup of chopped onion, and 1/2 cup of the cheese blend. Then, I spooned them into the tortillas as written. In the baking dish (I did not spray; used nonstick), I added 1 cup of salsa, put in the rolled up enchiladas, and topped with more salsa and cheese. I baked uncovered for 20 mins. They were delicious!

I've made these several times now. I like them best with red enchilada sauce on top and on the bottom of the pan. So easy and simple, yet delicious. My 2 year old helps me make them. Definitely not authentic Mexican, however.

These were SOOOOO delicious! I substituted a can of mild rotel for the salsa, kept everything else the same. Added enchilada sauce to cover bottom of pan, and on top of enchiladas before baking. I have never before been brave enough to make enchiladas, and I'm so glad I found this recipe! Thanks Ian and Kris!

I couldn't decide whether to give this 4 stars or 5 because it is not a very gourmet recipe, but, hey, it 's chicken enchiladas for goodness sake! But I had to give it five since it has become my go-to-in-hurry yummy dinner that my whole family likes, even the picky ones. I have made easy ones and more complicated ones and we prefer these. If I'm really throwing them together, I do as written with the addition of enchilada sauce on bottom of pan than across the middle of the top, then the cheese. I LOVE how easy this is! If I have more time, I add fresh cilantro and maybe some green chilis. I have also tried it with corn tortillas, usually flour though because we like just as we'll and I usually have those on hand. In fact, today I had everything on hand except had to use thawed chicken breasts, we prefer the flavor of rotisserie though.Thanks for the recipe! Keeper here.

Delicious!!! A keeper, definitely. Here are some notes: (1) Can add onion for flavor or to stretch meat, (2) Any bean or meat will do, (3) I used corn instead of flour tortillas, (4) I made a casserole rather than rolled-up enchiladas. I added "Red Enchilada Sauce," also from this site, to the top and bottom, and then added the cheese. Delicious!!!!! This is a great recipe for me because I love creamy-style Mexican casseroles but am not crazy about the can of "cream o' chemicals" soup that they invariable include. This way I can have a yummy casserole without all the revolting additives from cream soups. Later note: Being in a hurry, I tried this dish without the added enchilada sauce, and it was still GREAT. So good, in fact, that I think I'll eschew the sauce in the future, just so that I can put it in my "fast and easy" file. One thing I did was to not drain the beans so that there was more liquid to avoid dryness. I also put a layer of sauce on the bottom and on the top. Yum!!

Very delicious!  I wasn't brave enough to try an 8 oz cream cheese (didn't want a cheesecake) so I only used 1/2, but next time I will try the 8 oz.  I put taco seasoning on the chicken, only had black beans so I used that, and threw in some corn for color.  I made it into a casserole instead of rolled enchiladas.  Definitely a  keeper.  Thanks!

This was really good. Like others suggested, I cut the cream cheese in half, added a can of drained green chilis, and added a can of mild enchilada sauce (half poured in the empty pan and the other half poured over the enchiladas before the cheese).  I'd definitely make this again.

This was amazing. The first time I made these, I followed the recipe and they were amazing. The second time, I accidentally used a large jar of Pace picante mild with the cream cheese. I also used 2 small jars of enchilada sauce, one on the bottom of the pan, one over the top of the enchiladas - really fantastic. Seriously the best enchiladas, chicken or beef, that I have *ever* had.

They got eaten, but took 2 days.  Not what you'd think of as compared to what you would get at a resturaunt.  They were pretty dry I think because there was no red sauce on top, like you would expect and the filling was just ok.  I used corn and bean salsa, but I don't think that was the cause, because the family goes thru a pint of that a week with chips and whatever.  Maybe it was the cream cheese being used instead of sour cream, or maybe just the lack of enchilada sauce?  In hindsight, I see a lot of reviewers adding the enchilada sauce, and maybe if I had done that they would have been better accepted by the kids.

Good base recipe for some additional ingridients.  I used 8 oz of cream cheese, half cup of black olives (left out the pinto beans) and then added a can of cream of mushroom.  I also mixed in a additional cup of shredded cheese into the sauce.  Turned out pretty good.

This is my go-to recipe for leftover chicken.  So easy and delicious.  I get called on to bring it to pot lucks.  Only change I made was to use green enchilada sauce in place of the salsa.  I drizzle some in the bottom of the pan before baking and it adds flavor and also keeps it from sticking.  YUMMO!

Very good, I did spice it up a bit, as the first batch was a little ho hum. I replaced the pinto beans with ranch style spicy and used a spicy blend of salsa. Made some mexican rice on the side and shazam instant dinner. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Good but needed a little more - I followed a suggestion from the comments and added enchilada sauce on top and bottom - tasted much better.  I'd give the recipe with the enchilada sauce 5 stars!

This was a fantastic dish! Thank you for the base recipe, I made the following slight changes and the end result was fantastic! Changes were: I seasoned the shredded chicken with cumin, chile pepper, and mild green chiles. Coated bottom of baking dish with Cilantro Green Olive, with Roasted Tomatillo, salsa, and enchiladas and covered with low fat mexi cheese and more of the cilantro salsa on top. Used low fat cream cheese so all in all very tasty and relatively low fat. Easy dish to whip up to boot, total keeper. Thank you.

I added a 1 1/2 c. of cooked rice. Husband didn't like the pink color, but I thought it was good. Next time will bake with enchilada sauce like others did.

I think this recipe is awesome!! I've made it several times & do something different each time.  For the most part, I use 8 oz cream cheese & a jar of salsa, as I use more chicken than called for (my family loves chicken.)  I use black beans w/jalapenos instead of pinto beans. Like others, I also coat the bottom of the dish with enchilada sauce & use the rest of the Large can to cover the top.  Doing it this way usually ends up making 12 enchiladas because of more meat.  I use 2 baking dishes, a 9 x 13 one (holds 8), and an 8 x 11 one (holds 4). Like I said, these are pretty FAT enchiladas! I, like others, put the cheese on the last 5 minutes.

Delicious! I made these up the night before, refrigerated, the next day topped with cheese and baked about 10 minutes longer than stated. Turned out wonderful! I used 'picante sauce' in the filling and as an enchilada sauce under and over the filled tortillas. I did add some tomatoes and onions to the filling so I had a little extra after filling 10 small tortillas; my boyfriend ate it just as it was :) Served with some Mexican rice and sour cream and green onions, I'm definitely making these again.

this is now my "go to" recipe! i cannot say enought good things about this.... we had surprise company while i was prepping it, so i added some extra leftover chicken and steak, (measured to about 2 1/2 cups of chix/steak) as well as using the entire 8 oz. of cream cheese and a total of 2 cups of salsa.... i wanted to stay as close to the original recipe as possible, but i had to wing it with the extra folks to feed. i threw in some hot chili peppers with the salsa/cream cheese mix and it had a very nice warm heat, without being really hot. next time i will put more sauce on the bottom of the pan, though i was begged to "not change a thing!"  made 7 enchiladas, closely wrapped. i used large flour tortilla shells.

We really liked it! It was rich- but we like that. I made mine mild for the rest of my family but there's def room to spice it up to your liking! I used Weight Watchers Cream Cheese and whole wheat tortillas.

These were less than good. I only changed the cream cheese for whole milk Ricotta (what I had). I did everything else per the recipe. I thought they were bland. Quick recipes don't have to be tastless. I wont make these again.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  Based on previous comments, these are the changes I made:  used 1/2 the recommended cream cheese, used a can of enchilada sauce (to line pan and pour over rolled tortillas), and mixed some packaged enchalada seasoning into the chicken mixture.  Very good, will make again.

I slow cooked '2' chicken breast with cumin and garlic seasoning on them.  Then I shredded the chicken (I like this texture better).  Instead of salsa - I chopped 2 fresh tomatoes, 1 large chopped jalepeno, and some fresh chopped cilantro to the cream cheese mixture.  I rolled them in soft corn tortillas (better flavor than flour - just microvave then first so they are pliable when rolling).  What ever mixture was left over - I put on top of the rolled tortillas.  I then added strips of roasted (peeled) poblano peppers on top. I then lightly spooned on some Enchiladas sauce (bought in the can)on top. For cheese - I used shredded Chihuahua cheese.  Everyone said they were fabulous!  Thanks for this recipe!

So yummy! I added 12 oz enchilada sauce and that made them 5 stars!  I could see that it would be too cream cheesy w/out the sauce.  Will make again:)

I tried this recipe last night, and upon our first few bites, my husband and I decided that this recipe was absolutely terrific.  But the more we ate, the more we both felt that the food was much too rich. I will make this again, but I will cut the cream cheese in half, and use more salsa.  Other than that, it was very tasty.  It was also good heated up the next day (drier and not so rich).

Although they were nice and easy I didn't think they had a whole lot of flavor.  Next time I will only use half of the cream cheese and definately flavor the chicken with cumin or something.  I also used black beans which were great.  It made enough for a lot mote than 6 portions and they were very filling.

Great, very easy recipe!  You can use a salsa to your individual taste, hot or mild.  I liked the cheese topping baked for the entire 30 minutes.  This would be very adaptable for shrimp or pork.

I really enjoyed these!  The salsa I had on hand was mild so I added about a tablespoon of chopped jalapenos. Perfect!  I also used a green enchilada sauce which was lovely.  Will definitely make these again.

Love the fact that it is so easy, uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  I had a busy day out, so made this is the morning and put it in the refrigerator.  When I came home, popped it into the oven and by the time I changed clothes, and made a salad my enchiladas were ready to serve.  My husband even likes them as leftovers.   It's a keeper!

DELICIOUS!  This was so yummy and very easy to make!  I used a green salsa as well b/c it seemed like it would taste the best with the cream cheese.  I thought the cream cheese mixture would taste weird, but it was lovely.  I will add this to my rotation.  Bravo!

I was looking for chicken Enchilada ingredients like the ones I enjoyed in college years ago.  This one was it.  I went so far as to make my own salsa and tortillas and boiled chicken.  They turned out especially good, its not every day you have a completely homemade Mexican dinner, so thank you for the recipe.  I should note that these are not authentic but I love them anyway.  Make these and have salsa and sour cream ready, super!

Yummy, family friendly, and easy!  I used what I had on hand, so I used fat-free refried beans instead of pinto beans (kids don't notice beans that way), and only 4 oz. of cream cheese as others suggested.  I used a little more cheese than recipe calls for because we love cheese.  Other than that, I followed recipe as written.  Turned out great, and family ate it all!!  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious.  I used cheddar cheese instead of colby-jack & I add green chiles (my husband likes these).

I made this with black beans, added some taco seasoning to the chicken while it was cooking, used enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I also added mexican corn and a can of green chiles and it was very good !!! Don't add the cheese until the end or it will get too brown

I give this recipe 5 stars but feel it's really only that good when using less cream cheese than the recipe states. I tried this recipe several months ago and have been making these enchiladas regularly ever since then. I decreased the amount of cream cheese to about 3 ounces. The first time I made the enchiladas I followed the recipe exactly and the cream cheese was way too much.  Also, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and now add some enchilada sauce--I pour a little in the bottom of the dish and a little on top before sprinkling the cheese. Mmm, so good!. My family loves these!

This was great, I made a few modifications... Instead of salsa I used enchilada sauce (from a can) for some kick and cut up my own onions & green peppers to add to the filling. I also used black beans instead of pinto, and half the cream cheese as was mentioned. Also only cooked till it was bubbly (about 15 min) at 375. All my modifications made this recipe less "easy" but it was defiantely good and I will make again!

Best! Enchiladas! Ever!
Like other reviewers, I added a can of enchilada sauce: half below, half on top. I also added cumin to the filling. Awesome! The whole family loved it.
Like another reviewer, I didn't have cooked chicken on hand, but quickly poached the chicken breasts as I prepped the rest of the ingredients. No need to trash the recipe, duh.

This recipe is good!  I didn't think I'd like the cream cheese but I did.  I had leftover chopped green pepper so I threw that into the mix.  I didn't have enough salsa so I used 1/2 of a chopped tomato with a little bit of tomato sauce.  It was almost too soupy to assemble the enchiladas, but the end results were good.  I used whole wheat flour tortillas, which worked out well.  I used reduced-fat cheese, which melted kind of wierd, so I would use regular next time.

Fast, easy and flavorful. I added the enchilada sauce as suggested, and they were JUST RIGHT for moisture.  I added sliced olives too.  Served it with diced tomatoes, fresh Cilantro, chopped lettuce, and sour cream. It was inhaled by all...lol

It's more of a 4.5 star, but with a few tweaks it was very close to a 5. I went with the 5 star (instead of 4) due to the taste you get for very little effort. 

Next time I make it I'll do a lite version to see if it retains it's flavor. This is a busy women's recipe for SURE!!

Very good-- will make again-- did make some changes however:  no real need to measure-- just mix-- I used the tub cr cheese (all i had), black beans in place of pinto, added cooked spinach and used a mixture of colby jack cheese and pepper jack.  i also took the advice of others-- 1/2 can enchilada sauce on bottom of pan, 1/2 on top; mixed in a can of green chiles.  It had a nice kick and was very filling and easy.  Thanks!!  may add mexicorn next time!

This is very tasty, but kind of rich.  When I make it again, I will substitute LF cheeses and also half the cheese topping.  I was in a real hurry, so I layered the tortillas instead of rolling them.  It seems like a lot of filling for 6 6-in tortillas.  If I were going to roll them, I would use more or bigger tortillas.  Also, unless you're serving a group of teen-aged boys, I would say this serves 8-10, especially if you have side-dishes.

No cream cheese so used goat cheese.  No Colby jack so used havarati.  Always layer bottom of pan and top of enchiladas with canned red enchilada sauce.  Stays moist.  Cheese on top.  Sprinkle parsley flakes before baking to give it color.

Simple but only "okay.  First off, flour tortillas aren't typically used for enchiladas but rather soft corn tortillas.  The flour tortillas go a bit gooey which isn't an attractive texture in the mouth (unless it's a sweet gooey).  Adding sauce at the bottom of the pan (as most enchiladas have) would make this feature worse.

These were more like baked burritos to me, but tasty nonetheless!  I had to make changes based on ingredients on hand - namely the beans (used chili beans with liquid), cream cheese (only had half the amount), and tortillas (Mission jalapeño cheddar as well as Mission herbed spinach - halved them since they are so large; I used a total of 5 tortillas).  I added a can of green chiles to the filling mixture.  They turned out great!  I will make these again.  Quick and easy!

A good basic enchilada recipe, but we certainly will tweak it more next time.  It needs enchilada sauce (use the 10 minute recipe from this site!), plus green chilis and black olives.  Unfortunately, even with medium salsa, it needs more spice.  I will add a lot more spices next time, or try with hot salsa. I did not find it too rich with the full amount of cream cheese.

That was very good. I had some leftover chicken and all the other ingredients on hand. I used fresh medium pico de gallo that had a hint of cilantro in it and it gave the dish a nice flavor. And we aren't big fans of cilantro but it was nice. Easy, filling and yummy.
Score!

Very good even though I did over do mine a little.  The filling is very tasty!  I topped mine with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and cilantro.  Yum!

Wow, this is the best recipe I have tried for chicken enchiladas so far and the easiest! Tastes so much better than the enchiladas made with canned soup!  You can adjust the calories and heat with the kind of cream cheese and salsa you use.  I used "On the Border" Medium Salsa, and  used chicken from grilled boned chicken breasts. I also used black beans instead of pinto; since that is what I had on hand. I also find it works better for me to use 8" tortillas instead of 6" tortillas.  I didn't have any Colby-Jack cheese for the top, so I used slices of "real medium cheddar" with sliced ripe olives on top.  I did spread a thin layer of Enchilada Sauce on the bottom of the pan and put some on top of the enchiladas before the cheese and olives.  I doubled this recipe (as I always fit 8 tortillas into a 9" x 13" pan. The 4 extras fit nicely into an 8"x8" pan.  This just moved to the top honor of my Chicken Enchilada recipes. Thank you Iankris!!!

Easy peasy.  Used dried pinto beans I cooked myself and meat from a rotiserre chicken from the grocery store.  I think next time I'll use enchilada sauce on top and bottom.

If I could give this a 4-1/2 star I would. The only reason because while my husband liked it, he didn't love, love it. But I thought it was very tasty. And, four of my kids gobbled it up and that is huge. Plus it was very easy to make. An extra plus for me, a busy mom.

This was a very good recipe. Ingredients having on hand to use up leftovers was soo easy to put together. My family liked. I used fat-free cream cheese and low carb tortillas. Thanks this is a quick fix on the run type of recipe.

So easy and delicious. I used two cans of seasoned chicken breasts and also added a can of corn and 2 tsp taco seasoning to give it some more flavour. Instead of enchilada sauce I used a can of cream of chicken soup mixed with a half cup of milk and poured it on top before the cheese. It was amazing :) Thanks for the Recipe!

Delicious! Used it for my first time making enchiladas and it was quick and easy! I added enchilada to the bottom of the pan and on top of enchiladas. I also added corn in the mixture! It came out great! I highly recommend this recipe!

these were very good, I made a couple adjustments, I added green chili's to the mix, I used corn tortillas as my husband prefers corn, I just quickly friend the corn tortillas a few second on each side, rolled them up with the chicken filling, I also took enchilada sauce and mixed it with sourcream and poured over the top, and topped with cheddar cheese and jalopenos. yum!

I used half the cream cheese, black beans instead of pinto (I really like black beans) and added half a can of green chilies. This was super easy to make and it turned out quite well.  If you top it tightly with aluminum foil the tortillas will remain nice and soft. I baked it for 25 minutes, and then put some cheese on top and baked it uncovered for a few more minutes. They started to get a little hard them. I'm not sure the extra cheese on top really adds anything and would probably leave it off next time but have it on the table as an extra.  Served with extra salsa, sour cream, cheese and green chilies.

Great idea to add beans and cream cheese! I had some of the "Be Prepared Five Bean Soup" left over (which I'd made into a stew with the addition of pearl barley) and tossed that in. Really made the dish hearty and rich with the cream cheese. Other mods were made with the addition of red chili and passata instead of salsa. Thanks! Will definitely do again...plates were licked clean!

So easy and delicious!  I didn't use the beans, and used just tomatoes with habanero peppers in them instead of salsa (it was what I had in the house).  Will definitely make these again.

Yummy!  I made these with a few modifications = used black beans instead of pinto, half the amount of cream cheese, and 10" whole wheat tortillas.  Also, I chopped up 2 chicken breasts into small pieces and cooked them in a non-stick pan with a heavy sprinkle of both cumin and chili powder.  I also covered the enchiladas with a bottle of enchilada sauce and sprinkled with some reduced fat monterey jack cheese.  This was really really good...could have it once a week!

My husband is still raving about these and we ate them over 2 weeks ago.  Love the recipe for the simplicity.  Like other reviewers, I cut the cream cheeze in 1/2 and added a can of green chilis.

This recipe was too cream-cheesy.  If you're used to Tex-Mex enchiladas you might as well take out the cream cheese and use 1/2 the amt of another cheese to 'set' the inside. And what happened to the enchilada sauce!   Maybe call it a different name.  Tasted too much like Jose Ole right out of the grocery freezer.

I have been making enchiladas for years now from this recipe I found in a magazine while I was in collage. This is the closest to it. They are a great hit for feeding a crowd...and buy some aluminun pans from the store so clean up is super easy too. I boil the chicken and then shred it with two forks. I also add a can of black beans and a can of green chiles. The best thing about this recipe is you can always add or subtract things to your tastes...I being vegetarian will make a few for me that have spinach in them. Sometimes I add jalapenos and onions. Thanks for posting this!

I find a few things will help out this recipe and make it the 5 star rating I gave it anyway. Cook chicken in taco seasoning so it has the flavor to start you off (helps give it a little more spice). Then, instead of heating up the salsa and cream cheese, I just smear about a tablespoon of softened, unseasoned cream cheese in a strip on the bottom of each tortilla and then just top it with a tablespoon of Rotel (or salsa and diced green chilis) before adding the chicken and the flavors meld together nicely once baked in the oven. I also prefer to pour enchilada sauce over the top before baking to heighten the flavor. Melts in your mouth!

A really simple recipe that looks and tastes as though you worked on it for hours. Great mid-week meal. Love the creamy filling. Pour some enchilada sauce on it before you cook it though.

This was by far the best chicken enchiladas I have ever had.  I usually use sour cream but from now on I will only use this recipe!!  I cooked my chicken breasts in a slow cooker with some chipotle peppers and the taco seasoning recipe from this site and cooked until so tender and flavorful.  Also added a can of enchilada sauce to the top before the cheese.  WOW!  They reheat beautifully too!

I used 6 oz of lite cream cheese, but I think 4 oz would be plenty.  The tortillas got a little tough when baked dry.  I'll add the enchilada sauce on top next time and the cheese at the end (it was pretty crispy!)

mmm..mmm.. mmmm.. Great Enchiladas without the hassle! I did some few minor changes though, co0k the chicken meat in taco seasoning and dip flour tortillas in heated heavy cream before putting the mixture on it (this idea is from Gerry's chicken enchilada w/c can also be found in this site). We now have Spanish night on dinner rotation because of this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

All six members of my family loved this. Changes I made: used ground turkey instead of chicken and put enchilada sauce on top.

Definitely a keeper

We are not big Tex-Mex eaters but this recipe really went over well.  After reading the reviews, I used pinto beans and covered them with enchilada sauce.  I tried it once with pinto beans but it is much better with black beans.  You have to hide the leftovers or you will be out of luck.

Quick, easy and very good!  Only change I made was to use 8 1/2" whole wheat flour tortillas and the filling was ample and they fit perfectly in the 9x13" pan.

I really liked this recipe. In the tradition of the creative cooks on allrecipes I did modify it some. I used refried beans and spread them on the tortilla and then added the chicken, salsa, cream cheese mixture and topped with cheese and rolled it. I used the enchilada sauce idea mentioned earlier on the bottom of the pan and over the tortillas. I had some leftover taco meat and did the same process except used just the cream cheese/salsa mixture on top of that and the refried beans and my husband LOVED IT! We had mexican rice and it was an easy and tasted wonderful. Thanks for the starting point!!!

I cooked 2 chicken breasts in the crockpot with a small jae of salsa for 6 hours.  It shredded great and really made these enchiladas great.  I also added enchilada sauce.  We will definately be having this again!

I made this with canned chicken(!), 1/2 package cream cheese, and extra salsa. I didn't even have any beans or cheese on hand, and this still came out great. It was a big hit!

Tastes great, used frozen cooked chicken pieces and still tasted good. I agree with other reviews that it needed to be a little bit spicier but overall very delicious. My husband loved it.

Easy to prepare but just a little bit rich for enchiladas.  Sort of bland, need to spice it up a notch or two.

This was quite good, maybe my favorite enchilada recipe thus far.  I used the whole cream cheese and did not find it too rich.  My only deviation is that I used some enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan and over the enchiladas.  I also uncovered the last 5 minutes or so to get a little browning of the cheese.

It was awesome and easy!   I know this will make it harder but last night I put my chicken in the crockpot Mississippi style with a stick of butter and 6 pepperoncinis and cooked all night to use.  I think the peppers will add an extra zing!

This recipe is amazing! Instead of rolling into enchiladas, I layered it lasagna-style in a 9 x 13 and baked for 35-40 min. Also left it sit for 10 min to firm up. De-lish!

I really liked this recipe! I made this for a culinary project and it worked our nicely. I did make a few changes by only using 4 oz. of cream cheese and I actually used 2 cans of Enchilada sauce all together. I put one can in with the chicken and I used one can to coat the bottom of the pan and top the enchiladas.

I've used this recipe many times over the past year or so and my husband and I love it. I use canned chicken breast meat from Costco for convenience and I only use 4 ounces of cream cheese as recommended by other reviewers. The first time I made it without enchilada sauce and my husband requested that I use it so now I spread sauce on the inside bottom of the pan and over the top of the enchiladas before adding cheese. This is a great and simple enchilada recipe that I will continue to use! Thanks!

As soon as I started making this I realized it was like a dip I make and had a feeling it wasn't going to be what I'd want for enchiladas.  By the time we put enchilada sauce and all the toppings they were good. Just not our taste. Ty for sharing.

Thank you for posting a New dinner rotation meal for our fam.

Very easy and quite delicious. You can make as is or add a few things to make it pop. Either way, just use 1/2 a package of cream cheese. A whole package makes it too rich. I added a small can of green chiles, chopped cilantro and half of a jalapeño pepper for some kick. I also put a light coating of enchilada sauce just to cover the bottom of the baking dish and a small amount on top of the enchiladas before adding the cheese.The flour tortillas are good but the second time I made it I used corn tortillas and it was even that much better!

Loved these!  I used chicken thighs because I prefer to breasts.  I also added a can of green chilies and used a can of enchilada sauce.  I like a little heat, so I added about a tablespoon of Tastefully simple fiesta party dip seasoning.  For the cheese, I used 1/2 taco cheese blend and 1/2 pepper jack cheese.  Will definitely make again!

Tasty!  Made as directed except I put a bit of salsa on top of the Enchiladas underneath the cheese.  Very rich and filling!  Update:  This has become a regular go to meal.  We enjoy it very much and it sooo easy!  Used low fat cream cheese and noone noticed.

I have not only tried this recipe but it is now a go to staple.  I have followed the recipe as written and it was good.  I only made changes because of personal preference but the recipe as written is good!  For the gluten free in our family I use the corn tortillas and we found that we prefer them. Also add some jalapenos to give it some heat.  Using rotisserie chicken cuts done on time too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have tried this recipe and it is good, if a little bland. Adding a bit of whole kernel corn adds some texture and flavor. Spicy enchilada sauce adds a bit of bite also.

I made this tonight and my family enjoyed it. I am a new cook I am literally just able to boil water. I was surprised how easy this was for me. I pour enchilada sauce over the top sprinkled with the suggested cheese topped with black olives and chopped green onions. It was beautiful and scrumptious.

Great - quick and easy. I add additional spices (chicken spice) and add enchilada sauce to the top. I use taco shredded cheese as well. I also make homemade guacamole and top with sour cream.

I put 3 lbs of chicken,1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 2 tsp of chili powder and 2 packets of taco seasoning(1 spicy and 1 mild) in a crock pot and let it cook on high for approximately 3 hours. I shredded the chicken and doubled the cream cheese and salsa. I then followed the recipe adding the chicken and 1 can of pinto beans to the cream cheese and salsa. I put a little Old El Paso Enchilada sauce in my glass dish before placing the enchiladas on top, then I put a little more on top and put Colby Jack on top. I only use corn tortillas. I topped it with a little more salsa and sour cream. Amazing!

I used corn tortillas, Monterey Jack cheese with jalapenos, and threw a diced jalapeno into the filling, and these were amazing.  So easy, and they tasted fantastic.

The only thing j would suggest is to use about 3/4 of the filling for inside the tortillas and use the rest as a topper... will make the cheese even gooier when adding it near the end of the baking time and keep the enchiladas from getting too crispy. But will DEFINITELY. make again, great recipe!!

Great recipe! A couple substitutions - used rotisserie chicken, 1/3 fat cream cheese (just a little less than recipe called for, too), and about 3/4 cup salsa and 1/2 can Mexican style Rotel diced tomatoes. I set 1/4 cup of the sauce aside before adding chicken and drizzled it over the enchiladas before sprinkling sargento Mexican cheese blend over the top. Served with sliced avocado, it was a huge hit!!

My husband liked it and he's hard to please. I did take the suggestions of another and add'd some green chili peppers.  The pinto beans had green chili pepper already in the can I purchased from the store.  I also had enough sause that I made 7 total and poured the remaining sause on the top of the enchiladas.  We will definatly make this part our menu from now on!!!   THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!

Made this last night and we all enjoyed it. However, I am not a huge fan of chunky salsa, but that was all I had. Next time, I am going to try making it with taco sauce instead. I did add a dash of cumin, salt and pepper. Oh, and I made 12 medium (soft taco) enchiladas. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic recipe! So easy to follow. I did it without the beans (because I had none). The kids devoured it. If you're looking for an easy starting point for chicken enchiladas, this is defiantly it. Very flexible to add or take things out. Will do again.

Excellent, I did put enchilada sauce over and in the pan, as others recommended and didn't put the pinto beans in, prefer on the side.  Had an amazing flavor, I used leftover rotisserie chicken...great use for leftovers!

This is a great dish, its a new taste to enchiladas. At first its a tangy taste that gets settled down by the taste of the blander unique pinto bean taste.  I sincerely enjoyed this meal and recommend it to anyone looking for a new taste to their buds...

I love this recipe, so simple to make and tastes wonderful! Just needed to pick up a roitisserie and I added a little more salsa to the cream cheese mixture. I love cheese so I added shredded mexican blend cheeses inside the enhiladas.

We really enjoyed the recipe. I used enchilada sauce instead of the salsa, about 6 oz. of cream cheese, and substituted black beans for the pinto beans. We will definitely have again. Yummy!

Woohoo! These were SO good... this is what I did... had an Old El Paso Enchilada Kit I wanted to get rid of... used the spice packet that came with it when I was cooking the chicken... read the other reviews and didnt want the top of the enchiladas to be hard, so I doubled the sauce (well kinda -  I actually just used the same amount of cream cheese and doubled the salsa) Reserved about 1/3 of this to put on top of the enchiladas, then added the beans and chicken to the other 2/3. Added the reserved sauce to the top, topped with cheese..... DELICIOUS!!  The enchilada spice packet gave it that extra zing some other reviewers thought was missing... I even got to use the enchilada sauce from the kit to make "Best Spanish Rice" on this site... awesome dinner!!

I didn't have any salsa so, I used 8 ounces of tomato sauce and I cut up green chillies and added that. I cut down on the cream cheese a little and added a can of refried beans. I cooked the chicken in a skillet with half a package of fajita seasoning. Baked in the oven at 325 for around 30 minutes. I also used the taco style shredded cheese and liberally sprinkled that on top. An easy and absolutely delicious recipe. Thanks for posting it!

Everyone really loves when I make this, except I always top it with more salsa so it is not so dry. But I get the same response as others. They think I am the best cook ever... yea, not even close. Sometimes I add corn to mine in substitute to the beans, because corn is my favorite.

my husband said these were the best enchiladas he had ever had and they were SO MUCH easier than the other recipes I've used. I did half the amount of cream cheese and I set aside a bit of the sauce to pour over the top while it baked.- YUM!!!

I've made this dish at least a dozen times so far.  I can never get sick of it.  So easy, so tasty, so filling.  Impresses everytime.  I tried using low-fat cream cheese and sour cream, and it still tasted just as yummy.  I also used enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and a little on top of the enchilada before adding the cheese.  Great as left-overs!

I'M A BEGINNER AT MEXICAN FOOD BUT MY BOYFRIEND LOVES IT SO, I TRY. THIS RECIPE WAS SOOOO EASY AND VERY GOOD. IT IS NICE THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE 2 PANS FOR EASY CLEAN UP. I READ OTHER REVIEWS THAT STATED TO USE ONLY HALF THE CREAM CHEESE. I DID AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I ALSO USED REFIED BEANS INSTEAD OF PINTO.

This was a great basic recipe.  Very easy.  I also used what I had on hand.  I did not have beans so I used some things from Tastefully Simple - the corn black bean salsa inside the enchiladas.  Then I used enchilada sauce on top and underneath.  I cooked the chicken in their S.W. Season Salt to add flavor and reduced the cream cheese to 4 oz.  The entire family loved it.

This was wonderful...loved that it was so easy...came together in 20 minutes.  I boiled the chicken in salt water and shredded it.  I added my homemade salsa (which has a small kick) and substituted black beans for pinto..I would highly recommend salsa with some heat..otherwise, I would add a shot or two of hot sauce to the filling.  Excellent!  The entire family loved it!

This is super easy and incredibly delicious! This might be one of our favorite dinners now. Here are the modifications we made: 
1. We took others' advice and put half can of red echilada sauce on bottom of pan and the second half on top of the rolled tortillas before we put the cheese on.
2. We added a can of green chiles to the filling.
3. We cooked 3 chicken breasts and while cooking them in the skillet seasoned them with cumin, black pepper, chopped onion, garlic powder, and a little chili powder. 
4. By using the 3 chicken breasts and the recommended 1 package of cream cheese, along with the can of beans (we used black), and salsa we had enough filling for 10 enchiladas. There was a little filling left over that we just smeared in between the rolled enchiladas.
4. We tried to make it a little healthier by using light cream cheese, whole wheat/high fiber tortillas, and 2% shredded Sargento Mexican blend cheese. You couldn't even tell it was light stuff. 
This was a great dinner and we'll definitely make it again. Thanks!!

This recipe is super easy and super delicious. First time I made this I had to make it the very next night also. I would recommend buying a can of Red Enchilada sauce to poor all over the enchiladas. It's the step that takes my rating from a 4 to a 5.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have regular pinto beans, but had some ranch-style beans. The sauce added some great flavor to the chicken mixture! I also added some taco seasoning to the chicken, and added salsa to the bottom of the pan, and also spread a little salsa over the top, then added the cheese on top. We like "saucy" enchiladas! The creamy filling is to die for! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these enchiladas today for a quick dinner tonight. I was quite surprised with the simplicity of this recipe.  The only change I made was that I mashed the pinto beans and sauteed the "paste" in chopped onion, minced garlic, salt and pepper until most of the liquid evaporated.Pretty much I just made homemade refried beans and used that instead of the whole beans. Let me tell you....these were so good.  I topped them with salsa and Cheddar before putting them in the oven. Taste was amazing...

Filling is easy and good. Better as leftovers than the first time around! Needs sauce -- or be prepared to add plenty of salsa when serving.

These were really good. I did modify a little bit. I used about 5 ounces of cream cheese and I had a little extra chicken and salsa and about 2 cups of rice. I didn't have pinto beans, so I used a can of black beans. I threw in some cumin and like others, used enchilada sauce. I think that the full amount of cream cheese would be too much. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe is very good and easy.  I leave out the beans just because it doesn't appeal to me. I pour a can of enchilada sauce on top then shredded cheese before I stick in the oven.

I love traditional enchiladas, but decided to try this recipe because it was quick and easy and others seemed to like it.  It was quick and easy to prepare but not to my liking.  The cream cheese and salsa combination doesn't work for me.  I tried pepping up the chicken with some taco seasoning but all the same, I was disappointed with this.

These were just what the title says, "Easy." They were also delicious. My husband LOVED these, he said these were the best enchiladas I have ever made. He liked the texture and flavor. I will be putting these in my rotation.

this was just what i needed. Had leftover chicken breasy (again) and wanted something different for a change. i am not a big fan of enchiladas but thouht i would give it a try my hubby loves them. I had to cut the recipes in half sicne i did nto have enough of everything, i also did not use the beans and i added cheese salsa to make the amount needed. It was awesome, this is a keeper. it was fast easy and different i also did not have the enchilada sauce so i used a little taco sauce. turned out great hubby did not wait to take it to lunch he ate it tonight for supper!!

Definitely the most simple and wonderful tasting chicken enchiladas I've made.  I threw some tobasco sauce in to give it a little kick.  Besides that, one of the best recipes I've had from this sight!

I used this recipe for girls night at my house. All of us loved it and I have made it several times since then! It's soooo easy! Everyone always asks for the recipe. The only modification I made was that I used whole wheat tortillas and they were wonderful. You can top the enchiladas with anything you like. The possibilities are endless.

I thought this dish was great. I was worried about the fat and calories so I used fat free cream cheese, reduced fat mexican cheese, and low carb tortillas. I served the enchiladas on a bed of lettuce and had black beans and rice as a side.

Can't give this a "5" because of the changes I made, so don't know what it would have been like originally.  Used black beans rather than pinto, and added cumin to the filling mixture.  Also, don't much care for chicken breast, so left out the meat entirely and just mixed the shredded cheese (used Cheddar) into the filling.  Topped with more salsa and some of that white Mexican quesadilla cheese.  Heavenly!!  Also, I got a whole lot more than 6 enchiladas out of the filling mixture!  So, basically, I ended up with bean and 3-cheese enchiladas, and they ROCKED!

This was an easy recipe to make, and it turned out great. I only used half the can of pinto beans, and next would probably add mushrooms and green chilis!

My husband and I loved this dish the first time we made but since have become less enthusiastic about it.  It tastes good although it is rich with the amount of cream cheese as specified in the recipe.  I think I will need to play around with this recipe to make it one that we will want to keep for a long time to come.  I'm welcome to suggestions from others.

Delicious!  I followed others advice and reduced cream cheese to 4 oz. and increased salsa to 1 and 1/2 cups and thought it was perfect.  I loved the beans in it!

This was an awesome recipe!  I am so glad I found it; I was looking everywhere for a simple chicken enchilada recipe!  My husband really loved it, too!  I followed other reviewer suggestions and used 4oz of low-fat cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of spicy salsa, I used corn tortillas and layered them.  Just delicious!  Thank you Kristine!

I wanted to make chicken enchiladas and I was out of sour cream. I tried this recipe and it was great! I used hot salsa and added cheddar cheese to the filling. My family and myself loves it! I will definitely make these again!

Super easy to make and delicious. When you double the recipe it makes a lot so we took the leftovers and used it as a chip dip. It was amazing.

Great easy recipe.  Followed other suggestions and reduced cream cheese to 4 oz. and added 1/2 small can of diced chilies.  I also seasoned the "mixture" with a little Cajun seasoning to give a little kick.  I did use enchilada sauce on bottom of tortillas and top  -------- I must add this! In discussing with spouse and reading reviews, we agreed that yes,  enchiladas are made with corn tortillas.  So in prepping for the meal- along with pictures we agreed to use flour as the recipe calls for.  I posted the pic with the "small"amount left.  Forgot to take pics before eating. LOVED IT!  The concern with using corn tortillas was cooking time in oven- harder to roll.  Thanks other reviewers for all the input.

We made this for dinner tonight.  However, I had to substitute enchilada sauce for the salsa because I didn't have salsa.  It was still delicious! My husband loved it!

This was very good.  I had some smoked chicken from a previous meal and added a cooked chicken breast.  I used a little less cream cheese and microwaved that with the salsa.  I added siracha sauce and a few more spices, to our taste.  Quick and easy and no canned soup!  Served with a yellow rice dish.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Super easy to make and super delicious!!! I have to say they are the best enchiladas I've had yet! I looked at reviews prior to making this and found that a lot of people added the enchilada sauce, so I did so as well. If your much of a bean eater only use half of what the recipe calls for beans.

I had leftover chicken breast to use and stumbled across this little gem. I love cream cheese so this was a no brainer. Hard to believe something so simple can be so tasty. I almost subbed the salsa for rotel but I decided to run to the store and I'm glad I did. Can't wait to try it with steak! The only thing I may do differently next time is use a medium salsa for more heat!!

My wife makes these and the recipe is much easier than her original. Really love the taste. The only thing she does different is to use corn tortillas and black beans and when it is ready to go in the oven covers it with Verde sauce and cheese. I can eat them for breakfast lunch n dinner not a heavy meal at all.A Nice sprinkle of fresh cut jalapeños and these things are gone. Nice recipe.

This was a huge hit for my wife and I and our kids!  I added jalapenos to a few for my wife and I, and that gave them a nice bite.  Also served them with a Mexican Rice recipe I found on this site.  What  an easy and delicious weeknight supper!

Instead of salsa, I always mix in enchilada sauce. Sometimes I add sautéed onions and chopped black olives as well. Also, I don't use flour tortillas. I use corn tortillas instead, and I fry them in vegetable oil for a few seconds on each side before filling them. They always turn out great, and I always have leftovers.

Four stars because I think it would be too bland without adjustments.

I changed this up a bit, but this is a good, easy baseline recipe. Here is what I did:

Spread a light layer of enchilada sauce over the bottom of a foil-lined 13x9 pan. (Forgot to spray it first with cooking spray and that would have helped after baking.)

In a saucepan, mixed 8 oz of sour cream, a jar of salsa, a 15-oz can of refried beans, and the chicken. Heated enough just to take the chill off the sour cream.

To be more traditional, I used small corn tortillas, and had ample filling to roll enough to fill a complete pan. I then poured the rest of the enchilada sauce on top, then shredded Mexican style cheese (only used about 1-1/4 cups). Baked around 45 mins until the cheese was lightly brown. After plating, topped with a little bit of sour cream, parsley (did not have cilantro), and some left over tomatoes and peppers from the rice recipe below. The enchiladas were DELICIOUS and so easy!

For a side dish, I drained the juice from one can of Rotel canned tomatoes/chilis and added enough water to make two cups. I placed one cup of brown rice in my rice cooker, added the liquid, and about half of the remaining tomatoes/chilis from the can. (Used the other half to top the enchiladas.) This was good, but next time I will use more spices to the rice, like chili powder or cumin.

In the end, a great easy meal with easy cleanup. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I followed this pretty much to a T. I switched out the pinto beans for black beans and added green chiles and a teaspoon of taco seasoning. I will add this recipe to the arsenal.

Just made this recipe and we are all stuffed!!!  Delicious!  The simple changes I made.... added cup of sour cream since i did not have cream cheese, and I added little bit of chili powder and i poured a can of enchilada sauce under and over the enchiladas before placing them in the over.  My husband and boys absolutely loved them....and so did I since I used GLUTEN-FREE tortillas for me!  Thank you for this easy recipe.

This was really good. I put salsa on the bottom of a 9x13 pan and poured a bit over the top after I rolled the enchiladas. I also filled 10 flour tortillas, not 6. I added jalapenos, cumin, and garlic powder to the cream cheese mix while it was cooking. I also sprinkled sliced black olives over the salsa on top and sprinkled cheese on top before baking. After baking, I put chopped fresh tomatoes, cilantro, sour cream, and hot sauce on top. Yum!

This was a simple and tasty recipe that even my picky 6yr old enjoyed.  I added minced garlic at the beginning and enchilada sauce to the top.  I'm not much of a cook and this was my first attempt at enchiladas.  I will definitely make this again.

This was An Extremely easy weeknight meal! I did tweak it a bit lol but it would be just fine as written! I used black beans and instead of salsa i used a can of tomatoes with green chilis in it and last but not least we like ours a bit saucy so i made a little sour cream sauce to put over the top DELICIOUS!!!!

i made this using refried beans, chicken marinated in orange juice/cumin/salt/pepper/garlic, and blended 2 jalapenos, 4 roma tomatoes, and one huge green pepper in a blender to make a mild salsa instead of using enchilada sauce. turned out yummy but because of the gooey filling (cream cheese, beans, etc) it felt more like eating a casserole. i grew up eating enchiladas that made me feel like a kamikaze from the heat! but it was nice to tone it down and Americanize one time

Family (including children) loved it.  Cut back to 4 oz cream cheese.  Maybe next time I'll try adding some sour cream with the cream cheese!

I made it as stated (I did use low-fat cream cheese) and it was a little dry.  I made it again and put Enchilada sauce in the bottom and on top before I topped with cheese as others have stated and it was really good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried it tonight, used corn tortillas of course, and followed the measurements carefully. I was able to fill 8  6" tortillas and have enough mixture left over to do the same amount again. I sure hope it freezes well because I hate to waste food.

Very easy, very good & makes a lot- plenty of leftovers.  I used other reviewers' suggestions and added a can of green chilIs, used refried beans instead of pinto, and poured half a can of enchilada sauce on bottom of casserole and the other half on top before adding Mexican cheeses.  I threw the frozen chicken in the crock pot with some of the salsa in the morning- very easy to shred/cut up when I got home that afternoon.  My young son tasted it and said "Mom, you've outdone yourself!"  Definitely a keeper.

AWESOME!!!!!  And, to wslowry who commented that enchiladas are not made using flour tortillas...I beg to differ.  It depends on a lot of factors, region, whether or not they are Spanish or Mexican or South American or Central American.  I followed this easy recipe but used black beans instead of pinto and had it on the table in 50 minutes flat. I used a corn salsa and will try enchilada sauce next time.  Thank you so much!

Delicious...flour or corn tortillas?   Who cares??? We prefer flour.   We enjoyed this simply delicious recipe. I also used enchilada sauce and boned & skinned rotisserie chicken w/juices.  Thank you INKARIS.

I changed it up a bit to be more healthy, with LF cream cheese, black beans and soft corn tortillas, I also added a can of enchiladas sauce because I thought it would be too dry.  It was OK but nothing stand out.  I used a rotisserie chicken and I felt like it was a waste but it was a quick and easy meal with most of the items on hand.

Used the 8oz of cream cheese and a small can of green chiles. We used a rotisserie chicken for convince and it was delicious!  An excellent enchilada base. Would also be great with spinach and mushrooms. Will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe 4,762 times (or something close to that ??)!  It is my go-to, new baby, sick, friend in need, take them a meal.com recipe!  The ONLY thing I do different is add 1 can of mild, red enchilada sauce and pour over enchiladas before adding cheese!  Wonderful recipe!

I think this is going to be my new go-to enchilada recipe! I appreciate that the sauce stays on the inside so that the enchiladas stay rolled together and don't go mushy.  I also really enjoyed topping it with the fresh ingredients like chopped tomatoes, sour cream and shredded lettuce.  A yummy and easy dish.  My father in law even asked if he could take home the leftovers! :D

Loved this recipe!  My husband rated it "best yet" and he's really picky.  I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa, added chopped olives, tomatoes, green onions and diced avacado after baking.  Love it!  If you need to pre-prepare...I would put the chicken breasts in the crockpot on low for 8 hours..chicken will shread perfectly and ready for assembly and baking.  YUM!

This is an excellent recipe. My daughter is a picky eater and loved this one. I did add the green chilles and jalapenos.  Also base my pan and the wraps with the enchilada can sauce as suggested from previous users.  Added sour cream, lettuce and tomato as toppings.  Don't slip on this one.  You will be missing out.

I live in Texas and all enchiladas I've had were made with flour tortillas. I used ground turkey white breast meat and added some taco seasoning to taste. Mixed the meat with cream cheese while a bit warm along with roasted chopped green peppers. I then covered the entire dish in green enchilada sauce and cheese cooked on 325 till bubbly in the middle.about an hour.  No beans for mine.  I freeze the unsauced enchiladas individually then bag them for later use. When I need them I just take what I need and finish with sauce and cheese.

I LOVED this recipe and so did my family! I didn't change a thing about the recipe and it was great. I did add jalepenos, diced tomatoes and onion for the topping. This will definitely be added to the rotation. =)

This recipe was delicious for Cinqo de Mayo!  Not too fussy either.  I had my husband grill the chicken after I seasoned it, which also gave it some extra flavor.  Overall, great!  Thank you!

This is an entirely different flavor, than the ones I make with cream of chicken soup.  I like both.  The cream cheese filling could easily serve as a dip.

Hubby loved it and very easy quick meal I felt it did need some extra fresh toppings like tomatoes onions and sour cream to cut down on richness. Very filling! I also did add montery jack cheese.

OMG!  5 stars because it was soooooo easy and soooo good!  I actually think I will make it for my super bowl party because it's so easy.  I bought the Costco rotisserie chicken and we had some leftovers. I had a container of salsa.I had the cream cheese.  I bought corn tortillas, and a can of refried beans and for some reason I thought I needed enchilada sauce. I purchased the milld "Hatch" green enchilada sauce.  I put some in the bottom of the pan.  I took my salsa and did what the recipe said to do.  I followed all the remainder steps and put some more enchilada sauce on top of the rolled enchiladas, then I put it in the oven for maybe 5 minutes covered. I uncovered it after the 5 minutes, splashed the cheese (mozzarella because that was what I had!), put it back in oven for about 3 minutes uncovered,  and with all these oops, it was fabulous!  Definitely sent the recipe to my friends and kids with families.  This is an easy recipe that is a winner!

I'm giving this five stars because although it wasn't anything 'special', it was tasty enough to get everyone in my household to eat, which is nothing short of miraculous! Half the amount of cream cheese was enough for us, but that's all down to personal preference. Also, I used black beans because that's what I had, but they were great, too. This is a great base to start from, and could be modified with whatever ingredients in the house. It will definitely be part of our regular rotation!

Loved how easy this was to pull together. I subbed black beans for the pinto because I didn't have any pinto beans. I also added a small can of corn in order to stretch this into more enchiladas.  For the chicken, I used canned chicken breast.  I followed past reviewers who suggested using only 1/2 the cream cheese.  I also opted for lite cream cheese to cut back on some calories.  Added about 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning mix to give it a little more flavor.  In order to Spice it up even more I added Hot jalapeno chilis diced.  I did NOT use flour tortillas ONLY because authentic enchiladas use CORN not FLOUR.  I did include some enchilada sauce as well.  I didn't want them to dry out.  Overall very easy and tasty.  EXCELLENT dish to make ahead of time and Freeze and then pop in the oven whilst still frozen.  Thanks IANKRIS !!

I have been making enchaladas simmalar to these for years now, they are always a big hit with my husband, and now our kids. I use corn tortillas and flour, depending on what i have on hand, i also use pace salsa and leave out the beans sometimes. I also pour a can of enchalada sauce over them and then the cheese. I have also used this as a chip dip. And i have used it as a layer in a mexican style lasagna. (just start by layering meat sauce, refried beans and corn, then a corn tortilla.) 
TIP: if you are having trouble rolling the corn tortillas, place them in a plastic sandwich bag and seal lightly, put in the mircowave for 30 seconds this heats them enough to make them plyable and should not rip. Or you can put them a skillet of hot oil and lightly fry them on each side for 10 seconds. I will make this again.

yummy and easy 
alterations: used half the cream cheese (and 1/3 less fat cream cheese), used enchilada sauce instead of salsa, shredded chicken, added some chili peppers, added cheese last 5 mins (used less than asked)

I feel kind of bad for giving this recipe a review after all the things I did to it. I avoided going to the store by using the cream cheese with chives I had (half of a tub/4 oz because of several reviewers recommending so), black beans instead of pinto and Queso Blanco instead of Colby-Jack. I made a Mexican rice on the side and top the "enchiladas" with guacamole, sour cream and a pico de gallo I added some corn to. It was very yummy and easy to prepare.

My family and I are on a semi low carb kick, so I used mama lupe's low carb tortillas. Very simple recipe with delicious results. Following the other suggestions, I did use a bit less low fat cream cheese.

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  My husband who is picky even loved it.  I left out the beans just because of personal preference and it came out quite good.  I also doubled the recipe and needed to cook it an additional 15 minutes.  I also used canned cubed chicken to save time.  Overall a very good and easy recipe to use.  Will make again.

Great recipe! Quick and easy. I use a rotisserie chicken and just skin and shred. I also use an enchilada sauce to coat the pan. Wouldn't change much and it's easy enough to alter any particulars that one may like in their enchiladas.

Loved this recipe! Never had enchiladas like this and already made them twice. Made a few changes the second time for variety: used fluffy lardless San Antonio-style tortillas; halved cream cheese and substituted sour cream; used salsa verde as my salsa and cooked with straight salsa verde on top; added slices of avocado on top the last 10 minutes; served on beds of shredded lettuce and topped with crumbled Mexican cotija cheese.

Easy, excellent recipe. I substituted a can of fat-free refried beans and 2/3 cup salsa for the cream cheese and pinto beans, and added about 1/4 cup shredded cheese to make it creamy when melted. Made one enchilada for my vegetarian daughter before adding the chicken for everyone else. Used half a can of enchilada sauce in the bottom of the dish, then poured the rest over the enchiladas once they went in. Toppings I had ready on the side: sour cream, salsa, chopped fresh tomato, sliced black olives, chopped green onions and fresh guacamole made from one of the many recipes on this site. Everyone enjoyed it. It's the first time I've made enchiladas, but it won't be the last! Thanks for the recipe. :)

Wonderful! We loved it. I followed directions, except added salsa on bottom and top of rolled tortillas. Very rich, but I love rich, salty foods. Perfect with chopped lettuce, tomato, and sour cream on top.

Quick and easy recipe. The filling alone, topped with cheese makes a  great dip with nachos!

These are excellent! Easy, quick and delicious. I didn't have salsa so I used a packet of enchilada sauce with a can of diced chilies - very good! Thanks. :)

Super easy supper.... family & friends will love it and kids will never guess the secret ingredient (cream cheese).  I used black beans instead of pintos one time and another I used leftover white rice from the previous evening.  Both were wonderful in it!  Yummy!!!

Great!  Easy, filling, and tasty.  Doesn't even need sour cream.  Made 7 or 8, with a little filling left over (which I just scattered on top).  Two tortillas was a very filling serving, with no sides.  Would easily serve a crowd if you added rice on the side.  MODS: halved the cream cheese, used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving (probably less than 2c, as I got tired of shredding), added some chili powder and cilantro to balance the bland turkey, used whole grain tortillas, topped with extra salsa before adding shredded cheese

We really liked this recipe! I used black beans , 2 green onions and 4 oz. of cream cheese in filling. Plus used enchilada sauce as suggested by others. They seemed to stick on the glass baking dish so next time I'll lightly grease the dish. Also I needed 8 tortillas for the quanity of filling. Thank you, IANKRIS this was a big hit.

I made these last week for 30 people/servings!  So quick and easy.  Layer them with parchment paper in between layers, worked great since there were so many.  Everyone loved them. You will need more than 30 tortillas, at least I did.

My husband & I loved it! I like to eat low fat menu items so I was able to tweak the recipe & it was still awesome! I usually don't eat enchiladas when we go out to restaurants b/c of cals b/ this was great & still tasted like it was full fat. I added the rotel mix that was recommended & used the fat free sour cream & 97% fat free cream of chk. My husband couldn't stop saying how much he loved it & he is hard to please! It will definitely be in my monthly rotation.

These were actually pretty good and better than I expected. I did add a little extra salsa because it was very cream-cheesy and next time I will add more beans. I topped these with enchilada sauce, a lot of cheese and sliced black olives. I doubled the recipe and they were devoured by my husband and kids.

I really like this one. It's pretty dang easy. I, too, use red enchilada sauce and pour it over the top. To make it even easier, you can use canned chicken (it sounds gross, but there are a couple good brands out there), and I really like using uncooked tortillas (they cook in the 30 mins in the oven. The last 5 minutes I take the tin foil off and brown a cheese a bit. Other than that, I leave everything the way it is.

This dish is so easy.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and coated the bottom of the pan in salsa as well as the top of the enchiladas and then covered the entire dish with cheese. This is a great basic recipe that you can add to to suit your own taste.  This time I threw in all the leftovers from the fridge part of an onion, bacon, shreaded rotisserie  chicken and vegan bean taco filling (from this site).  These are awesome, even better the second day!!!

I make this meal OFTEN for guests.  It is always a hit with everyone.  People think I'm some sort of insane genius in the kitchen (I'm Not by the way), but it makes me feel good to get all those "oooohs" and "aaaahs" at meal time.  Very delicious.  Don't change a thing, except maybe double the recipe and make two batches because it will literally disappear.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

My family loves these enchiladas.  They are tasty & nice for after work because I can make them ahead & just pop in the oven when I get home.  I skip the beans because my husband won't eat them.  I always use a homemade salsa & reduced fat cream cheese in the mix. My husband likes me to make extra cream cheese/salsa mixture to serve on top.  They are also yummy if you add some sliced black olives baked right inside the enchiladas.  This dish is a regular feature on our menu.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I love this dish!  I use a can of refried beans instead of a can of pinto beans.  I use the burrito or wrap size tortilla and have more than enough of the filling for six. I spread  some of the filling on the bottom of the pan then the enchiladas, spreading any remaining filling on top of the enchiladas followed by the cheese.

So Easy and So Delicious! This was almost too simple for me, so I added a few more ingredients to kick up the flavor. I cooked up my chicken to shred it finely. While it was cooking I added enchilada sauce, enchilada seasoning, sauted onions, tomato sauce, and cumin powder. To the tortilla rolls, I added a dollup of salsa, refried beans (instead of pinto beans), and shredded cheese. I topped it off with the remaining shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream. Yes, I know I made a simple dish complex, but that is the beauty of this recipe it really allows you to add your own personal touch. :-) NOTE: The cream cheese mix is wonderful and adds a nice richness to the chicken filling.

Was very good.  I did follow the suggestions of cutting the amount of cream cheese and also using sauce in the dish before I put the enchiladas in.  My family loved it- I think next time I will cut the cream cheese down a bit more then half- just a personal preference.

Very good recipe! I cut the cream cheese amt in half, and melted it with enchilada sauce and a small can of green chili's. I also boiled the chicken breast with half an onion and fajita spice, and shredded it, and stirred it into the enchilada sauce mix. I also subbed corn instead of the flour tortilla's to make it gluten free. 15 minutes after i put it in the oven i put the cheese on top with black olives- turned out fantastic!

Very easy and delicious. I followed other reviews and substituted the salsa for green enchilada sauce. Have made several times :)

I used previous reviews, and my own imagination, to embellish on this recipe: I used the breasts, legs and thigh meat from a whole boiled chicken, which I shredded (I ended up with apx. 4 cups of chicken), then took a cup of the broth and mixed in a pkg. of fajita seasoning, poured it over the shredded chicken and let it marinade in the fridge for an hour. I used a can of Mexicorn, apx. 3 cups salsa, 6 oz. cream cheese, a can of black beans, & all the marinated chicken in the mixture. I had a big bag of 6" corn tortillas which were cracked in places, so instead of rolling up my enchiladas, I poured a little enchilada sauce into the bottom of two 9x13 pans (I had a lot of filling), then double-lined them with the tortillas, so that they curled up the sides of the pans. I poured the mixture evenly into both pans, spread strips of whole green chiles over the top of the filling, then put another layer (6 for each pan) of tortillas over the top of that. I spread the rest of a lg. can of enchilada sauce evenly over everything, covered both with foil, and baked them for apx. 30 min.. I then added 2-3 cups shredded Mexican Cheese, dotted the top w/ sliced jalapenos, and sprinkled cilantro over that. I put them back in the oven, uncovered, for 10 more min.. Finally, I browned the cheese under the broiler, cut into rectangles, and served w/ sour cream. It got rave review from my family, and I still have lots of leftovers!

This makes a good vegetarian dish if you leave out the chicken, but I like using this recipe the night after we have a roast chicken to use up the leftovers.  It certainly would be easy enough to grill up some chicken breasts, use pre-packaged cooked chicken or one of those warm cooked roasters all the grocery stores seem to have now. You can make it as hot or as mild as you like by changing the "heat" of the salsa you use. I don't think this is really "company worthy", but a definite family meal keeper!

Delicious!  I used black beans instead of pinto, added some tomato/corn salsa in the chicken mixture, and added canned enchilada sauce on the bottom and top like a lot of other people. I also lightened it up by using just 4oz of low fat cream cheese and 1 c. of 2% milk cheese on top and used whole wheat tortillas.  It was still great!

This was easy and suprisingly good.  The cream cheese mixture with the beans and meat made a great filling.  I used ground chicken and added a Tablespoon of taco seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  Used half the cream cheese b'c that was all I had.  I also had some leftover taco sauce so I spread that over the enchiladas before adding the cheese and baking.  It gave it a little extra color and flavor.

This is super easy! I needed a meal I could make in 15 minutes flat. I am a vegetarian, so I used a can each of pink and red beans, halved the cream cheese, and added two cut up Chikn patties. Rolled it up, put cheese on top, microwaved it for 4 minutes. Then I cut up tomatoes, olives, and green onions for garnishes. My husband loved it and was out the door in 10 minutes. Thanks!!

I made this for dinner when we had friends over at the last minute because I had most of the ingredients on hand.  It was wonderful and everyone raved about it.  The cream cheese creates a sauce so that the enchiladas aren't dry.  I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa, as that's what I had and I omitted the beans because I wasn't sure if our guests would like them.  Next time I'll try it with them to see which we prefer.

This a good base recipe. I changed a few things. I cut back on the cream cheese and salsa. I added 1/2 pack of taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture.  I did not add beans (the family are not fans of beans)  I then covered the enchiladas with enchilada sauce and cheese before I baked it.  It turned out very good and I will make this again.

Instead of baking in the oven with just cheese and no enchilada sauce, I just served these up as burritos.  I halved the cream cheese, and added a cup of shredded mexican cheese into the chicken mixture at the very end.  Piled the mixture into tortillas and rolled up into burritos It is really good this way.  Makes a really good lunch the next day for hubby too.

Everyone has absolutely LOVED this when I make it.  If we have people over, this is what I make.  I modify it by halving the cream cheese.  I coat the baking dish with enchilada sauce, add the enchiladas, smother them with enchilada sauce, and then adding the cheese.  I bake it on 400 degrees for 20 minutes to make it cook faster.  It still tastes the same (I've done the 350 degrees for 30 minutes as well).  I highly recommend using the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce also found on this site.  It's what I always use with it and everyone loves it.

My husband wasn't too crazy about this recipe because it was a bit heavy on the cream cheese.  I loved that the recipe was quick and easy, though, and may try it again with less cream cheese and more salsa.

My boyfriend loved these enchiladas. I had to make a few modifications based on what I had in the pantry. I baked a chicken the night before, so I used the meat we had left over and it was a PERFECT use of leftovers. I also used black beans instead of pinto beans and 1/2 canned chopped tomatoes with green chili peppers added in addition to 1/2 cup salsa (my boyfriend is afraid of anything spicy and our hot sauce was too spicy to use alone). Like many of the other comments, I used half the cream cheese to be on the safe side. 

A big difference was omitting the cheese and I made a really simple sour cream sauce and baked the enchiladas smothered in the sauce and finished the dish with a nice sprinkle of paprika as garnish. 

Thank you for giving me a fun recipe to play with!

These were so yummy, a little too much Cream cheese though, I read other reviews before making these and put a half a can of green sauce on the bottom and half on top then the cheese, and didn't use 2 cups of cheese, I only used one, and they were a smash hit at dinner time, even my husband loved them, and he is Spanish and  swore til I made these that his mother made the best enchiladas, now I guess i am giving her a run for her money.THANKS!

This was very good!  I made some changes, though.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour, I added a can of cream of chicken soup to the cream cheese and bean mixture and instead of salsa, I covered the casserole with a large can of red enchilada sauce.  I didn't have time to roll the tortillas, so I layered 6 corn tortillas on the bottom, then put some of the cream cheese mixture, then 4 tortillas, then the rest of the cream cheese mixture, then 4 more tortillas and then the cheese and enchilada sauce.  It came out really tasty.

Excellent and easy! I used lowfat cream cheese - and half the amount - low carb wraps & Trader Joe's Double Roasted Salsa. Cooked fresh chicken breast coated with a chicken taco seasoning. Tons of flavor and a little kick - great recipe! Thanks!

Excellent!  Fast and easy!!  I also coated the bottom of the pan with red sauce then put a little on top of the rolled enchiladas BEFORE I put the cheese on.  Also, I mixed in a small can of corn and used corn tortillas to watch the carbs.

We love this recipe. I don't add the pinto beans because my husband doesn't like them - but I usually can substitute refried beans.  And, I started adding some red enchilada sauce for more flavor to the bottom of the pan and some on top.

We enjoyed this very much. I was worried as it seemed rather bland tasting before I put it in the oven but baked up fine. I bought a big can of salsa and poured that on the top with the cheese. Two things I would do differently are to add more veggies and some spicier cheese to give it a lift. However as written it was quite decent.

These were good, but the recipe seems a little off . . . I needed 12 6-inch tortillas instead of 6 because there was so much filling. I also added another cup of salsa to the top of the tortillas and mixed some of the shredded cheese in with the chicken mixture. This tasted good, but there are other recipes I like better.

This was a great starter recipe!!! I love enchiladas... and always wanted to make my own....I followed a lot of the other rater suggestions.... I used black beans instead of pinto also I put some shredded mexican cheese in with the salsa and cream cheese mixture... and a can of green chiles and some taco seasoning mix....I used Drew's organic Salsa medium which was excellent and cut back the cream cheese to 4oz... I used whole wheat tortillas and a can of Enchilada sauce.... poured some sauce on the bottom and before I put the remainder of the cheeses on the top....and baked about 35 mins.... 
I served these with the Catina Pinto Beans also found on this site which I prepared in the crockpot and rice.....
My family just loved this dinner they said it was just as good as if we went out for this in a Mexican Restaurant..!! I had some leftover and my husband asked me to make him a plate for the next day for his lunch!!! I think I may try this without the beans the next time I make it and add some extra onions with the chicken and cheese mixture..... thanx so much for posting this I never would of thought this was soooo  easy to make!!!

I had wanted to make a different enchilada recipe but forgot to buy the can a soup so I ended up making these with some changes.  I reduced the cream cheese to 5oz, threw in a can of green chilies and substituted a sautéed onion for the pinto beans.  I also poured a can of enchilada sauce over the tortillas and under the cheese before baking.  I think they would have been pretty bland without the enchilada sauce.  I would definitely make these again but next time I'd include the pinto beans!

Used thigh meat instead of breast meat; used refried beans instead of pinto beans; used low fat cream cheese; added garlic and onions.  What a great recipe!  It is a keeper!

This was such a GREAT recipe!  Easy and so tasty.  I did do a few things differently, but truly it would have been great even if I did follow the recipe exactly. First, I used the enchilada sauce beneath and on top and when I cooked the chicken, I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin and a pinch of cayenne pepper. To the mixture I added a drained small can of diced green chiles.   I also used fat free cream cheese and reduced fat cheese and there was no way you could tell!! Our household LOVED these....thanks for sharing!

This recipe has become a favorite in our house! I also add enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan. On occassion I throw in a few extra ingredients -- black beans, corn, green chilies. It's a great base recipe so you can have fun mixing it up!

This recipe is great! I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa, and can honestly say I will never use another enchilada recipe again. Thanks!

This recipe is really very good, but it's even better as a starter recipe. I like to play around and make things my own. I ALWAYS use at least a can of enchilada sauce in the pan and in the filling. I cut back on the cream cheese, and add sharp cheese to the mix. I think I'm going to start seasoning the chicken a little more as well, maybe with chili powder. I've never had a complaint about this recipe!

I've made this several times, and it's a winner with my husband and teenage sons. I use leftover Rotisserie Chicken, so the whole dish takes just minutes to prepare, and it's delicious!

Excellent!! Used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and cut back to 6oz. Tossed a taco seasoning packet (cheese flavor) in with the chicken as well as some fresh cilantro. Used enchilada sauce in the pan and on top, but forgot to spray the pan so some of the bottoms stuck, but this was really easy and tasted great!  Served with guac, sour cream and Mexican rice.

My husband loved these. I thought they would be dry, but they were not!  I like saucy stuff, so next time I'll try enchilada sauce like ohters suggested. I just did not have any in the pantry. Also, my picky 3 year old asked for seconds!

This recipe was so tasty. My husband just loved it. I did use a can of enchilada sauce and to kick up the flavor used pepperjack cheese and sprinkled the dish with chili powder prior to baking. I also used a can of seasoned pinto beans. This one is a keeper.

My husband loves this recipe and he is the fussy person I know.  I left out the beans as he doesn't care for them and it was still great. I do use his homemade salsa in it so it is just the right amount of heat for him.

These enchiladas were a hit at a potluck and disappeared quickly!  I took others' advice and coated the bottom of the dish with enchilada sauce (Macayo's) and poured the remainder over the top, and baked them without the foil covering.  The sauce gave them a little bit of a spicier taste, and kept them very moist, too.  I also used low-fat Colby-Jack cheese and whole wheat tortillas, as well as Neufchatel (low-fat cream cheese) for a little bit healthier meal. Great recipe, Kristine!

I was surprised that such an easy dish can be delicious! I really thought that it didn't have enough ingredients to be good. I think this recipe could also be modified to make crab enchiladas.  I loved these!

Yummmm... These are delicious! I have made them 5 or 6 times now and we can't wait for the weather to cool down again to make them. I use reduced fat cream cheese, add 1 can of corn drained and add in some enchalada sauce at the bottom of the pan and over the top before adding the shredded cheese. A big hit in our house. Thank you for a great spin on a classic dish!

I was a bit suspicious if these enchiladas would be juicy enough, the recipe sounded a bit dry to me. They are juicy and very tasty. I used them with left over meat from a barbecue instead of chicken breast - nice and very easy way to "hide" meat that otherwise would  be forgotten in the fridge.

This was fantastic. My husband loved it on a salad the next day (just the filling). I used chicken tenders and boiled them in chicken broth, added green onions and cilantro, and put salsa on top. Wonderful recipe.

This was my first attempt at making enchilada's and they came out great! I love cream cheese which is why I chose this reciepe. I did make some minor adjustment, I left out the pinto beans because I didn't have any and I added sauted peppers and onions.  I also used green salsa instead of regular. It's a great reciepe that can be played around with. I will definately be making these again

I liked this recipe when I made it, but let me tell you--it was sooo much better the next day!  I used black beans instead of pinto beans; that turned out ok.  I also added enchilada sauce to the top before adding cheese and baking.  I highly recommend this addition since it would be really dry otherwise.  I served it with taco rice.  The leftovers (served over the leftover rice) were fantastic!

I did not care for this recipe.  It ended up taking me 1 hour to prepare instead of the 20 minutes as noted because I didn't have the already prepared chicken.  The recipe was easy to make but the taste was blan & and made to much.

This made a very pleasant dinner, Kristine. I understand that when the recipe is named "easy" chicken enchiladas and is so simple to make, I shouldn't expect a gourmet experience. And it was very nice for how easy it was. Does come out a bit dry, but nothing that sour cream and a salad on the side wouldn't fix. I really enjoyed the beans in there. Maybe, when feeling a bit more motivated, one could throw in some onions and peppers with the mixture for a little more diverse texture and that should easily make it a 5 star recipe. But again, good enough as is when feeling lazy and craving Mexican. Thank you.

Ok so I am not talented and ended up layering tortillas, chicken mixture, cheese and we added a small amount of enchilada sauce to the layers. We added black beans and it watered down the mix alittle so I added extra chicken. I baked it covered with foil until it was bubbly and cheese was melted, about an hour. It was excellent! We ate all the leftovers, better the next day! Thanks for this one!

Great enchiladas, esp the next day.  Putting green enchilada sauce over the enchiladas before cooking them makes them even better!  Enjoy!!!

I had left-over chicken and most of the ingredients so I made it. Used black beans and more chicken than called for. Recipe made 8 enchiladas, so I had to use 2 pans. Next time I'll add more cheese, as they stuck to the pan a bit.

Excellent! Very tasty, easy to make, not expensive. Was a big hit. I doubled the recipe and added about 1/2 cup more chicken and it made 21 taco sized enchiladas.

Very quick and simple! The only downfall was that I had a ton of extra filling left over. I even used 8 tortillas, but still had remaining filling. Next time I'd cut the recipe in half. Definitely made well over the 6 that was indicated in the recipe.

These were awesome! The only thing I did different was to put enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and over the top of the enchiladas. I think this made them a bit better. I agree with the people who said this would be great as a dip...we had some leftovers that wouldn't fit in the tortillas and we snacked on that with some chips while dinner was baking. I will DEFINITELY make this again, thank you!

This was a very easy meal that my family really loved.  The easiest chicken enchilada recipe I've ever seen.  The cream cheese was a surprise, but mellowed out the other flavors and pulled them together.

I think this was an excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really great.  You could add some really simple ingredients to spice it up a little more or leave it as it is!  I will definitely make it again.

My husband and I both loved this!  I used some of the subs others posted.  Only 4 oz. of cream cheese, black beans instead of pinto and a small can of Mexicorn (drained) added to the mix.  I also added a bit of cumin and chili powder for flavor.  I used corn tortillas for half as my husband does not like flour. I was able to fill 8 enchiladas.  No enchilada sauce here, we do not like it.  Just cheese on top was awesome for us.
This will be added to the monthly menu for sure.

I used salsa with Boubon in it, and substituted a blend of 4 Mexican cheeses for the Monteray Jack.  It was very good.  The next time, I'm going to use hot instead of medium salsa.

YUMMY!  This was so good and so quick!  Per other suggestions, I only used half of the cream cheese, but I think I may use all of it next time.  I also used taco seasoning, added corn, and used black beans instead of pinto.  I also added salsa to the top as well as the cheese.  Also used whole grain tortillas.  Again, yummy and easy!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make and so yummy! I used canned chicken that I had on hand and topped with jalapenos for added flavor...will definitely make this again and will also try some of the suggestions like using enchilada sauce instead of the salsa...I also made the Apple Enchilada Dessert...I cook for a bunch of guys who travel for construction work and they all just loved it !

5 out of 6 of our family really liked this entree and majority rules so I will be making this again. It seemed a teeny bit dry so I may try the suggestion of adding some enchilada sauce to it. Thanks.

This does NOT taste like traditional enchildadas, which is what I was hoping for. However, the recipe has a good flavor BUT you do need to drastically reduce the amount of cream cheese (I thought 4 ounces was still too much) and I would add cheese to the stuffing mixture as well.

Not bad!~ I think the sauce looked funky.. no one noticed since it's wrapped up. but if the kids had seen it they may not have liked it so well.. i thought the taste was excellent. I used hot homemade salsa so mine was almost spicy enough but i may add green chilies next time around and cover with red sauce before baking.

Decided to try this on one of those "no idea what to make" nights, and it was good!  I left out the pinto beans since I don't like them, but there was still plenty of filling.

Tasty and easy to make or personalize. I used a Chipotle Salsa and marinated the chicken in a quick easy marinade (Worcestershire sauce, cider vinegar, soy sauce,chili powder, garlic, and hot pepper sauce). Will make again!

I made this recipe a couple nights ago and it was great. In the freezer section, Tyson sells fully cooked seasoned breast strips and I used the faijita flavor. I also added spinach to the enchiladas and used the beans as a side dish. The dinner was great.

This was quick, easy, & tasty. I usually have the ingredients needed on hand. I agree with others about using some enchilada sauce on top. Next time that I make this I might had some jalapeño pepper as we do like it spicy.

Not that this recipe needs the 911th review but here goes.  I have made this dozens of times..the first 2 times EXACTLY as written and the enchiladas were very good, but some of the tortillas dried out on the edges and the 8oz of cream overwhelmed the taste of chicken. Yet they were very tasty, good enough to be tinkered with to make it just a touch better. That's why a 4 star rating. 
The changes I made many similar to other reviewers: used 4oz of cream cheese, extra chicken (we do like meat), added small can Mexican corn, 1 can thoroughly rinsed black beans, red enchilada sauce both on the bottom of the pain, as well as on top of the tortillas. Cook covered; add cheese the last 
10 minutes leave uncovered. Served with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa, and sliced black olives on the side. Scrumptious!!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious, my favorite combination as the chef in our house. Everyone loved it, I will be putting this on my menu rotation. Listening to what others said in reviews I did add a little more flavor to the sauce. I added a heaping tsp of chili powder, a half a tsp of cumin and a small can of mild green chilis to the salsa before I combined it with the cream cheese. I also used enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and tops of the enchiladas as others had suggested. This recipe made 10 thick enchiladas.

Thanks for the easy quick recipe. Had a whole bunch of Cilantro Lime Chicken from this site leftover and this made a quick, weeknight dinner for my family. Served with Spanish white rice. My kids even loved it!

I needed a quick dish for a potluck and this was great! Super easy and really tasty. I forgot to pick up enchilada sauce to put in the bottom and drizzle over the top (optional), and it really didn’t need it. Somebody else brought guacamole and that topped it off beautifully! I bought pre-grilled chicken from Trader Joe’s and chopped it up and it couldn’t have been easier to make.

This is such a great recipe!  I've made it four times in the last few months as my family requests it and it's so easy and affordable.  I'm sure the recipe is awesome as is but I make some minor mods based on my preferences:

I use rotisserie chicken and I love the flavor of enchilada sauce so I use that instead of salsa. 

I use a 10 ounce can of the enchilada sauce in with the cream cheese (I use only half a block and it's still plenty rich) and I throw about a half cup of the shredded cheese in there too.  I put about two thirds of the sauce mixture into the chicken and beans for the filling.   

I pour another half can of straight enchilada sauce  into the bottom of the casserole dish and lay each tortilla shell in the bottom of the dish as I build/fill them so the tortillas get coated in the sauce.  I top them with the remaining cheesy sauce mixture and then pile on the rest of the shredded cheese.  Half way through cooking, I drizzle the remaining half can of straight enchilada  sauce on top, finish cooking and then top with chopped green onions.   

I have also made this vegetarian, using just pinto beans,  finely diced onion and the cheesy sauce mixture for the filling.  It's great!

This is a great recipe as is, or as a starting base! I decided to make with ground beef since we had chicken the night before. I’ve got a household of hungry males, and they love leftovers or a frozen meal to heat up when I’m not home, so I tripled the recipe. I’ve kind of spoiled my family with my cooking so I knew this would be too “basic” for them, so I added to it. Since I knew 3x the cream cheese would be too much for them, I only did 2x but got 3 just in case. *Remember, you can always adjust recipes to your liking!* MY TWIST: 1) Cooked the 3 lbs of 82/19% beef and seasoned with a little pink Himalayan salt. Drained and left in sink. 2) Wiped down same pan, cooked 2 of 8 oz cream cheese, 4 cups Pace Picante medium salsa, 4 oz green jalapeños, 7 oz diced green chiles, and 2 of 2.25 sliced black olives. 3) In another strainer I drained 30 oz black beans, 15 oz pinto beans, and 15.25 oz crisp sweet corn. 4) Once cream cheese was fully melted, I added the ground beef, beans and corn. Stir well. This is where you can decide if you need to add more salsa or cream cheese. 5) I blended two cups of salsa in electric blender. Or, you can just use enchiladas sauce. 6) Put 1/2 blended salsa at bottom of 8x8 and 9x13 pan. 6) Made the enchiladas fat and happy! Leaving about 1 1/2 cup meat sauce aside. 7) 9x13 I put 8 in a row with 2 on side, 8x8 4 in a row with 1 on the side. 8) Add the saved meat sauce on top, then cheese then sprinkle blended salsa. 9) Cover n bake!

Great recipe as a starting point.  I followed others recommendations.  Added onion, fresh corn, one can of green Chile’s.  Used enchilada sauce instead of salsa, and spread some in then bottom of the dish as well as making sure all the CORN tortillas were well coated to prevent drying.  Next time I’ll also add a bit of cumin.  And there will be a next time.

Very good, and very simple.  My 9 year old that doesn't like chicken loves this. To make it even more simple pick up the pre- shredded rotisserie chicken at Costco.  It can't get much easier!!

Excellent!  I made it as written but reduced the cream cheese to 4 oz.  and put enchilada sauce on bottom of pan and over enchiladas before the cheese.  I thought 2 cups of cheese sprinkled over top was a bit much, next time I will try with half.  Thanks for the recipe!

I will definitely make this again. I followed some other suggestions and added enchilada sauce on bottom and top. I added a can of mild green chiles to the cream cheese mixture. I also used a rotisserie chicken for ease. I used lowfat cream cheese. I did use hot salsa which was a bit too spicy for my kiddos so will use mild next time but other than that everyone loved it. Easy peasy!

Great recipe! Very quick and delicious. I used picante instead of salsa because its all we had on hand. I also followed another reviewer’s  advice to put enchilada sauce on the bottom of  the pan and pour over the rolled enchiladas before adding the cheese. I made half of them with chicken, and half with ground beef.  The whole family loved it, which is saying a lot at my house!

These were excellent! The only change I made based on the reviews was to halve the cream cheese and add enchilada sauce. Chicken enchiladas are one of my boyfriend’s favorite dishes, this was my first time making them and he loved it! Thanks for sharing, I’ll be making this again for sure.

These were really yummy but I doctored the base recipe up a bit and made this into a casserole. 
I used medium salsa and added a can of drained black beans and a can of drained green chiles/tomatoes to the salsa/cream cheese mixture.  I chopped the chicken up a bit and after I added it to the sauce mix, I stirred in taco seasoning mix-about 1/2 to  2/3 (to taste) of an envelope.  I cooked two Uncle Ben’s Spanish rice  containers and put the Spanish rice  in a 13 x 9 pan. I spooned a couple of ladles of enchilada sauce over it and mixed it up a bit. I then filled the tortillas and put them on top. I got 8 in the pan. I ladled a little more enchilada sauce on each enchilada  then topped it with shredded Mexican cheese. I baked it for about 40 min since I added the rice layer on the bottom.  The chicken mixture  made two 13 x9 pans. Delicious!!

The recipe as written needs a little added to give it better flavor. If you add some of your own ideas to this I think it can be a 4-5.

Turned out great!  I added some seasoning to the chicken with some butter when I cooked it. Added enchilada sauce over top and then waited to add the whole bag of cheese on top until the last eight minutes. Next time I will cook at a higher temp like 400 for 45 minutes and shred the chicken instead of just cutting it. Corn would be good to add. Thanks.

I love this recipe.  It is so easy to make.  However, I did make some changes.  I prefer the black beans to the pinto beans.  I also added some sliced black olives to the filling.  I chose to top the enchiladas with a green enchilada sauce, the cheese (I added a little queso fresco) and some more sliced olives.  Turned out delicious.

This was easy and delicious! I used only 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and it was plenty for us. The next day, I warmed it up in the oven uncovered and found the texture to be better as it was a little too soggy the first time.

This was perfect. We drenched it in enchilada sauce since we prefer it that way, but this was a great recipe to make without too much prep or time involved.

This recipe was super easy & quick to make. I also didn’t have salsa so i used enchiladas sauce i found in the cabinet. Paired this meal with Spanish rice & red beans. Everything was done in 30minutes

5 stars for ease and 4 stars for taste.  I made it a little healthier by increasing the chicken and decreasing the cheddar cheese.  We added lots of healthy toppings/sides...tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, and corn.

Was a hit. Like everyone else, I did 4 oz cream cheese instead of 8 and I added diced green chilies into the mixture. I baked for 20 minutes and then added shredded cheese for the last 10 minutes. I also did two batches and did one batch with chicken and the other with ground meat.

i will say i tweaked it.  but the 4 stars is based on adding the cream cheese to the enchilada sauce.  that gave it a great smooth cheesiness.  i’m sure it would have been great if i followed it to tee.  just changed by what i had in hand.

This was scrumptious!! My fiancé and I have a pretty short list of go to dinners we regularly make, and this has definitely been added to it! It made plenty for 2 meals for us and we both loved it!! The only thing I have to say is, due to personal preference I would add onion into the mix and use black beans instead of pinto beans. Also we used enchilada sauce on both the bottom of the pan and the top of them. But this is definitely amazing as it!!

Came out so good! I doubled the recipe so I could have plenty of left overs. However I halved the cream cheese like several others have suggested. I also used spicy enchilada sauce (from the can) to cover the bottom of the baking dishes and also to drizzle on top of the enchiladas before layering with the cheese.  The flavor was amazing! Ate it with a side of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sour cream, and some Spanish rice. Definitely hit the spot since I was craving Mexican food! And super easy to make. Will definitely make this again. (P.S. this recipe never said how to cook the chicken— so I poached 3 chicken breasts in chicken broth for about 20 minutes at low heat and they came out moist and were easy to shred/chop for this recipe).

I liked it. Even my picky eater liked it. He picked out the beans though. A little too much sauce for my personal taste but I can fix that next time.

Easy and very good.  you could tweak to your own tastes, spicier, milder etc., but we loved it as is.  Serviced with sour cream and a little guacamole.  It is a keeper.

My family loves this recipe! I've made it a couple different ways now. 1st time was the base recipe except I spiced it up a bit more and added some peppers, onions, black beans and a little hot sauce. I also only had medium cheddar and a little mozza cheese so I just used that in a pinch. Didn't have quite enough cream cheese in my fridge but that was fine too, still tasted amazing! I couldn't stop eating the filling as I rolled them, lol (used burrito wraps because that's all I had, worked fine just cut them in half after baking so they're easier to serve). Second time I bought a family size bag of Bird's Eye fajita dinner and cooked it as the package said and then added a can each of corn, black and pinto beans, a little salsa and the cream cheese. Used shredded mexican cheese blend from kroger and whole wheat taco tortillas. Last but not least after it was baked I ripped up some fresh cilantro on top of everything, it was SO GOOD! Such an easy, yummy and pretty quick meal that you can change up as much as you want! Love it!

This dish came out really good. I actually combined this recipe with another one and I was amazed how delicious it turned out. Before adding cream cheese I sauteed onions and jalapenos and then adding rest of the ingredients. I did add a bit of taco seasoning and tapatio sauce (for that little kick). On the baking dish I added a mix of Red and Green Enchilada sauce. Also, you can use the Mexican Blend Cheese so you have all different types of cheese on top and inside the enchilada.

This easy enchiladas recipe is very good. My wife said it is one of the best she has had. I used green salsa and also a can of red enchiladas sauce. I added a can of green chilies. I included cheese inside of the enchiladas.

Great quick and easy recipe!  I didn’t read the directions closely enough and just softened the cream cheese and mixed it with the salsa instead of cooking it in the sauce pan. I did everything else as directed.  They turned out great!  We like them on the crispy side and topped with red enchilada sauce.  Delicious!

This was pretty good, but I would shred the chicken next time. It still seemed like it was missing something, but the creamy sauce was quite tasty.

Turned out amazing! I made it as meal prep for my husband and I. I boiled the chicken and used black beans rather than pinto.

This is my go-to enchilada recipe with just a few adjustments. And I’m not a tortilla snob so it doesn’t really matter to me if it’s used with corn or flour tortillas. I use what I have on hand. So I use half a cup of salsa and half a cup of enchilada sauce. I also use refried beans instead of whole beans and I add cheese to each before I roll them up. I then poor enchilada sauce on top and sprinkle with cheese, usually cheddar. They are always good and requested by my husband and his friends who have come over for dinner.  Enjoy!

These were the bar-none bomb diggity. However! I love green enchilada sauce so we mixed some in to the cream cheese/salsa sauce and then poured the rest on top of them prior to baking. Made for a delish addition, and these are definitely super, SUPER easy to make. Highly recommended.

Simple and delicious.  Halved the cream cheese as recommended and added a small can of green chilies.  If you like spice use a hot salsa as the heat is tamed when you use the cream cheese.

I followed recipe, except used enchilada sauce over and under the enchiladas, as some suggested.  Flavor fine,  but tortillas more or less melted.  Making mushy mess.  Think would have worked better to put sauce on top only or toasted tortillas.

I used this as a burrito mixture. My plan was to roll em all and put em on the grill for a minute to crisp up just a little but I ran outta energy and just let everyone make their own lol. Thanks for the recipe love it and will definitely use it again!!

I have made this several times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written. My husband and I really like these. The second time I used black beans, only because I was out of pinto beans. Still delish.   So easy too. Thank you for this recipe.

Thanks to other reviewers, I made a couple of adjustments...used 4 oz instead of 8 for filling.  I also used enchilada sauce (large can:  I made a double recipe)  I put a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and also put some on a dinner sized plate and dipped both sides of each tortilla in that sauce.  Also put sauce on top of enchiladas.  A batch was for someone who'd just had a baby so I didn't put the diced green chilies in.  I'll probably do that next time.

These are so-so.  It wish all the 5 star ratings on this site were reserved for things that are truly over-the-top excellent.  Tough to sort through all these extremely high ratings to find the hidden gems.  The bonus of these is that they are easy to throw together very quickly.  The negative...they are extremely high in fat with the cream cheese/cheese topping and extremely high in sodium.  Not one for the regular routine, for sure.

I should have used flour tortilla instead of corn tortilla. I thought it would be economical to use the corn tortilla left from making tacos, but it was really hard putting the ingredients in it to bake. It kept breaking apart. Make sure to buy bigger tortillas.

Good and easy. I used green sauce because that’s all I had. Poured a little into the 9x13 instead of oil. I didn’t find it necessary to prep the tortillas. They rolled nicely without the extra warming steps. Topped all with more green sauce and cheese before baking. Also good with rinsed black beans instead of pintos.

I made this as written and it was good but I didn’t like the beans in it. I loved it when I tweaked it the second time I made it. Second time: I slow cooked the chicken and than I shredded it before adding it into the salsa and cream cheese. I skipped the beans. It’s one of our go to favorite meals! I recommend it.

I made this pretty much to the receipe but I spread on top something different about the last 15 minutes of baking, cheddar cheese, green enchilada sauce, and black olives. I served these with the typical condiments, shreaded lettuce, diced tomatoes, mild salsa, spanish rice, refried beans, and sour cream. Everyone thought the enchiladas were delicious.

Super easy and delicious! I tried another enchilada recipe that was a lot more complicated and didn’t taste as good as this one!  This one is a keeper! As others suggested, I used enchilada sauce, and put some on the bottom of the dish and on top before sprinkling the cheese.  I used a whole roasted chicken, so the 8oz cream cheese was enough. I also added in about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese - yum!

These were sloppy, soggy, and a little too bland for me. I added green chilies and enchilada sauce and it still didn’t cut it. I will return to my stand by enchilada recipe.

So, I’m on low carb and didn’t want to blow it. So instead of trying to figure out a low carb tortilla, I stuffed this mixture into bell peppers(minus beans), topped with cheese and green sauce... this may be my new diet dish. It was fabulous.

Very tasty easy recipe.  Like other reviewers I cut the cream cheese in half and added green chilies for a little more bite.  Will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly per the recipe except for adding just a small amount of white enchilada sauce to the bottom of the dish prior to baking. There were only 3 of us, but we ended up with zero left overs. Big props to the original poster. This is now a staple in the recipe book. Thank you!!!

Big hit with the kids and very easy to make.  Toppings should be added to recipe list (tomatoes, sour cream, green onion).

Really good and really easy.  I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the salsa.  I also poured 1/2-3/4 can of enchilada sauce on as well.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I used fresh pheasant cut in small pieces and par boiled in spiced water. I also used less cream cheese, enchilada sauce and a scoop of of LaVictoria green salsa.

I have made this many times now, but alas I did make a few changes. (I know I hate it when people do that, but I read some reviews and these made sense.) 
I added 1 can of Rotel  to the cream cheese. To the chicken I added a dash of pepper, a couple splashes of Frank's sauce,  diced jalapenos instead of chilies, and a handful of mozzarella.  No beans (No one wanted).  I then used corn tortillas, and placed 1/4 can of enchilada sauce on the bottom of pan, then topped the rolled tortillas with the other 3/4 of the can before topping with cheese and baking.  Even people who say they hated enchiladas were eating them.  They come out great every time.

This has been a big hit amongst a handful of picky people. Made it as directed the first time and it was great. 2nd time I left out the beans (I don't like pinto beans) and added a couple tablespoons of 505 Green Chili sauce to give it a little kick.

Easy and filling, which is great for a mid week meal. Putting the cheese on when it goes in the oven just results in burned crispy cheese, so I now wait until the last 10 minutes of baking to put the cheese on top.

A winner.  Added the beans as directed.  I know many used refried beans, and I was a little hesitant about using whole pintos, but I'm glad I did.  The texture added a lot to the final product.  This is a different enchilada, which is nice for a change of pace.  As is true with most enchiladas, it's very adaptable.  

I followed the advice of others and put a layer of green enchilada sauce on the bottom, and added another layer on top, under the cheese.  Really makes a difference.

I used this recipe as my inspiration and changed only a few things.  I used 4oz of the cream cheese, used original Rotel instead of the salsa and used 1 cup of the birdseye frozen southwest blend; corn, black beans, pablano pepper, and onions instead of the pinto beans.  I also made a pkg of Lawry's enchilada sauce mix to use as well.   I mixed everything according to the recipe and dipped corn tortillas into the enchilada sauce and rolled them with the filling mixture.  Delicious!   Thanks for the inspiration!

Easy to make, & pretty good.  We added extra diced onions & jalapeños to the cream cheese mixture.  Other than that we followed the recipe.  I have never had beans in my enchiladas before, but they didn't take away from the other ingredients.  Next time we will use a little more salsa.  We did cover them with one can of enchilada sauce before baking.

Super easy and flavorful. I modified it slightly because of ingredients on hand: I mixed softened cream cheese with canned spicy tomatoes and added Hatch jalapenos (frozen from Trader Joe's). I only mixed these in a bowl. Nor did  I add the chicken or beans to the cream cheese filling but kept these items separate for layering.  Additionally I used Hatch's green enchilada sauce and added it to the shredded chicken to ensure juiciness and flavor. Instead of rolling enchiladas, I layered the ingredients: corn tortillas (not cooked), Hatch green enchilada sauce, refried beans, the cream cheese mixture, shredded chicken topped with more enchilada sauce, repeat. It made 2 full layers.  I didn't use any shredded cheese and it was moist and amazing. Baked it for 25 minutes and hubby is asking for it again. We both loved it!

This recipe was super simple and delish. I used half amount of cream cheese since I saw other reviews which were recommending to use only half of this. I added red enchilada sauce this gave the enchiladas a boost in flavor.

I made this without the pinto beans; I also put chicken breasts in the crock pot while at work so I could have pulled chicken to use.  The enchiladas are fantastic right out of the oven, and make a fantastic leftovers-for-lunch meal.  My daughter took one to camp cold and she loved it.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now and EVERYONE loves it. The recipe as is, is wonderful! But I also made some changes adding corn, black beans rotel, and chilies not because the original is bad but rather to enhance what there is. I also use red enchilada sauce at the bottom of the pan and on top and then add mexican blend cheese. I use corn tortilla and drop them in hot heavy cream before stuffing. An amazing yummy and easy meal to make!!! Thanks

This is a keeper! The only thing I did different was I used black beans, didn't have pintos. Then I poured enchilada sauce over the top and sprinkled with cheese before baking, yummy! ??

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site! They are delicious as written but I have experimented with minor changes and seasoned to taste. They are equally delicious with either flour or corn tortillas and it's great to have that gluten free option for certain guests. I like to shred the cooked chicken with forks instead having chopped chunks in my tortillas. I also spread the bottom of the baking dish with red enchilada sauce before placing the tortillas in it and then drizzle more sauce on top with extra cheese. It keeps it more moist. And I dice spinach leaves and add it to the filling. When doubling the recipe, I like to add one can black beans and one can of the pinto beans. These are delicious any way you choose!

This was very good!  The only change that I made was putting a red enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and then adding more to the top of the enchiladas before adding the cheese.  I also made a few with corn tortillas because my husband prefers corn over flour tortillas.  I do believe that using a good salsa that you like to eat with chips as opposed to a cheap brand that sometimes gets purchased for a recipe makes a HUGE difference. I used our favorite salsa and thought it was most complimentary to the recipe. FYI, the leftovers were even better the next day,

I can't believe how tasty this was, compared to how easy it is to make.  I did what another reviewer suggested and added  a can of enchilada sauce to the recipe, pouring half on the bottom of the pan, and the remaining half on top before adding the cheese.  

Delicious!   I will be making this a LOT.

This was very good. I used half enchilada sauce and half salsa. I also used corn tortillas since flour tortillas get too soggy.  I didn't put the cheese on top until the last 5 minutes.  I also added chopped onion to the top before baking. I will definitely make again.

This was a terrific, easy weeknight meal. It came together quickly and was delicious.  The entire family enjoyed it. I did use the recommendations of other reviewers and used 4 oz of cream cheese, 3/4 cup of salsa, and using rotisserie chicken to make it even easier.  I didn't have any pinto beans, but that didn't damper our enjoyment, in fact, I think my family may have enjoyed it more without the beans. Oh, and I followed some other reviewers recommendations to use enchilada sauce on the bottom of my pan and again on top of the enchiladas before I covered with cheese for baking. YUM.

Super easy and fun to make! I made two servings of this recipe - one with black beans and red enchilada sauce and one with pinto beans and green enchilada sauce. I also added green chilies to the salsa/cream cheese/chicken mixture. Served with rice on the side. Delicious and everybody loved it!

These enchiladas were so good, everybody said they really liked them. I should have doubled the recipe. I did add a can of green chiles and half the amount of cream cheese, and a can of enchilada sauce on top.

4 stars as is, but this was a 5 star recipe with some tweaks. I used corn tortillas instead of flour, halved the cream cheese, used a rotisserie chicken, used Frontera chipotle salsa and topped with two packets of Frontera red enchilada sauce. It was amazing!

Very good.  I too used enchilada sauce.  This is an easy recipe and easy to substitute items.  I substituted the chicken with venison burger, turned out delicious!

Nice, easy way to make enchiladas. I did change a few things. One, I used corn tortillas. Two, I cooked my chicken breasts in the slow cooker, seasoned with cumin, garlic, chili powder, pepper, and a some green chili sauce. I shredded the chicken after about four hours, cooked two hours more on low. I used low fat cream cheese, another can of green enchilada sauce. I mixed them together, with a few more of the same spices I used on the chicken.  I didn't add the beans to the enchilada, I just put them on the side. Very delicious!

I didn't have any cream cheese, but used shredded  quesadilla cheese which melts well! Added some cumin, and used black beans. Poured som salsa on top when I baked as well. It was very flavorful! I froze some as well!! It was great because I had ingredients on hand! Will make again!

This was an easy quick recipe that was delicious even left over. I tried to make my recipe a bit healthier by substituting the following: 
-7 oz of 2% Fage instead of cream cheese
-whole wheat tortillas instead of white
-organic pinto beans (significantly less sodium) 
-served on a bed of lettuce
YUM!

Smoothed out the salsa with the food processor and got the kiddos to eat it too!  Used rotisserie chicken breast and it was awesome!  The filling is delicious as a dip for tortilla chips too....

These enchiladas were great!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the tortillas.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  They were excellent.  The filling is so simple, yet they taste better than some of the more tedious recipes I've used for chicken enchiladas. I assembled them ahead of time, and stored them in the refrigerator until time to bake.  I'll definitely make these again!

I have made this recipe several times. Every time I make this for company, I get requests for the recipe. I adjust it to what I have on hand and normally just use left over chicken. (normally left over roasted chicken which adjusts the flavor due to different seasonings.) Definitely a recipe I would recommend and have shared many times as it is an easy recipe to make adjustments to, adding individuality.

Love how easy and relatively cheap it is to put together. It'll last you a long time, too. For those complaining about it being flour instead of corn tortillas...just go easy on the author and simply switch them out. For best results I say make sure you get a good quality salsa, not the cheap stuff. That extra cilantro/garlic will add a lot.

Although this recipe was easy and fairly quick to prepare, I thought (and my family agreed) that the outcome wasn't great.   The enchiladas were bland, and we didn't like taste and texture of the beans.

I sliced the chicken breast into thin pieces and sautéed it with some southwest seasoning then removed the chicken from the skillet.  I substituted enchilada sauce for the salsa and cut the cream cheese up into pieces to help it melt.  I added the chicken and beans to the mixture and put it inside corn tortillas.  As mentioned previously I put a little enchilada sauce in the baking dish before adding the stuffed tortillas then poured some more enchilada sauce over the entire batch and bake loosely covered for 25 minutes adding the cheddar jack cheese to bake for an additional 5 minutes.

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make. I use fat-free cream cheese and fresh cilantro as well as 2 cans of enchilada sauce.

Modified the cream cheese to only 4 oz - which was plenty. Next time I will put enchilada sauce on top as well. Easy & Delish!

I have made this three times now. Once I pureed the beans thinking that my kids then would like it, but that didn't work out very well whatsoever.  I've added sauteed peppers and onions to it and it's always been good.

Pleasantly surprised! I threw this together over the weekend and really enjoyed it. My girlfriend likes to get the jalapeno cream sauce from taco bell and we finally realized how it's made. Instead of salsa, we used red enchilada sauce. It taste very similar to the taco bell jalapeno cream sauce after melting down the cream cheese. Yummy, easy, will make again.

I followed the directions exactly and the hubs said the recipe is a keeper.  I think I will try the addition of enchilada sauce next time so that it is a little more moist, but it was very flavorful without it.

I'm not a good cook but. The family loved it. Great recipe. I didn't want to role the individual enchiladas so I made a lasagna with the mixture and used tortillas. And a lot of cheese.

Super easy, super delicious. I did add enchilada sauce per another reviewers's suggestion. It added the right amount of heat without being overwhelming & the tortillas did not get dried out. This has been put into my dinner rotation. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent base recipe. I made a few tweaks though. I used black beans instead of pinto, added green chiles as recommended in other reviews, added yellow rice, poured enchilada sauce on and put the cheese on halfway through baking, and use corn tortillas instead of flour to give it a more authentic taste. Will definitely make this again. Recipe made more than 6 enchiladas. I had doubled it thinking I'd get 12, ended up with 24 enchiladas all together. Leftovers tasted even better the next day! I definitely want to follow the recipe next time and use flour tortillas I think they'll be even better!

I saw this recipe and I thought I have to try this. However, I did make a few adjustment as recommended by a couple of other reviewers:
1) I used about 5 ozs  of cream cheese, instead of the full 8 ozs. 
2) Omitted the pinto beans
3) Used corn tortillas instead of flour
4) Used 1/2 cup salsa and 1/2 cup enchilada sauce (instead of 1cup of only salsa)
5) poured a layer of enchilada sauce in bottom of baking dish before placing in enchiladas
Also for convenience, I  decided to use Oscar Myer precooked Southwest Chicken Strips mixed with a can of Tyson Grilled Premium Chicken. My family and I loved this dish. I think the recommendation of corn tortillas really made it taste a little more authentic. This dish will definitely be added to my dinner rotation menu. Simple, quick and delicious!

My husband and I found this delicious. I did as other reviews suggested, added green chilies, used suggested flour tortillas. I also substituted borracho beans for the suggested pinto bean into the chicken mix, yum.  Topped with sour cream & guacamole served with a crunchy side salad. My mix made more than 6 enchiladas, made close to a dozen which was great.  I give this five stars. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I loved this dish for the ease of preparation. After reading some of the reviews I did add some green chilies, cilantro, pico del gallo and cheese in the enchiladas. I used green enchilada sauce and sharp cheddar on top. We had Mexican rice with this and my DH was very happy. We will be having this one on a regular basis.

These came out delicious.  I did not have packaged tortillas, so I made homemade ones, which added a fresh taste I think.  Also, did not have salsa, so used enchilada sauce mixed with a little chili sauce, and had no pinto beans, so used fava beans--still came out well.  I also put some enchilada sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish as suggested, and before putting cheese over entree, covered with some enchilada sauce.  I used a tip someone gave me and sprayed the Reynolds wrap with Pam so the cheese would not stick to wrap while baking.  When I make again, will still use enchilada sauce vs. salsa, as I am not a big fan of salsa, but would like to use pinto beans--although the fava beans turned out to be a good substitute.

Made it exactly as stated and loved it!!  Super easy and even though my husband doesn't like cream cheese, he loved it too!  I had some leftover sauce and chicken so I made my daughters over rice.  Perfect as well!  Thanks for the easy, great recipe.

It was delicious!! I used corn tortillas instead of flour. When trying to roll them up,  they just kept ripping in half. So finally I just put one layer of the tortillas down in the pan,  then put all of the mix on top,  then put another layer of tortillas on top of that and then sprinkled it (heavily ) with cheese. Same great taste!

Another reviewer said enchiladas are not made with flour tortillas, but I have used flour for years. Corn is also good but I prefer flour. This was a great recipe, but I thought it would be a little dry, so I mixed a can of chicken soup with some stock, and poured it on the bottom and top, before the cheese. Also zipped the flavor up a notch with green chilis.

I sautéed onions before adding the cream cheese & salsa. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup as well as adding some taco seasoning to the chicken before it went in the mix.  I happen to have a can of enchilada sauce so I put that over the enchiladas before the cheese. I didn't remove anything from the original recipe only added stuff. My incredibly picky son asked for seconds! That NEVER happens!!!

I used corn tortillas, and they they fell apart.  I'm going to try flour tortillas next time.  I also used Mexican cheese instead of Colby-Jack.  Also, the salsa was a little too spicy for my daughter, but I will definitely make these again!

So easy and tasty! Additionally, the leftovers freeze well are delicious reheated. Just pop them in the oven and heat. You can sprinkle a little more cheese on Top and put under the broiler......really tasty!!!!

Fantastic, easy, family friendly recipie.  I used leftover Costco rotisserie chicken and whole grain tortillas and followed the directions exactly.  Serve them with a simple green salad and you've got a healthy dinner! Will definitely make this again.

Easy recipe and very good. It was a bit on the rich side, so next time I'll use half the amount of cream cheese and make that low fat. Used red enchilada sauce and added a can of diced green chiles. I might try it with green enchilada sauce next time.

This recipe was GREAT and very easy to make. I added enchilada sauce to the recipe. I put a small coating on the bottom of the pan and poured the rest over the top of the enchiladas and then put the cheese on top.

Mmm this was great. I made a lot of mods to it and this was my first time making enchiladas. Drained and rinsed beans pretty well. Had no cream chesse so I instead added some sour cream maybe 1/3 cup, some of my friends homemade canned pasta sauce (pretty thin), and some of his picante sauce, not very much of either, especially pasta sauce, in a pan with the chicken (I used 1/2 rotisserie chcken) and beans, on medium-low after heating it on medium high. Put green enchilada sauce on top with some cheese, not too much, added some green onions and cilantro on top as well as some permeson cheese.

Very good basic recipe, but it needs more flavor. I first lightly sauté a cup of onion and a cup of green pepper with a couple of cloves of chopped garlic. Then add 1 TBSP each of cumin and chile power to the salsa/cheese mixture. Finally, top with sliced jalapeños for a bit of zing.

This was better than I expected! Very tasty and a nice change from the same old tacos and fajitas. I only used 1/2 the package of cream cheese and added a bit more salsa; I also marinated and baked the chicken breasts in taco seasoning, and added corn to the chicken mixture. It made 7 enchiladas, using the large tortillas. I served it with Spanish rice. Everyone loved it! Thanks for posting such a great recipe :)

My husband's favorite meal is enchiladas, so I wanted to try making them for the first time.  He said that these were better than his mom's! I cut the cream cheese in half to 4oz and added half a can of diced green chiles.  I used low fat cream cheese and lowfat shredded Mexican cheese - it was very good that way and doesn't need the full-fat cheese.  2cups of cheese is a lot - I will go down to 1.5 cups next time.  I used precooked end chicken breasts from the grocery store deli counter.  They were big chicken breasts and I used 1.5 of them to make 8 enchiladas.  I also used a can of enchilada sauce.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with olive oil, then coated it with a little enchilada sauce - put the enchiladas in, and then coated them well with the rest of the enchilada sauce.  I baked for 15 minutes with the foil in, then added the cheese and baked for 10 min with the foil on, then baked for 5 minutes with foil off.  Served with sour cream on top.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was very easy to adapt. I added more salsa and a little soft white cheese to extend out the sauce since I had more chicken than sauce. We added fewer beans and everyone liked it. It was great as leftovers, too, according to my testers. Use good salsa and it's even better.

Great recipe, and so easy.  I happened to use 8" tortillas and was able to fill 10 of them in my 9x13 pan. Used low fat cream cheese and 2% milk Mexican blend cheese for the topping.  Two large chicken breasts were more than enough.  Added a little garlic powder to the filling, along with 1/2 can green chilies and a couple shakes of Chipotle Tabasco sauce for a little zing.  Also used a can of red enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and top, as suggested, and these were excellent.  Next time, might try with green enchilada sauce, a diced chipotle pepper with a little adobo sauce, and jack cheese.

These were very good! My family loved them. My baby can not eat cheese so I had to make 2 pans, one that followed the recipe and a pan that substituted the cream cheese for cream of chicken soup and that was still good and they are very quick to make. Overall this is a wonderful recipe that I will use over and over.

This is a great recipe. I changed it up a little and my husband LOVE it. Instead of Pinto beans I used a can of refried beans and instead of cream cheese I used 8oz of velveta. I used 1 can of drained rotel tomatos and a 1/2 cup of Chipotle hotsauce. This is a great simple recipe.

Did this as written except for putting some sauce over the top, felt it might be dryer than we like. It was good but as others mentioned a little too rich for our taste, would cut down on the cream cheese and increase the salsa next time. Also think it would be good with green onions and olives in the mixture. We easy and quick and will use it again.

This was really good and so easy to make.  After reading the reviews, I made the following changes.  1.  used 4 oz of low fat cream cheese.  2.  used 1/2 jar salsa in the heated mixture and reserved  1/2 for the bottom of casserole dish and to top the enchilada's off (to avoid them drying out or hardening).  3.  added cooked corn from 1 ear.  4.  added canned chili peppers.  5.  added cilantro.  6. used Costco rotisserie chicken.  7. Trader Joe's lite mexican blend cheese.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add some heat with jalapeño's.

This tasted pretty good.  However, even though I only used 4oz of cream cheese, my filling was still a little too wet.  I'll make it again and add a bit more chicken next time (or add the sauce to the meat until it reaches the desired consistency, and discard the excess).  I used 10" wraps and the filling made four enchiladas.  Definitely easier than my usual recipe.

The recipe serves six and calls for 6 six-inch tortillas, but it took 13 tortillas to fill. Not sure what happened (maybe the 7 loaves/7 fishes syndrome kicked in). I would suggest that you remove the chicken filling from the heat and let cool a few minutes before filling the tortilla bread (or else Yowch). Another suggestion: Your choice of salsa will MAKE or BREAK this recipe. Get a good salsa (and pay more than a dollar for it)! I used a locally made chipotle salsa (and paid $6 for the jar). I also used a red chile enchilada sauce to keep the outside colorful and flavorful. I served my enchiladas with rice and a green garden salad consisting of romaine lettuce, pico de gallo, and black olives. An easy and quick to put together recipe that made a tasty dinner!

Added 1/4 tsp. each of cumin and chipotle powder to cream cheese mixture.  Put a thin layer of salsa on bottom and another thin layer on top.  This is a very enjoyable dish!

Oh my freaking goodness these are amazing!! I'm a new cook so I'm always searching for tasty simple dishes and this tastes like I put a lot more effort in than I did! Lol. Subbed some things in due to a semi-empty pantry (i.e. tomato sauce for salsa, sour cream for cream cheese + added enchilada sauce) and it was still bomb. Can't wait to impress people (other than the boyfriend) with this recipe!!

these were delicious and super easy to make! It was a great way to use leftovers and was extremely tasty. I used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese and whole wheat tortillas to try to 'lighten' it up a little.

Really good and easy to make.  Instead of plain cooked chicken, I baked up some chicken seasoned with cumin and lime juice.  I also used the suggestion of halving the cream cheese (I used neufatchel instead), and I put half a can of red enchilada sauce on the bottom, and the other half on the top.  Delicious!

I think that one could do a hundred things to this recipe , but it just changes it to a different Enchilada recipe.  It simple, quick, only a few ingredients, and it is yummy just the way it is.

I followed this recipe almost exactly except i only used 3/4 of the 8 oz cream cheese and a little extra salsa and i added corn. I put a thin layer of salsa just to wet the tortillas so they wouldn't dry out. As a working mom i found this to be very doable after a 10 hr workday, and that's hard to find!

Easy and basic--many people will want to add some oomph. Instead, I dip flour tortillas into enchilada sauce, and then make a basic filling of 1/2 pkg cream cheese and 1/2 pt of sour cream (melted on the stove together so I can really mix them), and mix that with 2 cups of shredded chicken. Put the filling into the dipped tortillas. That's the basic, delicious but bland start. Then everyone can add a spoonfull of their favorite toppings before rolling the enchiladas. Add guacamole, or salsa, or chilies to add a bit of zip. If you want even more flavor, you can add a bit of seasoning to the cream cheese/sour cream mix. Roll the enchiladas and place in a baking dish seam side down, top with some shredded colby jack or pepper jack cheese, cover in foil or a lid, and bake at 325 for 25 mins. SOoo good and it's a great recipe where everyone can customize their own jut a bit.

Delicious! Like others suggested, I cut the cream cheese in half- I think the whole pack would be a bit much. I might try with reduced fat cream cheese next time too. I had extra salsa, so I covered the enchiladas with that and then covered with cheese. I didn't have any leftover cooked chicken, so I stir fried some with onions, garlic, and a bit of taco seasoning before adding to salsa/cream cheese mixture.

Used green chile enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and 2 cans of Kirkland chicken, put half of the cheese (cheddar because that was what I had) in the enchiladas and half on top, and the hubby and I loved them. Unfortunately the kids did not, but hope their tastes "grown into them!" Thanks for a yum and simple dinner!

Honestly, if it weren't so easy I would have given it 2 stars. I figure being quick has to count for something .  I followed the recipe to the letter in order to be fair. The consistency of the filling was just gross with the cream cheese. Will not make again. Sorry.

Delicious! Like others, I coated the bottom of the pan with enchilada sauce and poured over the top under the cheese. I also mashed half the pinto beans with a fork to make a creamier sauce.

I didn't care for these enchiladas, mainly because they didn't taste like Mexican food at all.  Maybe its because I live in Texas so I'm spoiled when it comes to good mexican food....

Just made this, had to review... I admit it, I licked the plate. The ONLY change I made was to skip the cheddar cheese on top and put sauce on top instead (nuked it because my family runs on 5 schedules). Delicious. If the kids are lucky, there will be some left when they get home.

These are creamy, rich and delicious.  We used homemade salsa which added some great flavor.  We also used flour tortillas instead of corn - 7 instead of 6 because it made so much filling.  Very good served with black beans and guacamole!

This was a very good recipe. The only thing I would do different,I would  add some sauce on the bottom of the pan first. I used Wheat tortillas and they absorbed more liquid.I will be making these many times. Thanks

I made this for my family and added just a bit of red enchilada sauce to the bottom before putting the enchiladas in the casserole dish and used the rest of the sauce for the top.  Sprinkled with plenty of cheese the last 5 minutes while uncovered.  We liked the flavor, but will definitely use corn tortillas next time as the flour ones turned terribly mushy.

4 stars as written, still very good. The second time I made some changes to make it 5 stars. I made a sour cream enchilada sauce and seasoned the chicken with fajita seasoning. Baked it in the sauce topped with a mexi-cheese blend. Will make more than 6 unless you stuff them. Great recipe!

Quick prep time, easy to make and tastes good!  I prefer corn tortillas  and sometimes add enchilada sauce on top if I have it on hand.  I've added corn to the mixture as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe and the video was super helpful! I tweaked the recipe in accordance with some of the reviews. I added a can of green chilies to the filling, and I also used a can of enchilada sauce, 1/2 on the bottom of the pan and the other half on top of the enchiladas before I added the cheese. My husband is really into spicy food so next time I plan on adding some jalapeños to the filling instead of the chillies.

I made these AMAZING enchiladas for supper last night.
They are super easy and so quick. 
I have a 10 month old so quick is very important! 
I used flower tortillas and canned hot enchilada sauce. I also put beef instead of chicken. I will do these again with chicken soon! 
I served them with rice, shredded lettuce, Spanish onions, and tomatoes.

I made two changes.  I did not have salsa, so I added a can of Rotel with the cream cheese and I did not use beans...yuck.
My husband thought this was wonderful as did I.  This is one meal I will make again.

Fantastic.  Great and easy way to use leftover roaster.  Added a bit more chicken, salsa and heat but other than that made no changes.  A keeper for sure.

These are delicious! This is by far the best enchilada recipe I have made in a long time - restaurant-quality for sure! Like others, I use enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan prior to baking. Stupendous! Thank you for sharing!

I loved how easy it was to make. My 8 yr old son helped me make it. The taste was surprisingly good. I was afraid it would be a bit bland but I used hot salsa and it added just enough spice. I also used kidney beans instead of pinto beans because that is what I had. I will definately be making this again.

I now understand why this recipe was showcased as "Recipe of the Day" twice in the past four months.  My family loved it!  I followed others' recommendations by not using the full amount of cream cheese, opting for corn tortillas instead of flour, and using red enchilada sauce in the bottom of the dish and over the rolled enchiladas.  I added the grated cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.  I was able to fit 11 enchiladas in my 9x13 casserole dish.

This recipe is great for families!!! I made two different types of "burritos" one per the instructions and one my kids would actually eat. For the  regular ones I used pre-cooked chicken that I defrosted and topped them with extra salsa before putting the cheese on top. For my kids I left out the salsa and beans. Everyone loved them! When I reheated them the next day in the oven they came out crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and the kids dipped them in sour cream....will make this many more times due to ease and great response from the Fam:)

Meh. These were just so-so. The consensus at our dinner table was unanimous - myself, my husband and our dinner guest (our neighbor) all agreed that while tasty, these were too dry for our liking. The filling itself is SUPER yummy (and I even used a generic (Wal-Mart) brand salsa), but the enchiladas themselves need some "help." A simple sauce would make all the difference, IMHO. If I ever make these again, I'll definitely keep this in mind. Cilantro, onion, tomato, lettuce and a dab of sour cream were yummy garnishes. Corn, Mexican rice and margaritas completed our meal. If for nothing else, this will become one of those "save the day" go-to recipes I rely upon when my pantry is bare and I have little time to prepare dinner. Thanks anyways, IANKRIS. :-)

Giving 4 stars as some loved it and some felt it was too rich (made with amount of cream cheese suggested in recipe). Definately easy and will be tweaked with less cream cheese. Good, fast, easy recipe. Thanks!! ps: DO NOT FORGET TO SPRAY PAN!Learn from my stupid mistake.  :)

My family loved these!  To make life easier, I doubled the entire recipe except for the cream cheese and froze half for another day.  It was plenty rich with only half the amount of cream cheese.

I have been using allrecipes.com non-stop ever since i moved out of my parents house... i finally have to cook for myself! I tried this for the first time and it was perfect! My bf loved it also. One thing i did change was i used enchilada sauce instead of salsa. Will defiantly become a dish i will make often.

I made this last night. I can only give 3 stars because I made changes and I liked it but my husband wasn't a huge fan. I added a can of corn and used enchilada sauce in place of salsa. I also added some onion, pepper,  and garlic powder while cooking chicken and topped it off with enchilada sauce and added cheese during last 5 minutes of baking. It was pretty good but the flour tortillas just get mushy and fall apart in some spots and get hard and tough in others. I wonder if corn tortillas, lightly fried, would work better if covered completely with sauce and cheese. Overall I liked the filling and will probably try this again with a couple changes.

4.5 stars if I could.  This was very good for a busy school/work night dinner.  I used enchilada  sauce instead of salsa, and a rinsed, drained can of black beans instead of pintos.  I also added a drained can of Rotel roasted tomatoes with lime and cilantro on top of the shredded cheese before baking.  All it needed after baking was some sour cream. Yum.

I would give this recipe 5 stars. I loved the combination of the creamy/tangyness of the cream cheese and the creamy/sweetness of the beans.  However, I was serving this at a family dinner and my father thought the enchiladas had too much cream cheese and not enough beans and  veggies.  I Plan on making this again and I will definitely take that into consideration.  I used cheddar cheese instead of colby jack (worked great) and also omitted the chicken as my family keeps kosher.  I loved it!!

I added Drained rotel, and Rotel sauce on Top & bottom of pan. Corn tortillas if there might be left overs because flour gets soggy make sure to cover top with sauce to prevent hard edges

Fantastic!! I replaced the chicken with beef and it still came out amazing!! My son devoured it. I didn't use the cream cheese since I did not have any on hand, so instead mixed the salsa with the sour cream and added chopped onion. The results were fantastic. My mouth is still doing the happy dance.

This was a super simple enchilada recipe.  I really enjoyed it...especially the addition of the pinto beans which were an unusual ingredient, but really added a nice touch.  I put enchilada sauce on the bottom and top of the enchiladas.

My son "doesn't like" enchiladas...except for these! He absolutely loved them and it makes me happy because it's very healthy and I don't have to fight at the dinner table with him. I liked them as well with corn salad and Spanish rice as sides. Thank you for the recipe!

I make this recipe often---it is great to throw together quickly for a weekday dinner.  I use canned chicken to make it even easier.  Top with sour cream, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes...definitely a family pleaser.

I am relatively new at cooking so this may sound dumb.  Mine turned out pink.  I guess it was because the cottage cheese was white and the Picante Sauce red.   It was tasty but the color kind of weirded my husband and I out.  Maybe I will make some adjustments next time around.

I have made these several times and love how fast and easy they are. This time I added some sour cream to the cream cheese and salsa mixture and reserved some to put on the top before the cheese. I have also added some of my bottled hot chilis. Thanks for a great recipe.

Really good. I used 4 oz. cream cheese, black beans, and about 1 cup of white rice.  Poured 1/2 can of enchilada sauce in the pan, poured the other half on the enchiladas, topped with cheese. Delicious!

LOVED this recipe!! It was so easy, but I halfed everything and used FF cream cheese. I also took the advice of other reviewers and put Ecnhilada sauce on the bottom of the dish. It turned out great, and I am making for my parents tonight!

Great recipe...I used a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, already baked. Used both the white and dark meat.  It is really fast this way and this is a dish I would serve to guests.

I used rotisserie chicken, enchilada sauce and black beans - kids loved it and the cream cheese (only used 4oz) cut down the spiciness of sauce.

5 star rating from my family, but personally, I'M not a big fan of Mexican food. I liked the simplicity in making these particular enchiladas, but for a bit more substance, I stirred a cup-an-a-half of cooked brown rice into the mixture. And when I realized I didn't have any chicken in the house, I spread some big, cooked shrimp on top of the filling before rolling up the tortillas. It turned out great... nice change from chicken IF you like shrimp! (And my daughter ate the cold leftovers the next day, and said they were still delicious!)

Excellent recipe that has easily become a family favorite.  I never have cooked chicken laying around, so to make this even easier for me I use frozen grilled chicken breast strips.  I zap them in the microwave for 2 minutes, cut them up & add to the sauce.  I love the richness of the cream cheese and use the entire 8 ounces called for.  The only change I made was the addition of enchilada sauce (half on the bottom of the pan, half over the rolled enchiladas before cheese) as previously suggested.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe as is, but I also make it with enchilada sauce if that's what I have on hand. Also, I think this recipe is what rotisserie chicken was made for!  Very, very satisfying and comforting food.

Delicious.  I changed it a bit, so 4*. I used 4 oz cream cheese and almost a cup of mild salsa.  I left the beans out of some of the mixture and put sauteed baby bellas & brown rice in instead. I put the enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan, as suggested, and poured the rest over the top, along with some of the rice and salsa.  I put a small amount of cheese inside the wraps too.  Baked for 20 minutes covered, then added the cheese to the top and baked 10-15 minutes more uncovered. My husband really liked it and he frequently has to "spice up" what I cook for his liking.

Really enjoyed these!  The kids loved them.  I doubled the recipe.  When I did I used 1 8oz pack of cream cheese and enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I also took other peoples advice and cooked them then put the cheese on to melt.  Can't wait to make them again.

Some one said this was rich and they weren't kidding. Together with the jalapeno bread I made, I thought I would explode, but it was wonderfully good. I wasn't counting calories today and no regrets.

I think these were good- I will definitely use a little more seasoning next time- but overall they were good- my son ate "the whole thing!!!"

Easy recipe and good!  I added green onions and jalapeno sauce in the mixture...then topped the rolled enchiladas with remaining mixture, sliced jalapenos, more green onions and lots of cheese.  After baking I topped it with sour cream and chopped tomatoes.  VERY TASTY!!!!

Really enjoyed.  I had left over BBQ chicken that I used.  I did add additional items.  Additional 1/2 cup salsa to cream cheese, 1/2 cup diced jalapenos, 1 small can green chilis and 1 can enchilada sauce.  Poured 1/2 can enchilada sauce on bottom of pan and remaining salsa and enchilada sauce on top of enchiladas.

I use half the amount of cream cheese and put enchilada sauce in the bottom and on top (roll tortillas up in the sauce and they get a nice, thin coating of it)

I just made this and the filling is DIVINE. I boiled the chicken tender breasts in some salt, pepper, garlic and some taco seasoning to give the chicken some flavor...took the chicken out and let it cool. I then shredded the chicken and added a dash of taco seasoning and pepper. I put enchilada sauce on the bottom and on top (not too much to over power). This is a very tasty and easy dish to make. I will use this when my in laws come to town :)

Excellent! Quick and Easy.  I don't normally have cream cheese so had to run to the market but it was well worth the trip.I have made it twice already..once with red enchilada sauce, once with the green chili verdi sauce.

very quick and easy. I used canned enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan before putting in the enchiladas as well as on top. I also cooked my chicken in a tortilla soup seasoning with a little water and added the onion to it after the chicken was mostly done just to intensify the flavor some.

super easy and everyone loved it- even the kids.  I had left over shredded chicken so I made this the night before then cooked it in the oven when I got home from work.  I used corn tortillas instead of the flour and it was great.  this will be a part of my weeknight dinner rotation!

this was a great base for a potentially creative dish. I added feta cheeze, used a left-over rotisseri chicken and corn tortillias. o, and cilantro, sour-cream and garlic., mmmmmm....will do this again and again to experiment!

OMG! My family and I loved this recipe!  I have made enchiladas in the past with far more ingredients and requiring more prep time, yielding results as good as this easy enchilada recipe.  You can truly make this for dinner in a snap!  I, too, cut the amount of cream cheese in half and in addition poured some enchilada sauce I had on hand top the bottom of the casserole pan, as well as on top of the enchiladas before topping with the cheese.

This is the first I ever made enchiladas. I chose this recipe because it had all the ingredients that my son likes. I cooked my pinto beans in a crock pot and I used canned mild enchilada sauce. I used part of the sauce on the bottom of the pan. For the shredded chese, I put the chese on for the last 2 minutes of the baking time with the foil on. The chese was melted just right. They came out perfect!!! I will definetly make them again :)

The recipe was great and is super easy - just my style. I also use enchilada sauce instead of salsa. The first time I made it, I personally thought the sauce was too creamy, so, I use half the cream cheese (1/3 fat, too). It really very good. My husband loved it and asked for it again! A+
***UPDATE*** Regularly Make this and have passed the recipe along to another who's family absolutely loved it!!! One Good Idea: I have made this ahead and stored it in the fridge, then it is ready to just be "popped in" the oven for an even faster supper!! I also prefer using fat free refried beans instead of regular pinto. Spread  the mixture in each tortillas, THEN fill the them with the cheese/chicken/enchilda mixture -  holds the enchildas together better.

This was very good. I added my own canned salsa, and a can of chopped green chiles. I would have put my pickled jalopenos in it but my husband doesn't like too much heat. So I just put them on the side. I also cooked my chicken in the oven with liquid smoke on it. Thanks for a great recipe, Ann

Took others suggestion & added green chilies & 1/2 tsp cumin. We liked these for a change. They were very moist when making, but after baking they dried out alot I thought. I'd scaled the recipe down to 3 & got 11 enchiladas out of it. Will make again.

Delicious! Used whole wheat tortillas and topped with canned diced tomatoes (the best for wintertime). Quick and easy--I love it!

Excellent! Made as is except added a little more chicken and stuffed 5 burritos instead of six. Yummy! The filling could easily be served with nacho chips.

This recipe has found its way into my regular recipe routine. I use pre-cooked chicken strips and it turns out great and is so easy to put together when I'm busy. I'm wondering if it would freeze well.

My husband and I LOVED these. Using a full package of cream cheese allowed me enough extra sauce to pour over top the enchiladas, and then add a whole bunch of cheese. SO good and super easy, we will make these again and again!

This recipe is a hit at our house!  Great recipe if you are short on time.  Only gave four stars because I do put enchilada sauce in the bottom of the dish and on top of the enchiladas, too, and these would not be nearly as good without it.  Sometimes I substitute a drained can of diced tomatoes with green chiles for the salsa, depending on what I have on hand and I always use canned chunk white chicken.  Takes such a short time to make and my husband loves them!

I would definitely make this again.  I fixed it for a church group of 10 and everyone commented on how good it was. After I put the enchilada on each plate I added a little dab of sour cream and some salsa.  This is a very recipe to make.

This recipe is wonderful- super easy and ridiculously tasty.  The leftover enchiladas were even better the next day.  I used fat free cream cheese for the filling, a jar of mild salsa, and then served with sour cream.  I seasoned my chicken with just a small amount of salt, pepper, garlic, and dried cilantro.  I will definitely be making this again.

Tried this recipe tonight for my family of 5.  It was EXCELLENT!  My husband is a very picky eater, and he absolutely loved it.  It took about 10 minutes to prepare (I had some shredded chicken on hand), and was a wonderful two dish meal.  One pan to combine filling, and the 9x12 to bake it in.  I realized at the last minute I didn't have any pinto beans, so I left them out, and it was still spectacular.  Very filling, great tasting, and super easy to clean up.  We will be making this a regular menu item at my house!

This was really good.  Like some people mentioned, I used half the cream cheese, and I also put enchilada sauce beneath the enchiladas as well as on top, before I put the cheese on.

Delicious!

I've made this recipe a couple of times.  The second time I saved half of the enchilada filling and made fewer enchiladas, then a couple of days later added a can of corn and a packet of taco seasoning and made chicken enchilada soup - it was delicious!

These were so good!!! I kind of just threw a whole bunch of stuff I needed to get rid of in the mix. Like a frozen package of corn I needed to get rid of. An opened can of refried beans that I mixed with a can of black beans. I also followed other users advice and bought a jar of enchilada sauce. I poured that on the pan before I constructed the enchiladas. Than poured the rest of the sauce over them. I also used low fat cream cheese and it wasn't heavy at all. Even my Hispanic friends likes this white wash version of enchiladas.

I love this receipe. It is very filling so we always have left overs the next day.  I actually love salsa and enchillada sauce so I usually put the sauce on the botton of the pan and then pour it over the top, but use the salsa when I am making the cream cheese.  I always serve this with rice. YUMMY

Quick and easy! I used canned chicken and a full 12oz. jar of salsa along with the 8oz. cream cheese. Also added a can of green chiles to the mix. After filling 6 shells I had some left over so I poured it over the top, along with a can of enchilada sauce before baking. I then added the cheese (about 3 1/2 cups) to the top after 25 minutes and baked it for another 10 minutes. It turned out good. Next time I am considering adding the little black kidney beans instead of the pintos.

It was yummy. But I don't like my more meaty and less creamy so I would definately add lots more chicken next time. I also liked that I added lots of salsa on top of the enchiladas for more flavor.

very good with a few changes. I used leftover turkey instead of chicken. I also added a package of taco seasoning to the cream chesse mixture. I also used honeywheat tortillas instead. It was awesome and the kids liked it too. I will be making this again.

Our family loves these enchiladas.  They are so easy.  I put them together, put them in the oven and head to the gym.  I give instructions to my husband to take them out in 30 minutes!  Perfect.

I had cooked my chicken in the crockpot all day. I just shredded it and added the rest of the ingredients except the shredded cheese adding also about 1/4 cup cooked white rice. I made my own tortillas topped them with the cheese and serving with sour cream. YUMO!!!!

These we're amazing. I made them with turkey instead of chicken and they turned out great! I wouldn't change a thing about them :) Yummy!

My boyfriend devoured this recipe.  I substituted salsa that included beans in it for the can of beans.  I also used a chicken breast left over from the day before.

This was delicious.  I substituted lowfat cream cheese inside the tortillas and a lowfat 4 cheese blend for on top.  I also used rotisserie chicken inside the tortillas and covered with a mild red enchilada sauce.  Since the chicken was already fully cooked I stuck it in the over for 20 minutes.  Came out perfect!

My husband and I *love* these enchiladas, it's a huge time saver with the already made chicken - and I usually just buy a sauce pack of red sauce to put below and over the top of the enchiladas. We like to add corn and sometimes red bell pepper. DELISH!!

This was such an easy recipe to follow! And  it's pretty easy to modify. I decided to use vegetarian "chicken" instead of the real stuff and it turned out really well.  I think that next time I will cut back on the cream cheese and add more salsa (I used garlic/lime salsa) because I thought it was a bit rich and mild.

I'm rating this recipe a "5" even tho I made changes...the cream cheese adds such a great creaminess and smoothness to the filling without using canned soup.  I made my enchiladas with turkey instead of chicken, and onions and black olives instead of beans.  I put some of the sauce in the bottom of the dish as a "bed" for the filled tortillas and then covered the tortillas with more sauce and cheese.  Delicious!

Very yummy, I modified it slightly.  I took the chicken and sauted it with thick and chunky salsa added a smidge of ground cumin powder and then mixed it together.  I also added some diced table onions into the enchilada and used enchilada sauce on the bottom and top of the enchiladas.  Garnished with tomato, sour cream, green table onions and black olives, was absolutely delicious.  My husband is always looking for true mexican food, he loved this recipe.

This is a terrific recipe! I used enchilada sauce (the ten minute enchilada sauce recipe) instead of salsa as suggested by some of the other reviews and my husband said they were restaurant quality enchiladas. Thanks!

This is a 5 star recipe if you arent expecting true enchiladas. Because this recipe doesnt include enchilada sauce it is  really more like a really yummy burrito. I made the recipe as is but used bigger flour tortillas. I also didnt measure the amount of chicken and ended up using a half of a Costco rotisserie chicken (probably more then the recipe calls for). I served it with fresh salsa and sour cream. Its a great recipe and i will make it again. Thanks for sharing.

These turned out really well. I was worried that it wouldn't really be that flavorful but it was good. We topped them off with sour cream and extra salsa. The kids liked them well enough...just waiting to see if they reheat well for my fiancee.

This was a great recipe...my husband and I loved it! I added a can of Mexican corn and a few pieces of chopped jalepenos to add more flavor. I also topped enchiladas with a can of red enchilada sauce before baking. We topped with lettuce and sour cream....very yummy! I will make this again!

Wow! These were awesome! I added 2 small cans of diced green chilles and used a medium salsa. My husband and I like a kick to our foods. I'm not sure if I stuffed the tortillas enough, but I was able to make 10 enchiladas. I've already passed the recipe along to my co-workers and friends. I will definitely be making this dish again.

The blend of salsa, cream cheese and chicken was a brilliant idea. I used 4 12 inch tortillas though. I also found that there was a little too much cheese. Next time I would only use about a cup to cover them.

This recipe was so simple and delicious! I kept it vegetarian by using mushrooms, spinach, onions, and bell pepper. Next time I will use less cream cheese. I added a jalepeno for some kick. Also, I think enchilada sauce is a must! I poured about half on the bottom and then covered the enchiladas with it. This recipe is a keeper.

I made one dish with chicken and the other with ground beef.  They were both a big hit. Next time, I'll cut back a little on the cream cheese. I think I'll add a little more spice to the dish. Overall, very quick, easy and yummy!

Before adding the cheese, I pour over the enchiladas a warmed mixture of cream of chicken soup (cream of anything will work) with another half to one cup of salsa mixed in. It's creamy and gives it a little "kick"!

Everyone enjoyed these enchiladas.  I took the advice of others and poured enchilada sauce under and over rolled tortillas.  Next time, I'll add chiles for some more kick, and cut back a little on the cream cheese.  I'll also season the chicken more as it cooks, since I thought the chicken needed more flavor.  Regardless of the changes I'll make next time, I still really enjoyed the enchiladas, and the preparation was very easy.

Great, easy recipe! My picky husband loved it! I didn't have chicken, so I used ground beef and whole wheat tortillas and topped with pico de gallo.

I was desperate for a left over chicken recipe, and this worked perfectly, as my chicken already had chipotle marinade on it.  

This was just excellent!  

I left out the beans, as I don't like beans, and I think it was probably even better without them.  

I highly recommend.

I thought it was great!  I added extra tomatoes to the mix because I needed to use them.  It caused this to be a little more soupy but the recipe as written was great!

I can not believe how easy this dish was to prepare. The result was scrumptous--hard to believe it only has a few, simple ingredients. UPDATE 10/27/2011 - By following the recipe exactly as far as the filling, I was able to make 13 enchiladas from a 22.5 oz package of 20 flour tortillas. Still one of my kids' all time favorite dinners!

These were very good.  I used a little more chicken than called for so it made a few more than 6 rolled tortillas.  I also used a homemade salsa so I think that made it even better.  I have made it a couple of times now and it will be a family favorite.  If you like a creamy chicken sauce with beans in your tortilla then you should like this one.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!!  Even my picky 6 year old ate it.  I didn't have any pinto beans on hand, so I substituted dark red kidney beans (it was all I had on hand) and it was still fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and my Husband LOVED it!  I layered the tortillas instead of rolling and used Ranch Style beans - drained not rinsed.  It was good enough for seconds!  Very easy.

Outstanding!  I used black beans, and also 1-1/2 cups of salsa instead of one.  The mix yielded 10 enchiladas, which barely fit in the dish (2 were along the edge, spanning the ends of the others).

I soooo did not want to deal with dinner last night. I was looking for something that would use some leftover Mexican rubbed grilled chicken, and this was perfect. Didn't have pintos so I used a can of chili beans. My husband also really liked this recipe. Thanks for the post!

My family and I loved this recipe. It was a great last-minute choice, and I was able to make it with ingredients on hand. I also did not use as much cream cheese, substituted black beans and added the cheese for just the last few minutes.

Great taste for the ease of its preparation. Great church pot-luck meal. I put the required cheese IN the saucepan instead of on the finished product. The result makes a seven-layer burrito sallow by comparison.

SOO YUMMY!!! I omited the beans altogether (family doesn't like them) and used a 4cheese mexican blend. I also added extra salsa to the top before I added the cheese. We were impressed. I thought these were fabulous. I am going to entertain with this recipe at our next get together!

A little too creamy so next time I'll use less cream cheese.

This was a great recipe!  I took the advice from the others:  half the cream cheese and added enchilada sauce, and it was fabulous!!

Everyone thought that this was pretty decent.  I used ground beef instead of chicken.  Quick recipe if you want enchiladas at the last minute.  Personally thought that they were good but with the salsa that I used I found that flavor over powered everything else.

Really good and easy, my kids even ate the beans!  I used black beans, but any would be good.
