Delish! I added a cup of drained and rinsed canned black beans and a cup of chopped green bell pepper.  I also added some cumin and red pepper as a few other suggested and it was worth it. The store I went to didn't have a 17.5 oz jar of enchilada sauce so I just got 16 oz and that was plenty! I'll most likely make this at least one more time. Oh! Just an FYI 2 cups of zucchini is approximately 1 pretty big one, I ended up buying too many since I wasn't sure :)

Pretty good and easy.  Jesse really liked it.  We added mushrooms, black beans and a little broccoli (could hardly notice them!).  I thought it was a little too wet--should drain the veggies well and not overdo the sauce.  Also, next time use Hatch sauce.  Should season the veggies with at least a little garlic, salt and pepper.  I didn't like the corn b/c it was a little too sweet, but could have gone for more spinach and mushrooms.

I did use more enchilada sauce than what was called for. I also fried my corn tortillas in vegetable oil before using them in this recipe. This was fair. I think it's a good start but I think for us, it needs a little more "oomph" and more variety of vegetables. I'd use this idea again but just embellish on it. I made homemade refried beans and homemade mexican rice to go with.

Delicious. I added a few more veggies (broccoli, mushrooms) and because I live in such a hot climate I did not want to turn on the oven. I did this skillet style. I took my square skillet, and just did the layering in that. Covered it, let it cook for about 20 minutes and wah-lah. Skillet style casserole.

Very easy and yummy.  I made it twice; first, exactly as written, and then with cumin and red pepper added (as DLORD suggested).  The kicked-up version was better.

My son is so not a veggie lover, especially zucchini and corn but he not only ate one helping, he ate two!!!  I added a green bell pepper, garlic & a can of black beans (drained & rinsed) to the vegetable mixture.  I had leftover corn on the cob so I just chopped the kernels off and used that instead of frozen.  Like other reviewers mentioned as a good addition, I added a few dashes of cumin and cayenne to the veggie mix.  I assembled this casserole by starting with sauce, then tortillas, then more sauce, half of the veggie mixture, reduced fat Mexican cheese blend, tortillas, sauce, veggies, cheese, tortillas, sauce, cheese and topped it all off with some minced chives from the garden and popped it into the oven. Don't be shy with the enchilada sauce (I just used the brand I had) in your layers or this will be dry but too much will make it a mushy mess.  I didn't measure how much I used but I would say I used about 1/2 a cup for each layer.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream, chopped cilantro and some pickled jalapeno peppers.  If this got my kid to eat veggies, it is a MUST for our regular rotation.  ! love recipes that push those vegetables!!! :)

Hubby and kids loved it! I followed the recipe as it was and just added a little Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning to the veggies while cooking. Wish I had leftovers!! Definitely making it again soon.

I really enjoyed this recipe and will definitely be making it again. It was easy, tasty, and healthy. I used reduced fat mexican blend cheese, and fresh corn, and I kicked in a little cumin and red pepper in the veggies.

A yummy dish. It truly depends on the type of enchilada sauce that you use.  I used Rosarita enchilada sauce and ended up using more sauce than the recipe required, which helped keep the corn tortillas from getting too tough. I would recommend added sliced olives on top along with chives or green onions. Some cottage cheese (1 pint?) added to the stuffing would make it stick together better as well.

very nice. only 4 stars because I believe in fair ratings based on no changes and I did not have zucchini so I added 1 can of black beans and some extra onion to make up the bulk difference. Also made my own enchilada sauce. This is basic enough that it would be easy to personalize.

I made this using the recipe for Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce on this site. Also added some garlic and beans to the vegetables. It was very good and we will make it again!

This was alright.  I think some black beans would have added something to it.

Delicious and easy! Due to my location, I couldn't find bottled enchilada sauce so I made my own. I also couldn't find corn tortillas, so I used flour ones, and that resulted in a noodle-like texture. It reminded me of lasagna! But it was surprisingly delicious and we'll certainly be making it again.

It was easy to throw together, and involves lots of veggies - two of my favorite things in a recipe! I added half a green pepper that I had in the fridge. I only needed a 10-oz. can of enchilada sauce.

Yummy, but requires more seasoning. I added 2 TB fajita seasoning, 1 tsp cumin, and 1/4 tsp garlic. Yum!

I followed this recipe precisely.  I did add cumin to the veggies as suggested by others.  We are not a veggie loving family.  This recipe is packed with vegetables and taste delicious.   We will make this again!

Love this recipe and have used it as inspiration for other enchilada dishes - no more fussy rolling, it is so much easier to make casseroles!

this was so easy to make and delicious, the kids loved it! I used tortilla chips and salsa instead of tortilla shells and picante sauce because that's what I had on hand. I also added a tsp of cumin and corriander which added to the deliciousness. This is definately a welcomed addition to my recipe box!

I thought the combination of vegetables with added black beans and bell pepper really gave this enchilada casserole a bang for it's buck. Never knew it was missing the meat :)

My vegetarian daughter and I LOVED this recipe!! I tend to find some of the veg recipes a bit bland, so I added taco seasoning to the veggies as they sauteed, I also added 'fiesta' corn (corn w/red/gr bell peppers). This recipe will be used often!

Great concept, however home-made enchilada sauce would be a better fit. I added broccoli and mushrooms too, GREAT IDEA (should be in the recipe).  Try Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn for extra flavor and alvacado for garnish.
