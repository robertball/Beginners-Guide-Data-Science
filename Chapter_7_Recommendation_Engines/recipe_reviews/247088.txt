I found this bread to be an unnecessarily expensive banana bread, using buttermilk ,and  a stick of butter. To top it off, I could taste the buttermilk, and I thought it detracted from the taste of the bread. After letting it sit in the fridge overnight, I thought it tasted better, but I still think it's expensive to make.

It is good--especially when smothered with butter after toasting it.  My bananas ended up at 1 1/2 cups mashed.  I followed the recipe as written, and it was done after only 47 minutes for me.  I would definitely add walnuts the next time.  I always appreciate having healthy alternatives to recipes for quick breads because it makes for a better breakfast accompaniment.  Thanks for the recipe!

I hadnâ€™t too many bananas so I did the recipe and half (I added a half of all ingredients to what it already called for). I also added about 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of allspice. 

Next time I am going to try honey instead of all the sugar and just oat flour and flaxseeds and coconut oil instead of melted butter. I will update my post once I do that. 

The changes made a loaf and 24 mini muffins. Mini muffins cooked about 20 - 25 minutes and loaf was about 65 minutes.
