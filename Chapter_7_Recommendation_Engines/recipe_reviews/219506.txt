I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! I make this every year for Thanksgiving, and once in a while when I'm craving it I'll make it.  I didn't use it as stuffing, but as a dressing. I don't like it mushy, so I bake it as a dressing instead. I used this recipe more as a guideline and substituted with ingredients that I know my family and I enjoy. I used baby bella mushrooms and white button mushrooms. I made my own stuffing bread by drying out Pane Italian bread in the oven.  I also used a spicy italian turkey sausage for a little kick in my dressing. One more change I made was that I brought a brand of chicken stock I enjoy. I hope that others will try this recipe and make it their own!
