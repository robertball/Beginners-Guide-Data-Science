I was a bit leary of this - pork n beans w/mayo.  Just sounded weird.  But not bad at all.  Simple.  Something different.  Though I did prefer it freshly made at room temperature, rather than cold from the fridge.  I didn't drain the beans cause that would just make it navy beans, so I didn't really get that.  I also don't have relish so just chopped up dill pickles.

This is a refreshing salad that gets some sweetness from the baked beans.  Combine that with the onion and relish flavor and it is a winner!!
