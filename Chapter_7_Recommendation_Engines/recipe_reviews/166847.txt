OMG! I love apples and cheese, but never would have thought of the two in a grilled sandwich! This was a great for lunch. I used sliced Swiss cheese as I thought it would work better and thick sliced whole grain bread, but whatever bread you use this is bound to be delicious. This is definitely a case of don't knock it 'til ya try it!

delicious! i used what i had on hand: a perfect red/yellow apple, swiss & cheddar mix sliced, and microwaved some bacon to throw on top. and a dash of rosemary. with one side of the sandwich slightly burnt. PERFECTION in my mouth. the bacon adds a lot of flavor, the apple adds sweetness and crunch, and the cheese glues it together. amen!

Wonderful. I used the processed Swiss Cheese slices (2), should have sliced the Granny Smith a little thicker, to match the cheese.  I did not oil, but I buttered (margarine) the outside of the Grain Bread to grill.  Will definetly be on my everyday menus.  Have to try the brie and a lot of other cheese too!  thanks so much!

Great combination of flavors. The tanginess of the Granny Smith apple magically disappears and becomes "one" with the other flavors. Can't describe it really, but it really is delicious and I agree with the contributer of the recipe, you have to do this on wheat bread. Tastes so much better!

This has to be the best grilled cheese ever!  I used Monterey Sourdough bread instead of wheat, and butter instead of olive oil... Wow Can't wait for my husband to try this! Served it along side a bowl of tomato soup that contained fresh tomatoes, onions, garlic, peppers, eggplant, smoked reduced sodium bacon, rosemary, and chive.  That puts a twist in the old Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup Favorite!

A good sandwich - but before you serve or eat this sandwich wait about 2-3 minutes. That way, the flavors meld a little better.

These are awesome!  my kids and husband loved them.  They are super easy to make and are a nice twist to an everyday normal, boring grilled cheese.  Even my daughter, who hates grilled cheese, loved these.

This sandwich was good, but needed a little more 'zip.' I will have to experiment, but this is definitely a good start. Very quick and easy, the cheese and apple pair nicely together. I made it using my George Foreman.

Simple, and I added maple/dijon mustard as well.  I used wheat bread and provolone instead and used mcintosh apples because that's what I had on hand.

My husband can't eat apples unless they have been cooked (they make his throat scratchy). We are both originally from Wisconsin so we love our cheese. I thought that this would be a great way to combine two things he loves, but doesn't always get to eat. I was a little leery at first, but thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm so glad I did. Both my husband and I loved it. He has requested that I make it again soon. I used Swiss cheese and whole wheat bread (just store bought sandwich bread) and it was fantastic!

My sons love this. They like the tart flavor of the apple mixed with the Swiss cheese. Only thing we did different was use Rye bread but only because I didn't have any whole wheat. It was still totally awesome is now a family favorite.

Not as great as I was hoping. Make sure to slice the apples really thin or sautee them prior to assembling the sandwich.

Very satisfying combo of flavor & texture - I made mine with Granny Smith apple, muenster cheese, and some leftover brie cheese.  I used Potato Bread and grilled with butter.

Toasted in toaster oven (no butter/oil) with American cheese and granny smith. I'll try other combinations and properly frying it in a pan with butter/oil next time :)

Swiss and granny smith just happened to be what I had leftover in the fridge and needed to get rid of, so this was perfect.  I'm not normally a huge Swiss cheese fan, but this was a surprisingly yummy combo.  I normally dip my grilled cheese in ketchup, but instead I used a creamy dill dip, and it was the perfect meal.

This was a tasty but something was missing and with Swiss I tend to get that at times. For my 'food lovin' palate', Swiss Cheese is a bit too tough and while I like Swiss on somethings (like a nice big, thick Corned Beef Rueben on Rye umm..with Russian dressing and Sauerk)...oh wait...where was I??? Oh!...this sandwich...(ummmm...Ruuueeeben) ok..ok...um...Swiss doesn't really yield much flavor to me with this sandwich. I did however, give 'meself' 4 stars because the second time I used Harvarti Cheese instead. I like the buttery taste of the cheese better with the apples. I love and used Cameo--a little sweeter but still firm. I also butter my bread (100% Whole Grain--nutty flavor/crunchy toasted texture) with "Smart Balance" (omitted olive oil), sprinkled buttered sides with a bit of cinnamon/sugar, put one slice bread *butter sides down* on heated non-stick, put 1 slice of Harvarti down, my thin sliced apple, 1 more slice of Harvarti and then my other slice of bread. Pre-sliced Harvarti is usally thin. Using a wide-wide 'panny-cake' turner i.e spatula--I smashed ever-so gently. Just to help it a long a bit. Yeeuummie. If you try this...don't overdue it on the cinnamon/sugar or you will increase the chance of burning it in spots. Don't have flames or electric too high. Slow toasting is always better even with a 'Classic Grilled Cheese'. SLOWWW TOOOAST. I would have gave myself 5 but mine is a littttttlllle bit more fattening....;o)...but sometimes fat RULES.!!!

this was tasty, i've made it twice in the past few days to use up the ingredients. the first time i made it with french bread, thinking it would grill up nice. unfortunately, it's not the best bread to use b/c it really dried out, plus i cut it too thick. today i made it with some multi-grain sandwich bread. it was good, but i kind of burned it. both times, i finished it off in a 350° oven b/c i like my cheese really melty. so even tho i'm not great at making it (through no fault of its own), i think it's a great flavor combo. :)

This sounded so unusual that I had to try it. I don't know how this works, but wow, it does.  I used rye bread(had on hand), shredded Jarlsberg Swiss, and a Pipin apple. I also added a few bacon bits. I coated my bread with mayo as my momma taught me to do. Simple, filling, and SO tasty. I think the key is to slice the apples thin as recipe stated. I also layered cheese, apples, then again cheese. My husband even raved about it even tho shocked at the ingredients! Definitely adding this to our regulars. Yum

This was absolutely delicious! The granny smith apples and the swiss cheese melted together to create a sort of sweet, cheesy ham taste, which I adored! A must have!

This recipe is even better if you add a very thinly sliced red onion to it!  I like to put mine in a waffle-maker to cook, too!  Kids love the pattern it makes on the outside of the bread.

This was good but I didn't think the flavor was all that exciting.  It was just missing SOMETHING.  Not sure what though.  A good sandwich nonetheless.

What a great flavor combination!  It's light and quick, a nice fresh twist on grilled cheese.  I also experimented with making it in the toaster oven -- didn't need any oil that way, and it took just a few minutes on "toast" (450 degrees).    Remember to slice the apples thin, though, or else they'll be a bit cool.  Also, I used two slices of swiss cheese per sandwich, rather than shredded swiss.

I made this today, just for twist on your typical grilled cheese. I used butter for the bread and sliced Swiss. Simple to assemble and great for those moms who need a quick, light lunch.

My childhood best friend's mom introduced me to this YEARS back... this was one of our favorite after-school snacks! However, this version was lacking flavor in some ways. First, granny smith apples are too tart for this, in my taste. I usually use Fuji or Gala apples. Instead of making it a "sandwich", I take and toast each slice of bread. After toasting, spread a layer of mayo over each slice of bread, top with apples, then cover apples with sliced cheese (I always use Colby jack or cheddar... but swiss works well, too!). Place both slices on baking sheet & broil until cheese has melted. From there, you can either place slices together to create a sandwich, or simply eat each slice on it's own. 
Great, easy recipe... but definitely needs some sort of condiment!! (I found this version quite 'dry' and too plain in some ways.)I did not like the olive oil, when I tried this version. Maybe some butter would be better... but I really prefer the version I grew up with, using mayo & toasting/broiling instead of treating it like a grilled cheese.

Different. Easy. And not for me. I didn't really like the flavor of the olive oil and wasn't impressed with the swiss cheese/apple combo either. I only took 2 bites because I thought it deserved a second chance, but this just did not appeal to me at all. :(

I gave this a three because while I didn't really care for it, I still ate it.  I must just not like swiss.  I love grilled cheese sandwiches and I'm always looking for ways to jazz up the basic .  I was excited about this one, but the swiss just isn't for me.

I know this sandwich must be for the NON meat lovers, but a 1/4 lb shaved pastrami would have been better than the apple. To me this was a boring tasting sandwich, by far the bread was the star!!

This didn't do anything for me. The flavors did not "blend" as other people's did. I do not think 1/3 cup of cheese is enough, as I could barely taste it. It was just like eating an apple with bread, which is to say, nothing special. I'll stick with regular grilled cheese sandwiches and have an apple on the side.

This was my first time ever trying an apple and swiss sandwich.  That being said it was pretty ok but I'm sure it could be better (for my palate) with a couple of changes.  I really think that a creamy soft cheese would be a wonderful addition, I'm sure something else could go in there too, I'm just not sure what yet. :)

yum! I used sliced swiss cheese rather than shredded because it's what I had on hand. It worked just fine and still tasted good, but shredded would have been better to really melt in with the apples. I also added a slice of ham to make the snadwiches a little heartier for dinner. My husband and kids devoured these!

Pretty good.  Better than a normal grilled cheese sandwich, in my opinion.  Next time, though, I am definitely adding bacon.  I might use a different type of cheese, too, like cheddar or provolone.  Melted Swiss always tastes a bit bland to me.  But overall, a very healthy alternative to a grilled cheese sandwich.  Simple to whip up and very filling.  Thanks for the recipe!

Why didn't I think of this before?! Apples and cheese go great together. I used a tart granny smith and some bitter Brie, so the tartness and savoriness balanced perfectly. I've also used St. Andre cheese, which was even better.

I'm not a fan of this, partially because I disliked the apple cheese combo, but also because it just left a strange taste in my mouth after eating it.

Because I was curious with all the high reviews, I prepared this recipe today for lunch, using rye bread, butter instead of oil, and slices of Swiss cheese with a Granny Smith apple sliced thin. It's a nice flavor, but, not something I want to have again.

As written, I rate this recipe 4 stars.  For those of you who find it a bit bland, consider adding some zip to the mayo. To the mayo add: a bit of lemon juice, salt and honey (all to taste).  In my book this brings the recipe up to 5 stars.  When making tuna salad, add lemon juice, red wine vinegar, garlic(minced or powder), s&p to the mayo(no honey).  You'll have to fool around with the amts.

I will make it again, and will have fun mixing it up a bit.  I didn't have Swiss, so I used sliced muenster and I added a little whole grain mustard on the cheese side of the bread. Everything melded together very nicely.  The versatility of the recipe is key to being in my regular rotation.

I left out the oil and used two slices swiss cheese instead of shredded.  I cooked it in the broiler.  It was a little bland.  I dipped it in tomato soup, but think it would have been too bland without the soup.  I've tried this same thing with cheddar instead of swiss and it was a lot better.  I think the cheddar goes with the apple flavor.

Love this recipe. If I'm in a hurry, I used sliced cheese instead of grated to cut down on the mess and time. This is a great version of a classic.

I was so surprised by how good this sandwich was! Definitely use Granny Smith apples, I think you need that tartness to make it work.  I just used regular wheat bread which was perfect.

What a great combination of ingredients!  The flavours and texture (thinly sliced apples as per directions) go very well together. I used butter instead of oil on the bread.  The kids really enjoyed it.

This was really good with sourdough, 2 slices of swiss cheese instead of shredded, and I added 2 strips of bacon. Everyone raved and wanted seconds.

The tart sweetness of the Granny Smith apple nicely complements the Swiss cheese.  I used some good sourdough bread from a local bakery and it was awesome.

I used homemade sourdough bread and a Granny Smith apple.  The apple flavor doesn't come through very much, and I put a fair bit in the sandwich. It's a nice filling sandwich nevertheless.  I cooked it on a sandwich maker to get the grill lines. The added advantage of using the grill is that I could set a lower heat that would allow better cooking of the apple.  I might try a bit of apple jelly with the apple next time and I might look for a stronger tasting apple.

I used a "fruit and grain" sandwich bread, and sliced Swiss because that's what I had. To make it even more awesome, I served it with homemade hot pepper jelly. Yum!

Something a little different from the standard grilled cheese. I only had Swiss slices on hand, and they didn't seem to melt very well, so maybe shredded cheese would melt better? Because many reviewers mentioned it being bland, I put a little Dijon mustard inside of each slice and added a few pieces of bacon.

I made this with homemade 9 grain & seed, granny smith apple & swiss cheese. I didn't have olive oil, so I used safflower oil on one & butter on the second, my husband & I agree the one with oil was much better!

The Granny Smith apple was way too tart and overbearing.  I added prosciutto but you couldn't even taste it with the tart apple.  I would make this again with changes...red delicious apple and thinly sliced onion.
My husband and I were both in complete agreement.  We both decided it was much better when we dipped it in tomato soup.

I like most things that incorporate apples and I found this recipe accidentally and was very excited about it.  My husband refused to try it, but I really loved it.  The only change I made was that I used butter on the bread instead of oil.  I'm normally not a fan of rye bread, but it worked really well for this recipe.  And as someone else said, next time, I would do thicker slices of the apple.
