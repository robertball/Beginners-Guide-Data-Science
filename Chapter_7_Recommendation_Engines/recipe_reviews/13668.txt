This recipe was loved by everyone at my potluck although I did omit the coconut to keep it from being to much like a dessert. If I were to make it again I think I would cut the white sugar added to the potatos down to 1/2 or 1/3 of a cup instead because its so sweet!

Great recipe!  I found it a bit too sweet with the coconut but without the coconut it is just right.  I've served this at several holiday dinners now and everyone loves it.

I loved this recipe!  I cooked it for the first time for Thanksgiving this year and I know it will be coming back, everyone loved it!   The only thing I did differently was double the amount of sweet potatos while leaving the rest of the recipe the same, due to comments saying it was too sweet.  I think with double the potatos it turned out perfectly.   Thanks for the great recipe!

For the best taste I would omit the coconut. The dish is fabulous. I got rave reviews. I did not even have leftovers...

This is delicious!  I used 4 cups mashed sweet potatoes and it was still really sweet.  Omitted the coconut, because I am not a big fan of it.  I used light brown sugar and self-rising flour.  Was still really great!  I used some organic coconut oil in place of the margarine for health benefits.  I am saving this recipe in my recipe box.  Thanks!

Please separate the ingredient list, the sweet potato mix from the toppings.
