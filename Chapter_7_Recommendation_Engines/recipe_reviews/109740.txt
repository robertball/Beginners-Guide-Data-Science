I put down five stars because I didn't want to leave a bad review on the recipe since I did not really make it. However, I just wanted to say.. 83 grams of fat FOR A SANDWICH?? Not sure if anyone looking at this recipe who has made it noticed that but that is really insane!!! I just wanted to put this review here so that if you didn't see the nutritional facts on the side of the recipe you might see it here!!

If you have a panini press, you absolutely need to make this!  Here's what I did with mine, and they came out perfect: (1) Cooked chicken tenders on a skillet with minced garlic, salt, and pepper and until cooked through.  (2) Chopped up the chicken using my Ninja chopper so it was shredded into small pieces.  (3) Used Ken's Healthy Options Caesar Dressing.  (4) Used reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese.  (5) Used Hormel bacon bits.  (6) Used Land-o-Lakes Light Butter.  This still isn't the healthiest sandwich in the world, but if you cut the calories in a few easy no-brainer ways it doesn't hurt the flavor AT ALL.  I wanted to take a new picture for this recipe to do it some justice but both paninis were gone before I had a chance!

For those who don't have a panini press, did you know you can use your George Foreman grill?  Works great.

absolutly loved this sandwich.   I probably only used a tablespoon of the dressing, and couldn't find the chipolte chile powder so just did a sprinkle of cayenne. Don't own a panini maker so just fried in a pan with another heavy pan on top to press it down.  Will definatly make this again, thanks!

Made it with a ready made chicken from Costco (or grocery store). Sauce: ranch, a chipotle glaze and ted reader's bone dust.  5 minutes on the panini press was perfect. This was a great sandwich. Very filling!

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe.  Go easy on the chipotle chili powder to make it more mild.  You can also use ranch dressing rather than caesar if your kids don't like caesar.  This is such an easy leftover chicken recipe.

I thought the ingredients sounded rather strange together, but they aren't at all! My husband wanted a sandwich and all we had were chicken breasts for meat. He doesn't like mayo, so I was looking for something different. This was a perfect amount of sauce for two chicken breasts and two sandwiches. I mixed it all together like chicken salad. He loved it, so did I. I'll make this again.

My husband has been asking me to make this again ever since I made it the first time! He loved it! I used a George Foreman grill which worked very well and was so easy to clean up - my husband even did it for me! I spead the fattening ingredients out over several sandwiches and it was perfect. I honestly don't know how you get that much dressing and cheese on one sandwich anyway. We did not feel like we were cheated of flavor or calories. Definetly a keeper my family says:)

This panini came out delicous. I used ranch and mixed the chipolte right in the ranch, i also used provalone instead because thats what i had handy. I think this sandwiches is full of great flavor with a little spicy kick to it.

The chipotle was overpowering to me, but my husband liked it okay.  I missed the caesar, chiptle and bacon bits together and used it on a spread.  I also used one batch of it for 3 sandwiches, but it was still too much.

Okay, This was just okay to me. The addition of the chipotle seasoning was not really fitting to our taste buds and we love chipotle. It added much to much zest to the panini.  I will try again, maybe w/o the chipotle seasoning and add a mexican mayo instead.

YUM!  Unfortunately I did not have all the exact ingredients so my review isn't 100% true to the written recipe. I used 1/8 cup of ceasar vinegarette and 1/8 cup ranch for a creamier sauce and didn't have any chipotle powder so just used a chili powder.  I don't have a panini press and didn't have sourdough on hand so I used a french roll, buttered both sides, pressed flat with spatula and grilled like a grilled cheese. Great!

i made this tonight and my hubby said, "Great Sandwich!"  Changes that I made:  I didn't measure the dressing, though I should Have because i ran out of sauce and my hubby's was a little dry in that dept.  I carmelized onions, red and green peppers, and cooked mushrooms.  I used havarti cheese.  i didn't have the chipotle powder, but i did have the chipotle peppers in adobe sauce frozen in my freezer.  I took out one pepper, nuked it, mixed it into the dressing.  I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and chili powder.  i didn't have sour dough, but i had some panini bread that i got from Fresh Market on hand.  i buttered both sides of the bread before i put the sandwich together, put it on my panini grill and yummy.  i will make this again, very soon!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I made it twice once with Naan bread and the next time with rustic artisian Italian bread as I couldn't find a sourdough bread that I liked. Both tasted great.  I made up the chicken / bacon earlier and put it in the fridge the panini's came together very quickly come meal time.

Delicious!  I used Ranch dressing, because that's what I had.  One note-if you like "wet" sandwiches, definitely use the full amount of dressing.  I didn't and we ended up adding more dressing while eating them.  Very good though!!

This is a fabulous sandwich. I've now made it two days in a row. It's also the first time I've used my panini press, and perhaps the first panini I've ever eaten (I'm not sure). I made it exactly as written. I was lucky enough to find a "sourdough square" loaf whose label said "The perfect bread for paninis," so I knew I was on the right track. This was also the first time I'd used my bottle of "Ground Red Chipotle" (which tastes noticeably better than generic "chili powder"). This is a little messy to make, and even though my bread slices were fairly large, the sandwich was almost overstuffed, so I might use smaller chicken breasts in the future. Also, even though I like Caesar dressing, I think 1/4 cup (i.e., 4 T.) is too much, so I might cut it down to 3 or even 2 T. - the sandwich was a little too wet for my tastes. Still, and despite the fat content, this was a wonderful treat, and a great introduction to making my own paninis.

It was good, but the sourdough bread flavor and the dressing seemed to overpower to the point that I could not taste the other ingredients.  I won't make this again.

Very good quick and easy sandwich. I used ranch dressing just because my husband doesn't like ceaser dressing. Will make again in the future. Thanks for sharing recipe

Delicious!  I wing it with the amount of each ingredient, but the flavors mix beautifully.  I make them for dinner, and also make them for my teen's school lunch.  She eats them cold for lunch and says they're great that way, too.

This recipe was very good and my whole family loved it! I quadrupled it and did make some minor changes, though. The recipe didn't specify how to cook the chicken so I cut it into chunks and cooked it in a skillet with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a little Chipotle. After it was done I let it cool a little, and instead of assembling the sandwich right before cooking it, I mixed all of the ingredients together before hand. I put the chicken, Caesar dressing, bacon bits, cheese, and Chipotle in a bowl and stirred it up, like a chicken salad. I added the Chipotle a little at a time and kept tasting it to make sure I didn't add to much. I think total I used a little less than a tablespoon for 4 chicken breasts, just enough to give it some flavor and spice but not make it overwhelming. My younger siblings even liked it! One last thing, I used Italian bread instead of sourdough because that's what I had around the house, and instead of butter I brushed olive oil on the bread to toast it. It turned out very delicious and I will most definitely be making it again!

We loved it. I didn't have chipotle chile powder so I used smoked paprika. Made these on my George Forman grill.

My 19 year-old daughter picked this recipe. I had my doubts, but it came out really good. It's pretty obvious that the ingredient proportions will make more that one sandwich; who measures sandwich ingredients anyways. I used pounded chicken breasts that I seasoned with taco seasoning and then sliced them thin after cooking. Sliced chicken from the deli would have worked just as well. Instead of chipotle chile powder, I used Chipotle Cream (comes in a bottle) that I use on tacos. I also sub'ed Munster cheese for the cheddar. No panini maker, so just grilled it in a pan.

I think this is something my daughter, who loves chipotle, will be making on her own!
