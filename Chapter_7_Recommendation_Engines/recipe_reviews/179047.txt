This was great, creamy comfort food.  Loved it!  It was so easy - I even used frozen chicken breasts straight from the freezer and believe it or not, the chicken was done sooner than the carrots.  Will slice the carrots thinner next time.  I wish there was more rice to go around, so I plan to add some extra regular rice to the slow cooker (plus the necessary water to compensate).  Due to the frozen chicken, I jumped started the crock by putting on high for the first 30 minutes.

I added a small bag of mini carrots instead of cutting up four carrots like the recipe stated.  We love carrots in our house.  Also the other reviewer stated it does not need extra salt but all of us had to add a little salt to ours.  The chicken is so tender it falls apart after cooking for seven hours at low temperature in the slow cooker.  This is a keeper for us.  Even our four year old loved it!

For the people that thought it was bland don't forget that you need to use a SEASONED rice mix.  I found this very flavorful.  Added chopped celery and used chix stock intead of water.  Great for the Sunday dinner rotation.

This was not bad.  It is a super hardy meal that sticks to your ribs (my husbands quote)  Easy to do.  I did the recipe exactly as it stated using water instead of chicken stock.  No need for salt it is salty enough with the soup and seasoning packet.  I only used half the chicken breast and it was fine.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good base recipe.  I made the following modifications for my lower sodium health preferences:
To cut down on the sodium, I substituted 1 cup of homemade bechamel sauce for 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  I used reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the other can of cream of chicken soup that the recipe calls for.  I also substituted plain unseasoned wild rice instead of the seasoned packaged one, and added my own favorite dried spices (tarragon, italian seasoning, rosemary).  I then added my own amount of salt and pepper.  I used broccoli instead of carrots as a preference and used chicken thighs instead of breasts for more flavor.  It turned out creamy, flavorful and yummy.  
I felt good about feeding my family a lower sodium meal.

Hubby and I rated it 4, our 8 year old daughter said 5!

Hubby thought it needed more veggies.  I think next time I might ad some frozen peas.

Carrots were still pretty crunchy after 6.5 hours but everything else was cooked.  I didn't mind the crunchy carrots, they were yummy.

I used chicken thighs because they are less expensive and we like them better.  This was good, creamy comfort food.  I will definitely make this again.

I opted to leave out the carrots (not huge cooked carrot fans) and other than the fact that my crockpot cooks so fast/hot, it was pretty good.  I cut up my chicken into bite size pieces (it was for a potluck lunch at church). That way I only used about 1/2 the amount of chicken it called for...still plenty for everyone to have some.  It was all gone, so I guess it was a hit. I'll make this again, very easy and tasty.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It tasted very bland and that was after I had added seasoned salt and pepper.  It wasn't a hit with any of us

This turned out wonderful.  In addition to the ingredients required, I also added celery and onion. I will do it that way next time along with some salt and pepper.  This is a keeper!

Not as good as I hoped. Rice was mushy and even after adding a bunch more spices than what was called for, it was still bland. Would only make again with modifications... maybe cook rice separately and add some serious jazz to the chicken. Tried modifying with Uncle Ben's Original Seasoned Wild Rice and Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herbs, plus garlic powder, fresh celery, fresh onion, and black pepper.

It was alright. A little to bland for my taste. We ended up adding lots of salt and pepper to get more flavor. It was very easy to make and was very good after adding a little extra to it.

This is a great meal!  Perfect for cold days when all you want is comfort food!  I use only two chicken breasts and one can of soup since I cook for only two of us.  I use healthy request cream of chicken to make it a little healthier.  I also add some garlic powder.  This is my go to meal when I can't think of anything to make for dinner.

YUMMY! Boy, we loved this! I changed the preparation a little bit. 
 I used the oven method and mix the rice with hot chicken broth then then topped the rice with carrots and browned chicken thighs then covered it all with the soup. I sprinkled the top with seasonings then covered with foil and baked for 1 hour. So, good

Very easy to make.  This was done in 4 hours on low.  I did add a can of coconut milk instead of water to add to the flavor and used 2 cups of rice.  If I try it next time, I'll add some spices, my family thought it was kind of bland.

This is not gourmet but for a working family this meal delivers.   It took me less than five minutes to prep and my kids will eat it.  The rice is not firm -- more like a risotto / casserole.  I used Uncle Bens Wild Rice Mix, only two chicken breast and one can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom because that was all I had.  I used baby garden carrots in one inch pieces.  The chicken pulls apart.  I cooked it 7.5 hours on high.  Served with canned corn which could be drained and added at the get go.

I made this recipe for the first time today. The only swap I made was to change the water for low-sodium chicken broth. I cooked it for 7 hours, partly because I was worried about the rice, as other reviewers have had some trouble. The chicken was cooked perfectly, as were the carrots. Unfortunately, I did have the mushy rice issue. For reference, I used the Rice-a-Roni mix. No one else said what they used but I'm assuming that's the issue. Next time I will try a different wild rice and perhaps use my own seasonings to strengthen the flavors. They were a little mild, as most people mentioned. This seems like a good base for a more complex recipe, or great if you have a picky eater who prefers milder foods.

The flavor was good, however, it was a bit salty.  I think that next time, I will have to try a different wild rice mix.

I thought this might be fast food for a busy day, and it was; it just wasn't the best slow cooker recipe I've tried. It was a little salty for me. I prefer the taste of long-grain and wild rice without the condensed soup. It could be just my taste preference. I didn't have the problem of uncooked carrots as others did because I sliced my carrots into very thin rounds.

This did not work at all for us.  I ended up with crunchy carrots and a wallpaper paste mixture.  It was also pretty bland.

The chicken was so tender is fell-off the bone. You have to use bone-in. The rice was a bit mushy. My family loved it!
