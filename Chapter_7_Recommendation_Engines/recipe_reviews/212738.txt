I made this recipe exactly as written. The taste was delicious but we found that the sauce was too thick. Will add more milk to it next time. But 2 fussy eaters ate it up and asked for it to be put in our favourite recipes to serve again and again.

easy enough for a weekday meal. I made exatcly as written except i used real grated parm cheese only because it was all i had. It taste good but kind of bland...i will make again but play with the spices a little bit...has potential
