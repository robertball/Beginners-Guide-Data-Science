I've been making this salad for several years and it's always well received.  I reduced the hot water to 1 cup, dissolve the jello and add 3/4 cup of the drained pineapple juice.  I also add 1 tsp. lemon juice. The smaller amount of liquid makes the salad firmer as I usually pour it into a jello mold.

Great recipe!  I left out the celery and added a small peeled apple instead.  I find that it really helps if you use some of the excess pinapple juice in the blender with the cranberries first.  I don't blend the oranges or apples.  I agree with only using 1 cup of water, too.  (you can also use strawberry gelatin mix)  Everyone in my family LOVES this cranberry salad!  Yummy!!!

Yummy! My whole family loved it.  It is made easier with the use of mandarin oranges.

I am not a big fan of celery in "fruity" things so I replaced it with a chopped Granny Smith apple. I also did not grind the entire orange, I grated off the orange-only of the peel for the salad, then removed the bitter white rind before chopping up the fruit in the blender. The flavor definitely improves the next day, so make it the day before you need it.

This was just the recipe I was looking for that my mom used to make.  I left out the nuts and celery (kids) and added an apple to grind up in the food processor with cranberries and the orange.  This is so easy to whip up as a side dish adn well recieved by my Christmas Eve guests.  Thanks for a winner!

I made this for Christmas dinner, I was a little nervous of what the kids might think but they LOVED it, alongwith all the adults.  I mixed the jello with the water last so it wouldn't sit.  I also used cranberry raspberry jello.  Very, very good!! =}

Awesome!  I got lots of compliments at Thanksgiving by people starting with, "I don't normally like cranberry salad but this is really good, could you give me the recipe?"  I used sugar free raspberry jello and also 3/4 c of sugar instead to lighten it.  Also only used 1 cup of hot water.

This is a really old recipe that my family has enjoyed probably since the advent of jello.  Now that cranberry jello is available, I use that instead.  The ground orange with peel is what sets this apart from so many other recipes.  Cannot say enough good things about this recipe, and am glad that it is online for others to enjoy!
EDITED TO ADD:  There is one change I would make to this recipe if you watch the video. Do. NOT slice  the whole orange in pieces and throw it in the blender with the cranberries.  First,  Peel away just the colored orange part of the peel and toss into the blender with the cranberries. Second, peel the white rind from the orange and throw it away This is white pith and very bitter.  NOW, Cut your orange in the chunks and throw it in the blender and proceed.   Always toss away the white part of the rind with any citrus recipe including recipes made with lemon????

If you're watching carbs, leave out the sugar and use sugar-free raspberry jello. A dollop of IMO on top finishes it off nicely.

Thanks for the easy recipe.  I didn't drain the
pineapple as much as I probably should have. 
I'd reduce the hot water to 1 3/4 cup 
to make the jello a bit firmer.  The family liked
it -- it's a keeper and will make it again.

I used fresh cherries and sugar free gelatin. Very bad idea. Next time, I'll stick to the recipe, minus the celery.

This was very good, and my family enjoyed it with Christmas dinner.  I used Sugar Free Cranberry Jello, and didn't add additional sugar--I'd make it again with these same modifications.

This is just amazing! Wonderful bright flavors, interesting texture, beautiful color...a perfect addition to any table! And I'll never go back to jellied cranberry sauce again!  Thank you! * I used 1/2 cup sugar and ground cranberries and orange together in my food processor.

My family didn't like anything at all with the salad.  I thought the orange took over the other taste.  I had to add by sugar that what was suggested.

I loved this recipe, but instead of using an orange i substituted orange juice for the water when making the jello, also used pecans and diced some apples instead of the pineapple. My family loved it and i was told to make it next year too... :)

This salad was wonderful! The only change I made was using orange gelatin instead of raspberry.  I've often used orange and cranberry together in other recipes so I thought the flavors would compliment and it was just perfect.  This will be made A LOT!! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe reminds me of the cranberry relish my step mom always made without the celery.  I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 c and eliminated the celery.  Very yummy!

This is a great recipe, but much work with the grinding, etc.  It turns out I doubled the recipe and no one at it besides me.  Note to self (and others): Make sure you have Cranberry lovers on hand before making!

This is a family classic, on the holiday table for as long as I can remember.  I recently added a texture tweak that has my guests raving:  use 1 cup fresh cranberries as listed, but sub in 1 cup of DRIED cranberries.  Amazing, chewy surprise!

Not sure if the amounts are the same but it is all the same ingredients. We Love this, my family has been making this since I can remember. I put it in a old Tupperware jello mold and fill the center with fresh cranberries it is so pretty and so good with the turkey. I read that some are omitting the nuts or celery Please don't it all works so well together.

This is one of my favorite recipes I've made for years. The last few years, I have omitted the pecans and celery - mostly because I didn't want to chop. I like it better without the celery. Tip on the orange -I choose a nice-skinned navel type orange since they have a thinner skin and no seeds. I trim off the peel from both ends, quarter the orange and trim off the white pith before adding to the food processer.

Great recipe, and very adaptable. I left out the celery and used apples instead of pineapple. Used my food processor to chop everything, made it quick and easy. Everybody loved it at Thanksgiving, so I've made it again for a Christmas party. I used 6 oz package of raspberry jello to make it set up better.

I took this to a postponed Thanksgiving yesterday.  We had to travel nearly 100 miles, but it survived it beautifully.  I used about 3/4 cup Sucralose(Safeway's fake sugar), three Clementines for the one orange, both walnuts and an apple, and a dark jello.  I didn't have lemon, so I added about two tablespoons of lime juice.  As others suggested, I cut down a lot on the water, and used the reserved pineapple juice as part of it.  It was crunchy(celery, nuts, and apple) and delicious--not too sweet. It was photogenic, but I forgot to do that!  We had so many delicious things that I think someone must have taken a picture.  I left the leftovers with the hostess, but my daughter and I like it a lot, so I'm going to make us another one.

This has become a holiday staple for us.  We do make it to suit the diabetics in the house, so no added sugar and sugar free jello.  It is a tart, crispy, crunchy party for the mouth!

Don't change a thing! I've made this recipe for the past 4 years and it is always a hit. You can't taste the celery flavor. I've left out the pineapple before and it surprisingly tasted the same. I have also replaced sugar with sugar substitute and sugar free jello w/ no problems. I'm lucky if I have leftovers and wish I could keep it all to myself. It's my absolute favorite. Thanks to my friend Diane for sharing it.

Recipe called for too much liquid.  I'll make it again but either decrease water or add more gelatin.  It tasted great but lacked consistency.

I've made this for years.  I don't use the orange or celery but everything else I follow.  If I can't find raspberry jello, I'll use strawberry.  My family loves it!!!  I didn't make it one holiday and heard about it until the next holiday.  I read through the reviews and think I'll try using an apple next time.

I make this every Thanksgiving because my family asks for it.  It's really delicious (with or without the celery).  I DO use much less sugar (about half the recipe) because the jello adds enough for our taste.

I really liked this and the next day it tasted even better. Got lots of compliments. I did switch out the celery for apple.  Used 1 3/4 cup liquid. Will try 1 1/2 cups next time  just to see if a firmer texture is desirable. Thanks!

I tried to make this twice. Both times it didn't set and was liquid. It seemed simple enough but it was a disaster both times. I follow recipes regularly and it doesn't happen often, so I'm not sure where it went wrong.

Took for work brunch,  everyone loved it!  Followed other reviews and reduced liquid to 1 cup, added 4 oz craisins to hot jello,  reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, added a can whole berry cranberry sauce  Loved it, will make for another gathering. Many recipe requests for this one!

The only change I made to this recipe was to use green apple instead of celery. Did not care for the taste, too strong, perhaps too bitter/tart. Will keep looking for a good cranberry recipe for next Thanksgiving.

I tried this for the first time at our Thanksgiving Day dinner. Everyone loved it, including kids. I left out the celery and would use 1.25 cups of water so that it would be thicker. I used cranberry Jello-O instead of the raspberry Jello-O mix. I knew it was a hit when I watched kids and adults get seconds and thirds on this dish! I will be making this again for our Christmas dinner!
