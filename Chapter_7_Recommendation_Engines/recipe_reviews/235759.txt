Pure comfort food! Easy to make with leftover turkey. The beef stock adds a depth of flavor without calling attention to itself. The only change I made was using turkey shaped pasta in place of the rotini.

Needed a recipe to use some of my leftover Thanksgiving turkey and this soup was a great one. A little bland until I added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper because I like some spice. Other than that I followed the recipe. My family enjoyed it very much. Very easy.

I consider any recipe to be a basic place to start. Everyone's tastes are different. This recipe is no different.  Personally I like rice in my soups rather than pasta (although I love pasta dished) and in this soup I used pre-soaked Basmati rice in place of the pasta. I'm not one to measure ingredients, I go by the "seat of my pants" as my dad would have said, but stuck fairly close to the recipe otherwise. This was made with a carcass with which I made my stock and then the stock was de-boned. My brand of rice called for a 30 minute pre-soak so very little boiling was required ( 10 minutes). I ended up with about 8 cups of liquid to which I added 1-1/2t. of both beef base and chicken base and granulated garlic. Otherwise no alterations were made. You might like a touch of cayenne  or other hot pepper if you like a little heat in your soups. Overall, a very good place to start to make your own version. All  Recipes is my "go to" cooking site.

Using beef broth made me like turkey soup! I never knew why I didn't care for poultry soups I made before, always feeling like something was missing. The beef broth was the answer to that question! Now I won't lose sleep at night wondering about it ;)

I made this recipe as is the first time and found the broth to be far too rich but definitely worth tweaking.  I substituted the stock for broth and added 3 cups of water and cut the pepper down to 1/2 tsp.  These changes definitely helped suit our tastebuds.  The beef broth does add a nice, more hearty flavor and this is a great use for turkey leftovers and the family enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing Mongolia11!

Great recipe! Added 6oz of craisins and replaced rotini with 1 cup orzo.  Don't let simmer too long. "Soup" portion will evaporate. Very large portion so I froze half of it for later. Best to add orzo or other pasta as you eat the soup so it doesn't turn to mush. Frozen in ziploc freezer bags.

I made this with my broth from a smoked turkey. 10 cups. I used 1 1/3 cup macaroni noodles & half a bag of mixed vegies with the carrots, onion, & celery. I added a can of red kidney beans and a can of diced tomatoes. The soup was awesome!

I followed this almost exactly. My only variation was adding cabbage since it was sitting in my fridge. It's a simple recipe that's easy to follow and very tasty. I'll make this an annual post-thanksgiving tradition. Thanks for the recipe!

Very impressed with this soup.  Simple ingredients that combined give it a complex flavor and richness.  I agree, the beef stock really adds another dimension to it.  Great recipe!

Excellent recipe, made exactly as stated except let simmer longer while my bread cooked (before putting in the pasta) and put about double the amount of pasta in, partly because I had a lot of turkey to work with. Also used green onion instead of white. I used the Better Than Bouillon  Beef and Chicken (3 tsp of each) with 6 cups water instead of the broth. The soup was delicious, and maybe even a tad too salty, probably because of the Better Than Bouillon. This recipe is similar to others online, except no garlic (my husband has a sensitivity), so that's why I went with this one. It was really awesome, but I still need to work on the pasta, they were a little odd. Next time maybe I'll cook the pasta separately and add in right before serving. Thank you for sharing.

Quick and easy to make!  The whole family enjoyed it.  I found the recipe called for too much pepper though so the second time I made it I cut the pepper quantity in half and it was perfect!  Will be keeping this recipe.

So easy and just wonderful for leftover turkey. The beef broth made a huge difference. I had fresh parsley so used that and added a little thyme, I had ditalini on hand and made that separately so it wouldn't get mushy with leftovers. Other than that exactly like the recipe. My husband loved it!  I will definitely make again.

I made this for a Christmas eve soup. It made the whole house smell wonderful. Tastes great  too. I used our Thanksgiving turkey carcass. I covered the carcass with water and pressure cooked it. I used the broth and meat off the bones. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasonings.  I also doubled the pasta (don't do that). Otherwise I followed the instructions.

It was not as tasty that I like it definitely needs some attention in the flavor aspect
