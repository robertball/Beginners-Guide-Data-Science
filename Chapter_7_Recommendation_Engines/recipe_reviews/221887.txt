A great simple recipe.  I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a chopped onion for a bit more flavor, but I'm sure it would be just as good as directed.  Thanks!

Succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence, but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe, composed of a few common ingredients.   Chef John really shows off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms.  Yes, you may add more things, like wine, or aromatics, but the more additions, the more complications and subbing, and then the tweaking begins!  I chose not to view the video beforehand, just to check out the instructions and the cooking times.  I went on the low side of the recommended times, and the chicken came out perfectly, with rich, delicious mushrooms.  We really enjoyed our Sunday chicken today!

I followed this recipe to the T, and it came out delicious! It was simple, quick, and had only a few main ingredients so I didn't have to go to the store to get anything off hand. It also still tasted good when I reheated it for lunch. I think next time I may add in some onions, just for some more flavor, but it was delicious!

Terrific. Quick. Simple. Delicious. No special ingredients. 
What more could a busy person ask for!
No excuse for not oooking. The video is great.

Got this recipe from a top NY chef with one twist: rub skin side with your favorite pork/chicken rub ( grab one from the store-Stonewall great) then sprinkle on other side when chick is skin down.  Fab favor and sauce. PS olive oil not needed as skin produces lots of rendered fat.-Drain excess when you turn chick in pan.

But if you have on hand scallions and garlic, don't hesitate to add them just before the chicken.  A little white wine is good to add just before transferring to the oven

Incredible. Try it as is for the easiest weeknight meal you'll ever make or add your own seasonings. You can't miss with this one.

Practically perfect.  Try this...delete the salt, put a chicken bullion cube in the water and heat it first, then add 3 tablespoons of Marsala wine.

Excellent! I’m on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill. I did not use boneless chicken breasts because I believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor. I used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half. I’m a seasoned cook and I always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus. I watched Chef John’s video of this recipe and I think that I saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video. Chef John always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and I’d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning. :) I served this with Sarah’s Rice Pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2nd side dish. It was a delicious meal.

I tried this off a whim, and it was superb! I have a few plans to add my own flare, but this alone is quite good and very easy to do! Thumbs up!

The challenge factor made me curious, so I had to try it. The meat was good, tender and cooked through. The accompanying sauce, however, was unrelentingly bland..  To increase the flavor, simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality. I mean, if adding butter was acceptable, why not stock? An interesting culinary exercise, however.

Excellent dish.  Just follow the recipe and video exactly and it is no-fail.  My spouse picked up the chicken at the market, and as it is often the case, came back with the wrong item. :-)  It was chicken leg quarters.  We followed the same recipe and it was delicious.

Maintain control and you won't be disappointed   I added this to my rotation and the family never grows tired of it.   Only tip I would add is to throw a handle cover over the handle of your skillet after you remove it from the oven.  I've grabbed that hot handle more than once when I returned to the stove to add the water   I guess I could have said I only did it once and appeared a little smarter?

This is a fantastic recipe!!  My husband (who doesn't even like mushrooms) raved about it.  The flavor is spectacular.  Don't add anything else or delete anything.  Try it as written and you'll be hooked!

This was quite good and very easy. I made some egg noodles to go with it and added the mushrooms and sauce to the noodles.

Mushrooms were flavorful, and if I took a bit of mushroom and chicken together it was alright. But I made it according the recipe and the chicken was dry and flavorless. Not a fan

Wow! If you are in need of some cooking inspiration, try this recipe, its like a food mediation and the end result is fabulous. Is chef John making millions of dollars on food network? If not, he certainly should be. I was blown away by this recipe that is full of flavor despite its simplicity. This has become part of my regular repertoire and I haven't made any adjustments or experiments with it. Its simply delicious as is (though I use baby bells generally). I usually serve it with equally simple mashed potatoes (goes great with mushroom sauce) and sautéd spinach. My family thinks its interesting to eat four things for dinner. I tell everyone about this recipe even friends I know are great cooks.

Loved it!!   This was so good!  It did teach me a lesson.. simple is better sometimes and this was simplicity at its best!  The aroma from the mushrooms after they came out of the oven was amazing!  I will do this again, the only change (and I know it was a little off beat) was to make white rice :)  Please forgive me Chef John

I haven't watched the video yet, but with the great instructions in the recipe, you don't really even need to!  The only thing that is off is the timing because at least the first time you make it, it will take you longer than 40 minutes.  This is a great basic recipe that needs nothing else to make it taste good, but I can see why some would want to add more to it.  Sometimes, however, less is more!  Very nice!

Another great recipe by Chef John. I loved this chicken recipe!!! I didn't have bone in chicken breasts so I used what I had, boneless skinless. I knew that the timing would be much less with this cut so I checked the chicken at ten minutes and they had reached 175 at that point. I used cremini mushrooms and subbed 1/2 the amount of water for a dry white wine. The chicken was so moist and the mushroom added so much flavour. Thanks again Chef John, another winner.

This is one of my regular rotation meals, but I don't challenge myself to the two ingredient rule, what for? It goes from good to amazing with a few extra ingredients. After browning the chicken all over (which renders a lot of fat off for a lighter gravy), I pour off all put one tablespoon of chicken fat and cook an onion for one minute with one clove of minced garlic until light brown, scraping up all the browned bits from the chicken. Add the chunky cut mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of flour and sautee for a minute. I add one cup of chicken broth and a tablespoon of fresh thyme. Bring to the boil and pour over the chicken (I use a whole chicken cut in 8 pieces) cover and slow cook at about 300 degrees for about 45 minutes or until chicken wing pulls off easily when you tug on it. Garnish with fresh chives or parsley before serving. And don't forget to serve that luscious gravy over the chicken and mashed potatoes.

Chef John..........This was a "test" of following directions and I thank you!  I have been cooking most of my life.  Cordon Bleu, Tuscan and Floretine Cooking classes all start with the simple basics; fresh ingredients and "don't cloud the flavors"............thanks for reminding me.  I am an "older" lady who still needs to be reminded now and then to start from square one and savor the results. 
11/11/16  I have now made this recipe many, many times over the past 2+ years, I make it the same way, no additional ingredients but now I buy and use one whole fryer (2  1/2 to 3 lbs) I cut it up, removing the back, wing tips and any extra fat which is actually pretty hard to find on such a small chicken. Using a whole chicken allows me to use some dark meat also which has more flavor and retains more moisture, since I have more meat I add another 1/2 cup of chicken broth at the end when I'm adding the butter.  I like serving this recipe with a wild rice blend and something a little tangy/tart like whole cranberry 
sauce.

Excellent! Made the recipe almost exactly as written and this was very, very tasty. Maybe just a little too much salt though. Used kosher salt and unsalted butter. The only minor change was I didn't add additional salt and pepper as instructed after stirring in the butter. Thought the salt could have been reduced further. My mom, who always uses salt at the table no matter what she's eating, didn't add any to this. Next time maybe will leave out the pinch of salt after adding the mushrooms. But that was a tiny flaw. Wasn't able to buy boneless chicken breasts with the skin on, so bought bone-in ones. However, I discovered it was very easy to de-bone the breasts, which I did myself. Definitely will make this again and again.  One thing - I don't recommend leaving these in the oven longer than 15 minutes. One of my chicken breasts was a little smaller than the other, so I left that one in the oven for 15 minutes and the other for 20. I should have taken both out about 5 minutes earlier than I did.  Next time I will use a meat thermometer, as recommended. It was still very delicious though.

Very good, chicken is moist, mushrooms are very tasty.  Update:  Still one of Hubby's favourites.  I have also used bone-in chicken thighs when I couldn't find breast with the skin still on.

I've made this several times, and sometimes I replace half of the water with white wine. This is good and simple. I rotate many of Chef John's recipes to keep my taste buds tittilated!

Thank you, Chef John!  Your chicken and mushrooms recipe (exactly as written) (with mashed potatoes and peas as side dishes to add a little colour :) ) was dinner tonight.  I have been wanting to make this for a while -- and am glad I did!  It was so awesome to use a few simple ingredients that we always have on hand to create the most incredible meal hubby and I have had for a very long while.  (I must admit, somewhat ashamedly, that I actually bought chicken broth to use instead of the water, but I decided to trust you -- and am really glad I did!). This is definitely a favourite in our house and will be repeated many times -- as written!  Thanks again!

I just could not believe how good this chicken came out!! I followed Chef John´s steps exactly and it was really delicious!! So hard to believe how good such a simple dish can be. The skin on the chicken is fundamental to the taste (even if you don´t eat it, as most in my crew do not.)so you gotta have it for the browning.

This is such a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe!  Like Chef John said, it's a baseline to be used to make your own creations, add your own personal touches.  As is, it's flavorful and dinner-worthy, and a great learning technique for beginners.  Well done Chef John!

I substituted white wine for the water, because I had some I needed to use up.  It was awesome!  I'd double if not triple the mushrooms next time.

Great quick and easy recipe that's simple but very tasty. We used boneless skinless breast because that's what we had.  We also doubled the mushrooms and sauteed them with half an (large) onion. Served with mixed vegetables and creamy chicken rice.  Great recipe!

Very good and I think Chef John accomplished what he set out to do with this one.  We did add onions which did no complicate the recipe at all.  This is a simple dish that delivers!

This is a great recipe!! This is my second time trying. I don't care for chicken breast (white meat) so I used boneless chicken thighs.  Awesome!  Still great.  I just love Chef John's recipe. Thanks

Love love love this. I followed this just as written only adding one more chicken breast and it was awesome!! Not only is it a wonderful meal but the leftover chicken is great in loaded mashed potato casserole! You must try this! Do it the same way chef John does it the first time and you won't be sorry.

This is really very good. Seemed confusing with a lot of steps, but followed them and it turned out just like he would say: Simple and very flavorful. I print out a recipe and if it works out place it in a 3-ring binder for future use. After eating my wife saw me throw the recipe away and demanded an explanation. I had spilled on it so printed out another. We both loved it and are having it again tonight!

I have made this twice.  The chicken is juicy every time.  The other cook who said the recipe was dry, obviously did not follow the directions.

The skin is important to give flavor to the dish.  I had to ask the butcher for skin on chicken breasts, then had to bone them.  Well worth the time, my son loved this dish.

I also used a thermometer as was recommend and although I cooked the chicken up to 170, it was still moist.

I will make this often, maybe a bit of garlic next time, but this is a great recipe.

Absolutely superb!
 My wife and I came to the conclusion some time ago that the simplest meals are the ones we most often enjoy the most. Therefore, when I saw this recipe I knew I wanted to try it. 
 For the first time I did it exactly as Chef John did. It turned out fabulous! We could taste the pure simple flavours of the chicken and mushrooms together, and loved every bite.
 Next time perhaps I'll try substituting white wine for the water to see how that turns out. However, it'd pretty hard to top what we just finished for supper 15 minutes ago!

Really flavorful, tender chicken even though I used skinless breasts.  I added a little soup base granules with the water to compensate for the lack of skin, since Chef John said the skin was essential to flavor.

I used fresh shiitakes pre-sliced at the supermarket.  

This is the first time I have used a skillet in the oven so I had to go buy a stainless steel pan that was oven safe to 400.  I thought it was silly that they felt compelled to warn me on the label that the handle would be hot when removed from the oven.

Yet here I am soaking my fingers in an ice water bath because I forgot to use a mitt.  

Regardless, delicious dish and will make again with proper PPE.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Mushrooms are my favorite thing and this recipe will ensure I enjoy them a lot more often. Next time I will need to sear the skin a bit longer than 5 minutes, but overall this is a great, quick and simple recipe. I seasoned with a bit more than salt and pepper. I use Adobo and Sazon. I also paired it with mixed greens and grape tomatoes topped with Balsamic Vinegar, which mixed nice with the Mushroom sauce.

Could not find boneless breasts with skin on, so used the bone in split breasts, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Just took a little while longer to cook. It was absolutely delicious, and the family loved it.  I had one request from my daughter: to also use bone in thighs  since she likes the dark meat better.  This is definitely a keeper.

I did the ingredients as written, but did not bake in oven.  I cooked it on the stove the entire time.  Turned out nice, served w/ noodles.

Amazing.  The only addition I made was to use a grinder that had mixed garlic and salt.  Easy, fast and absolutely delicious!  Oh--I used skinless chicken breasts that I had previously frozen, it still was exceptionally tender.

I have made this chicken several times.  It is painful to stick to the premise that you don't add anything extra but I do it.  And I am always glad that I did.  Such a wonderful taste of pure chicken and mushrooms, it's delightful!

Simple, cheap, yum. The chicken itself turned out phenomenal. Snacked on the mushrooms by themselves, they were great as well. Good simple food.

With great self-restraint I made it exactly like the recipe/video. Even though I had white wine, fresh thyme and minced shallots at the ready. It was so flavorful and juicy. Lesson learned.....Simplicity wins. I will definitely make it again.

An excellent, tasty meal. It really brings out the flavour of the chicken and mushrooms. We found we needed less salt but that's just a matter of personal taste.

First time followed recipe exactly.  Fantastic, perhaps the most flavorful mushrooms ever.  Second time, my only tweak was to use stock rather than water, which I always make from the carcass.  Recipe is simple and delicious.  I have made this a number of times and everyone seems to agree.  Of course, I never tell them how simple it is.

Don't know who Chef John is but his recipes kick . Another make again. Not quite 5 stars but 4.5 if I could give it. White meat came out tender. Mushroom sauce was fantastic...probably needed more but I did have an extra chicken breast the recipe did not call for. Anyway very very good.

So good it's crazy. The chicken is so moist, probably because of the high moisture content in the mushrooms. I use skinless chicken so I add an extra 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil to make up for the fat loss, otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe is written. Goes well with any side dish or vegetable. Literally any, from applesauce to zucchini.

Yummy!  The rich mushroom sauce was decadent for a plain old chicken breast.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  Next time I'll also add an onion and a couple garlic cloves with the mushrooms.   Very good as written, but a couple of easy additions and it'll be five star!

We looooved this!  I added a half an onion to the mushrooms in the pan, and found that when the chicken was done cooking the mushrooms were perfectly flavored, no need to make the sauce.  I also used a combination of butter and coconut oil which added great flavor.  Thanks!

Recipe was simple- overall flavor was a little lacking with the chicken itself. I chose not to add more salt to the mushrooms (figured I have enough sodium between the salt rubbed on chicken and the butter) so maybe I needed to do that for the sauce, which might have in turn helped the chicken and its blandness. If add the salt next time and maybe even some white wine.

I made this in a pinch with what I had on hand, boneless skinless breasts, canned mushrooms, onion powder on the mushrooms. Husband judged it a keeper and has asked for it again. That makes it five stars in my recipe book

I really love this recipe. It's delicious and easy. BUT it's impossible for me to fine boneless chicken breast with the skin on. I usually have to get it with the bone in and take it off the bone which is way more work. That's the only reason it gets four stars instead of five. 5 for flavor but 4 for not being easily accessible.

Love this! I added caramelized onions, used chicken broth instead of water and added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce. Was delicious over penne pasta and I added some spinach to the base!

YUM! I made this last night and it was delicious - and so easy!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because it's all I had and I added diced red onion, chopped up a garlic clove, and poured a splash of cooking sherry to the mushrooms.  Right at the end I added some grape tomatoes that I had cooked in a fry pan with olive oil, S&P.  For sides I just made some egg noodles and some fresh corn on the cob.

Took Chef John's simple principles to cook the chicken,  but sautéed some onions,  green peppers and red poblanos. Baked them w the chicken then used large Portobello mushrooms (olive oiled n grilled) as burger buns w a touch of homemade dijon.  Delicious.  Thanks, Chef John for the inspiration.

Simplicity. The recipe is as simple as you can get and demonstrates what a simple sauce can do, as it brings the flavors of the pan together. As others did, I added a few of my own ingredients that needed to be used: red pepper, diced; onion, diced; and sherry to deglaze the pan which brought out the sweetness of the pepper and mushrooms.

I followed this simple recipe for the most part except that I substituted a 1/2 cup of white wine instead of the  water in Step 6. It added that little sumthin' to the shrooms that put it over the top for me.

Made this for dinner last night almost as written.  We only use boneless, skinless chicken so the skinless part was the change.  However a nice high heat under my stainless steel pan and I still got a nice crispy coating with some of those little brown, flavorful pieces.  I was a bit concerned that it might be a little bland but to my surprise this dish has a very nice flavor and texture component to it.  Served it with some saffron rice and sautéed zucchini and carrots and it was a winner.  Goes into our rotation.  We eat a lot of chicken so anytime I can get a performer like this one, I am golden.  Thanks Chef John.

This recipe is outstanding!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which I liberally salted and peppered.  I tripled the amount of mushrooms and sauce ingredients.  Aside from the tripling of ingredients, I followed exactly.  If you're a fan of mushrooms, this recipe is for you!  If you love Chef John as I do, try his grilled mongolian pork chops.  To die for!  BTW, I used cremini mushrooms

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out absolutely awesome. Chicken was moist and tender, mushrooms were flavorful (I used portobella). I will definitely be making this again and just maybe I'll deglaze the pan with a little white wine :)

A very easy recipe...that gets you back to basics. With the simplicity of the recipe, the true flavors of all the ingredients is succulent. I also put a splash of dry sherry in the gravy, for a little bit of a personal flavor boost. Definitely will be making this again.

It is good - a good derivative is to add garlic and some scallions and don't forget the butter at the end. Simple, easy and yummy. In my house I have to scale everything up and the quantities work. If you want a bit more juice for on top of your risotto or rice, add a bit of chick broth.

This recipe was fantastic! It really pays to go minimalist, the flavors from the mushrooms are to die for! I did accidentally buy bone-in chicken breast halves and find it hard to find boneless at my local grocery store but it still turned out great, they just need to be in the over for about an hour, instead of the 15 to 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe, chef john!

If the recipe had suggested chicken broth or white wine in place of the water, it would be 5 stars.  I highly suggest making this substitution. I also tend to thicken the sauce slightly with cornstarch or flour to make it more like a gravy.  Serve with mashed potatoes and a green veggie for a really great weeknight meal.

This is an excellent recipe. Used skinless breasts which browned nicely. I cut the salt an added a bit of chicken bullion and marsala wine to the water. This takes chicken to another level. Love this recipe.

This was so delicious that I made it twice in one week. The only thing I did different was using skinless, boneless chicken breast because that was what I had. Everything else, I kept as is. Definitely a keeper.

Wow. This was really easy but extremely good!!  Juicy and so flavorful.  I've never made chicken that turned out this good before.  This will now be my "go to" recipe for chicken.  I did sprinkle a little McCormick's Poultry Seasoning on one side of the chicken at the last minute before putting it in the oven, as I'd read someone else's review that said that they added a little garlic seasoning. Probably not necessary but it was delish.  My other half kept commenting on how moist and delicious it was throughout the entire meal, and said that normally it's good to eat the skin because it has the most flavor usually...but that there was no need to eat this skin because the chicken was amazing all on it's own.  YUMMY!  Next time I will be using 16 ounces of mushrooms, though, so there's plenty left for the leftover piece the next day (we share one of the chicken breasts for dinner because they are often pretty big). I am thrilled to have this simple but AWESOME recipe in my repertoire.  I'll definitely use it for guests!!  BTW, for sides we had a baked potato with sour cream & chives, and steamed asparagus.  UPDATE-- Made this again, just using salt & pepper (no other seasonings) and also, cut each breast in two pcs so that they would cook more quickly.  I am going to use this method going forward.

Watched the video & followed the directions to the tee. Tasted fine but just okay, nothing special. I'll only try it again if I'm short of ingredients/time but will definitely tinker with the seasonings. White wine or even chicken broth instead of plain water, garlic during the last saute, etc.

I read the reviews before I attempted this recipe and wanted to see for myself if the four ingredients could actually "get the job done" and satisfy my awaiting taste buds.  OMG! Much to my surprise and delight, the flavor was robust and pleasing.  This was simplest recipe I have ever tried!  I didn't do anything different from the original recipe and not sure if I will tweak it in the future. Except, I didn't have a frying pan I could place in the oven so had to use a frying pan on the stove and then transfer to a glass dish and then back again to a frying pan for the final steps. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is fantastic. I've made it several times with and without onions. I fell in love with it and so did my family. My youngest, 7 who typically refuses mushrooms adored them. He said that this was "the best chicken in the world!" I would have to agree. Yum. Try it. It's simple and tastes wonderful!

A little bland, but pretty good considering the sauce is mushrooms, butter and water. I will probably dress it up a little more next time.

I cooked this in a pan instead of the oven. I was a little confused to the pan to oven directions. For some reason, my chicken had a very rubbery texture. However, my biggest issue was that the amount of sauce just wasn't enough and the sauce didn't have much flavor. I thought wine or broth would have been better than the water. It appears, other had great success though.

Amazing!!! I used skinless chicken breasts, and then added some garlic with the mushrooms (I don't know how to cook without garlic!).  Cooked on the low side (15 minutes in oven) and it came out perfect and delicious!

Wow, this is just so good and so simple. The chicken was moist( even though I used frozen boneless skinless breasts). The simple preparation make the real chicken flavor come out and the mushroom sauce was also very flavorful. Saved me money too! Will definitely make again. Thanks Chef John!

This was a very good dish, but I can no longer buy boneless chicken breast with skin on. I used bone in legs and it turned out fine. You can't cook the chicken or mushrooms as long as stated and need to use lower heat or it begins to burn. I didn't have a skillet that could go in the oven so after browning the chicken and adding the mushrooms I added a tiny bit of water, simmered then had to add a bit more water. I removed the chicken and added the water called for and the butter. The chicken wasn't quite done so after removing it from the skillet I put it in the microwave for 3 minutes, on high. It turned out very good but it was a lot of work. Messy to make as the oil popped all over the stove and me. 
I will try it one more time after I buy a skillet that can be put in the oven.

Winner, winner! Chicken dinner! Made this exactly as directed, except used bone-in chicken breasts. Amazing. When I read the ingredients, I thought, "no way". But, was pleasantly surprised. Whole family loved it!

This was delicious! I prepared the entire recipe on the stovetop, because it was too hot to use the oven. I/4 cup water and 1/4 sauvignon blanc were the only substitution I made. Huge hit with fussy hubby! 
Served it with fresh green beans and a Dutch combo called Leiden hutspot (mashed carrots, potatoes, onions). Wonderful!

Really enjoyed this! I added an onion with the mushrooms but other than that followed the recipe verbatim. Served with cooked carrots that I tossed with garlic, salt and pepper, a little bit of butter and lemon juice.

I had 2 large skinless and boneless chicken breasts that I sliced horizontally in half instead. Followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great. Family loved it.

This was delicious and simple. Which makes it easy to add other flavor if wanted. I added minced garlic towards the end of the pan juice sauté and when I seasoned the chicken. This gave it the extra flavor. Great recipe, especially for someone who forgets to keep wine or chicken stock/broth around for cooking, will absolutely use this recipe again!!

The only change I made was I used chicken stock instead of water otherwise stuck to the recipe and the suggested times.  Served over brown and wild rice with veggies...this one will be repeated many times, next time perhaps with chicken thighs.  Very tasty.

Delicious exactly as written!  I’m doing Whole30 so I subbed the butter for ghee. I also used chicken breast cutlets with no skin because it is what I had. I served it over a cauliflower mash and it was a very hearty dinner even my cycling husband raved about.

This was a hit in our  house.  Good comfort food, and easy to make. The chicken came out very moist.  The mushrooms didn't exactly make a sauce, but that hardly matters given how good they were. I made the whole thing is a large cast iron frying pan and given how much the mushrooms shrink in the oven,  next time I'll double them to a full pound.

This was a spectacular recipe. I paired it with green beans as well - salt, pepper, and squeezed lemon over the top, roasted for about 25 minutes at the same temperature as the main dish. That helped fill out the meal while maintaining its simplicity. I'll be making this many more times.

My husband loved it. Chicken was perfectly juicy and done.  I  always have trouble getting my chicken cooked thoroughly and still be moist but this was perfect. Will make more mushrooms next time but needs nothing changed. It was delicious.

My husband and I thought it was absolutely fantastic! I just wish I made more mushrooms with it. Dumb thing I did was burn my hand on the skillet handle when I went to stir the mushrooms after taking them out of the oven. I’ve done that once before, but this time was worse. Next time I will keep the potholder on the pan handle. The recipe came out lovely though.

Really good! Our store sells skin-on chicken and somehow these breasts always are huge. Three in a package crowded the skillet so I cooked baby bell mushrooms after transferring these to the oven. The brown bits ended up in the baking dish so I added a little water to that and stirred to remove it from there and poured it into the mushroom and water mixture in the browning skillet left out of the oven. The dish has lots of flavor and the meat is tender. I served it with white rice.

Made as is except did not use water with the mushrooms. Butter, Oyster flavour sauce and mushroom broth did the trick. The mushrooms were like candy.

Supurb. I did make egg noodles to go with this and doubled the chicken so I used 4x the amount of sauce to make sure there was plenty of gravy. Definitely a repeat.

I eat a lot of chicken breast but I’m not really a fan of it. This recipe (I did it exactly as shown) was so easy and turned out perfect.  In the future, I would probably use white wine or maybe with s little balsamic but I could eat it every night even as is.

So yummy. I made yummy noises throughout dinner. Made it for my mom and she loved it too. I did use 1/4 white wine and 1/4 water, as I had wine handy. Also finished with Kerry garlic herb butter. Just delish and so simple, easy to throw together too.

I would give it 4.5 if i could.
Excellent.  Easy.   I just want a little more flavor.
I substituted lemon pepper for the initial seasoning, and I think I'll add some minced garlic and diced onion to the olive oil before I put the chicken in.

Turned out great each time I've made it.   Works well with bone in chicken thighs too. 

I started out with the straight recipe and it was yummy.   The next  time I did it I added onion, a bit of minced garlic  and some herbs.  You simply cannot go wrong with this recipe.

I made this as written except that there is no such thing as boneless skin-on chicken breasts in my world.  Unless I want to risk loss of fingers and bone the chicken myself—no thank you!  It was very tasty, but I think it would have been better with the crispy, tasty skin.

Simple recipe to execute and the only change I made was to add some white wine to deglaze the pan.  Didn't "wow" me, but tasted just fine.

Used vegetable broth instead of water because I had some to use up, but it really wasn't needed.

I was disappointed!  If Chef John thinks this dish is good, he  needs to rethink this recipe.  It was very bland, and it needed some fresh herbs in order to make it (at least) palatable.  This dish needs a lot  more 'umami', so where is that?  Get some flavorful dried mushrooms & re-constitute them, and use the water in which you re-constituted them in the recipe.  I'm not bragging, but I made better Chicken & Rice when I was 14 yrs. old.

Another winner from Chef John! I used chicken thighs because that’s what I prefer, had a small amount of red wine leftover so I added it in the pan before putting it in the oven, & used homemade chicken stock instead of water. It was easy, delicious & this will be going into regular rotation here.

This turned out very nice. I used chicken stock instead of water and served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of steamed asparagus.  I made a double lot so my wife had something to take to work.

Mostly followed the recipe, except that all cooking, other than the browning of the chicken, was done on the grill. Turned out very moist and we loved it! I did add carrots to the packet. My Wife, who usually eats very little, scarfed every bit. Definitely a keeper.

I've been making this recipe for years now. It's still the best chicken recipe I've ever made. Yes, like Chef John says, you can embellish the recipe, but then you lose the Zen magic of just 3 ingredients. Do it as written, then next time, use wine instead of the water. That's the only thing I've ever changed.

How can something so simple with so few ingredients taste so good? My husband raved about it and wished I had fixed a double portion. The only thing I did extra was to add a bit of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it.

Yay!! And Yum!! So easy and it turned out awesome! This will definitely be a recipe I make again and again. I lucked out and got all the sauce for myself because my daughter didn’t want any ... otherwise I’d want to try to double the sauce next time. Great recipe!

I had to use skinless chicken breasts so I just sauteed the mushrooms and added onions as well. After sauteeing with some garlic I added chicken stock and then the chicken breasts. My husband loved it! I served it over jasmine rice. I did not have any leftovers. Fantastic!

I did not make any changes. It is one of my all time favorites! Learn how to debone the chicken breast. Although on a lazy or busy day I have made it with the bones.  It does taste better cooking it with the skin on so avoid buying the boneless/skinless breasts. I did have to go out and buy a skillet that would go in the oven. I feel like a real chef when I make this.

Absolutely delicious ! Followed everything except the pan. I used cast iron and I doubled the recipe for my family. Just added some roasted veggies since oven was set to 400. Thank u Chef John, for challenging us to keep it simple.

This recipe is tasty and super-simple. Instead of putting the chicken in the oven, I put it in a crock pot on low for four hours. The flavors blended together beautifully and the chicken was very tender. YUM!

My husband loves this simple dish. I've made it multiple times. After a few tries, I decided to add one thing: 1 tsp of flour before I add the water. A roux to make gravy. What can I say, he loves gravy.

I made this with chicken thighs instead of breast. I had to cook it in the oven for 40 minutes, instead of 20 because of the thighs, and the mushrooms were very chewy as a result, but I like them that way. For more tender 'shrooms you could remove them and then add them back in for the last 20 minutes of cooking. Served it with buttered kluski noodles with some of the mushroom sauce over them. Yum!

Excellent basic chicken and mushroom recipe. Have used this technique many times and find it is much more interesting with a little tarragon which brings out the flavors of both the white mushrooms and the chicken. Thank you Chef John!

Made according to recipe with no changes. So simple but so delicious. Looked like a gourmet meal when plated. Next time I will probably omit the salt on the mushrooms as I found the dish slightly too salty for my taste.

This was really great! I really love the peppery flavor in the sauce.  I only made two changes. I added a little cornstarch to the water to thicken it up and I splashed some fresh lemon juice in the sauce at the end. Super easy. Super tasty. Another hit by Chef John!

This is a tasty dish.  I will probably make it again, but I will want to increase the amount of the pan juices for use on mashed potatoes as a side dish.  I cooked it for the longer time of 20 minutes.  Next time I will use the lower time as the chicken was just a bit on the dry side.

This was the juiciest chicken I have ever made! I did brine the chicken first since I used skinless large chicken breasts and cooked it in cast iron. I even used canned mushrooms. It was still great.

Fantastic recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken and my homeade chicken broth instead of water with lots of mushrooms. We served the chicken over spinach noodles. Thank you Chef John for sharing basic recipes.

Outstanding, especially using a cast iron skillet. I used skinless, boneless breasts followed cooking times for the most part, using a thermometer to check doneness. The only ingredient I added was to use some Creole seasoning in addition to the pepper and salt. I cut the amount of salt on the chicken since it wasn't needed with the Creole addition.

Great base recipe! I've made 2 ways now-sprinkling garlic powder on the chicken, subbing water for chicken broth and adding 1/4 c red cooking wine and also same adds above but adding sun dried tomatoes sliced thin on the step after removing chicken from pan. Adds a great tartness!!

I recommend using more than just 8 ounces of mushrooms. They shrink pretty quickly and we really enjoyed mushrooms. Also, there is a lot to be said about using chicken breast with the skin on. I used skinless and regretted it. The skin on would create much more flavor.

This was easy and fast. I will make it again for sure. I used skinless chicken breasts bc that's what I had and it was still moist and tender. I added some cornstarch at the very end to thicken the sauce a little bit. Next time I will double the amount of mushrooms. It was delicious. I did burn my hand on the hot pan though...again.

Fantastic. I appreciate the simplicity of it. If you find yourself wanting to add or adjust anything while cooking it, I say go for it. I think that was John's intent in making such a simple recipe. If you follow the recipe exactly, then you will at least learn the technique and that will inspire you to experiment further.

I used white wine instead of water and wilted some spinach in with the butter. I also added some onions and garlic with the mushrooms. I only have skinless chicken breast, but it still turned out great.

Easy, easy, easy. And such comfort food! I added an extra cup of water and a spoonful of chicken bullion to make more of a gravy for the chicken, thickened with corn starch and served over mashed potatoes. So good on a cold winter's night! Thanks, Chef John.

Both my husband thought this was really good... the only downfall was that the sauce was a little too watery. Maybe we need to wait longer next time for more of the water to evaporate? Other than that it was really good! I served it up with a side of garlicy kale.

I've made this twice now. I use the amount of salt and pepper on the chicken that i know my family likes.
I also add a bit of flour to thicken the gravy at the end. 
Comfort food? Oh yeah. Add mash and corn. YUM!

Very simple recipe, but very good. I added about half of a sweet onion and opted for a Dutch Oven rather than a pan. I definitely left the sauce on the burner to long, and ended up with less than I was expecting. It was a rookie mistake, but in the end didn't detract from the final product.

Used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that is what I had on hand. I thought it was really good and would make again. I made it because my hubby loves mushrooms. He thought it was good, but no raves.

I made this recipe and the only changed the water to chicken broth. this is not only an easy recipe but also delicious! i did, however suffer 1st and 2nd degree burns to my left hand because I  grabbed the handle after removing it from the oven to finish up the mushrooms. PLEASE WRAP THE PAN HANDLE IMMEDIATELY UPON REMOVING THE PAN FROM THE OVEN. Otherwise a most delicious recipe and I finished it after 2 hours at Urgent Care.

I love listening to Chef John.  This recipe looked good and easy, and since I love chicken, we gave it a try.  It is so delicious!  We will make it again.  We used Crimini mushrooms, since they are my favorites.  I assume it would have a slightly different taste with different mushrooms.

Yum yum yum! I LOVE mushrooms and my husband kind of hates them, when I first met him he absolutely hated them but I've cooked him a few dishes where the mushrooms did not taste earthy and he was happy. This is one of those recipes. When he saw me cooking it he was really scared by the large amount of mushrooms and that they were fresh (we both hate the flavor of fresh, uncooked mushrooms, too earthy tasting). After eating this he said he thought he was "getting more used to the taste of mushrooms" lol (it's really just that it's a great recipe but it's okay, I'll let him think that.) Thanks for making my husband a mushroom "liker"! As for me, being that I am a mushroom lover, I was in love with this recipe! We are also on the Atkins (low carb, high protein) diet and so this meal was perfect for us. :) Served with some cheesy (mozzarella) veggies.

If you can find enoki mushrooms for this, they are fantastic!!  Sometimes I'll add a little cream to the sauce instead of water. Otherwise no changes.

It's always good to have simple chicken recipes in your repertoire and this one is no exception. So simple and so delicious! I made a few changes, using skinless breasts instead of skin on and in lieu of water, I used some beef stock. Choice of mushroom can really make a difference, I elected to go with creminis as they have a great beefy flavour (hence the beef stock addition) Great weeknight dinner but can be fancy enough to entertain with. Yum!

I used Portobello mushrooms, which were terrific with this dish.  It's a very simple, wonderful chicken dish.  Not "fussy", just nice tasting and relatively easy to make.  I say "relatively" because I personally hate using an iron skillet.  It's heavy and it's a PITA to wash.  But, that being said:  Loved it!

I tried this "experiment" when I was cooking for my grandma because she tends to like simpler dishes. Now she thinks I am some sort of gourmet. She asks for me to make it for her all of the time. I use chicken broth instead of water and sometimes chicken thighs instead of breasts.

Really juicy chicken! Could have used twice as many mushrooms and a variety thereof. Just really simple and tasty!

This is simple, tasty dish. I also used paprika, onion powder to season the chicken and used white wine instead of water to add more flavor.

I made as directed.  The chicken was moist and very tasty.  The mushrooms however became tough and dried out though their flavour was delicious.  I intend to make this again, but will try adding the mushrooms just prior to placing the pan in the oven.

I didn't give in to the temptation to use wine or herbs.  I did use thighs (we love dark meat and it was on sale) and portabella mushrooms.  Did everything as directed.  My husband and I both thought it was one of the best chicken dishes we've had.  A case where less is truly more!

I used chicken thighs and baked them for 30 min. Don't add any water if you want your sauce be creamy. I served it with garlic bread to soap up the juice. It was so simple to make and sooo delicious

Made just like recipe called for except had a different pan but could still go in oven.  Had 3 large breasts and even de-boned them myself! Just followed the bone line with a sharp knife - and frozen the "tenders" that come loose for  future use.  My husband loved this! The chicken was so moist and tender - I was surprised and pleased.  Used a larger package of mushrooms as they were on sale. This is a keeper! Love Chef John!

I made this tonight and it came out seriously delicious....Chef John did it again with a most wonderful recipe. I followed his recipe exactly except for the timing in the oven, I doubled it to 35 minutes. I'm glad I did. The breasts these days are very big and my timing had the breast coming out absolutely perfect and tender, done and juicy. What a nice recipe that I will not only make over and over but even serve to company, it was that good. I also used my cast iron skillet as that was the only one I had that can go on top of stove and in the oven.....just perfect!

Made this last week and the family raved about it! Was afraid it was going to be bland but I trust chef John so, I didn't change a thing except for using thighs and it was seriously amazing. My BFF made it the other day and she loved it too! Making it again tonight at the request of my two teenagers and one of them doesn't even like mushrooms! Thanks for a great recipe and technique Chef John! You bring much happiness to our family table!

I added chopped onions to the mix and I didn't have an ovenproof skillet, so I started it on the skillet and transferred to a casserole dish. Don't overlook the chicken. I didn't cook the full 5 minutes on the stove. I didn't want it crispy. When the chicken was nearly done in the oven, I sautéed the mushroom mixture and substituted wine, and returned chicken to the oven. I served it over pad Thai noodles that I had on hand. Yummy!

Didn't plan on making this, just had what I needed for this recipe on hand when I came across it.   My chicken was skinless.  This is a super easy recipe.  
I usually make the recipe as written, or try to as I hate to see someone completely change a recipe, but I knew that with our taste we would like additional flavoring.  I added a minced garlic clove, fresh thyme and I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also deglazed the pan with a bit of sherry wine before adding the broth.  It seems as if wine deglzes my Le Creuset Cast Iron skillet the best. I would double the sauce next time it was very good.

Fantastic simple recipe.  Making a sauce with cold butter is a cooking trick that works miracles on sauce every time.  Make sure the butter is very cold.

We will do this again for sure!  Gave it a 4 only because we made a few changes.  1) All that was on hand was chicken quarters.  Broke those down and used bone-in.  That added cooking time.  2)  Added extra mushrooms and added onions.  Straight up yum factor is why. 3) Rubbed some chicken seasoning on and cut back on the amount of salt. 4) Used chicken broth instead of water.  It was what was left over from the rice and didn't want to waste it.

I love this recipe, I tried it today using bone-in chicken thighs with skin, be careful with the salt, the mushrooms and chicken skin seem to absorb and retain it. I just recently found that I love mushrooms and Chef John always has amazing recipes, so i had to try it and i loved it, thanks Chef John

I made these exactly as Chef John said, avoiding the temptation to add stuff as he urged viewers of the video. The meal was delicious, flavorful, and super moist. It will be a staple in coming years. It took longer to bake during the oven phase - by about 20 minutes - but the chicken breasts were very plump so probably took extra long. Mostly, with all that time in the oven? The chicken was succulent anyway. Fantastic.

I make this all the time. Delicious, tender, juicy chicken and lots of mushrooms. Follow the video directions EXACTLY the first time, then you can play with adding garlic or whatever. The butter sauce is soooo very good over rice. 
I have no idea how you would dry your chicken breast out making this recipe.. except for maybe not having the skin, which is a MUST. It takes some practice to de-bone the chicken breast, but it's worth it.. Trust me..

We love this recipe. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I soaked the dried Japanese agitation mushrooms I had on hand and chopped those up. Talk about intense flavor. I also only had chicken thighs on hand, otherwise I made it exactly like chef John. It turned out fabulous, my kids always ask me to make this Thank you Chef John.

I have made this several times. You must use breasts with the skin on or it doesn't work. Follow the directions and it is superb.

I love this technique.  I actually use it on chicken thighs but I just love the way the mushrooms come out. In the video, he says to at least cook it his way first then later you can make alterations, like adding wine to the deglazing part. I've made this many, many times and I've never been tempted to add anything different.

The only change I made was adding 1\2c chicken stock and a bit of corn starch to make a light gravy. My guests, husband and 1 year old son loved it.

I've made this twice and both times both hubby and I enjoyed it very much! I've made it once just on the stove and once in the oven. Once with boneless skinless, and once with boneless, skin on. Both were excellent.
This recipe is very easy and very tasty!

I am not sure why some people thought this was dry. Maybe they got bad chicken. Maybe they over cooked it. But we found this delicious with an elegant simplicity.  Just follow the directions and you will love it too.

An absolute favourite! I cooked this one on a skillet and once the chicken was cooked, in the same pan I added butter and cream of mushroom soup for the gravy. Serve with rice cooked in chicken broth and mushroom soup.

Spectacular flavor! All my family raved about this chicken. So easy to make, so simple with such an outstanding result! Definitely will keep this on my favorites book. Try it without changing a thing first, I assure you will love it. Next time you can experiment more with it if you'd like, but it needs nothing else as it is!

The bomb.com. Super simple recipe. I had a box of mushrooms in the fridge and having never cooked anything with mushrooms before, I was pretty nervous... Came onto Allrecipes and found this! I make this about once a week! It's easy enough for metro

Wow! I made this recipe just as shown, who knew that these few ingredients would have such flavor! The only thing i didn't have was a oven proof pan, i just kept a glass baking dish in the oven and transferred the chicken and mushrooms into the warmed dish, then warmed the pan and transferred back.  Really great recipe, my family loved it, the chicken was so moist and mushrooms so tasty, even my picky seven year old  said "Mom this is the best chicken you ever made" thanks chef John!

Family absolutely loved it! Will definitely make again. I will probably add a bit of ginger for the chicken. I added a bit of flour to the sauce to make it more like a gravy.

I tried this exactly as Chef John did it - no extra ingredients.  I'm not that great of a cook (that's my wife's department) but this was so easy, and it got her (and my) seal of approval.  Of course, as Chef John suggests, I will try different variations, but his point that a delicious entree can come out of two basic ingredients was spot on.

Okay, so this was a great meal! I made a few alterations. I added garlic to the olive oil while browning the chicken. I also added onion in with the mushroom for added flavor before baking the chicken. Instead of water, I used chicken stock (though probably should have used water because I think the stock may have made it a tad too salty). I also sprinkled cajun seasoning on top of the chicken just because I really love cajun seasoning. 

I say this next part with humility because I knew better....One of the reviews on here even said to throw something over the handle of the skillet so you don't burn yourself while finishing the mushrooms. I didn't. I burned my hand....twice. So for future cooks who may be slightly absent minded or multi task...ABSOLUTELY throw something over the handle after pulling it out of the oven. haha

ORIGINAL REVIEW 6/7/15: This was good, but I think it could have been better.  I did make a couple of changes.  I didn’t have skin-on chicken breasts, so I had to use skinless, and I cut back on the oil by about half.  I cooked the chicken completely in the pan, and kept it warm in the oven, while I sautéed the mushrooms and made the sauce.  The sauce was very, very thin, so I would try to thicken it up next time.  I also thought that, although the water worked, I think it would have been better using wine or a  broth/wine combination.  I will try this again with those alterations.  UPDATE 7/19/16:  I needed to use up some mushrooms so I made this again with the changes I suggested in my original review.  After salt and peppering the chicken, I again completely cooked it in a small amount of EVOO and removed it to a warm oven.  I added just a little more EVOO to the pan and proceeded to brown the mushrooms, adding a clove of minced garlic at the end.  For the water I used half chicken broth and half dry white wine, adding just a little cornstarch/water to thicken it.  I swirled in a pat of butter and added the chicken and the accumulated juices  back to the pan.  I coated the chicken with the sauce and served it topped with the mushroom sauce.  My changes elevated this from my original 4 stars to 5 stars and I will make it again this way.

I thought this was very good - and so easy!  I accidentally  bought a bone-in chicken breast, but it worked out fine, possibly even better than if I'd used boneless.  I also added a crumbled chicken bouillon cube to the water.

I am 18 and decided to cook a nice meal for my parents, and they absolutely loved this! However after cutting up the mushrooms I added some green onions, tablespoon of bar-b-q sauce, half a can of black beens, and tobacco sauce. I mixed this all together and let it set in the fridge while I prepared everything else. I cooked it exactly like the directions said, my chicken was juicy and flavorful. I will definitely be cooking this again soon!

I made this with skinless chicken breast and it was still delicious.  My very picky 12 year old son even loved it!  It is the perfect meal for a busy family and I find it amazing that two ingredients cooked properly can be so tasty.  Well done Chef John!  I am looking forward to making it next time with skin-on chicken breasts.

I enjoyed it but I over reduced the sauce and there wasn't enough. The mushrooms cooked down to practically nothing so I really needed more of them. My husband doesn't care much for chicken. He said "it's just chicken. Nothing special." On the other hand, he raved about Chef John's Coq Au Vin.

I made this dish with one exception. I substituted Marsala wine for the water. It was a huge hit. It had so much flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I would give it 10 stars if I could!!

This really is a basic recipe with few ingredients. I used the wrong meat (had bones but also skin) and will try to find the correct (boneless) cut next time. I also need to seer it better (longer) next time but that is my fault, not the recipes'. The plain butter and mushroom sauce was delicious.

I followed this recipe word for word, and it came out extremely well. My husband definitely approves also :) Being newlyweds, we are looking for some simple and quick recipes and this falls in both categories! We made it with herb rice and everything came together splendidly. Would definitely recommend!

Okay, I failed the temptation to not add anything else. It was very subtle, but I will not say what I did. It's irrelevant. I can tell you that this dish is  simply delicious, and you MUST try it. Just try not to alter it. The simplicity is kinda mind blowing...

So simple and delicious.  I hardly ever make anything new so I was nervous, but the meal turned out so well.  We used butter instead of Olive Oil and Bone-in Chicken and it turned out great.

Made this last night with some steamed broccoli. Only change I made was using Half Breasts instead of boneless. But that was personal preference. It was an amazing exercise in simplicity. Loved it, and will definitely use this as a base for making my own chicken dinners. 

Thank you Chef John!

Wonderful flavor.  I used skinned thighs with the bone taken out.  Awesome, even the wife liked it!  Next time I'll try it with asparagus.

Made exactly as stated and it was superb!  Amazing the taste with no seasonings but salt and pepper and of course the mushrooms added a fabulous flavor too. Thanks Chef John for this simple dish.

Followed the recipe as written and it was a success.  Like others I was skeptical and tempted to add wine or SOMETHING, but it didn't need anything.  I added extra mushrooms because I figured I might as well and it was great because we all had plenty.  They were delicious.  I'll definitely make it again.

This has been in our rotation since I discovered the recipe! I sometimes add a handful of onion slices with the mushrooms but it's just as good without the onions! Couldn't be easier, and delicious to boot!

Made exactly as written.  Wonderful.  Chicken was moist and delicious.  Never had mushrooms that tasted so good.  Thanks Chef John!  This is a keeper and will be made frequently.

I used chicken quarters. Reduced cook time by 30 minutes. So juicy!  Better than rotisserie, my kid said.

fantastic! definitely use all mushroom recipe calls for, since it cooks down quite a bit. I cooked chicken in 5 min per side stovetop, and 20min in the oven, which was perfect.

I can only emphasize what others have said, i.e., FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. EXACTLY. I often improvise and change recipes, but I trust Chef John to know what he is doing, so I did this exactly the way he said, and oh wow, it really worked! Chicken was tender and moist, sauce was tasty, mushrooms were perfectly caramelized. Yes, you could add garlic or onions or shallots or a pinch of cayenne, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE no canned soup. He is showing us a professional cooking technique that always works. Do it the way he says and take pride in your accomplishment. Thanks again, Chef John.

I have to confess I was a bit skeptical at first.  How could something with so few ingredients be tasty, but I was very surprised.  I did tweak the recipe based on reviews and changed the water to wine.  Other than that I pretty much stuck to the recipe.  It really was AMAZING tasting.  Thank you, Chef John.  This one is in my recipe box forever!!

Followed exactly using boned thighs instead of breast, because I prefer the flavor of dark meat...this was simply fabulous! Bonus was learning how to bone a chicken thigh! Success!!!

Made just as directed...delicious! Had one of the butchers at Mariano's remove the bone for me. I was pleasantly surprised at the moistness and flavor of such a simple dish. Wouldn't change anything about this. 
Wonderful!

Loved this recipe. However, I cooked the chicken on the grill and cooked the mushrooms inside some aluminum foil on the same grill and added them at the table. Definitely a keeper. I know I didn't follow the recipe as written, but rated it with five stars because I felt the mushrooms went well with the chicken.

I substituted water for 1/4 C white wine, reduced, added 1/2 C heavy cream, reduced, added 1 tsp. fresh thyme chopped, then finished as written, mounted with the butter, pour sauce with mushrooms over chicken and serve. Was more flavorful than the original version (which I tried first with stock instead of water), and richer which suited my palate more. But pretty darn good either way.

Made as the recipe indicated, and the chicken was awesome.  I used Kosher salt and cracked pepper.  Not sure if that made a difference, but YUMM!  Very juicy.  I think I may add onions next time like someone suggested because I love them.  Great, simple recipe.

Very good.  I would do this again.   Difficult to find boneless chicken breasts *with* the skin, so I made do with skinless/boneless breasts.  My cooking time was shorter.   But a good recipe that's easy and quick.

Had to use skinless chicken breasts, but they were delicious. Really juicy and flavorful. I would definitely make this again. Very easy to prepare and the prep time was fast.  My husband thought this was very good.

I tried the recipe as written, using a cast iron pan to cook in, and I cannot believe how moist and flavorful this dish was! The sauce was so tasty.  I'll be using this method to make chicken more often.

It was a fun experiment, to scale back ingredients to just the basics, and use a simple technique to make a fantastic dish.  Thank you for the lesson!

I made this for the family tonight and even the members that don't like mushrooms, loved it.  It was quick and easy.  I browned the chicken in olive oil and butter, transferred it to a baking dish, deglazed the pan with a little cooking wine and poured it over the chicken. I baked it for about 20 min.  Sautéed the mushrooms in a little butter until well browned. Once baked, I sat the chicken on top of the mushrooms and poured the juices over all.  Served it with rice/noodles (some like rice, some egg noodles) and veggies! Yum! Will be making this as a regular!

I've made this several times following Chef John's directions exactly.  It's wonderful as presented and doesn't really require any additional tweaking.  I used a cast iron skillet which always produces some splatter but this recipe is well worth the effort required to clean up after.  Loved it!  Thanks Chef John!

Great basic recipe!  I get his premise of "chicken and mushrooms only" but I did fuss with the recipe.  We only had skinless chicken so the olive oil was key.  I sprinkled a little dry thyme and tarragon on the chicken with the salt and pepper.  Also used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  Served it with plain couscous.  Next time I think we'll use half the chicken and two kinds of mushrooms.

I never leave comments but this is the best chicken I have ever made. I really had a hard time with just using water, but made it exactly as recipe states and the chicken is fantastic! The mushroom sauce is great. Only thing I do different is add more mushrooms and water for more sauce. It's that good.

This was excellent and so simple. I took other reviewers tips and added onion and also mixed in a little white wine with the water. I only had boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Everything else I did the same. Delicious!

So simple but so wholly good. I've demonstrated restraint and have yet to add anything to this recipe :) It's become a staple meal for lazy weekdays when I don't have time to shop/cook anything intensive. TRY IT!

Double or even triple the mushroooms...they're THAT good!   I've made this recipe with bone in and boneless breasts with equal success.

Great recipe. Used Portobello mushrooms since that is what I had on hand.  After reading the reviews, I could not help but add garlic and used wine instead of water. Turned out great.

Scrumptious! The only thing is, I have never seen a boneless chicken breast with the skin ON. It is always removed. Oh well, it was good without the skin too (and healthier!!) :-) I didn't change a thing and loved this recipe. Another winner from my favorite chef, Chef John!!

This had enough patient technique to make it appealing to try but then the flavors of the mushrooms and chicken even individually were amazing, yet simple, and then combined bites made it even that much more worth while.  PS, we had it with champagne as our standard drink and it was kick a**!  But I'm sure a fruity white wine would have done the same.

Ok I love this recipe exactly as is, thank you Chef John! I love my food well seasoned and definitely questioned just using salt and pepper. I'm like just salt and pepper??? Never! But I have this thing about at least trying the recipe as written once, then tweaking it afterwards. How can you even rate this recipe without trying it as is first? Then saying its bland. It is in the opposite, this is one of the most delicious well seasoned tender chicken dishes I've ever had! I've tried it over and over with beautiful results ever time. Adding garlic would be the only addition I'd add if any. But differing from the recipe changes the whole point of the chicken simply shining with salt and pepper, the mushrooms and butter make it irresistible! I have tough critics in my house and everyone always wants thirds. Just try it and remember to salt and pepper the chicken well.

I've never been a fan of chicken breasts because they're generally dry and flavourless.  However, this recipe made the chicken delicious.  It was moist and tasty and the gravy/sauce was fabulous.  I will definitely make this easy peasy recipe again.  Thanks Chef John.  Oh and also, I got a nice new frying pan because I had to purchase one that would go in the oven ... an added bonus!

Found mushrooms a little overbearing.  Used skinless chicken, so this may have lessened the flavour.

This recipe is great. It is very simple and tasty. Totally recommend it. I served it with rice and followed the recipe as it is. It came out very good. Next time I will try “chicken broth” instead of “water” (just to see the difference). I also made some chopped sweet onions, parsley and lime for the side dish to go with this meal. My husband is very picky but he gave this meal a 5 star.

Loved it!!!  Oh my god, cooking this dish reminded me of Chef Gusteau's idea from the movie Ratatoille - "Anyone can cook."  This dish was so easy to follow from the video recipe.  I'm so simple a chef, I didn't even know that "to reduce" was to allow to evaporate.  That said, I learned neat tricks like saving the juice that runs off from the chicken breasts and putting into the sauce.  And that the "fond" is the best part of the recipe as that is where all the flavor come from.  My wife and 10yr old said this is the best dish they've ever tasted.  And the coolest part, skin-on breasts were 50% at the grocery - so I'll be making this dish again real soon!!

I am not much of a cook...but this recipe was easy and so incredibly delicious.  I never would have expected such such a nice flavor from just a few ingredients!

Great. We couldn't find skin-on chicken breasts in our market, but the dish was still lovely. My five year old daughter, a picky eater, complained of the smell of mushrooms, grudgingly tasted it, then devoured all of the mushrooms on her plate. Now she insists she loves mushrooms!

Just the best and easiest recipe ever.  I used thighs and baby bella mushrooms.  DELICIOUS!  My 3rd recipe by Chef John's and they ALL were out of this world good.  I just ordered his cookbook on Amazon.

This was really good!  I chose it because it was supposed to be fast, but wondered how tasty it could be with so few spices.  My family loved it.  The chicken was perfect.  Will make again

This is a 10 star!  We make this at least 4 times a month...so easy and so delicious.  The key is to not change anything...follow recipe exactly!  I adore good steak but this beats it!  Never thought chicken breasts could be so moist and tender and the mushrooms just complete it! 
Sara Petty...we love you John!

This is gorgeous and easy to make.  My new favorite way to make chicken! I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and it still turns out delicious every time
