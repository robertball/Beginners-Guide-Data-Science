You have to use short grain rice Arborio the kind used in risotto. Long grain is not meant for pudding. Only short grain will make a creamy pudding.

I just finished making this pudding.  I was sceptical at first after reading the other reviews, but I must say I disagree with most of them.  I like this a lot.  It is creamy, the rice is tender.  It took 2.5 hrs. just like the recipe said on high.  I added more cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg because I like more flavor than usual.  I definately will do this again.  Thanks.

This recipe tasted fine, but the recipe is wrong when it instructs you to cook the pudding on "low;" I cooked the mixture on low for four hours and the rice was still crunchy. I finally just had to add some water and cook it on high for another hour and a half to get it to cook through. I don't like crunchy rice!

Otherwise, this pudding was very tasty. I substituted Splenda for half the sugar and coconut milk (not cream) for half the evaporated milk. It tastes lovely!

I made a few changes to this recipe, but it's now become a favourite with my family. The most important thing is that the rice needs to be cooked first. The other changes I made were to reduce sugar to 3/4 cup, add 1 cup of raisons, and add one more cinnamon stick.

This had a great flavor and was creamy.  I did however, have to cook this on high for 7 hours total, and had to stir every 20-30 minutes.  I also had to add an additional half gallon of whole milk during the cooking/stirring process.  UPDATE:  I make this regularly....family loves rice pudding.  I usually use leftover rice from dinner or precook it.  I cook on high for 2 hours stirring occasionally.  I also cut the sugar down to 1/2-2/3 cup.  1 cup is too much and I have a sweet tooth. This is probably our favorite rice pudding recipe and I have made MANY different ones.

First off I would have liked it to have explained the glutinous rice, stating that it is the japenese sticky rice, for people who do not cook very much. I used regular white rice and cooked it for over two hours in my slow cooker, when nothing happened I moved it to the stove for about another 30 minutes, when I realized something was wrong and that the rice was not going to cook.
    Not a good recipe to use!!! Did not work and I wated my time and money on this!

I think something is missing from this recipe.  It says two hours of cooking time but the instructions only say one and a half.  I wonder if it was supposed to be 1 hour on high and 1 hour on low or something. I know we all have different slow cookers, but mine took over six hours on low to cook.  The flavor was okay, I did add some raisins that had been pre soaked.  But it just did not taste right.  I guess no one can be my Mom's old recipe.  In tasting it right now, it still feels like the rice is not done.  Save the evaporated milk for another project.  This was not a hit for me.  Sorry!

Clearly this recipe was not field tested by the chef prior to submitting to Allrecipes.com.  This was bad.  I have a feeling that the chef meant for INSTANT rice to be used (?) but the recipe does not say to use INSTANT rice.  Even after cooking for 6-7 hours the rice was hard. Try Creamy Cinnamon Rice Pudding by TinyChef if you want fabulous rice pudding.

I had to add half a gallon of milk. I also cooked on high for four and a half hours. After that it came out great, nice and creamy.

The time to fully cook the rice in the slow cooker is more than 1 1/2 hours.  It was more like 5 hours.  Very tasty though.

I'm rating the original recipe 3 stars, but I managed to get 5 stars out of this recipe! Here's how: first, I precooked the rice on the stove. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used one can of sweetened condensed milk and one can of regular whole milk. I skipped the sugar entirely because of the content in the sweetened milk. I added the vanilla, nutmeg, milks, cinnamon stick and cooked rice to the slow cooker. I let them go for 1.5 hours and then added one beaten egg and an additional 1/4 cup of whole milk. This is amazingly good! :)

I should have read the other reviews before starting this recipe. After 2 hours the rice was not cooked and that's when I read the reviews. It took me 8 hours to make this pudding. I will cook the rice first next time. Also I added a lot more milk, and mine is very sweet and caramel like. I'm going to take the advice of others and add less sugar next time. I gave it 3 stars because after 8 hours it did turn out tasty, just don't make the same mistake I did. Read the reviews first & take their advice.

We made this with 3/4 cups (when dry) cooked whole grain rice and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Simmered on HIGH for several hours. The sauce was thick and caramel-like. So delicious.

while the flavor was good, the pudding was much to dense for my taste. also, it took nearly 4 hours to cook in the crock pot and the rice was still a bit crunchy.

This was not worth the time or effort to make it. Nothing special. I make Slow Cooker Tapioca from this site and it is still the best pudding ever.

I was skeptical because there was nothing in the ingredients to tie this together and make the pudding- no egg, no cornstarc, etc.  This did not turn out good at all.  I used the Arorbio rice as another suggested and tested it after 1.5 hour - the rice was crunchy.  Kept testing every hour - finally - after 5.5 hours the rice was done but by then, all the liquid had absorbed - so it was sweet rice, no 'pudding'. The taste was very good - the texture was horrible.  I put it in the fridge and thought I would have some the next day (hated to throw it out and it did taste good) .. the next day I found a separated, watery/rice combo (strange as no water was used).  I won't make this again.

This was absolutely delicious!  Use SWEET RICE (from your local Asian store).  I cooked on high for 2 hrs based on other reviews and it came out perfectly.  Also cut the sugar to 3/4 c and it was still sweet enuf.

This rice pudding is very tasty and creamy! I will make this recipe again.  I used, for a double recipe, 2 cans of evaporated milk and 2 of regular milk and also added some lemon peel.  It did take longer to cook and I did have to add a considerable amount more of milk than what the recipe stated but the end result is very good.  This is a lot like the Cuban Rice Pudding that I always made but much easier.  I also lined my crock pot with a cooking bag for easier cleanup.

I thought that 1 1/2 hours on "low" sounded like a lot less than it should take to cook this.  But it's not even close.  I am cooking this as I write and have had the pot on "high" for over 3 hours already and I see no sign it's even close to being cooked.  I think I'm going to take the liner out an finish in the microwave, rather than let it cook on overnight in the crock pot.  This recipe needs a major overhaul.

Bummer! Everyone was right, a few vital things missing... like LIQUID! I added about a half gallon of milk, and another half gal of water- milk was added throughout the cooking time (over 20 hours!!) and the water was added in the last 6 hours. Seriously... 20 hours?!  (Crockpot was on high,  stirred regularly)   If I attempt this again, I will cook the rice separate, or add 6 or so cups of water in the initial set of ingredients.  It smelled great, but without the needed liquid, the condensed milk and sugar scorched- the entire batch turned black-brown and tasted toasted.   Too bad the recipe hasn't been adjusted for all those who have tried it. It has the basics, just needs explanation about the type of rice, and an addition of liquids and time!!

I only gave this 3 stars because the instructions for this dish are all wrong. I made the following changes and it ws over the moon.


* I used 3 cups of water to 1 cup of sticky rice.
* I cooked it on low for 6 hours
* I gave it a stir and then added 1/2 cup of cocoa, 1/2 cup of sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a can of coconut milk.
* I gave it another stir and let it cook for 30 more minutes while I got ready for work.
* I then sat down to enjoy a warm, delicious breakfast.

This is a pretty easy method for rice pudding.  I agree you need to cook this on high for about 3 hours.  I had some half & half in the fridge, so I used 12 oz of evaporated milk and 12 oz of half & half.  I would probably increase the amount of liquid next time because the ratios in the recipe resulted in a sort of gummy pudding, and I like mine a little creamier.  Probably add another 6-8 oz of evaporated milk.  I also didn't have a cinnamon stick, so i put in 1 tsp of ground cinnamon, and it was pretty tasty.  A pinch of salt didn't hurt either. I stirred about every 30 minutes, and the end result was pretty tasty.

This recipe is all wrong. Was all watery after 1 1/2 hours on low. Not sure if it should be on high or something else was missing. Big disappointment!Do not waste your time.

I did not care for this recipe-the looking time was way off.  and the pudding never did thicken.

Followed the directions, used arborio rice, cooked for 1 1/2 hours on low ... rice soup. Turned it up for a little to high, then back down to low for a couple of hours. Rice was hard in the middle, and this is WAY too sweet, and too much nutmeg. Perhaps you CAN make rice pudding in the slow cooker, but this is NOT the recipe to use.

I agree - something is wrong with this recipe.  I tried it on low for 2 hours, had crunchy rice and gave up. And waaay too much nutmeg.

I wish I had listened to other reviewers. I followed the recipe as it is written. It is WAY too sweet, and this from someone who loves sweets. It could probably use a third of the sugar. It also calls for too much nutmeg which is very overpowering (once again, I love nutmeg). It requires more time than written, and more liquid. It does not taste like rice pudding. Overall, I was very disappointed.

Now I know to read the reviews. It tasted fine after 12 hours(!) of cooking and even then the rice was not completely soft. If I were to try this again in the future I would definitely cook the rice first. I ended up adding liquid to this all day.

I wish I would have read reviews before attempting this. We had people over for dinner and it was embarassing that we couldn't eat it. After 21/2 hours on low I turned it to high and was another hour plus. Tasted very good.

This is the second time I've tried this recipe, thinking I must have made a mistake the first time.  After reading reviews, I see I'm not the only one to notice it takes over 4 hrs. to cook in slow cooker.  Wouldn't recommend this one, especially if you're in a hurry.

After 4 hrs on high, the rice is still like little stones. The milk has turned into caramel.   Do not make this recipe.

I should have heeded the advice of the other reviews and just passed on this one, but took a chance because I was starving for rice pudding.  This was like soup.  I let it cook for one hour on high, then switched to low and cooked another 4 hours and it still looked like soup (although my rice was somewhat tender).  I finally gave up and poured it into a dish and put it in the fridge. Don't even bother with this one.

I thought this recipe sounded great and gave it a try.  Warning Do NOT use uncooked rice in this recipe. I used regular uncooked long grain white rice.  I let it cook all day, and the rice was still hard and crunchy.   The evaporated milk turned brown.  In desperation I put the whole mixture in a pan on the stove and added milk, covered it and let it boil.  It started turning into a thick brown candy due to all the sugar and milk, and the rice was still hard, so I ended up throwing it all away.
I am trying it again with cooked rice tonight, I'll let you know how it goes.

The condensed milk turned into a toffee like substance and the rice was solid.  After 2.5 hours it was destined for the bin.

Not that good. The rice was still hard and had not soaked in enough flavor. Very bland. Threw out most of it. will not make again.

Good, but I changed one of the evaporated milk by one coconut milk and I cooked it one more hour and I found it a bit dry. Next time I'll do it with more milk and I'll cook it for 3-3 1/2 hours

Nothing cooks in a slow cooker in 1.5 hours on low, or High even.  I started it at 2 and it might have been ready at 6:45.  I got tired of waiting.  It's still cooling, so I haven't actually tasted it yet.  I gave it the rating I did solely on the technique of the recipe.

I made this and while the rice I used was old, I increased the milk a bit and it turned out delicious. However after reading other people's reviews, I put it on high and it was done perfectly in about 1 hr and 45 min.

I needed to double the cooking time and the recipe still came out runny. The taste was ok, but nothing special. I'll be looking for another recipe for next time.

First of all the recipe call so for uncooked rice. I had doubled the recipe (big crowd) and doubled the time and it came out a watery mess. I turned the slow cooker to high and it actually began to cook. Also, the nutmeg may be a little too much as it turned everything brown looking and unappetizing.

It's great with some tweaking.  After making this 2x first time w/ Valencia Short Grain Rice it took almost 8 hours and an extra cup of Almond Milk because it started to dry out and even after 8 hours some grains were still crunchy.  Then I made it with Minute Rice and it took 4 hours to make so the timing on this recipe is incorrect for sure and I added Almond Milk again to this to keep it creamy and balance out the sugar taste.
