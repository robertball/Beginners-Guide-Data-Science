I made this for a bridal shower brunch and it got rave reviews, with multiple people asking for the recipe. No one even knew it was gluten-free; they just knew it tasted great! Since this was my first time making quiche I have to say the recipe was easy to follow and true to taste. Since I like salt I didn't change that quantity (and no complaints from guests), but I did use 1 c 2% milk instead of half&half for the filling. I also made the whole thing the night before so all I had to do was throw it in the oven before brunch, and it turned out great. I will absolutely be saving this and making again - thank you!

I am one of those idiots who never reads all the way to the bottom of a recipe until it's too late.  I missed the author's warning about "salty" and, if you make it as written, it's quite salty.  (But then, the only time I like to taste salt is potato chips.)  The recipe itself is excellent, cooks up well and very pretty, and impressed my non-GF friends at brunch.  I used a fancier pie plate (one of those colored ceramic ones that are slightly deeper-dish) so I added two extra eggs to the mix, and it filled out nicely.  I think next time I'll omit the salt from the crust completely and probably from the egg portion as well.  But otherwise, this was easy-peasy and quite tasty!  (I used the Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour from the grocery store, by the way.)

I make this often because it is delicious.  Even my picky boyfriend likes it!  I do leave out the nutmeg though because I don't like that spice.

First time making a gluten free crust - it turned out great and both my husband and daughter loved it. I used shredded cheddar cheese and added 1 cup extra cheese.

Hubs and I love this cuz I can’t tolerate gluten anymore. I add spinach and sautéed onions to it. I then put sour cream on top of it after it comes out of the oven so it’s not super dry.

Love how the  crust came out. I used a dash of cinnamon instead of nutmeg and and I skipped the garlic I'm he crust as I have stomach issues with garlic. Consistency of final quiches was amazing!

I didn’t care for the almond meal which made it dry and made an almond flavour in each bite

Loved it!  I substituted olive oil since we don't use butter and the crust turned out great.  I added my own toppings in lieu of bacon; sautéed onion, spinach/kale, fresh herbs, but still used the cup of cheese (goat cheese).  I also used almond milk instead of half and half and it was perfect.  It was very rich as a typical quiche and this is my new GF quiche recipe.  Thanks! (pic)

I did not use bacon.  So I added about 2 cups of cheese and some cooked spinach.  It was delicious.
