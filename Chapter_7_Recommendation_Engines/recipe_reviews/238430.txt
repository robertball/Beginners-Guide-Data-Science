This dish is heavenly! I made it for Thanksgiving and a small amount was eaten-- one daughter-in-law doesn't like cherries, there was too much of everything else, etc. OK. So I ate it myself...every last morsel (over a number of days). It probably added 10 pounds, but it was worth it! I did use low fat Eagle Brand, lite cherry pie filling and lite Cool Whip, but I doubt that made a difference having EATEN THE WHOLE THING! and I initially froze it overnight, then refrigerated it.

Easy to make and tastes fantastic.   Work at a senior home so lots left over.   I squished the cherries for them.   The ladies loved it.

Loved by everyone! Great for Potlucks. Be careful if alone, very tempting in the fridge! You can feel the pull to the fridge!
