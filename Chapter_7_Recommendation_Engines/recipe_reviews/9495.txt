I baked this as a side dish of a game stew. We usually have chestnut puree for Christmas eve, but this is much better, because it is lighter. Next time, I might increase brandy to 1.5 - 2 Tbsp, though.

Just cooked it and it turned great. Had it as a side dish with game and quince compote.

A delicately-flavored souffle.  I used a 5-ounce package of shelled chestnuts, pureed them in a food processor w yolks, milk, sugar, and one tablespoon of good liquor (rum).  Folded the whites in the yolk mixture.  Needed just over 40 minutes in my 350 oven, and still moist.  Slightly sweet--but the sugar really brings out the chestnuts.

I used hazelnuts instead of chestnuts. And I shucked and grind fresh nuts with a little water cause I didn't have puree. Could've been better if I had a better food processor but it was pretty  good!
