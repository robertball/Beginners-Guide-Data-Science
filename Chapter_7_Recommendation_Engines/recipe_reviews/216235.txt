This recipe did not taste good at all.  We made a few and tried them just to see if we should keep going, and there was just something not right about it.  I guess it was the picante sauce; it made it just a little too sweet and not spicy at all!

I made this with a can of salmon and panko breadcrumbs.  Delicious.  I also used lemon juice instead of lime, but next time will try the lime juice.  The picante that I used was very hot so I upped the proportion of mayo to picante.  I liked this recipe much better than my usual salmon cake recipe and so did my husband.

Great Crab Cakes and easy to make. I have made this several times for my family and they love it.
