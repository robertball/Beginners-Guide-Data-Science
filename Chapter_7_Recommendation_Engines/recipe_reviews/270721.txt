This soup has a watered down taste.  It needs chicken or beef broth not water.  Add some canned tomatoes with chillies, lots of garlic, onion powder,  white or red wine to give it some flavor.

Itâ€™s very flavorful. I only changed 2 things. I used beef broth and added a can of Italian stewed tomatoes. My husband said that it is now his favorite soup.

Very tasty, wonderful soup! It takes more than 20 minutes to prep, but well worth the work of chopping up all the vegetables. I did use chicken broth instead of water and strongly suggest you use chicken or vegetable broth for a more complete flavor which compliments the mild Italian sausage.  I also added garlic and used Italian seasoning.  This recipe is a great base to begin with, and gives you the opportunity to make it all your own with your ideas and additions.

I bought the wrong beans and got Garbanzos (chick peas).
It was still fantastic!
Will definitely make again.

My family liked this. They even went back for seconds. I drained the beans but used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the juice. I will make this again.

After reading the other reviews I just made a few changes: no toddlers in my house so I used hot Italian sausage, 2 large cloves of minced garlic and added 2 beef bouillon cubes to 2c water for the liquid.
