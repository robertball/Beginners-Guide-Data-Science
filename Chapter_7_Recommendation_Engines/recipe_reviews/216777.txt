Delicious!  I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead (measure half as much), and it was wonderful.  I will make it again and again.

VERY GOOD!  I served these carrots with flounder and mashed potatoes; and, they not only were tasty, they added a nice color to the dish.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.   Thanks for sharing FROGHOPPER!

Candied Ginger Carrots' Haiku: "Slippery and sweet. Ginger was a unique touch. Perked up plain carrots." I followed Froghopper's recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked these, b/c I'm a carrot-purist (either crunch'n raw, or steamed w/ a little EVOO, s&p.) With the glaze, they're a little slimy, but the taste is sweet, and unusual w/ that ample addition of ginger. Oh and as a little watch-yourself warning, during the last boil/stir step, my hands took a couple unexpected small burns, as the glaze kept hopping around the pot, much like a frog would :)

DH said these were awesome and I agree!  I had to eyeball the amount of carrots since I was working out of a large Costco bag and I'm pretty sure I didn't add enough since I had glaze leftover in the bottom of the pan but it was great for dipping!  These will be made again!

I made these as written except that I just cut up some regular sized carrots.  If I were to change anything it would be to reduce the amount of butter.  It just doesn't need as much as the recipe calls for.

Yum! Great recipe! I used regular tri-color carrots and just cut them up in pieces. I also used fresh ginger and they turned out great. We are not huge cooked carrots fans, but these are really good.

Sorry, I felt the ginger was too over powering.  We just didn't care for these. I'm sure it's our taste and has no reflection on the recipe since others who rated this really liked.

Sooo good!  I'm not a big fan of carrots but my grandson is!  I added a bit more sweetness with honey.  As strange as it sounds,  I also added dash of vanilla.  I prepared this part of my dish today.  However, tomorrow afternoon I will be tossing the clazed carrots in coconut flakes and then putting under the broiler to toast.   The recipe as written was GREAT!  I just adapted it to my taste.  YUMMY!

Followed the recipe (more or less...there may have been a tad more brown sugar than the recipe called for....) and the carrots turned out great! The family and our guests all said they tasted yummy..even those who weren't carrot eaters. I personally could have added a bit more ginger to my taste but I was very pleased with the dish. Will definitely do it again.

So simple, and so good!  I might add a touch more ginger next time, or possibly use fresh instead of ground.

4.9.17  Steamed the carrots in the microwave on high for 3 minutes, drained, stirred in the other ingredients, back in the micro for 10 seconds, and they went on the table.  Knowing our taste preference, I did cut back on the ginger and brown sugar (sub’d Truvia® brown sugar), and with these changes, the carrots were delicious.   Served with Instant Pot® Pork Chops and Gravy (on this site), mashed potatoes, and tomato slices with a provencale dressing.

Use fresh ginger rather than ground sugar, and add some lemon juice.  I prefer more salt and brown sugar than is used in this recipe.  Also, I prefer slivered carrots to whole baby carrots.

Delicious! I steamed carrots green beans and corn and used the glaze from this recipe and it came out great.  My fiancee didn't like the heat from the ginger so step it back a little if you're cooking for sensitive palates.

Was looking for a recipe for carrots to go with Easter dinner (my daughter LOVES carrots) and am delighted that I went with this simple yet delicious recipe. Everyone loved them and was asked for recipe by all the cooks in the crowd.  Quick, easy, and not too sweet, these carrots will become part of regular dinner fare; however, for heart and waistline sake, will reduce amount of butter and use Splenda brown sugar.  Thank you for posting this recipe!
