I thought this was great. I served it with the fresh tomato and basil soup.  I also made these with turkey, and they were great!  The only thing I would do differently, is take the meat out earier or warm it in the microwave. The few minutes of broiling was not enough to warm the meat up all the way.

I gave this quick, easy, kid friendly, tasty recipe 5 stars!! This is very fast and tasty!! Easy to make to your liken! The kids love it!! I made two varieties. For the adults I used leftover Tri-tip and garlic roasted cheese and for the kids I used deli ham and American sliced cheese (thier favorite). We all loved this wonderful meal and we are all stuffed! They are huge (depending on the size of Hoagie). Something fast and tasty is always welcome in my house! Especially when you can jazz it up in so many ways!!  Try it you'll like it!

Great idea for a quick yummy dinner... Best thing is you can make each sandwhich to each persons liking. Definately warm the meat in microwave before placing in oven.  I used garlic butter spread on the hoggie rolls before adding the may/or mustard of choice. 5 stars for a quick great dinner

No hoagies so I used a quality whole wheat bread. I kept everything else the same. I did have to increase the mayonnaise and mustard but that's always purely up to the taste of whoever's making the sandwich. My boys and I absolutely loved this sandwich. Everything went together wonderfully and it was a wonderful combination with chicken noodle soup on a cold, rainy day. YUM!

Yummy Scrummy! We change out the meats and cheeses and it is always a hit! My teenagers love Subway sandwiches (so do I) but I don't love the prices, so this is a great alternative. We usually add shredded lettuce. Thanks :)

This was wonderful!  I was surprised how good it was since it has typical sandwich ingredients, but broiling it made all the difference!  We will definitely have this again.  And it was so quick too.  We made this duriing the summer and used our BBQ instead of the broiler so we didn't heat up the house.

I'm not even a huge fan of deli-sliced roast beef but this was pretty good! I used miracle whip and dijon mustard - mixed the two together in a small bowl before spreading on the hoagie buns. Also - I added some sliced onion, no tomato and colby jack cheese. I'm sure any deli meat would work! Good and simple lunch!

This was so easy and tasty, I think I'll be broiling sandwiches regularly!  It went quite well with french onion soup for a very filling dinner.  I use the Rich and Simple French Onion Soup recipe from this site.

I made this minus tha mayo and mustard and not on hoagies but on homemade wheat bread and it was delicious regardless. I got a rant and rave from my fiance. So simple, yet so filling!

Loved these. Only change we made was in using "Jarlsburg" cheese instead of Provolone. Turned out really well. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  I realized last second that my provolone had gone bad BUT I did have swiss which I think was a great alternative on this sandwich.  Thanks, it was delicious!

Oh so yummy!  I used leftover roast beef and it worked great.  Also made a deli ham, pepperoni version.  I preferred the roast beef, but hubby loved the ham. That goes to show that any combo will work!

This made a tasty and very filling lunch for my family. We used pepperjack and havarti cheeses and roast beef leftover from the French Dip sandwiches, this site. BTW thinly sliced cucumbers added to this sandwich is very good!

This was great! I did't use deli roast beef, I used leftover roast beef from the night before (see 'all american roast beef' recipe).  I sliced it very thin. We added shredded iceberg lettuce after the broiling.

I think this is excellent for University students who may find their toaster oven has a lot to offer. Buy your bun, your deli meat, a slice of cheese of your choice, a squirt of mustard, a touch of mayo or sauce leftover from a take out and you got a meal. Cheap.

This was a very simple yet delicious  sandwich to make for a family of 6.  My husband asked for them again.  I have made Mrs. Dash's garlic & herb mayonnaise and spread that on the toasted bread instead of the mayo/mustard combo, and that was delicious as well.

A very easy and quick weeknight dinner served with a garden salad.  I used horseradish mustard for a little kick and would recommend broiling the sandwiches for a little longer than the 2-4 minutes, especially if all of your ingredients came straight from the fridge.

Desperately needs an au jus sauce or something else (like a brown mustard) to kick it up a notch.  Otherwise it's just another warmed up cold cut sandwich.

Great little hot sandwich! I cut this down to serve my son and I and it needed more mayo-tard dressing (as my kids call it). Other than that, it was great and I'll make this again, Fantastic recipe, thanks!

Hard to eat because the mayonaise made the meat slide but the family liked it.

I made this a couple weeks ago and it was great! My husband and I loved it. I'm making it again tonight. It has such simple ingredients, you wouldn't think it would taste so good; but it really is a winner!

These were delicious and easy. I was surprised how good they were since it took such little time to prepare. I made an au jus for dipping but we didn't need it, it actually took away from the goodness of the sandwich. Will definitely be making again. And I did make this exactly as the recipe was written.

Delicious! Even better with home-cooked rare roast beef instead of deli, but I never seem to have enough of that left over for sandwiches! I don't like to toast the rolls because then it seems dry, I just put them under the broiler alone briefly before adding the sandwich ingredients.

So amazing!  I wasn't able to toast the buns first so I just put the whole sub in the oven at 350 for about 10-15 minutes...just watch the cheese.  Then I broiled for a few minutes, but be careful as the buns will burn quickly.

I sometimes get home late from work and need something quick and easy. This recipe can be made to everyones liking with very little effort. I made some with the roast beef, some with turkey, and some with ham. I also switched cheese slices to what they wanted. The sandwiches were great and a nice alternative on busy nights, will deffinately make again and again.

This was a delicious sandwich.  I always judge a recipe on whether or not my husband eats any leftovers.  I didn't have to offer it up twice.  The combination of flavors is wonderful and it is so easy to put together.  YUM!

Very good, quick sandwiches.  Easy to prepare - I did everything in the toaster oven!  Same comment as below, I changed meats and cheese for which ever the kids wanted.

I enjoyed this very much. Okay, it wasn't exactly the same. As close to it with what I had on hand. Difference: Used left over boiled beef roast I made, whole wheat English muffins and mozzarella cheese.

Recipe was easy. I made them for my family as a quick meal before my son had to play trombone at a concert. 
i did change the meat from a deli roast beef to some thin sliced round steak but kept everything else the same.
Next time I might use a different type of cheese and maybe spice up the veggies a bit.

I did change this a bit, based on the ingredients I had on hand, but stayed true to the general idea, and it was delicious. I doubled the recipe, used chopped leftover roast beef, onion powder instead of onion, shredded cheddar cheese, added garlic powder and dill weed, and no tomatoes; I mixed it into a spread for sliced Sourdough Bread (also from this site). I toasted the other side first, then put the spread on and broiled till it was bubbling. My DH said he would like it even better with more mustard, and he gave it an emphatic 5 stars!

Tasty sandwich!  Used with some Peppercini Beef and Chipotle Mayo recipes, both from this site.  Added sliced peppercini peppers, sliced avocado and olives as well with the tomato and onion. After broiling I topped with shredded lettuce. Delicious...and filling!  Thank you!

My family really liked this recipe.  I was looking for a roast beef sandwich that was easy and different.  I made my son's sandwich without the tomato and onion and he still enjoyed it.  I also toasted the bread in the oven first, then added the ingredients before I placed it under the broiler.  Good recipe!

Very good & easy recipe!  Kids liked!  Forgot to toast the buns first-would've been even better.  Used cheese we had available-parmesan, and still great. Also added some sauteed mushroom.  Yummy!

I didn't have rolls so I used english toasting bread. I toasted in my toaster because I don't have a toaster oven. I heated up the roast beef slices in a skillet before assembling and used shredded (4) cheese mixture because i didn't have provolone. I also omitted the onion because i didn't have that either. With everything I DIDN'T have, this sandwich still came out GREAT!! Thanks!!

These were really great, simple sandwiches.  I would suggest warming them in the oven for 5-10 minutes BEFORE broiling-ours had melty cheese, but weren't all that warm.

This sandwich was outstanding, and very easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of olive oil and vinegar on top of the tomato, and to put the onions on top of the cheese-- the broiler carmelizes them.  This, and variations of it, will become a part of our regular rotation on those "I don't feel like cooking" nights.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best!!!  I made it according to the directions, except I used Dijon mustard instead. (It's what I had).  In the future, I may try variations, but right now it is WONDERFUL just the way it is.  My compliments to the chef!!!!!

Excellent with minor changes. I didn't have Grainy mustard so I just used regular Dijon. I caramelized the onions. I followed the rest but after broiling I topped it with the toasted top half of the bun. Something about holding a sammie rather than using a knife and fork makes it seem to taste better!

Very yummy and quick. What I like about this is you can use any meat or cheese you like. We used ham and Swiss on half and ham and Colby jack on the other. Ty for the recipe!

Too funny. I just made this today EXACTLY without ever seeing this recipe. How odd. I was just now trying to look up what else I could do with my leftover roast beef I had after making my open faced sub and saw a picture of this recipe and clicked on it because it looked like what I had just made on a whim. I have to say they were good too :)  In the summer I'll add a fresh green pepper (after broiling for some crunch) and will definitely use tomatoes from the garden.

Really tasty, hits the spot.  A bit on the greasy side but you can use turkey for a lighter sandwich.

Delicious! This sandwich recipe is versatile and so simple!

In addition to all of the other ingredients, I had mine with turkey and havarti on toasted sliced wheat bread. My boyfriend had roast beef with cheddar on toasted sliced wheat bread. For color, I threw on some dill weed along with the salt and pepper. This was easily done in 10 mins. 

Will definitely make again!

Very simple, but very yummy!  It was a great fast meal with chips or fries, and my family LOVED it!  My husband has asked that we have this as often as we can!  We used deli roast beef and tomatos fresh from the garden...great flavor combination with the provalone!

The buns would not fit into my toaster so I broiled them in the oven until browned. I followed the recipe exactly and used Creole Mustard.  These were tasty.

I used this recipe with the Best Beef Dip Ever found on this website instead of deli roast beef.  I also subbed the mayo and mustard with Home Horseradish also from this site, and used Mozzarella instead of Provolone!  My hubby thought it was divine!  Thanks HellSwitch for a great sandwich!

Quite tasty! My significant other said, "Oh, sandwiches for dinner" -- he was unimpressed. But after tasting them, he was VERY impressed. He ate two and they are large. The only problem I had was that I wasn't able to toast the hoagies in my little toaster, but that didn't seem to affect the quality at all. I'll be sure to make this one again.

these were quick and easy, tho i changed them a bit. i used fat free cheese and mayo. i didnt have hoagie rolls so i used hamburger buns and the worked out great.
