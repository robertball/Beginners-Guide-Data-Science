This tea is delicious - it has become a family favorite!   Very similar to the spiced tea (or Russian Tea) mix I used to drink growing up, only it uses better ingredients.  Just a quick tip for brewing the tea - I brew mine for 15 minutes (perfection) and add just a pinch of baking soda to the hot water, which takes out any bitterness in the tea.  Try drinking this over ice as well - equally delicious!!  Thank you Carmen for submitting such a wonderful recipe!

I made this exactly by the recipe, but when I tasted it, it seemed a little weak. So I added the tea bags back in for another 10 minutes (I had already discarded the cinnamon and cloves). The next time I make this, I will steep tea, cloves, and cinnamon for 15 minutes since I like my tea a little stronger, which will turn it into a 5-star recipe. Delicious afternoon pick-me-up.

I added an additional cup of orange juice to give it a lighter taste.

I sure did. I added a lot more cinnamon sticks and cloves! It turned out delicious and was very calming.

This is the same as Russian Tea, with fresh ingredients and much less sweet - a good thing.  The other advantage is that I don't have to mix as many servings as the dry mix version.

Delicious.  Wanted a warmer-up that wasn't spiced apple cider. This is very good. Adjust the sugar to your preference. I think I'd use a little less next time.
