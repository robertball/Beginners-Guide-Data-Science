Suprisingly, this was a very good dish. I really didn't know what to expect after reading the reviews, but I halved the recipe and was pleasantly suprised. It probably could have used more egg, in my opinion, but it is very good as is. For more details, please refer to my blog about Russian food! Thanks for a great recipe.

It was very dry and I ran out of eggs near the top, so the next time I baked it in a tall dish, so it wasn't so dry and added more eggs and onion. Try adding sliced hungarian sausage (kolbasz) for added flavor to the layering.

This was pretty good. Like other reviewers said it was pretty dry (and I added a lot of extra sour cream). When we ate it, we put a few dollops of sour cream into it and it tasted really good that way. Overall I liked the combination of potatoes, eggs, and onions, but it just needed that extra creaminess factor.

Yum!  I did make some slight changes, though.  I did put salt and pepper on each potato layer; used chive & onion sour cream; parsley and a bit of olive oil drizzled on the top layer (which I ended with potatoes, not sour cream) and covered the dish for baking.

I followed the recipe flawlessly and it came out too dry.  More sour cream and not eggs would've made this dish superb!!

Very Dry. Tasted nice but the dryness made the texture very crumbly. Perhaps better with normal cream.
