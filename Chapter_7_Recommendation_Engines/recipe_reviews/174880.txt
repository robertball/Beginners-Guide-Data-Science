These were better the second day than the same day they were baked.  So don't be disappointed when you first taste them.  You might be surprised the next day!  Also the stores here in Meridian, Mississippi did not carry the holiday colors so we had to use the regular boring colors of brown/white...what a drag.  Oh well...they tasted good anyway.

My family LOVES these.  The only thing I do different is that I use Milk Chocolate chips or Dark Chocolate chips.
