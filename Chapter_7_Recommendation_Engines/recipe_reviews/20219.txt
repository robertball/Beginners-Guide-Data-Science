This is a great recipe!

I have also added a 46 oz can of pineapple juice.  I also added one more cup of Whiskey to this as the added pineapple jusce will make it want to freeze harder.  You want to be able to scoop it out and only add a little ginger ale or lemon lime carbonated type beverage.  I keep it in the freezer all summer and use it when ever I want a nice cold punch like drink.  If you do not add the tea it will not taste the same, so don't forget the tea.  I steep 6 tea bags in two cups of very hot water.  This makes a good and strong tea.

I love this stuff! It is so refreshing on a summer day! The only changes to this recipe is I used a 12 oz. can of orange juice and the recipe I used was a 1/2 gal. of bourbon whiskey. It makes it strong but the lemon-lime soda covers up the strongness and it packs an extra punch! This one batch is HUGE so make it for a party/get together or if you want it for the freezer for all summer.

very good slush, NO extra sugar is needed, all the juice concentrate is plenty sweet (and I like sweet cocktails).  I'm not sure I cared for the orange juice flavor in this, I think next time (there will be one!) I may try limade and lemonade combined.  I'll report back!  *****UPDATE:  tastes very good with limade instead of Orange juice concentrate.  I love this recipe!***

Delightful party beverage!!  This is the one everybody asks if I plan to make!  I have to make a double batch (I mix and freeze it in the top of my rubbermaid cake keeper and it fits perfectly) for parties and it is ALWAYS all gone by the end of the evening.  I prefer the ginger ale, but the sprite will do in a pinch.  I agree with an earlier poster--you will definitely need more than one liter of the soda.  We might go through 3-4 two-liters for a double batch.

My family has been using this recipe for years as well.  We use 4 tea bags in 2 cups of water and 2 cups of sugar dissolved in the 7 cups of water.  I have swiched it up once in a while with different juices.  I always use the lemonade but experiment with different juice.  My favorite is Cranberry juice with orange spice tea and I use vodka instead of whiskey.  During the holidays I try and find cranberry ginger ale instead of lemon-lime soda or you could use a sour soda like 50-50 or squirt.  In the summer I have also used a citrus punch juice and a citrus vodka.  There are soooo many possibilities with this recipe!!  Have fun and enjoy!!!

This recipe is also great using Peach Schnapps.  Just add a large bottle in lieu of the whiskey and use 7Up instead of ginger ale.  For those who don't like whiskey it's a nice, refreshing alternative for a hot summer day.  Oh, and I always used green tea instead of black tea but I don't think it really matters what kind of tea you use.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I have been making it for years and always have it in my freezer during the summer.  I also add maraschino cherries, plus some of the juice.  I use Amaretto instead of whiskey, making it more like an Amaretto slush. Is much smoother.  I will try limeade next time.  Never thought of that.  And it's wonderful with Fresca or Sprite, instead of Ginger Ale.

I have this same recipe and been making this for about 4 years.  It's wonderful.  You can use 7up if desired or any other lemon-lime soda. Keep a tub in the freezer for those unexpected drop-ins.  You can offer them a beer or one of these!!

I'm kind of in the middle of the road on this one. It's not bad, but as written, the amount of whiskey is sort of pointless. If I make this again, I'll be making some changes. I would change the ginger ale to Sprite, raise the amount of whiskey, and maybe cut back the water a bit.

This is a great summer drink in Florida! After several batches, we concluded it needed more whiskey.

Now this is my grandmothres slush recipe!  I found a similar one on here but they added pineapple juice, which she never did.  I wish I was sipping on one right now.  I'm definately making a batch this weekend.  Brings back so many memories!

Awesome recipe!!  The only change I made was that I omitted the sugar.  The Orange Juice and Lemonade had enough sugar in them already.  VERY REFRESHING.

When I made this I thought I had made too much, but my wife and I polished it off soon enough.  It keeps great in the freezer.  It is easy to make and tastes great.  I tried it mixing it with ginger ale and also with sprite.  Either one works great.

Good grief - this is one of the best drinks we've had/made!  Really does taste similar to a long island iced tea - just slushy!  Enjoy!  We did!!  (We did cut the sugar back a little and added more whiskey - even after it was made - still yummy!)

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is always a hit at parties.  IF we put any soda in it has always been 7-up or Squirt.  I also cut the sugar in half, it is more to our liking that way.  After doing it like that for a while I decided to make the slush minus the soda and put it into individual plastic cups and use Glad press and seal to keep slush from spilling and freeze that way.  Then when we are ready for one we just put it in the microwave for about a minute and it is still frozen but ready to eat with a spoon.  No more trying to sccop out hard slush.  This is TOO GOOD!

Great recipe, I've been using it for years!  Also good made with brandy.  I use 12oz frozen oj and 3 cups brandy or whiskey.  We've also made it with vodka, the non-whiskey/brandy drinkers like it a lot but we prefer the brandy or whiskey. 
Try it sometime with a flavored tea...cinnamon apple spice is our favorite, especially good for the Christmas holiday celebrations.  I use 7-8 flavored tea bags steeped in 2 cups boiling water so the flavor doesn't end up too weak.  I agree with Gwenevere, don't skip the tea, it's not the same without it.
Thank you for posting this recipe, Bea!!

This was my parents pool drink while I was growing up now I am old enough to serve and drink it also. I am not a whiskey drinker, I can't stand the stuff, but I love this slush. I use 5 cups of water instead of 7.

this was a huge hit at the bridal shower i just hosted.  i used 1/2 cup of sugar as suggested by others and felt like it was sweet enough.  the orange flavor was nice, but i'm excited to try the limeade next time and replace some of the water with whiskey...

My friends mom used to make these and i searched for a similar recipe. This one was right on target. i mixed it in a gallon ice cream bucket. it made a TON of slushies. they were a hit at a pool party i took them to. but i will advise 1 liter of ginger ale is not enough-i bought 2 liters and ran out before the bucket was empty. i substituted sprite and it was just as good. I did't have black tea so i used earl gray that i had on hand--turned out great!

Great recipe to have on hand this summer & it got lots of compliments at a party recently.  I've tried it following the recipe exactly and also using pineapple juice instead of water.  The juice version is a little more sweet.  Both times I just used the brewed sun tea that I had on hand.  I'm not sure how usuing stronger tea might be different but I was please with my results and it was super easy that way.

This recipe (or many variations of it) has been around for at least 40 years. Great summer cooler which can be made with your choice of booze.  There are many flavored syrups available (many with no sugar) so you can flavor it any way you want. Just substitute frozen lineade concentrate for the Orange juice for a more neutral base to suit your booze choice.  I agree that the sugar is not needed. Between the juice concentrates and flavored booze and syrup it's just sugar overload. I want to taste the booze so increase the dosage to satisfy your own desired taste level.  I've been enjoying this slush for years and I'm sure you will too.

This is a great recipe, but we used raspberry ginger ale and instead of oj, we used pineapple orange juice. The slushes were well received on Christmas.

Made the base mixture exactly as per the recipe and it was great! Used Fresca instead of Ginger Ale though. No lemon wedge.  Refreshing drink on a hot day.  Will keep this recipe on hand to make any time of year.

I am not a whiskey lover (or even liker), but my boyfriend is so I made this, and per his suggestion doubled the whiskey. It was absolutely amazing! Everyone at our get together loved it. I made mine with diet ginger ale and thought it was great. Fabulous refreshment for a barbeque.

Great for a large group gathering.  Everyone loves this slush.  Looks festive in a glass garnished with an orange or lemon slice.

My husband and I don't usually drink any alcohol. We received a
bottle of Crown Royal recently and didn't know how to make use of it.
I saw this recipe with the different variations and decided I'd
use the Crown Royal in it. OMG!!! It was awesome.....I think we
are hooked! Had a pool party and the neighbors didn't leave
until we all finished it. Talk about a smooth refreshing drink.
Now we seem to be the most popular neighbors on the block! They
can't stop talking about it.

I have had this recipe for years but had forgotten about it.  4 stars as is, but like others, changes can be made to improve this - leave out extra water, concentrating the tea.

This reminded so much of the brandy slush my mother liked to make for parties when I was a child.  Due to the fact I really don't care for brandy I loved the whiskey twist in this recipe. While it was a bit sweet for our taste once the ginger ale was added it was still so refreshing.

My mom would make this for holiday parties. So glad to find it again! Back in rotation for my family gatherings at the holidays. I do not add the sugar. It is fine without.

This was great! I added pineapple juice as one reviewer recommended. We used Canada Dry until it ran out, then switched to any other soda we had.

It's a constant here...unfortunately.  Ha! It is seriously one of the most dangerous beverages I know how to make. I use less water but more black tea. When I serve it, I like to do a little floater on the top for people who don't like sweet being the first thing they notice.  I also don't use the sugar. Perfect anytime.

This might be my new summer favorite. I left out the sugar (and even used a diet ginger ale), and they were just the right amount of sweet. Dangerous though! They went down WAY too smoothly!

classic slush from the '70's
kind of a frozen Arnold Palmer
less sugar, less water and can sub vodka, rum or brandy.

I will also use this:
1 c. limeade
1 c. water
1 c. rum
2 c. lemon sour (12oz)
1 T. sugar

Big party hit. I use about 1/4 of the sugar, and heavy pour on the whiskey. 

If I keep the orange juice I use Sprite - if using limeade instead I go with gingerale.

I've been making this for years and it's always requested.  the only suggestion I can make is to try it with 50/50 or Squirt, if you can find it.  It's delicious!

I used limeade instead of OJ as that's what I had on hand and added an additional 1/2 cup of whiskey.  Love this recipe!!
