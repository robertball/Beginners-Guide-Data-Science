This salsa has gotten me rave reviews.  I add a bunch of cilantro, juice of one lime and 2 roasted small green chiles.  I think the vinegar is the secret ingredient.

Fast and simple is an under statement here.  This salsa is awesome.  It is the wrong time of the year in St. Louis for home grown tomatoes so I used a can of no salt diced tomatoes and a can of RoTel tomatoes with green chile peppers.  Also threw is a few chopped jalapeno peppers.  I was worried about the vinegar but not any more. Boy is this spicy.  Goes great on top of my black bean veggie burgers, chicken and fish.

It doesn't have to be complicated to be good --- we had some homegrown tomatoes, some poblano and hot banana peppers and my husband was searching for a quick salsa recipe.  He saw this one and tried it.  My initial thought was that it looked like too few ingredients.  I was wrong!  We gobbled up this salsa and the flavor was fantastic.  I disagree with the reviewer that said that it needed more ingredients to be tasty.  I am a huge fan of Mexican / Tex Mex food so I've tasted hundreds of salsas.  This one is really good.  You can certainly add ingredients if you want to, but it is not necessary.

This is the beginning of salsa or pico de gallo. Half of the few reviewers admitted to changing the recipe by adding things. I scaled it to 8 servings to make some tonight and got about 1 cup of salsa. Without anything added it taste like a bowl of tomatoes, onions, and peppers and nothing more. After it was finished I added some lemon juice, minced garlic, and a couple of seasonings. I would have also added cilantro if I had it. With the added flavorings it was better. Just seems like a quick recipe, because ingredients seem to be missing?

This was quick and easy to prepare. Even my husband who is not a salsa fan loved it! I have received special requests from friends and family to can this for them.

As is, I think this would be a bit one dimensional, but that's because I love cilantro and lime. I added a little bit of both, tasted it, added more, tasted, added more again, and in the end, my husband and I agreed that it was really good . . . except that it needed a bit more cilantro and lime. One party guest said it was the best salsa he'd ever had, though. This recipe is certainly a great starting point!

I added a bit of lime juice and cilantro - loved it.  Very fast easy - tastes best if you leave in the fridge 6 or more hours.  Much better than the sweet over processed salsas we buy in the store.

My son wanted some salsa with his chips so I found this easy recipe for him to make.  We had really great tomatoes, so that might be why this salsa came out so yummy!  I did substitute lime juice for the vinegar because I wasn't sure what type of vinegar the recipe called for- regular white vinegar or if their is some Spanish type of vinegar or something.
