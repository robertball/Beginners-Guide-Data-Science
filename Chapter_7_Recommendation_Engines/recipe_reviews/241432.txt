DELICIOUS! Very easy to make. I refrigerated them overnight before cutting them and dusting them with powdered sugar...they cut beautifully and taste really, REALLY good. The shortbread crust just melts in your mouth, mmmmm... I used the zest of a whole lemon in these...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing! :)

These are great but I did make a couple tweeks because I had to discard the first batch. First I added 1/2 cup flour to the crust. It seemed to hold together a little better. The second thing I did was increased the temp to 350 for the first 15 minutes then turned down to 325. I baked for 30 minutes. The reason is the first batch was a gloppy mess. It just wasn't  anywhere near done and my oven runs a little  hot .

They are really good, I just didn’t cook them enough the first time around, we were going to cut them and the custard was still raw.  They had been covered in the fridge for 3 days, so we put the oven back on and cooked them again for 30 minutes, then let cool and cut.  There very good!

I don't think I will make these again, they turned out pretty sour and they were very greasy.  They fell apart, I may have made the recipe wrong but I am sure that I followed the instructions properly.

These were great-- I wasn't sure about the food processor to blend but the crust was delicious.  Took to a party and three people asked for the recipe.  :)

Great taste. Good balance of sugar and lemon, although I did add slightly more lemon.  But I agree that a cooler oven temp for longer would be better. Mine we not totally set in the middle either, although the top was slightly browned as it should be.

I made it exactly like the recipe and it was delicious! I had lots of complements because I made two batches and took some to two different families. I want to try this same recipe with oranges using the orange juice and zest just like the lemon. Yum!

I made these yesterday. Loved the taste of the filing, and the crust was perfect, but I found the curd was too runny. Maybe it needs some cornstarch or something to keep it from flowing all over the dessert plate

My squares did not turn out well, much too sweet for our taste and unfortunately the filling was very runny. I baked it in the oven for 25 minutes but it never set. Perhaps I should have cooked it longer. I will try this recipe again but will add more lemon juice next time and will cook it for a longer time. Disappointing results.

Yum!  Took another cook's suggestion and doubled the custard filling but this requires a longer cooking time. Next time I will still double the filling, grease the pan really, really well and reduce the oven temp to 325 degrees sooner.  Probably half the baking time at each temp, guessing 30 minutes each.

Made exact per recipe except doubled the lemon filling. Absolutely delicious. Lightly crisp on top. Shortbread base melts in your mouth. Will be making these over and over again.
