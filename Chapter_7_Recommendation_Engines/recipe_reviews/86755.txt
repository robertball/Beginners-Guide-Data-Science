This is a breakfast staple in the Philippines. It is usually eaten as you would have bread accompany your meals.  It is normally served to accompany Filipino sausages (with as many varieties as there are regions in the country), thin slices of  fried beef (called tapa) or sweet pork (tocino), or fried fish...even corned beef, luncheon meat, or chicken/pork adobo, for breakfast.  Most times, slices of tomatoes and cucumber or pickled vegetables are served on the  side while the fried meat or fish is dipped in vinegar and minced raw garlic, with salt and black pepper.
The garlic rice, therefore, need no meats in them. It is not the basic "sinangag" (as it is called locally) Basic is the garlic. 
The best to use is day-old cooked rice. When the rice becomes hard in the fridge, just wet your hands and mash the rice to crumble when ready to cook. The finished product is not supposed to be wet but toasted. That is why it has to be "dried" for at least a day in the fridge. That is why it is really called Garlic Fried Rice. Season to taste with salt and pepper and/or enhance further with meat powder while cooking.  
Turn heat off only when you are satisfied with the consistency achieved.
Basically though, except for the pork added, this is the way this dish is done by Filipinos.

I have a person who can't eat pork so i just deleted that portion of the recipe.  This recipe is simple and delicious.  My 10 yr old daughter had a blast cooking this with lots of supervision.

This rice is great.  I cooked the rice the night before in a rice cooker.  I left out the pork and used more garlic salt, I love garlic.  I made this as a side for Easy Olive Martini Chicken, they were great together.

one of my turn to recipes for cooking leftover rice,  of the few filipino foods in my repertoire..... yes i am filipino but  i use whatever rice i have left, sticky rice doesn't work so great..i've even tried it with brown rice and it was great.   IN MY OPINION... don't measure the garlic... put aLOT.... tastes much better...    a quick tip is not to make your heat too hot, or else your garlic wil burn quickly...  usually when my garlic is just starting to brown on the edges, i go ahead and put the rice in, and it will still brown nicely while you mix up the rice..... i prefer lots of garlic and regular salt to using a little fresh garlic and using garlic salt...  ... but everyone's version will be different.....

We had a ton of leftover sliced pork from a party this weekend and I wanted to find a recipe that included both pork and rice.  This recipe fit the bill!  I chopped up the pork and used way more than two tablespoons.  I also added some chopped green onion to the mix.  I swapped the white rice for brown rice and I used pre-minced garlic from a jar.  However, even with those changes this recipe turned out fantastic!  The only thing my husband had to add was some crushed red pepper since he likes things spicy!  And usually he adds a ton of salt and pepper to whatever I make.  I highly recommend this recipe for using up leftover pork!

This is definitely a filipino staple.  Lola would also add some combination of onions, bacon, eggs, quail eggs, bean sprouts, bangus, chinese sausage (julienned), and/or frozen vegetables.

The perfect solution to leftover rice. I love garlic and this really was a flavorful side dish. If the rice is not in an airtight container in the fridge, it may harden. I beat in an egg to make the rice moist again and cook as usual with the garlic and chopped scallions. I don't usually have pork on hand but it still tastes great.

Like other reviewers, I omitted the pork, and the recipe still turned out very well.  I used margarine instead of vegetable oil, and just used more chopped garlic and table salt instead of garlic salt.  It turned out very well.  I used it as the rice portion of a curry dish and my husband said it was a good complement.  :)

Didn't put in the pork and paired with Cajun Shrimp. The two dishes were meant for each other.

I really liked this dish since I am such a garlic lover. I added onion to it as well which gave it a bit more "umph". I actually served it with a chicken marsala and it went well with it. The rich bold flavors made a delicious combination.

This is so easy and delicious.  I can see it going with lots of different types of dishes.  Tonight I'm using it with a Trini Chicken which is also from this site.  I didn't have any ground pork so instead of oil I used 2 tbs. of bacon drippings instead.  It tastes great!

It looks like there's nothing to this recipe, but it was the perfect side dish for my dinner tonight--only thing I changed was to add the last couple mushrooms I had to use up before they went totally belly up--nice, basic rice recipe that's a step above plain old white.

I'm vegetarian, so I made this without the pork of course.  It was o.k., but a little bit dry.  I think a little sesame oil would really enhance the flavor, though I know that would really change everything here!

I'm only giving this a 4 because I modified it and I am not sure how the unmodified version tastes, but I'm sure it's good, but I think I may prefer my version. I cooked the rice as usual and then I added the rice to a pan where I had cooked my chicken in, added butter (you can use unsalted butter to control for salt), adobo seasoning, pepper (white or black), 1 clove garlic and fresh spinach, garlic powder to taste and that's it and it was really great!!!

Was super good, as is.  Of course it would be awesome with all kinds of stuff--red pepper flakes, hot sausage, eggs, etc.  I wound up pairing this with the Cajun Shrimp recipe on here, and it was freakin' awesome.  Even the husband gave it two thumbs up (he'd give it more, but only has two hands, so....)
This was a nice twist on boring old rice :-)

Excellent. This is a go-to recipe each time I have leftover white rice. I did away with the ground pork because I rarely have it anyways. I also used half a head of garlic. I peeled the cloves and then smashed them down. It may sound like a lot of garlic but it was perfect if you like garlic. Instead of garlic salt I used what I had, which was dried, minced garlic. I had a pork chop spice mix which was high in garlic powder and black pepper so used that and added kosher salt. I also didn't have oil, so I subbed margarine. It's easy to use substitutions, and still comes out nice as a base for dishes with sauces.

I love this recipe! I use whatever ground meat is on hand, and add more garlic than called for and onions. My BF and his mother are both philipino and love this dish! It is so good that I use it as a main dish I just use 4 cups rice and 1lb meat.

I made this w/o the meat, just wok frying the cooked rice in the garlic and oil to use as a side dish. I used probably 3 tablespoons of garlic and no garlic salt. I didn't season it at all actually since I cook my rice with salt already. It was outstanding. A quick, easy way to add an awesome flavor to rice. I regularly use garlic and oil with lots of things, so I'm glad I found this. I'll try adding some ground pork or chicken at some point and make it more of the main course.

This rice was perfect!  I used frozen brown rice which I cooked in the microwave then followed the recipe.  I omitted the meat to make it vegetarian.  So flavorful and has the house smelling something wonderful...if you like garlic.  I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder instead and added sea salt to taste and about a teaspoon of dried parsley. First time I actually got a thumbs up from husband for brown rice!

this was so delicious.. cut the recipe in half but added another 3/4 cup of rice b/c it tasted a little too salty to me.. then again i don't think all garlic salt is created equally.. i didn't add the ground pork and used unsalted butter in place of the veggie oil.. we really enjoyed this.. ty so much for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: i made this again and topped with some fresh chopped cilantro.. so good.. this is a dish i look forward to making again every time

Really good.  I added a little salted butter at the end, as I felt it was a little dry.  I used pre-cooked bags of jasmine rice for convenience, that may be why it was a little dry.  Next time I'll add a few green onion tops for a little color.

Very good.  I was skeptical of adding so much garlic salt after all the fresh garlic, but it works!

This was a good way to use left-over chinese food rice.  I used several fresh garlic gloves and mushrooms.  It gave the rice a nice flavor and was super easy.

I added 1lb of pork and a green pepper and called it dinner. It was a huge hit, and I'll make it again!
Thanks so much!

This is delicious served with tocino (sweet cured pork) and topped with a sunny side up fried egg. The only changes I made were to omit the ground pork and use garlic powder with a little salt to taste.

This was OK...somehow I think that we expected more, even though it is a pretty basic recipe. It seemed better to me warmed up for lunch. I added butter to it and it was OK. It is only a slight change from straight white rice as a side. It does seem like a real good starting point to experiment with and make your own additions. Good garlic flavor, however.

I cooked up some bacon and used that grease instead of the vegetable oil.  Also, I did not add the pork.  Now I had a lovely rice dish to go with my bacon!

Very good. I didn't add the pork, and served it as a side dish with mojito chicken. I added some red pepper flakes as suggested by another review. Nice flavor, and an exciting change up from regular old rice.

I could eat this dish every day!
My version though, calls for using chopped ham (like leftover Christmas ham) instead of ground pork. After seasoning the rice, I usually make a well in the middle of the pan and add a couple of beaten eggs, scramble them and then when beginning to set, combine quickly with the rice. Sometimes I add frozen green peas and spring onions when the mood takes me - instant fried rice!

Yummy!  Fast and easy.  I only had a jar of garlic, but it worked well.  I started browing the sausage first, then added the garlic.  Fantastic!  Next time I will add some onion as well.  Easy, delicious side dish!

This is a quick and tasty side dish. Next time as a personal preference, I would up the chopped garlic to 2 tablespoons. I will also use a little less oil than the recipe calls for because I use oil in the instapot to make the rice. It was slightly too salty for me so I will cut back to one teaspoon of garlic salt.  Overall this is a great recipe and can easily be adjusted for personal tastes and preferences.

5 star with the following change.  You must triple the seasoning ingredients for 8 chicken thighs if you're going to season both sides of thighs. I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the seasonings but will use 1 to 1.5 tsp next time as the chicken was still bland. (I did not have garlic salt so I'm not sure you would need salt at all if you use garlic salt).  I oiled a cookie cooling rack, placed it on top of a foil-lined cookie sheet and placed the seasoned chicken on the rack.  I baked in a preheated 450 degree oven for 1 hour.  The chicken came out still juicy and crispy skin. There was very little fat in the pan but the drippings do burn so be sure to foil the baking sheet.  Hope this review is helpful.

I really liked this; although, I used garlic powder and sea salt because I didn't have garlic salt.  The rice had a subtle hint of garlic which was perfect.

I just omitted the meat since I was looking for a side to go with something I already prepared. 
This was tasty and my son, who is a picky eater, said that from now on he always wants his rice made this way.

So, I make this a lot at home.  I don't usually do Pork all that often, as we don't buy it a lot, so what I use is Salmon.  I do everything that the recipe says, sans pork, plus salmon and it is amazing!  10/10

I substituted turkey sausage for the pork. Definitely garlicy. Wouldn't recommend it for a date night (unless you're both eating it). I served it with a mild fish dish and it complemented it well.

A wonderful accompaniment to the Adobo Chicken with Ginger (another allrecipes recipe).  I've made this recipe both with pork and without.  Without pork, try using a bit more oil so the rice isn't too dry.  Also, I like to amp up the flavor with a seasoned stir-fry oil (typically infused with garlic, ginger and black pepper).
Finally, the rice needs to be cold or room temperature for frying.  As a quick "cheat", start with a packaged ready rice.

This rice turned out really great for me. I didn't include pork because the rice was a side for a chicken dish. It was pretty great, and while everyone was pleased with the chicken, they all scarfed down the rice. 

Since I omitted pork, I threw in a little extra oil to make up for the loss of fat. After mixing the rice with the garlic\oil, I added just a little water to keep everything moist. I'm sure I'll make this again in the future, and I'll try it with the pork. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for company and they loved it. I omitted the pork for a vegetarian side dish. Tonight I am making it for company again, but this time I am adding veggies and making it the main dish. Thanks for the recipe.

I am not a white rice fan unless it has soy sauce on it, but this recipe is amazing! I love it!

Great for breakfast. I made mine with chorizo and more garlic. It tasted like my mom's authentic Filipino fried rice. Yum! Yum!

Delicious! We love garlic and the bold flavor of this rice was excellent.  I make this without meat and I don't feel like it's missing anything.  Definitely one of my new favorite rice recipes!  Served with Amazing Spicy Grilled Shrimp.

Not so much!  This was kind of bland and didnt have much taste!  I tried it twice, and both times just didnt like it!
