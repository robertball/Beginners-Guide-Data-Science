I actually used this as a base recipe, with very few additions or tweaks. My family loved it! thanks for a wonderful Pizza! We definitely needed a change from the homemade boring peperoni pizza's! I sprinkled Garlic powder on the dough...(next layer). I added 2 tbsp water to the soup and stirred until creamy..once on I added 1/2 cup Parmesan..(next layer). I used some raw chicken tenders I had and sauteed them with some onion and  mushroom and sprinkled that mixture on top. I then added bacon bits and shredded cheese. let it cook for the called for time, removed it drizzled it with ranch dressing(add 2 tsp milk to thin it out a bit)..put back in the oven for 7 min. Then serve.

I make gourmet home pizzas often,  family pizza/movie nights, and I did not care for this at all.  I thought the soup as a sauce would be an interesting twist, but the flavor of SOUP was way too strong and just plain wrong on a pizza.  Chicken bacon ranch, fine...soup? canned chicken? I'll stick with my ranch sauce base.  Pass on this one!!!!

Excellent. I too used my own home made crust with seasonings and parm. cheese added to it. I also sauted sliced portabella mushrooms in 2 tbs margarine with 2 cloves of Garlic. I took one cut up chicken breast and cooked that in 2 tbs margarine and 2 cloves of garlic (we love garlic). I used a mexican blend of cheese, more parmesan cheese and aprox 1/2 tsp dried baisl. The portabellas added an excellent flavoring to this pizza!

OMG! This was sooo good! I have been looking for this recipe for a long time and this is it. I made it just like the recipes calls for. I used a Pillsbury pizza dough and followed the cooking instructions for the dough which was 13 minutes @ 425 degrees. At 10 minutes I pulled it out and drizzled the ranch dressing on it (home made ranch dressing) and then put it back in for the last 3 minutes. Yummm....my family loved it. Definitely will be making it again. The combination of the soup, the chicken, the bacon, cheese and ranch dressing is so incredible. You have to try it.

Tastes like soup on a crust. Can't taste the cheese at all and the bacon is barely noticeable. I'll try a different recipe next time. Boo.

Made this last night. I used Boboli pizza crust, cooked for about 5-6 minutes and then added layers. The only thing I would change is to use a low sodium soup next time. With the soup and the bacon, the three of us thought it was too salty. Otherwise, it's definitely a favorite I'll make again!

This recipe was great! I pan fried the chicken in some garlic and mixed it with some pesto and basil. Instead of mozzarella and mexican cheeses, I used a blend from Kraft called Italian. The whole pizza was excellent.

I made my own pizza crust and used cheddar and Parmesan cheese instead because I didn't have the others on hand. It was delicious!

The ranch dressing was a delightful surprise.  I had to cook this a lot longer then the recipe stated.  I even tried precooking the crust for 10 minutes before loading with toppings but still needed to cook the pizza twice as long.  I'm not sure if this issue is because I live at 6,000+ feet.  I have this problem with every pizza I try to cook.

This is great!  I admit that I wanted the sauce to taste like Ranch, so I mixed ranch seasoning mix in with the Chicken soup.  I think it is 5 stars either way.  Thanks for sharing!

The Cream of Chicken Soup "really" needs to be doctored with some additional seasoning and don't put too much on, other than that its not a bad recipe, quick and easy to make.. just get a little creative

This was fabulous!! I added some cubed pepperoni and I made my own pizza dough. I really didn't want to drizzle the ranch over it, but I did it anyway and it was so good! Thanks for posting it!!!!

I recommend using 1/2 can of cream soup per crust (just enough for a very thin layer) otherwise it overpowers all the other flavors.

I have made the pizza as is and my family has LOVED it.  The last time I made it, I thought I had all of the ingredients.  I forgot the soup. (not even sure how that happened) - so instead I put olive oil and garlic on the crust, then everything else.  It was an even bigger hit.
