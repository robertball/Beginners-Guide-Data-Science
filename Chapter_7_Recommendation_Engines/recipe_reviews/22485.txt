These are awesome. Quick and very easy to make. I found they needed to be baked a little longer than 8-10 minutes, though - more like 10-12 minutes.

I MADE THESE FOR MY SON TO TAKE TO SCHOOL. HIS CLASSMATES REALLY ENJOYED THEM, AND WANTED MORE. VERY EASY TO MAKE, AND MY CHILDREN AND HUSBAND ENJOYED THEM VERY MUCH. I DID HOWEVER LET THE COOKIES COOK A LITTLE LONGER. THANKS. A GREAT RECIPE.

Delicious cookie!  A bit too much chocoloate but by leaving out some of the chocolate pieces the recipe is perfect.

I took these to work and everyone loved them! I was able to buy the candy-coated chocolate at a bulk food store.  I added broken Skor (Heath in the U.S.) bar, halved the amount of candy bits and added mini chocolate chips, along with the 'regular' chocolate chips.  A tasty and easy recipe!

These cookies came out soo awesome! Moist and chewy!  Delicious! My kids ages 3 and 2 only cared about the little m&m pieces and picked them all out of the cookies (I think the coconut might hae been too much for them)...but me and the hubby loved them. They were like a very chocolaty macaroon.  I used Mini M&M's and I also used chocolate graham crackers!

Could not find candy coated bits anywhere! Would have been better with them. Cookies comes out like chocolate chip with coconut. But very good.

At first I was worried, since the dough was *extremely* watery, however, I added a few shakes of flour extra and it turned out very nicely. My only improvement to this recipie (it's THAT good- and relatively simple to make!) would be to add about 1/2- 1 tsp. of salt. It does need the contrast. Also- I have no idea what Holiday Candy Coated Bits are, and I assume they must be a regional thing so I just used the semi-sweet chips- and it's still excellent. I can see these cookies being really good with nuts in them, especially salted nuts if you don't add salt to the batter....ENJOY!!!

A tasty, moist cookie. Couldn't find the colored baking chips so used a 1.75 oz. jar of colored jimmies.  
I loved the simplicity of this cookie, and that it had no eggs and no nuts, due to severe food allergies.

These cookies are awesome!! They come together very quickly and easily.  I have been making them for 9 years now and everyone loves them and always asks for more.

Words cannot express how bad these came out for me.  Looking at the list of ingredients, I thought they would be great, but they really were a mess.  They spread into one large cookie, didn't rise AT all, were far too chewy, they were just awful.  Looks, taste...  I used parchment paper, tried to lower the temperature to cook them slower, made them smaller- nothing.  I made two batches thinking that I must have forgotten something, but they were awful both times.  Really disappointing.

I love these cookies!! My aunt found this recipe in a magazine a few years ago and they were awesome! For those of you whoe are looking for the candy coated bits they are just the mini m&m's they have them in the same spot as the chocolate chips and stuff. 

I did notice that some of them do stick to the pan sometimes but I still think they taste YUMMY!

I love this cookie. I have so many cookies I love to make at the holidays and not enough time or money to make them all so I rotate them from year to year and these made the rotation. The graham cracker gives these cookies such a great holiday taste. It's something different to try!

I liked these cookies OK, but since so many other people I gave them to loved them I gave it 4 stars. They did stick very badly to the pan, I thought that was just some mistake I made but it seems it happened to others too. I didn't know what the Candy Bits were, so I replaced them with Ghiradelli White Chocolate Chips and those tasted really good. I'm not sure I would make this again for myself, but my mom loved them so I have to! I think the reason they stuck so badly is because of the coconut...I would suggest that others maybe try less coconut?

I make cookies every Christmas and I usually try a new recipe every year.  This recipe, however, I will never make again.  I ruined many dozens of them because they all stuck to the pan.  Sweetened Condensed Milk is really not meant to be in cookie recipes, but the ones that were not completely ruined tasted OK.  In my opinion, these are too much of a hassle to make every year.  For all of you who were able to get them off the pan, how in the world did you do it?

I cook and bake a lot and regularly use allrecipes.com.  I had high expectations based on the reviews but found this recipe to be very disappointing.  I definitely should have tested it before making it for a cookie exchange!  They taste "ok" but stick badly with or without cooking spray and become deformed when you remove them from the sheet.

These were good; however, based on the reviews I expected more.  The one thing I really liked is they stay moist and chewy.  They are a bit busy for my taset, too many flavors and textures.  But, everyone at work loved them.

These were realy good.  My husband loved them.  They are more like candy cookies because there is so much "stuff" in them.  These will be one of our favorites that I'll make every year.

What a great tasting cookie.  Wherever I go with them, I get at least 3-4 people asking for the recipe.  I did cook mine a little longer, and used less chocolate.
