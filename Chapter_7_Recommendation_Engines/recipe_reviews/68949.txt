All I have to say is WOW!One quick tip: I microwaved my sweet potato until tender and then mashed with a fork to speed up the process. It was a quicker cook time, made the sweet potato easier to puree. SO FAB!!!

I've made this soup two times.  The first time my husband referred to it as the 'peanut butter soup' and we ended up throwing out the leftovers.  The second time I made a few modifications:  halved the peanut butter, subbed lemon for lime, omitted cilantro and tomato (as I was out).  It turned out fantastic!  This made the perfect lunch on a chilly winter day.

This is an interesting and flavorful soup.  To make it more "Thai" I added a can of lite coconut milk.  Added creaminess and wonderful flavor.  Next time I make it I might omit the red pepper flakes and add red curry paste instead for more of a kick.  Definately a
keeper!

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of the traditional Sweet Potato with marshmellows.  It turned out wonderful.  I used my crock pot and then after the potatoes were soft combined all the ingredients (including sour cream and tomatoes) and then blended everything together to make it easier for me Thanksgiving day.  I used only about 1 Tbsp of peanut butter and added 1/4 cup coconut milk.  It was amazing!  I received so many compliments and now no one wants the traditional Sweet Potato Casserole for Thanksgivig again.

I thought this was delicious, a very different way to use sweet potatoes. The flavors blend well and gave it a Thai sort of flavor, what with the lime, ginger, red pepper, peanut butter, etc. I followed the recipe exactly, although I had to substitute ground ginger in place of the gingerroot (1 tsp was about right) and bottled lime juice for the fresh. The toppings really made it special - especially the fresh tomato! My kids turned up their noses, but I wasn't expecting any different; my husband and I loved this. Will make again!

This is my first review, and I have to do it because this soup was just amazing! I didn't have cilantro so I left that out, and only put in about a Tbsp of peanut butter because someone else's "peanut butter soup" review made me nervous. I also approximately doubled the chili flakes; I like the flexibility with the spiciness. Anyway, it came out PERFECT, and very easy. The sour cream and tomato topping was great too. Everyone loved this soup!

I'm really the only one in my house who likes sweet potato soup, but it was no chore to finish the entire pot myself. OK, so it took a couple of weeks, and there was freezing involved.
 
Great recipe, though I'll confess that tweak as I go along. I added more cumin and some cayenne. A warm hunk of bread is the perfect accompaniment.

This was honestly one of the very best soups I've ever made -- and my friends call me the Soup Nazi. I didn't have cumin in the house at the time, but it was wonderful anyway. YUM!!!

delicious ~ and easy to make, took about 30 minutes. i used some japanese sweet potatos i had, substituted some tangy cottage cheese for the sour cream, and didn't have any cilantro on hand (what a shame! i bet it makes it just pop) but still it was a really really good soup. 

i like my soups with some texture, so i only pureed half the soup, used chunky peanut butter, and left the skins on the sweet potatos. 

thanks for the recipe!

This soup was delicious!  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and also used no fat plain yogurt as the topping with the lime zest.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Great soup!   I simmered the sweet potatoes in 3 cups of chicken stock and then added one cup of coconut milk after it was cooked.  I cut the peanut butter down to one heaping tblsp.   I also bumped up the spices..... I added 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp. of curry powder to the onions and garlic after they were cooked.

I didn't have a lime, but next time I plan on putting a dollop of yogourt ,with lime zest on top of the soup.

I've made this twice now and it doesn't disappoint!  I skip the whole sour cream and tomato on top part and both times I've actually used sweet potatoes that had already been roasted in the oven.  Next time I will double the recipe so there will be some for my freezer stash!  Mmm!

I made this toward the end of the week, so had to make a few changes to accomodate for my dwindling pantry. First off, as no one in my family is a huge peanut butter fan (imagine that!) I took another reviewer's advice and halved the amount, also, I used chunky peanut butter as that is all I had on hand, and mixed it in at the beginning so the blender would work out the chunks of nuts. I also used chicken broth instead of stock (does anyone actually BUY stock anymore???) and 2 tablespoons of powdered ginger rather than fresh. I omitted the cilantro, even though I love it, I hadn't the time to make a grocery run for it. All in all, this was a fabulous recipe!!! Even my picky three year old loved it. I fully plan to make it again, AFTER going grocery shopping! Thanks for sharing!

I only had two smallish sweet potatoes so I added a few carrots and it is very, very good.  I didn't have a lime either but it doesn't seem to need it.  It is bitterly cold today and this soup is just what we need to warm us up.

I decided to make this as the "starter soup" for my division's Thanksgiving feast. I got up 1 hour early to start cooking......I was really rushing things (I am a slow cook). I microwaved the potatoes, cooked up 12 ounces of bacon, and sauteed the onions and garlic cloves in the bacon grease. I then pureed the microwaved sweet potatoes, chicken broth, onions and garlic in a blender (it took several blendings, as I had increased the serving size to 24). I left the skins on the potatoes, added the spices, etc....except that I reduced the peanut butter by about 75%. I didn't measure anything, and didn't even have time to taste it before taking it to work in crock pot to cook for 4 hours. I crumbled the bacon to add as a garnish, along with the roma tomatoes and sour cream/lime zest. OK, I even added a little bacon grease to the soup.  I was more than a little terrified to bring an untested, hastily prepared, unusual dish to a work function. Without a doubt, I received more rave reviews than from any other recipe I have ever cooked. Of course, 1/2 the people didn't even want to taste it. But those who did went back for seconds or thirds, and just absolutely raved about it and want me to bring it to future "meals". I tried to generally follow the recipe, except to substitute thyme for the cilantro. As others have said, go easy on the peanut butter. And I agree, the garnish/toppings are essential. I personally loved the addition of the bacon, so consider adding it, also.

I absolutely loved this soup and I don't own a blender. I just baked the potatoes in the oven until they are slightly overdone- I love the carmelized flavor of overdone sweet potatoes. Then I just scooped them out of their skins and followed the recipe as normal, but reduced the peanut butter as others recommend. It is equally delicious with sliced onion and pieces of ginger floating around and gives it a very rustic appearance. Definitely still make if you don't have a blender!

This is alright, but not great. I followed the directions exactly except that I substituted one tsp of ground ginger for the fresh ginger.

This was interesting but a little strong for a whole bowl of it. It was more of a novelty to taste than a soup you'd want to eat a whole bunch of. I used half a cup of coconut milk instead of the sour cream to further the Thai flavor.

Yumm!  Like others suggested, I microwaved the potatoes first.  One suggestion - mine turned out kind of thick, it would be helpful to have a more specific measure for the potatoes - in weight rather than size, for example.

Yum! I loved this- I had a flop of sweet potato fries recipe earlier this week, so I got to use up those uneaten fries in this recipe.  I loved the warmth and depth of it.  I added a can of black beans for more texture (just before ladling into the bowls).  The cilantro on top is great!

This soup was so creative and interesting - but ultimately too rich for my taste. I found the first several bites delicious, and then it became too much. If I make it again I will not use it as a main and serve really small amounts.

Follow the recipe exactly and you will have a winner!  the complex and unusual flavors are a nice surprise.  Don't skip anything.  Lemon juice and zest does well in a pinch, but the lime  really makes this soup special.  Be careful to keep the peanut butter at or below the amount in the recipe.  I used too much and thought the peanut taste was too strong.  (My bad.)  I used olive oil instead of butter (which I usually burn!) All my co-workers raved about this soup when I brought it in for lunch.

How unusual tasting and good. This was flavor upon flavor. Very rich...a little goes a long way. Next time I will thin just a tiny bit more.

WOW. This soup was delicious! and we don't normally like sweet potatoes! Per several reviews I made some adjustments to the original recipe: 1) I used 3 medium sized sweet potatoes, 2) substituted 1 cup of chicken broth for 1 can of coconut milk, 3) increased cumin to 1 1/2 tsp, 4) added 1 1/2 tsp red curry paste and omitted the red pepper flakes, 5) subbed fresh ginger for 1 tsp powdered as that's all I had. I didn't have any cilantro either, but I can see how it would taste very good! You can really taste the lime, and next time I might just use half. The fresh tomato is awesome, as well as the lime zest sour cream. Definitely making this again.

I subbed evaporated milk for sour cream, sriracha for pepper flakes, and tahini for peanut butter. Used roasted sweet potatoes because I wanted to do something with leftovers. Excellent, thanks.

This is the first time I actually made a sweet potato soup using chicken stock as opposed to vegetable stock.  I was a little apprehensive at first, but let me tell you, I liked it.  It smelt really good cooking and the other flavors seemed to blend and complement each other nicely (the cumin, etc.).  Even the sour cream and lime zest was amazing and added a lovely flavour.  BUT....what I didn't like and would omit next time is the peanut butter.  After reading the other reviews I decided to cut the peanut butter in half.  With only half the amount put in, it was still too strong.  It took away from the other flavors and brought the soup down a few notches from "restaurant quality" (and why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).  Without the peanut butter, this soup, in my opinion, could be restaurant quality.  By the way, I didn't have sour cream but substituted plain yogurt and the 'dollop' in the middle still tasted great (even my husband commented on it).  Because of the lime zest power, I don't think it would make a difference using sour cream or yogurt.

This was really good.  I made it with veggie stock, but like other people thought it could use just slightly less peanut butter.  Think it would also be good to double the spices, but I tend to like spicy food.

I made a half recipe because I only had 1 sweet potato. I followed the recipe except I had to use dried ginger. I tasted it before adding the sour cream with lime zest or cilantro (didnt have any tomatoes on hand) and it was good. But with the toppings it took it over the top for me. Yum. Easy cheap and delicious.

This was really good - very different though.  Definitely enjoyed it.  And I didn't even have fresh ginger, a real lime, cilantro, tomatoes, or sour cream!  I halved the peanut butter as others had suggested, and it was just perfect.  I also added some heavy cream at the end, and it made it that much better.  Very good!

I've made this soup numerous times and everyone I've made it for loves it.  I typically follow the recipe exactly because I don't think it needs any modifications.  Great recipe!

WOW!  This soup is SO DELICIOUS!  I think next time I will try a tad less peanut butter (I won't omit because it makes it sooo creamy).  The soup without the peanut butter was amazing by itself so I'm sure if you wanted to add cream instead of peanut butter you could!  I love all of the flavours and the fact that it's so healthy!  (There's a tiny bit of fat but all good fat for your body!)  ENJOY!  I AM :D

You say, "tomato," I say "to-mah-to." You say, "potato," I say, "po-tah-to." You say, "five stars, I say one star." My family just did not care for this soup. I guess we're not very adventurous eaters! My one star is for the looks on my sons faces when they took their first bite and my husband's face when he tasted the lime/sour cream. It must be a great recipe since so many loved it, but just not for us. Thank you, though!

I have been addicted to this soup ever since I first made it a few months ago. The sweetness of the sweet potatoes and the peanut butter balanced with the lime is soooo good. I use parts of this recipe and parts of a similar one that adds black beans and doesn't blend the soup, which I prefer. I also use chunky peanut butter. If you like this recipe, also check out some of the other variations on it--there's another recipe from All Recipes that I make which uses diced tomatoes, bell pepper, rice, and peanut butter. Yum!

Delicious soup! I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and my family loved it. I used 1 1/2 pounds of sweet potatoes and it came out well, but will try 2 pounds next time so it is thicker. There is no need to add salt. If you are watching your sodium and/or fat intake, consider using a sodium and/or fat reduced ingredients. This recipe yields about 2 quarts of soup. In my house this is not enough for 8 servings! Realistically as a main course, expect 4 to 6 servings.

On my second time, I made this in quantity and gave containers to a a few friends.  We all love this soup.  It's a very forgiving recipe.  I used vegetable stock, grated lemon peel instead of lime zest, did not put tomato on top.  I've made this starting with raw sweet potato cubes, and also with microwaved and then mashed sweet potato.  My son thought it was a little too peanut butter-y but I liked the noticeably peanut butter taste.  Great mix of flavors.

I made this recipe as directed minus the sour cream/lime zest garnish; I made it to freeze and pack for lunches so the garnish seemed unnecessary. I tried a small bowl before freezing the rest and was unsurprised to find the ginger flavor a bit too strong. I had suspected 2 tablespoons would be too much. Ginger, but decided (since this was my first time making it) to follow the recipe. Next time I will likely only add 1 tablespoon and taste the soup before making additions (adding teaspoon by teaspoon after that point).

All in all, however, I think this is a good recipe and would certainly make it again.

Great, I overdid it on the ginger, added a whole clove of roasted garlic and my boyfriend was like: "WHOA! That will cure your cold!" We added in tomato chunks to the soup when it came out a little watery, they were a big bonus for people who might not like the 'puree texture'.

Perfect soup for a rainy day! I doubled the spices, which really kicked it up a notch! I also omitted the lime (didn't have any) but think that flavoring would really put this soup over the top. Definitely a keeper!

So good! I didn't have limes but lemon zest/juice did the trick. Heathy, fresh and filling. My man LOVED it. And don't worry about the addition of the peanut butter. I think it makes the soup...

My husband and 9 month old loved this! Since I was giving some of this to my 9 month old, I left out the red pepper flakes until after I blended the soup and removed some for him. Still had great flavor. I also sub'd lemon for lime and plain yogurt for sour cream.

Delicious!  It's a great warm, comforting, rainy-day kind of soup.  The flavor is lovely--it's subtle, so it's not too spicy or too peanut buttery (next time, I might actually bump the spice quotient up a little bit, but I like things spicy.)  The tip to microwave the potatoes first was a great one--they cook while you're cooking the onion, garlic, etc. and then you can just scoop the insides right into the pot!  Plus, it saves peeling them--something I'll avoid any time I can!

One thing...the recipe says it makes 8 servings, but unless you are doing pretty small servings, that's not the case.  I serve it as a main dish, and only get 4-5 servings from it.  Something to keep in mind if you are also planning to serve it as a stand-alone dinner!

This soup was delicious and easy to make. Since I didn't have fresh sweet potatoes on hand I used a 29 ounce can of sweet potato pieces instead. Also I used only half of the fresh lime juice.

This was a great soup.  I think the peanut butter overpowered the dish, so I'd either omit it or reduce it by half next time.  I also replaced the cumin with madras curry powder because that's what I had.  The soup was very smooth once I blended it.  Soothing enough for any winter's day.

This soup surprised me!  I wasn't expecting it to be that great, and it turned out amazing!  My 3 toddlers scarfed it down too!  I played with the spices until it was the way I liked it, just a little spicier.  Will definitely be making again!

I'd give this 3.5 stars.  The more I ate it, the more I liked it.  I could really taste the lime flavor, but didn't get any hint of ginger.  The peanut butter taste was stronger than I'd imagined it would be.  I recommend substitute chipotle powder for red pepper flakes, as it gives a smokier flavor that goes well with the cumin.  Also, this recipe made more like 4 servings if you are serving a full bowl.

I don't have an electric mixer or a blender, so I had to settle for mashing up the sweet potatoes with a wooden spoon.  It probably took a little longer, but I thought the texture ended up great that way.  I also left out the tomato, sour cream-and-lime-zest, and cilantro.  It was really excellent, though next time I'll do like another reviewer said and halve the amount of peanut butter used.  I think I'll also serve it with rice in the future.

This came out awesome! I omitted some things like the sour cream, tomato, cilantro and added an extra garlic clove, paprika instead of red pepper flakes and added some jamaican curry powder (OK, i changed it quite a bit but the basis is the same) used crunchy peanut butter with flax seeds--and it was AMAZING. I blended everything in a food processor and the texture came out perfect. Thanks! I'll definitely be making this at my next dinner party.

This had a very strong flavor and I will definitely make it again.  It was time consuming to make, but worth it.  I used 1 tsp. ginger powder instead of fresh ginger.  I also left out the cilantro, sour cream, and lime zest.  I did not find the peanut butter overpowering as some did, but you have to be a big peanut butter fan to like this.

This was WONDERFUL! I can't get over how awesome this soup was!!!!  I only put in half of the peanut butter as others suggested (I used chunky). You could omit the peanut butter and just add crushed peanuts on top as a garnish. I used two chicken bouillon cubes dissolved in four cups of water and I didn't have to add any salt. I also did not feel like dirtying up my blender so I just mashed the potatoes a bit with the spoon once they were soft and ate it chunky - still awesome!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE! I'm passing it on to all my family and friends :)

Personally, I thought this recipe was a 5 star, but the family was more inclined to give it a 3 star rating.  I did it pretty much exactly as stated  I used a ginger that it is a jar instead of fresh ginger root.  It was what I had from something else I tried.  I used about a tsp.  I guess everyones tastes are different.  I guess I won't make it unless I cook for someone other than the family. :(

Delicious soup. I omitted the Roma tomatoes. Cilantro and sour cream with lime zest were nice. I might use more of the spices next time since I like spicy soups.

I loved this soup. It was delicious and easy to make. I followed the directions and thought the blend of flavors was great. I do think I could eat it without the garnishes if I didn't have them on hand - it was that good.

This recipe has to be the best soup recipe that i have ever tasted.  My girlfriend and I made this a while ago and this has turned into our favorite standby soup recipe.  Although beware that we do love peanut butter so there is just enough peanut butter in this recipe for us.

Great recipe - and a cinch. 

I sometimes omit the creme fraiche but it is a nice touch.  I've also substituted almond butter for peanut butter which works well too.  And I always leave the skins on the potatoes for added texture and fibre.

Awesome!! Super tasty! My husband and I devoured it.  The flavors are so intersting.  After reading the other reviews I decided to use about 1/2 the peanut butter (large heaping tbls or 1.5 tbls)- the flavor was great, there was only a slight hint of peanut butter that my husband only noticed after I told him.  Also I used yams instead of sweet potatoes and so added a tablespoon or so of white sugar and followed the rest exactly.  Don't skimp the toppings- the tomatoes add such a delicious and unexpected flavor.  Thank you!

Hubby put in a request to have more sweet potatoes in our menu (they are incredibly good for you!) so I thought we'd give this soup a try...we both liked it a lot but didn't fall in love w/ it. I cut the recipe in hlaf & I used two medium potatoes instead of one large. This soup was very hearty & very thick....too much so, in fact. I had to add quite a bit more broth (I used vegetable for the additional liquid as I didn't want to add too much "chickeny" flavor.) I used my immersion blender to puree it & I used organic fat-free yogurt instead of the sour cream...love the zip it added! Thsi was a really unique, flavorful soup...thanks Sarbek!

This soup came out very good. I loved the flavors and the smooth texture. It's hearty so can be used as a side dish as well as a main meal.I used vanilla yogurt on top for a great cool taste. Will surely make again.

I liked this for a different tasting soup. Didn't have fresh gingerroot so I used 1 tsp of ground ginger and it was plenty.  Loved the peanut butter flavor!
Great recipe for freezing when sweet potatoes are cheap!

Served chilled due to the heat outside and it was a hit though next time I will add the peanut butter and then stick blend since the PB didn't seem to really just melt. Otherwise it was great.

My daughter and her kids (3 under 3 yrs old) came for dinner.  I thought the soup might be a little too spicy for the kids with 2tbsp of ginger...   But they Loved it.   The 1 yr old was practically swimming in soup and the twins asked for a 2nd helping. Delicious!

I made this soup this morning and I originally gave it 3 stars because the peanut butter flavor (and smell) was overwhelming when you first add it to the soup.  But I left it in the dutch oven for about 3 hours before eating it for lunch and the pb totally mellowed out.  The rest of the flavors all blended together. The hint of lime was fantastic.  I will definitely make this soup again!

This was very tasty change from the usual and I found it delicious. I stuck to the recipe ( except for the cilantro, don´t like it!!). The only criticism I have is the vague instruction on the amount of sweet potato. I used one very large one and had to add some more water as it was too thick.

I used a potato masher once it was cooked and that worked well. Also I put more spice in but I still couldn't taste it. It was just ok to me but my girlfriend liked it pretty well. Maybe it's because I skipped the lime zest in the whipped cream? Also I used 3 tablespoons of dried ginger instead of 2 of fresh but couldn't taste it. Just not a lot of flavor. I may make it again and see.

So good! I did a tblsp of peanut butter instead of 1/4 cup, added a 1/3 cup of milk, and cilantro mixed into the soup. I also added some spicy sausage and blenderized that as well. Amazing!

I make a lot of soups, and this is one of the best recipes I've ever made.  The balance of flavors is wonderful! Fresh ginger makes a big difference, don't be tempted to use powdered, it will change the result.  I made it exactly as written and I will make it again very soon! Thanks for this, SARBEK!

Very simple to make. Delicious. My husband is a meat and potatoes guy and its hard to get him to try different things, but to my surprise he came back to seconds and thirds. The sour cream and tomato on top really make the soup stand out. I didn't have any cilantro. I also used almond butter in place of peanut butter. I will absolutely make this recipe again and again.

Very good and super easy to make! I made a few adjustment, due to lack of items on hand. I used lime juice with the sour cream, no zest. I didn't have any ginger so just completely left that out. I also followed other reviewers advice and added PB in gradually to taste. Overall would definitely make again!

Good use of ingredients.  I liked the PB.  Rather than Thai, I see this as an African-based soup, with the use of peanut and sweet potato.  I did not have sour cream on hand and used thick cream instead.  Would love to try this with sour cream, but honestly, it is delicious without either. You don't need cilantro, but it is quite nice.  I added more flakes and cumin. I don't think it is fair to rate a recipe when you have made any changes, but as I am a soup snob, I give this a 4 star.

This was very nice. I added half a can of coconut milk and tripled the seasonings. We like a little kick but not enough to over power and found tripling it just right. I also added just a bit extra chicken stock so it wasn't so heavy. Lovely flavor and it pleased the family : - )

Delicious! I doubled the cumin and tripled the red pepper flakes. Perfect! The leftovers the next day were even tastier.

I prepared this soup for a class project this week, and it was a huge success! Classmates and I had to plan a menu, prepare, and serve a meal to faculty members. We served this soup, bread and a light salad. They all loved it (even those who did not normally like sweet potatoes or spicy food) and it was so easy to put together.
I actually forgot to add the peanut butter at the end, but the soup still tasted great.
One tip: Unless you really like ginger, you might want to cut it back a bit. I prepared the recipe twice, once to test and once for my project. The second time I used less ginger, but it still tasted a bit strong (however the dollop of sour cream does help calm it).
Thank you SARBEK and Allrecipes!

Amazing soup that one craves after having but once... i tweaked upon first making for what i had on hand- switching Greek yogurt for the sour cream, water, soy sauce and extra cumin to compensate for lack of broth and cashew butter for peanut butter.  this soup was divine!  much appreciation for the recipe which i will add to regular rotation.

I have only tasted the soup without the lime/sourcream and I found it to be a bit bland. But maybe it will taste different once the toppings are on it. I am planning on substituting red peppers for the tomatoes. And i did not use fresh ginger which might be an issue, only had dried.
UPDATE when the toppings are added so is a wonderful flavor. I love this soup, only change, I would use less peanut butter.

This was fabulous!!  It smelled so yummy while cooking!  I did not have creamy peanut butter, so I used crunchy instead, and added it before I blended with the immersion blender.  It gave the soup a little bit of texture/crunch, which I LOVED.  I always miss texture in pureed soups, so I probably will deliberately use crunchy next time I make it.

This soup was GREAT!! I make soup for every family holiday dinner and everyone  (adults) loved this. The kids didn't like it ,probably because it was spicy. Because of other reviews, I left out the peanut butter completely. Otherwise I followed the rest of the recipe and it's definately going to be made again. The ginger,the lime,the cumin,the presentation,just great.I forgot to bring the fresh cilantro for the garnish, but it was still one of my favorites without it!

It was *ok.*  I've tasted other better soups (creamy sweet potato soup) as this one was bland without adding lots of extra spices and it really needed the peanut butter to be toned down.  My family ate it but it won't be a repeat recipe at our house.

I really liked it.  I added a few Tbsps plain yogurt and sour cream when I blended it, and then some peanut butter at the end.  It was filling and really good.  I used 4 small sweet potatoes.  Really really good.  Mild Indian quality to it.

This is THE BEST soup!! I didn't puree the sweet potatoes simply because I'm too lazy. My daughter said to hook her up to a "soup IV" because she loved it so much. Will make tHis recipe often for now on. SO GOOD!!

I am not a big soup person, but I LOVED this recipe. I thought coconut milk was more appropriate than sour cream...and I doubled or tripled most of the spices to our tastes. I also omitted the tomato because tomatoes in November are usually bleah. The photo with the swirl of coconut milk and cilantro is mine -- it's a beautiful soup! I used a VitaMix to puree it...so the texture was absolutely perfect. I also doubled the entire recipe so there would be enough to freeze....and had enough to share with a friend, as well. YUM!

A huge success as a first course for a small dinner party I hosted.  I made exactly as written, except I used about 1.5 T of peanut butter instead of 1/4 cup.  I will make again and again!

This soup was amazing - both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I upped the cumin and peppers as well as added some red curry paste as somebody else suggested. I also only used about 75% of the peanut butter called for. Delish!

I followed this recipe to a T both times I made it. The first time it turned out tasting wonderful-- and the texture was spot on. The second time I made it- my potatoes just weren't right and I ended up with a grainy soup. If you decide to cook your potatoes stove top only I recommend giving them a few more minutes to make sure they are really cooked before blending them.

Major impressive impact on guests for the same effort as any other day.  I still haven't figured out why peanut butter is the alchemical addition that makes it taste like restaurant fare.

I made this just as presented except for the grated lime zest in the sour cream.  It was exceptionally tasty.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I would have given it 4.9 stars if I could, subtracting just a tiny bit for the order of presentation of the ingredients.  The actual dish was very good, though.

I loved it up until I added the PB....I only added 1T but that was too much for my palate.  I will still eat it but next time I will omit the PB.  I added 2 sprinkles of curry powder.  Overall it its a very nice soup. xxoox.

Really yuummy warm and cheap! I had tasted a soup like this at a party and looked for a similar recipe online. This fit the bill and is SO good. This is one recipe I do not alter at all :)

It's really great, thanks.  From my CSA I seem to have an endless supply of sweet potatoes (North Carolina, it's kind of our thing), and this is one of my favorite ways to use them.

This was pretty good and very filling. I thought the ginger was a little overpowering. If I were to make this again I would reduce it to only 1 T. One thing I didn't like was that this soup didn't keep well. I tried reheating it a couple days later and it was more like mush instead of soup. I would probably only make this soup again if I was serving it to enough people to finish it in one sitting.

I thought this soup was delicious, but my husband was less than thrilled (he's not a big sweet potato fan...maybe I shouldn't have told him what it was!).

Let me say that I'm not a huge fan of soup but this one is delicious!  Next time I would add a 3rd large sweet potato as mine turned out a little thin with just two.  I also cut the peanut butter in half since I didn't want the peanut taste to overpower everything else.  Even my picky 11 year old loved this soup!

delicious. I wish I would have had the lime and cilantro, probably would have really made the flavors stand out, but this was absolutely delicious. I added a good deal more cumin and some curry powder and a pinch of nutmeg.

I've made this recipe MANY times.  I like a thicker soup, so I leave the skins on the sweet potatoes, use an extra sweet potato, and use chunky peanut butter (the full amount called for in the recipe).  The cilantro really adds that final touch.  It turns out great!

This was fantastic. My wife made it last night, I'm sure we'll see it again soon. Before topping it off, it tasted just like one of our favorite thai dishes in town. In future i think we'll try to mimic that dish by adding chicken and serving with a side of rice. Yum Yum.

This is a really good soup! I happened to have most of the ingredients on-hand so I decided to try it. I unfortunately didn't have the lime, sour cream and cilantro so I added some milk to make it a little creamy. I also added some frozen sweet corn and that was a great addition. I cannot wait to make it again-with all of the ingredients.

I wasn't sure about this at all. I usually change a bunch of stuff, but I made this one exactly and it was a winner! Didn't think the peanut butter was overpowering at all. You can smell it more than taste it. The tomato, cilantro and sour cream make the soup, so don't omit that step!

This is so delicious! As others recommended, I halved the amount of peanut butter, added a can of lite coconut milk and a teaspoon of red curry sauce. I used my food processor and made a big mess so will invest in an immersion blender. Thank you for this tasty recipe!

I'm rating this 5 starts mostly on the merits of pairing sweet potatoes and fresh ginger root.  I left out a few ingredients because I didn't have them - left out cilantro, peanut butter, lime and cumin, and left out the tomato garnish because I thought this was wrong for this soup.  Then I added an ingredient that turned out to be excellent - parsnips.   Also added some chopped baked ham because I had it in the fridge.  So what I made wasn't really this recipe after all, but many thanks to the submitter for the ginger root idea.

Very good basic recipe but it needs some additional ingredients.  I added 1/2 cup full fat coconut milk, 2-3 tsp of mild curry paste and 1 tsp of cumin and a little more red pepper flakes.  I used 2-3 tbl of peanut butter.  I used toffuti sour cream since I am lactose intolerant.  With these changes it was fabulous.  The cilantro and tomatoes adds a nice contrast.

Delicious! We spiced it up a bit extra because we're chile heads, but even my husband, a dedicated carnivore, chose a second bowl of this OVER the leftover meatloaf from the previous night.

I think I have a new favorite soup!  I didn’t have fresh cilantro or ginger so used dried.  I didn’t have a fresh lime so used bottled - both in the soup and to ‘flavor’ the sour cream.  I didn’t have Roma tomatoes so used some cherry tomatoes for the topping.  I doubled the recipe but more than doubled the spices, and added some curry per other suggestions.  This soup has a real kick to it so if you don’t like spicy this one won’t be for you.  My hubby and I do :-).

I've made this soup a few times now, I'm not a soup fan, but when I do crave a warm comforting soup, this is my go to!  I make it exactly as shown, except I cut the peanut butter amount in half now, as although it is definitely the secret ingredient and makes the soup, I found it a bit over powering.  Definitely a keeper and staple soup recipe!  It's also a perfect 1st course for a holiday dinner:)

Wow we really liked this!  I didn’t use sour cream but added half a cup fat free milk with a tablespoon of dried coconut flakes.  Also I use a little olive oil instead of butter and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Definitely a keeper.  Delicious!

This soup is fabulous! Perfect for Fall too! Not difficult at all and the smells are incredible. Has a Thai vibe going on with the peanut butter, ginger and lime! I’ll make this one again for sure!

Best when left to sit overnight before serving, to meld flavors together. Next time, I'll cut down the amount of peanut butter slightly (or try omitting it altogether), as we didn't care for the peanut taste in the soup.

Awesome! Did not bother with sour cream, lime zest or tomato and cilantro
Did not add red pepper flakes and reduced peanut butter to 2 Tablespoons
Put vegetables in processor instead of chopping

Outstanding recipe. I prepared it exactly as outlined, with one exception. I only had crunchy peanut butter on hand. It turned out to add a very interesting dynamic to the texture. I made it a second time, and used smooth peanut butter, but the family preferred the crunchy. A matter of taste. Great dish.

Very good soup.  Family loves it.  I usually add just a bit of nutmeg before serving.

I often make baked sweet potatoes the day prior, and make sure I have leftovers to make this soup.  The sweet potatoes are baked with olive oil, garlic and thyme, and bring a bit of extra flavor to the soup this way.

I made this soup and I tweaked it as I read other reviews regarding the amount of peanut butter. I used a rounded tablespoon and it was a good amount. I also did what another reviewer said and I microwaved the sweet potatoes and added the last 5 minutes of cooking time. I ate all the left overs! Very nice flavor and texture! Thank you!

I used less peanut butter than called for and next time would use even less, or maybe none and just garnish with peanuts.. Love the ginger and lime with sweet potato.

I followed the directions exactly aside from microwaving the sweet potatoes before adding them to the stock and it was fabulous!! It has a very rich creamy mouth feel and the addition of peanut butter takes it over the top with an immensely satisfying and craving inducing umami flavor without overpowering the delicate flavor of the sweet potatoes. It ticks all of my boxes for crave worthy flavor and super healthy vegetarian, fiber and protein filled main course.

Made this one several times. Works well for buffets. Received many compliments.  Fresh ingredients are key here, especially fresh ginger v paste. I also added a few handfuls of spinach leaves at the end and provided fresh garnishes including scallions, cilantro,  chopped tomatoes, etc. for folks to customize.  This recipe is also good for making ahead and freezes well for quick heat ups on busy work days.

I definitely liked the soup, and the family reviews have been decent. Though I added some modifications -   I sprinkled the sweet potatoes with lemon juice (didn't have limes) and let them sit for a bit before they were cooked to absorb the lemon juice. I also added more lemon than was called for in the latter stages (again in substitute of limes), and more crushed red peppers and cayenne, as it did not taste spicy at all. In fact, my aunt who hates spicy food found this not at all spicy, she felt it needed more! I wavered on the use of peanut butter - my mother and I felt that it might be better to just add crushed peanuts as a garnish (peanut butter didn't melt/absorb well afterwards) while my aunt liked the effect - so users can choose! Overall, I did like it though :)

My husband eats sweet potatoes a lot with dinner, so I thought I’d try something different. He ate it, but said I didn’t need to make it again. I tried a spoonful and it was okay, but just generally don’t enjoy soups so it was only  for him and my mother to eat.  The baby food texture wasn’t anyone’s favorite.  Not sure if I over blended or if it is supposed to be that way. We did skip the cilantro and tomato, and I reduced the peanut butter just a little.  After reading a review he tried a little cinnamon on it, but did not like that with the spice and other flavors. I’m sure I could adjust a few things, but I’ll probably just try something different next time.

I thought this was delicious...great flavors & very satisfying. I served it will a tossed green salad with quinoa, which made for a really yummy  lunch...very similar to something off of the "Panera" menu. I followed the recipe exactly as written; except I reduced the peanut butter by half, because I was concerned with the possibility of having a "peanut butter soup" incident, as one reviewer commented. I loved it! However, the husband disliked the soup texture....although, he ate a whole bowl. (So, I'm assuming it wasn't  all that bad) He did  say the flavor was really good. If making it in the future, I will ladle some out for him, prior to blending.

Not exciting, but a tablespoon of cinnamon certainly helped.  It's a very thick puree more than what I'd think of as a soup, but it has substance and lots of Vitamin A, great if you're limited to liquid diet for a time.

This recipe has all my favorite ingredients so I had to make it. The only thing I did different was steam the cut up sweet potatoes first then peeled them, and I added the chopped tomato and cilantro to the soup in the pot at the end. Also, used a potato masher instead of immersion blender. VVG, will make it again.

Fantastic, easy, healthy... I love this recipe. I'm a single career woman, so I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian recipes that don't require prep because meat always spoils if I get busy during the week. This just requires chopping the onion (and you can buy chopped onion at the store!) and sweet potato. I use an immersion blender (best purchase ever) and add the peanut butter to taste, probably not a full quarter cup, just a few spoonfuls. The sour cream is a great addition. No changes to the recipe, love this.

I thought this recipe was just okay. My boyfriend was unhappy eating it, and thought there was too much ginger.  I prefer my soups to have some more texture, so if I make it again I will definitely use less stock and blend the mixture less. I had to make a few substitutions given what I had in my kitchen and that may have been why I didn't really care for the recipe. I use ground instead of fresh ginger, lemon instead of lime, and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I omitted the cilantro completely because I think it tastes like soap.

EDIT: I am eating the soup leftovers, and it tastes so much better than when I first tried it! It really thickened up, and the flavors seem much more cohesive now.

yummy!! will definitely make again... maybe just keep tasting  when adding peanut butter bit by bit... this goes so well together I didn't have to change anything, but for some people peanut butter can be too much.  But it makes the soup creamier... just ENJOY!!!

Already purchased another lime and sweet potatoes to make it again this cold, windy March week.  My sweet potatoes were not that big so I chopped up some carrots and used up some mini-peppers  that I threw in with the onions and extra garlic.  The other change was using chunky peanut butter.  It reminded me of a groundnut stew I had in Sierra Leone years ago.

Delish !!! I made a couple of adjustments to suit our preferences ~ using homemade veg stock rather than the chicken stock ~ I added in a half cup of diced carrots and let them cook with the sweet potatoes until tender. We like things a bit "rustic" so, I simply ran a potato masher through the mixture after the vegs had cooked and the mixture reduced somewhat. I also added in about 3/4 cup of coconut milk ( which I tempered with the soup mix first ) to take the edge off the spices ( since I go heavy there, doubling the cumin and red pepper flakes ). The crown jewel was the peanut butter , lovely in this recipe ~ I used a tablespoon of chocolate peanut butter and a tsp of regular peanut butter , so it had a bit of a mole finish. Perfect ! Absolutely a winner and I am thankful that I stumbled upon this recipe earlier today ~ we have a small portion leftover that will be up-cycled into a pasta sauce tomorrow....

Very easy and very tasty! I added a 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder to it, and omitted the peanut butter, and it was great!

I used the red pepper flakes plus 1.5 T red curry paste and replaced the sour cream with Kefir. My husband liked it as much as I did.

This recipe needs alot of work. Its texture and flavor = baby food. There is hope but the spices need adjusted dramatically.

So sorry Sarbek but this is a big miss.

One of my all-time favorites in cold weather. I typically double the recipe so there's more of this around for days to come (or the freezer).

This was an amazing soup that was pretty easy to make! I added a 1/4 teaspoon of curry powder in addition to the other spices. The peanut butter I used was a natural creamy peanut butter that needed to be stirred before using- it was the perfect consistency for adding to a soup. I think that regular peanut butter may be too thick. The lime zest sour cream was also a great idea for a topping. I think I'll make that again for taco night! All in all, this was a fantastic recipe that my family loved. I will surely make it again!

Really terrific as is! However, I did add boiled shredded chicken breast, and I would consider cutting down the peanut butter slightly next time.

My family thought the soup was sensational. I used a bit less of the peanut butter and added a half cup of half n half for a creamier texture.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated..I used my blender to purify the ingredients however I found it have small pieces of lime and ginger in it..I used a fine strainer to get rid of them..next time I will use ground ginger instead of fresh ginger root and will omit the lime rind from the sour cream..it tastes good without the cilantro and tomato so try it first before you add them..

I added more cumin and some coconut milk (a can, accidentally) like another few reviewers did, also less peanut butter, maybe 1/8 cup. Since I added too much milk I let it simmer awhile to cook down. I also added a few more shakes of red pepper flakes and some cayenne to make it spicier. Very Thai inspired for sure. I think it would be tasty if it were made into a thicker sauce, added with chicken satay and rice or something...Maybe next time, I will make it again for sure.

So I made some big changes by not adding pinger and peanut butter but it's more my taste. The other change.... I added lime juice instead of zest to the sour cream and cilantro. I love the taste and bitterness of that dollop of sour cream in such a pleasantly mild but tasty soup. I also doubled the recipe... I'll be feeezing!!  :)

I LOVED this soup! It was so flavorful and made good use of sweet potato leftovers from Thanksgiving. The best part was that I had everything in my refrigerator or pantry!

Tried and true recipe. Can't even tell you how many times I've made this! I just add the lime juice into the soup at the end and top with a dollop of sour cream and chili flakes instead of mixing it together. Sooooo goood!

Wow, most interesting soup I ever made.  The ingrediant list was kinda crazy...not sure how they were all gonna go together....but real good.  There was not much sweet potato flavor left after all the strong ingredients...but that wasnt a bad thing...just saying.... good soup!!!

i just replaced the cilantro with green onions sliced into really thin stripes. I doubled the garlic and used himalayan salt to sprinkle while serving. Delicious!

I added the peanut butter gradually, starting with 1 tblsp, then added another tblsp or so. Some of the reviews mentioned it was heavy with pb taste; cutting back just gave it a subtle pb taste that I liked. I chose not to do the sour cream topping and additions. I did find it needed more salt; just had with a few Saltine crackers. Very good and healthy!

Not a fan of the sweetness but this is a good base recipe that I can tweak to my own liking.  The texture was velvety smooth which I really liked at least.  Microwaving the sweet potatoes beforehand is a must!

This turned out amazing. This is my new absolute fave. Doubled the garlic as I always do, didn't use peanut butter as I'm weird and only like peanut butter on my toast. And I was out of cilantro. But still Absolutely Awesome!!! Would be good with pumpkin instead of sweet potato too! Thank you thank you thank you!!!

We are dairy-free, so we skipped the sour cream. We replaced the peanut butter with almond butter and used black pepper in lieu of chili pepper flakes. Delicious! We also added rice, to make it a satisfying meal. Got several servings from one batch.

Delicious soup and easy to put together (the hardest part was chopping the yams).  I didn't find the soup spicy at all (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), particularly with the sour cream.  I'd double the chili flakes or maybe do as someone else suggested and use a teaspoon of red curry past instead if you want  it spicy.  Personally I'm pretty happy with the recipe as is - the peanut putter was a nice touch that gave the soup a good creaminess.

This soup definitely has a Thai flavor to it that makes it very unusual and tasty for a sweet potato soup.  I made a few changes.  First I reduced the peanut butter down to one large tbsp due of people complaining about how it over-powered the  other ingredients.  I also made this vegetarian style, substituting veggie broth for the chicken broth.  Other changes I made: I used yogurt instead of sour cream, a can of organic sweet potato puree instead of two sweet potatoes, coconut oil instead of butter, and then added spinach, soba noodles and a poached egg to it at the end -  making it a Thai-style Ramen noodle type of dish.  It was delicious and can easily be made 100% vegan without sacrificing taste. Next time, I'll try adding sliced mushrooms, diced red peppers,  spinach, and edamame.

I love the simplicity of this soup and the tremendous flavor. I took the suggestions of other cooks and microwaved the cubes first. This made for quick softening. I also added 1/4 cup of thick coconut milk I had on hand and a few extra dashes of red pepper flakes. I however only added a tablespoon of peanut butter as my husband is not a fan. Love it and will make it again and serve with pride!

Excellent!  Had a sweet potato in the fridge since thanksgiving, finally used it.  Made half the amount, used parsley instead of cilantro, no tomato.  Raw ginger is important, don't use powdered.  What was nice is I put in a small amount of finely diced raw carrot when serving.  (used the sourcream w/lime, very nice!)  The texture of the small carrot was a nice contrast.  Yum!  Thank you!

This soup is amazing! I didn't change a thing except to use dried cilantro which I already had on hand. Wait, scratch that, I had it about a half cup of half-and-half is well. All in all, I would definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe to use sweet potato. I added a can of coconut milk, a teaspoon of curry powder, vegetable broth instead of chicken. I only used 1/2 of peanut butter but added 2x the ginger. I made these modifications after making the recipe per directions (except peanut butter) because I felt it needed a bit more substance and flavor.

It was okay as written but I will add cayenne powder next time to add more spice. I also pureed it in NutriBullet !!  I used a couple of leftover baked sweet potatoes & it was a fantastic way to use up a can of coconut milk in cupboard !! It will be in my soup rotation !!

Delicious! I made it with 4 small sweet potatoes and microwaved them to save time, as another reviewer did.  I did about 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of coconut milk.  I omitted the peanut butter.  Next time, I will add more spice and serve with cheesy bread.  Wonderful fall flavor.

Loved this and so did the family! Although I took advice from other reviews and didn't add the cilantro or tomatoes as well as halved the peanut butter.  Super quick and easy to make. Will definitely make this one again!

I made it exactly per the recipe, and sorry guys, I didn't like it.  I thought that it was rather bland, and more importantly, the peanut butter just overpowered the soup.  I've made another highly rated recipe from AR, and I liked it much more.  The one thing that I did like was the lime zest with the sour cream.  That has potential for a lot of applications, and was super simple.

OMG.  I made this vegan! And it was amazing. Use vegetable broth and smart balance (for sautéing). Then at the end I used vegan sour cream and rotel tomatoes (drained) and the cilantro. My husband LOVED it. Thank you whoever is the soup genius!

I didn't have sour cream so I substituted plain yogurt and I mixed that into the soup. I read that someone who did not like the recipe used ground/powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger. That is not an okay substitute and that would account for a recipe fail. This one is fabulous.

The flavors in this soup are so well put together. I only had two small sweet potatoes so I added a butternut squash into the mix. The squash has a more bland favor so I doubled the spices. Also only used a 1/8 cup of peanut butter though, it really has a strong flavor. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I was fresh out of sour cream so I used Greek yogurt. The soup came out amazing I love it, my stepdad liked it, just waiting on my moms approval now. This dish also goes great with bread !

This is wonderful! The dollop of lime-infused cream is essential! I did use the suggested crème fraiche - and even added some extra zest directly to the soup. Measuring the potatoes as cups would have been helpful - I had small sweet potatoes from a neighbor's garden and didn't know if I really had enough. I did. Using the immersion blender allows you to use crunchy peanut butter or leave the soup as "lumpy" as you wish. I recently had dental surgery, and this is smooth enough to not have to chew, but thick enough to make me think I'm really eating something! Definitely going into my "soup rotation!"

Made this today and while I'm not a huge soup fan, this was really good. I microwaved the potatoes and added just a small pinch of "Meco" chipotle powder which gave it a low spicy/smokey heat. I just added this to my recipe box for futures. Thanks again.  I also wonder how it would be cold, like Gazpacho?

Wow, this is so delicious!  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned "fire roasted" tomatoes instead and actually blended those into the soup.  The lime sour cream was perfect to offset the heat from the ginger and red pepper flakes.

Thanks Sarbek for a great recipe.  I've made this three times.  I never actually measure anything and it always turns out wonderfully.  I use vegetable bouillon for the broth.  It is definitely best to go light on the peanut butter.  If you add too much though, you can add just a bit of coconut milk and it will cut back the peanut butter taste.  I always add lots of ginger and red pepper. If you freeze your ginger, it can be easily grated.  Make sure to use the shredder side or else it is very difficult to get the grater clean.

A delicious twist for sweet potato soup. The peanut butter gave it a protein packed nutty flavour. The lime juice that I used instead of zest worked well and gave it that refeshing twist! I definitely recommend trying this recipe if your looking for something out of the ordinary. Give it a try!

I used acorn squash instead of sweet potato as requested by my honey. Made it as per the recipe and it came out nice. I personally would cut the peanut butter in half but my honey really loved the soup.

Very good soup! I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ginger in powder and it came out great, also I used cayenne pepper, why not? This is a keeper and will cook it often this fall.

I hate rating when I make substitutions but here goes.  I basically made it as is except I didn't use sour cream and I only put a heaping tbsp of peanut butter.  I could not get the peanut butter to blend into the soup.  Maybe because it was natural?  But it stayed in chunks so every so often you'd just get a mouthful of PB.  I ended up adding a can of coconut milk because I just didn't like the flavor of it, which helped quite a bit but still not my favorite soup.

We made it vegan using veg broth and vegan sour cream. We doubled up on the cumin and the pepper flakes.  Oh, and we didn't have smooth peanut butter so we used crunchy with no ill effects.  Great recipe!

Taste was great, and I did not add peanut butter or lime. I halved it for a dinner for my husband and I (serving size says makes 8 servings) and there wasn't nearly enough. I served it with homemade bread, and next time, I will make the whole batch. I like to use leftover vegetable soups for curry bases.

I added a couple tsp of thai seasoning which seemed to bring the flavors together, but as much as I love peanut butter in soup this was a bit heavy handed.  If I made again I would only use half as much.

This soup is a 10!!!! Exactly what I was looking for. The only change was to add coconut milk and a little more red pepper (crushed, not flakes).I too microwaved the potatoes to speed things up. Thank you for a great recipe.

This soup was absolutely incredible. Let the soup cool before puree. I filled my blender less than half but the heat created pressure and blew the top off.

Wow, what a delicious soup!  My husband and I loved it!  It definitely has a Thai flavor.
I followed the directions mostly, but added a wee bit little less peanut butter and ginger for the first time, since they can be over powering flavors.  I also added 1/3 cup of light coconut milk at the end. 
Very nice blend of flavors. Will most definitely put this in my recipe box. Thanks!

This was so yummy!  I loved all the flavors that you could taste while eating.  Great on a chilly night.  I used a immersion hand blender and it worked wonderfully.  I will say I forgot to add the tomatoes on top at the end but it was still wonderful.  Hint, after adding the lime sour cream mixture, just swirl it in, do not mix it all together.  This way you get to taste that great flavor of it.

I also used the coconut milk that another reviewer recommended - and lemon juice instead of lime, since I didn't have limes.  This soup is wonderful!  I made a double batch, which my family made short work of - and just cooked up another double batch for lunches for the week.

Yum - it was a great change of pace from normal soups.  It reminded me of Ethiopian food.  I followed the recipe exactly with the following differences using homemade chicken stock and no cilantro

My husband liked this more than I did. I thought it was a little on the bland side. It was better after I added the sour cream, tomatoes, and cilantro, and better still after I added a little cayenne pepper.. Next time, I would double the spices and half the peanut butter.

Made this last night and it was delicious. I read the recipe wrong and did not zest the lime and instead mixed the mie juice in with the sour cream. It still tasted delicious. I did not even need to add salt, there were so many flavors already.

This is my first time making a sweet potato soup and this is a great recipe! Based on personal preferences, I cut the cumin and ginger in half, but followed the rest of the recipe.

Yum yum yummy! The perfect way to use my sweet potatoes that were on the verge of turning bad. I did however make a few changes. I used half of the requested chicken broth and the other half of water. This helps to lower the sodium content and the flavour is just as amazing since the real dominant taste is the ginger and peanut butter. As well, I substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt, again being health conscious. I omitted the cilantro and tomatoes since I felt they were unnecessary, but for presentation points, I would use them in the future. This is a little time consuming with the chopping, but well worth it.

Awesome tasting soup! The sauce was great. Make sure you make it. I used yogurt instead of sour cream to cut on the fat. Also didn't have tomatoes or cilantro on hand.

I never review recipes, however, this was fabulous! I doubled the red pepper flakes because my family loves spice, used a large white onion, added 1/2 a cup coconut milk per other reviewers suggestions, and reduced the peanut butter to 2 tablespoons. The peanut butter was not over powering in my opinion; in fact, I may add a little more next time. Wonderful flavor!! Leftovers would be delicious over white rice and grilled chicken.

I'm making this recipe for the second time today.  Even my teenagers liked it.  I added some lentils like one of the other recipes for sweet potato soup called for.  Once it's pureed, nobody could tell and it added protein. I will make this often when I have an excess of sweet potatoes

I make this about once a week but substitute out vegetable broth for the chicken (tomkeepnit kosher) and keep the peanuts butter to a minimum. Adding in chunky peanut butter gives you some nice little surprises when eating too.

We thoroughly enjoyed this variation on sweet potato soup. I made it according to the recipe, except I used just a rounded tablespoon of the peanut butter.  It was delicious and the flavours were perfectly balanced.  Definitely adding this one to my winter rotation.

Yummy! Used only a Tbsp of peanut butter and still loved it.  Didn't bother with the sour cream to keep it healthy and used low sodium chicken broth.  Fried onions and garlic in olive oil.  Didn't add any salt either.

I take back everything I said in my earlier review. Initially, the recipe came out a bit mushy. I decided to reserve about 2 cups of the mixture in my dutch oven and then add that to the pureed mixture. The texture was amazing. 

I took the advice of other reviewers and used slightly less peanut butter. I didn't even find it needed any sour cream mixture. I originally intended to eat this over 2 days. It lasted a matter of hours. May as well have been dessert. 

I skipped out on the red pepper flakes as I am not a spicy fan.

I have placed this recipe in my collection and can't wait to make it again. Maybe...tomorrow?

This was rich in flavor and hit the savory spot. It is hilarious when raters say I love this recipe, then continue to put all the changes they made. I only rate the recipe based on actual ingredients. In saying that, I used a purple onion (as it did not mention type). I would agree with the other ratings to use half the amount of peanut butter.

This soup was delicious!  It would not have been as good without the lime-sour-cream which put it over the top.  Based on the previous reviews I was afraid of the peanut butter so I only used half of the specified amount. But other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I keep hearing about how good sweet potatoes are for you so I am glad for another great way to eat them.

I used my sweet potatos from the garden and boy was this tasty.  The more I ate the better it got even though I accidently poured too much red pepper in it and it made me sweat.  I did use unflavored greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Absolutely fabulous!  I felt like I was eating at a bistro.

Have to say this a very good base recipe. I modified like other users did...used only 1 1/2 tsp of ginger (I had chopped ginger in a jar), crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy, and also added a touch of cinnamon and about a 1/2 tsp of agave nectar to added a little more sweetness. Overall, a great recipe...thank you for sharing!
