Loved it! So easy and really flavorful. I used honey mustard. My pork chops must have been thinner than other reviewers because 20 minutes was just right. The chops were just done and really tender. My husband claimed it was one of the best meals I have ever made. I will definitely be making this again, and soon.

This was delicious!  I made with pork loin chops, not butterflied.  I added about 10 minutes to the cook time.  Also, I used the cheddar cheese french fried onions.  My four year old twins loved it.  It's so easy, I will definitely made again!

I had my doubts about this recipe, and I used the yellow mustard but also added some honey to cut the taste of the 'straight up' French's.  When it was nearly done I nearly died because it looked like pork chops in yellow mustard.  No different.  I knew that my husband would take one bite and know that it was yellow mustard on pork.  To my surprise, he liked it and said he couldn't quite figure out what the taste was.  I thought he was crazy because it seemed obvious to me.  He really liked these, I was not quite as impressed.

The picture is not the correct picture for this recipe. Interesting idea, not too impressed. Might try again with different mustards though.

This was a great and to the point recipe. I just added onions, green bell peppers, salt and black ground pepper to flavor. It tasted great with rice. My boyfriend said it was "good" and he didn't even know that it was mustard! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I used Goulden's Honey Musturd, just spreading it on top of each chop. (I used boneless pork chops.)  The onions were a nice touch.  Very flavorful.  I had to bake for 25 minutes.  Thanks!

This was ok, I fix pork chops a lot so this is good to have as something different on them. I also cooked longer.

This was delicious and decadent.  I mixed dijon mustard with the regular mustard and slathered the pork chops with the mixture.  I processed the french fried onions to fine crumbs and heaped them onto the top of the chops.  I baked them until done and I couldn't believe how good they were.  A new favorite!

I made this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand and it looked easy.  I was really surprised when it was so good!  I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't use the amount of mustard called for, I just liberally brushed dijon mustard on the top.  I used dijon because that's our favorite and less mustard was right for us because we loved it.    I sprinkled the top with the onions rather than measured, but mine could have used more, so Amelia, you were right.   Next time (and there will be a next time) I'm going to crush the onions to see if that's better, but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Not a fan of yellow mustard, so I used honey-mustard.  I kind of liked the flavour, but my husband wasn't thrilled.  Certainly was easy to make!

Made these exactly as directed.  They were very good and very easy. I gave the recipe 4 stars because it was a bit too "mustard-y"for my taste.  Will take other reviewers suggestion to cut the mustard with honey or try a different mustard next time.  The crunchy onion topping was a hit and mysteriously disappeared from the leftovers while stored in the fridge overnight! I have similar recipe where the chops are coated with breadcrumbs after being covered with the mustard, then baked.  It is very good, too.

Very Very Good. Similar to other reviewers, I was hesitant about how this would taste.. I mean "Mustard on Pork chops" - not the first thing I would think to cook together. But boy was this good. My family loved it. I used a mixture of honey mustard and french's mustard. I also seasoned my porkchops w/ season salt, black pepper, and onion powder before adding the mustard.

This is a keeper!... I was worried that they'd be bland with a lack of ingredients so I added one key ingredient!.. First I butterflied then salt and peppered.  Next I drenched them in the mustard sauce, which I blended 1T Dijon, and 3T real MAPLE SYRUP to the regular mustard.  I made sure to get some inside the chop.  Covered with cheesy french fried onions and baked about 30 minutes covered for my thick chops then uncovered to brown onions for about 6 minutes more!  Just lift them out of the pork fat in bottom of dish and onions on top stayed crispy!  Hubby and picky eater liked them!..Thanks!

I wish I would have thought to take a pic - they were beautiful! I used both Dijon Mustard( on bottom ) and yellow mustard ( on top ). I covered, but uncovered for about 15 minutes to get onions crunchy. My chops were super huge so they took some time to cook. Very tasty!

I'll probably never make this for company, but it is definitely a new favorite in my kitchen!   I tried a bite of the pork alone and it tasted too strong of mustard, but when I added the generous portion of sauteed mushrooms and onion I'd chosen to replace the fried onions--delicious!  It all came together as a simple and very tasty dish.  I butterflied the meat and the 20 minute cook time was perfect.

OK not the worst recipe that I have tried from this site, (See Make-Believe Middle Eastern Chicken) but it is close.  My kids SLATHERED ketchup all over their servings.  There is potential in this recipe but I'm not going to waste any more pork chops trying to fulfill it's possibilities.  OH and cooking time is WAY off. Sorry...

Will likely make again.  It's not healthy, but it's good.  I tweaked it - I put some ~ 2 tsps garlic powder, brown sugar (? 1/4 packed) and a shake of Worcestershire sauce into the mustard (sorry just estimating amounts).

The cooking time worked for me -- my chops were boneless and normal thickness, ie not thin/thick.

The sauteed spinach & mushrooms with peppers I prepared were good with it too.

Wanted to try something new and this was perfect. I did make a few changes though, I chopped the pork and onion up and added onion with season all, was perfect. I made little tacos out of them with flour tortillias. I will make this many more times to come!!!

The canned French onions make it way too salty - otherwise it was fine.

My husband said they were "ok" but a little odd.  I used regular yellow mustard but he asked if it was mayo.  Many seem to love the recipe but I don't think I'll make it again.

Great recipe, and VERY quick and easy. Actually I used venison butterfly chops instead of pork, and added honey and hot sauce to the mustard mix. Everyone in the family loved it.

Quick and easy.  Do cook in oven for at least 45 minutes unless you use the thinly cut chops.  Very tasty and something different to bring to the table.

I don't care for a strong taste of mustard. As I made these, I thought the mustard would be overwhelming. When they came out of the oven, they looked, well, bright. Not the way I want my food to appear....looks can be deceiving! These were delicious. No alterations, just what the recipe called for!!!

We made this recipe last night, and it was really good.  We added peach jelly to it to give it a sweet taste.  It must have worked because it wa all eaten.

This was very good, the onions gave it a great extra flavor.  It did take longer to cook the first time then what was stated, but now I just turn the heat up and it cooks perfect.  My husband cant get enough of it.  Will make again and again!!

I'd never thought to do this before.  My fiance actually wanted to grill our chops, but they still turned out great!  I just threw them in the oven the last few minutes to crisp up the onions, and wah-lah!  Will definitely have this again.

This was great! Way better than you would expect.  My son doesn't even like mustard and he loved these pork chops.  (Didn't tell him that it was mustard.)  Even great on pork roast.

After searching for a quick, refreshing recipe for pork, I found this and my family loved it.

Baking time takes 30-35 min, and instead of just yellow mustard, I used 1/2 yellow and 1/2 gourmet honey mustard.  I added a bit of apple juice to the bottom to keep everything moist.  A great winner for something different.  No one knew it was mustard!

Tasted great, but I made it a bit differently ;o). Lightly salt and pepper both sides of chops, brown on both sides and reduce heat. Mix together 2.5 tbsp plain mustard, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 c water, pour over chops and simmer about 20 minutes. Didn't bother baking since I had no onions but will definately try that next time as I'm sure it will only add to the flavor :o) Thanks for sharing!

My mustard was a honey, Dijon and garlic.  20 min might be too much cooking time as the chops were tough.  Husband loves garlic and I love the onions.  If I make this again, I will season the chops before  the mustard and shorten the cook time.

Family loved this but did make a few additions. Seasoned chops with Tony C's and mixed mustard with some Olive Garden Italian dressing. It's a keeper!

This is the first time I have rated a recipe.  Loved it!!  My husband was thrilled with it too. Made a few changes based on other comments.  Used half yellow mustard and half stone ground mustard with 2 tbls of honey.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

The recipe was good.  A different flavor to the normal Shake and Bake recipe that we always use.  We had spring salad with balsamic vinegar on the side. Quick and Easy.  Good Dinner.

This was so easy and my husband and I really liked it.  I cut up a 2 lb boneless pork loin and used the plain old yellow mustard.  I paired it with au gratin potatoes and candied carrots.  So easy!  I will definitely make this again.
