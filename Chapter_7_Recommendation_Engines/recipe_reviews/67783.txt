I was skeptical, because 1/2 an hour in the oven didnt seem like enough time to cook everything, but it sounded good, and the other reviewers convinced me.  It wasn't enough!  After an hour (hour and a half?), we gave up.  The bottom layer was soft, and cooked, the top was hard and raw...along with all the onions.

If you attempt this, be sure to cook everything thoroughly, then put it in the oven to heat through.  But I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

I absoulutely loved this! I brought it to a vegetarian lunch and everyone raved about it. I used honey in place of the brown sugar and incorporated it into the tomato mixture as opposed to the bread crumbs. I used cottage cheese in place of the heavy cream, and made 1 1/2 recipes of the cashew sauce. Topped with freshley grated parmigiano reggiano cheese during the last 10 minutes, and let brown. Excellent.

Delicious!  I just made it and my family loved it. I didn't have soy milk or heavy cream so I twisted the recipe a little putting ricotta cheese and cottage cheese instead and also didn't have cashews so I just added peanuts.  in addition,  I made the mistake of pouring the cheese mix before the breadcrumb mixture, so I added another layer of the cheese mix....very tasty.. Baked it for 45 mins instead.  I recommend it!

We hosted a dinner with this recipe for our vegetarian guests from India - we all loved it.
Don't miss the part where you can substitute the paparika!  The saffron was pricey.

i baked the eggplant for about 10minutes before hand, and even the 30 minutes in the oven was not enough, i added an additional 10-15. The mixture between the eggplant was a bit mushy (did not use the heavy cream since I am lactose intolerant), but it did taste pretty good despite expecting a different, more crunchy consistency....the olives add a nice kick.

We made this with the extra chopped cashews one reviewer recommended, and because another reviewer felt it took longer to cook, I gave it just two minutes in the micro to help it along after the half your baking time.  I thought it was wonderful, and if it is a vegetarian dish, non-vegetarians are missing a great dish!

This came out mushy and all-around not very good. I did make a few modifications to use what I had - used Italian bread crumbs instead of wheat, green bell pepper instead of red, omitted the olives, and cow's milk instead of soy. I also took another reviewers recommendation and precooked all of the veggies before arranging them in the dish. It was more work than it's worth and we threw the left-overs away b/c neither of us could imagine eating it again.

Edible, but a very strange combination of flavors that didn't blend and turned out very bland.

I brought this recipe to a potlock party.  I added chopped cashews in the mixture and on top. It was a great addition.  Everyone loved it, even the non-vegetarians.
