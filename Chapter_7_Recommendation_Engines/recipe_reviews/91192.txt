Hi! Recipe creator/contributor here.  Thanks for trying the onion soup and for all the thoughtful reviews.  Just a couple of comments I thought might be helpful.  
The 1 teaspoon of salt in the beginning of the recipe cannot be omitted as it is necessary for the proper caramelization of the onions.  However, at the conclusion of the simmering process, please be sure to taste the soup before deciding to add any more salt (or pepper).  
Also, the addition of balsamic vinegar at the end is very important--not only for taste--but also because there's a chemical in red onions that tends to turn the soup gray and cloudy, and the balsamic vinegar corrects that.  
Lastly, while my broiler does take 4-5 minutes to melt the cheese properly, that's probably because I place the baking sheet on a lower rack.  Yours may take less time.  
Well, thanks again for all your kind comments... and, enjoy!

ONE MORE TIME... Have made this again and, again, wasn't disappointed. THIS IS THE BEST, without exception!

Anyone looking for the best Onion Soup Recipe on the Planet?  You found it!

This was the most incredible onion soup recipe we have ever tried. We followed the recipe exactly. .Make sure you cook the onions as suggested to almost a carmelized soft, syrupy, consistency.  You may not need to adjust the salt in the end; the combination of beef and chicken broth and the Worcestershire and balsamic vinegar may be salty enough for many.

The bottom line to this review, is if you want to really impress your family and friends with a onion soup recipe that is better than any restaurant recipe we have ever tried, USE THIS ONE! You will not be disappointed.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.

One recommendation: I use croutons rather than sliced French bread. It is much easier than cutting through a thick piece of cheese-covered bread. Guests and family say they like that: it adds to the enjoyment and ease of eating without losing any visual appeal.

This french onion soup has great depth of flavors!!! I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I used seasoned croutons instead of the bread & I omitted the mozzarella cheese as I didn't have any. I did miss the stringiness of the mozzarella ...gruyere has a wonderful flavor but it tends to just clump up. I did decrease the chicken broth some & used more beef (I used low sodium broths) & I aded a tsp. of beef base which really helped kick up the beefy flavor. This was a fairly hearty french onion soup, I think next time I might add more broth to thin it out some. The wine I used was a shiraz. A glass of the shiraz & a fresh salad was all the accompaniments it needed...thanks so much for a wonderful soup!

This is really good soup! I made it per the directions but I don't eat beef, so used an equal mix of chicken and vege-table stocks.
This soup tastes a lot like what you might order at a nicer restaurant. I do question the use of mozzerella and asiago cheeses - two Italian cheeses - in something that is so decidedly French. I personally was not a fan of the resulting taste and next time I will combine parts of this and my recipe, which calls for the use of Gruyere or true Emmental swiss (no substitutions). If desired, throw into the soup the rind of one hard French or Swiss-made cheese of your choice, doing so after removing kettle from flame to rest (about ten minutes). I also use sherry wine, not balsamic vinegar, because my grandmother always used this flavor in soups and casseroles. The sherry imparts a subtle sweet-smokey flavor that is a nice counterpoint to the Gruyere's mild tanginess. Remove cheese rind, and ladle the soup into bowls. Top with a 1/2 in. slice of dense, day-old, crusty french baguette that has been lightly toasted beforehand. Top with Gruyere swiss or Emmental and continue with recipe, broiling as directed. I found just 3 minutes in the broiler was enough. Keep an eye out for over cooking - there is nothing worse than the taste and smell of burnt cheese.

Excellent soup.  I didn't read through the recipe first so I had to make 2 modifications. I had to use dried parsley and thyme.  I used 1/2 tsp. parsley and 1/4 tsp. thyme and  I only had enough swiss for one piece on top.  Even with the modifications, we still rate this a 5.  It has a deep full bodied flavor.  Can't wait to try it again, but I will make sure I have the  right amount of cheese and the fresh herbs.

I'm going to give it 5 stars even though it didn't quite turn out for me. I tried to double this recipe and my advice is...DON'T! It never reached the fabled gooey, almost carmelized state of which so many people spoke. I stood over the pot stirring for not 1/2 hour, but 2 hours hoping against hope it would all work out in the end. While it smelled great and the onion became soft, it never carmelized. Plus, my hair smelled like onion for two days from standing over onion steam for so long... While it was very very good I must only imagine how much better it would have been had it attained the gooey state. So, I'm going to try this again-without doubling it. I used the recommended cheese...don't substitute on the Asiago. MMMM GOOD!

This recipe is a close spin on the 1999 cooksillustrated.com / America's Test Kitchen French Onion Soup Gratinee recipe, and could use a little less butter (about half) and less red wine. (For a more subtle and sophisticated version, replace the red wine with 1/4 c. sherry.) The sweet  onions make the soup a little too sweet - better to stick solely with about 4 lbs. red or yellow onions.  ATK omits the Worcestershire and the paprika as well. Also, better to let the dish rest a few minutes out of the broiler - it's too hot to serve immediately.

This was excellent—as good as any restaurant version.  However, it is misleading to think onions caramelize in 35 minutes.  I think it takes about an hour to get great sweet caramelized onions. There are a couple of tips that I think help:  After the onions have started cooking for about 10 minutes, add the required salt but also add SUGAR to help with the caramelizing process (about 1 – 2 tsp). Continue letting the onions cook, only stirring OCCASIONALLY.  If you are constantly stirring the onions, they won’t brown.  I usually set my timer for every 5 minutes, stir, and then reset for another 5 minutes.  When the onions start sticking to the pan, let them stick and brown, but then stir them before they burn.  

Once the onions were done, I followed everything per the recipe and it came out delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this soup last night and HOLY WOW!  It was fantastic!  This is my second attempt at French Onion and I think my search is over.  Even better than Panera and Atlanta Bread!  Thanks so much!

I found this recipe here about a year ago and have been making it often since then.  It is without question the best French onion soup we have ever tasted!  I follow the recipe exactly as written here and have not had any problems.  But I must comment that I have often seen recipes here that have been negatively reviewed by people who clearly did not follow the recipe and then got a bad result, as is the case with "Suzie."  The fault is not with the recipe, but with the cook.  It's a shame that such reviews are given the same consideration on this forum as all the others.  Again, my family found this recipe to be extraordinary--delicious and easy to prepare.  We love it!

Great recipe - even when I skipped the cheese & bread topping. Yes, I love the cheesy lid too, but I didn't have the ingredients for that part so I just did the soup.
A few changes ... I used regular yellow onions and dried parsley, swapped the quantities of beef & chicken broth, basically to work with what I had on hand. Despite these changes, it turned out great! 

Tip, after browning the onions, add the wine & allow it to reduce by 1/2 before adding the broth. This infuses the onions with a lovely sweet ,mellow winey-flavour. Delicious. I will defiantly make this one again ... and again ... and again!

I made this exactly as specified by Jersey Tomato in her review of the recipe, and it was good--but I've had better.  I prefer slowly roasting beef bones and then using them and lots of water to slowly reduce for a day to make a rich beef broth and use that significantly reduced, rich broth as a base.   I found the soup's color to be slightly off from all the red onions and chicken broth, and it wasn't rich enough.  I would say that this soup is about the quality of soups found at better chain restaurants.  I had never tried onion soup with Asiago cheese before, and I am hooked on that now--very good choice.

SOOO good! I've tried about six different recipes for French Onion Soup, and I was always seriously disappointed until this recipe. It's not too salty, the wine adds a nice flavor without being overpowering, and the beef with chicken broth was a nice combo. 

HOWEVER, I did a few things a tad differently, just because I worked with what I had lying around.

1. I used ALL yellow onions (It was all I had!), so I threw in 1/2 tsp of sugar with the salt while I cooked the onions. 

2. I also had only 40oz of beef stock (a big box and one can) and no chicken broth, so I used all the beef stock plus 22oz water (just to make sure i had the correct amount of liquid) and I threw in a chicken bouillon cube.

3. I didn't have fresh herbs so i used dried (1tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp dried thyme, 1 bay leaf) plus added some herbs de provence (I didn't measure, just threw some in). 

4. I added only 1/2 tbls of balsamic vinegar (has to be GOOD kind! Balsamic vinegar is NOT something to be cheap with. It can totally ruin a great recipe!) and then remembered the poster's comment that the vinegar counteracts a chemical reaction caused by RED onions. Since I had no red onions, I didn't add the other 1/2 tbls. 



Other than that, everything was followed exactly, and this recipe is a KEEPER! :)

Very good! I tripled this recipe. I prefer my onion soup a little more chunky so I added a lot more onion to it. Otherwise made as written (aside from going wild with the cheese). Fabulous flavor! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly (other than using croutons instead of the French bread) and WOW, it was delicious!!!  The only thing I might do different next time is reduce the amount of wine to 1/4 cup or maybe just use a milder tasting wine.  I used a Merlot and the "wine taste" seemed just a bit overpowering.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!... This made exactly 4 soup crocks full, so my husband and I ate the other 2 for lunch the following day and I must say it was even better the second day!!  It was so good I'm thinking next time I might make the soup a day ahead of time and allow it to sit in the fridge overnight, then reheat it the following day and do the bread/cheese thing... Either way, YUM!!!!!  :)

This is the best French onion soup I have ever tasted.  I love french onion soup and order it often whenever we go out.  There is a restaurant by us that makes a phenomenal one and this one beats it.  It did take me a long time for the onions to carmelize but be patient. It does happen. This is key to the success of the soup.  You need to add the salt  at the beginning but I did not add additional salt at the end b/c I knew there was going be salt in the cheese.  It turned out perfectly.  I don't have oven proof crocks.  So I sliced the bread and toasted it with a slice of swiss. Once that was toasted for a bit I then added the grated asiago on top. Toasted (in the oven) for a bit more. Ladled the soup into bowls.  Added a pinch of asiago cheese and then toppped with the toasted cheese slices.  It worked out great.  I completely forgot about the paprkia though ! Didn't make an ounce of difference.  Will absolutely be making this over and over again.  This is a great soup for a cold winter day. I would also suggest making large batches of this when you need to feed alot of people.  It's very satisfying and filling.  Comfort food at it's finest ! ~Changes to recipe~ I used low sodium beef broth and low sodium chicken broth~ Simply for health reasons. Thanks Again !!!

Fantastic. Tip:  dried thyme, parsley and a bay leaf fit perfectly in to a tea bag.  take the tea out and refill with my herbs.  :)  Works great!

AWESOME! I followed the recipe as written, but used white wine, and garlic croutons instead of bread. 4 onions made enough for 3 large soup bowls. It took prob 40 min for the onions to carmelize. I did everything in a huge frying pan, then broiled the bowls of soup/croutons/cheese on the top rack of the oven for 2.5 min.

I can tell the flavor would be wonderful. HOWEVER, the only pot I had on hand was non-stick. Onions will not caramelize in a non-stick pot. Next time, I'll be certain to have a pot without teflon.

Excellent! Even tasted delicious when made with vegetable broth and no-chicken stock (I was worried). Used dried herbs because that is what I had on hand and made my own worcestershire sauce because I was out: equal parts soy sauce and white vinegar with a dash of hot sauce). At the end, I sliced french bread and broiled both sides until lightly browned and then topped with shredded Swiss cheese and fresh parmesan and broiled again until cheese was bubbly. Placed toasted bread over bowls of amazing soup! Fanstastic recipe - Thank you!!

awesome!!!!  thanks.  Used croutons, too...it's easier! For those of you who had trouble caramelizing onions on the stove top...you can do it in the crock pot.  Use one pound of onions and two tablespoons of butter per quart in your crock pot.  (So a six quart crock pot can caramelize six pounds of onions with 12 tablespoons of butter)  Pile onions into crock pot, add butter to the top, stir after a few hours and leave on low overnight.  http://thepioneerwoman.com/tasty-kitchen/recipes/canning/caramelized-crock-pot-onions/)

This is the recipe that made me sign up for this site. I saw the picture and felt I had to make it.

Now, let me say, the experience of eating this was somewhat mindblowing for me. On one hand, it's delicious food. On the other hand, I felt like I ceased to exist as I ate it. That's how good it is. It really takes food the next level. Follow the recipe exactly and you'll end up with the potential for an enlightening lesson in what good food can do for you!

A note: I recommend going to the full 35 minutes recommended for caramelizing. I thought the onions looked syrupy and I think I jumped the gun at 25-30 minutes of cooking when I poured in the broth. So, go the full 35. This recipe is a work of art.

Thanks so much for this fine recipe! My wife and I made it one rainy day and we jst loved it! Be sure to double the batch and freeze the remainder because it really freezes well. At the same time, unless you intend to cook the whole batch in the bathtub, don't increase the serving size to more than double cause' it's a lot of onions! MAKE THIS!

I've made this 5 or 6 times this fall/winter.  I usually make a double/triple batch so we can freeze half of it.  I also use some of the tips and ingredients from the recipe "Rich and Simple French Onion Soup" so I guess I make a combo.  Delicious!  I cook the onions for at least 2 hours though, otherwise they are not carmelized enough for our liking.  I also use more yellow onions, fewer red, and more beef broth, just some chicken broth.  I do add a little sherry as the other recipe calls for and even my husband, who is not a fan of sherry, loves the soup and doesn't want a thing changed.  Little does he know that I pretty much make it differently each time since I can't remember all of the little things that I change... but he says it is one of the best things I make.

Delicious!  It takes time to make this soup but definatley worth it!! We followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great. Tip when using the broiler = keep your oven door open slightly, this way you can watch the cheese melt properly and it wont burn. I find closing the door tends to burn a lot of food when broiling, this trick will stop that :)

Magnifique! This is the only recipe I will ever use for french onion soup. Please follow the directions! The key is caramelizing the onions and adding your balsamic right before serving (I add a little extra because I love it). It's easy to sub in spanish onions or even a couple yellow onions in a pinch. I use either mozzarella or gruyere, whatever's handy. I served this today with a thrown together nicoise salad with a honey balsamic dressing, and french bread with honey butter. TRIFECTA of flavor, my friends. TRIFECTA.

This was delicious.  I made is exactly as written, served it with an iceberg wedge with bleu cheese dressing, chopped toasted walnuts and bacon crumbles.  It made 4 very generous servings.  I used my mandoline slicer (made by OXO) for the thinly sliced onions, it worked perfectly.  With the mandoline making such quick work of slicing the onions, it was actually quite easy to prepare.  It does take a bit of time to caramelize the onions, but since it is the most important step, take your time!

I had never made French Onion Soup before, and this recipe was very easy to follow. It also turned out delicious. DH was very skeptical (not an onion fan), and I was nervous as I went along, but it all came together really well. TIP: Don't skip the toasting step. I thought it seemed unnecessary and time consuming, but it helps your bread not just soak up soup and sink. If your bread sinks (like mine did), your cheese doesn't have something nice to brown on top of. EDIT: I've made this a few more times now, and it's still amazing!!

I was in France a few weeks ago and while I was there I had French onion soup.  This Recipe has almost Exactly the same flavor... Fabulous... The only changes I made was 1 (48 fluid ounce) can BEEF BROTH and 1 (14 ounce) CHICKEN BROTH. Traditionally french onion soups is made with a beef base and is fairly heavy.  I also added mozzarella cheese, asiago, and the swiss.. Fantastic Recipe!  Defiantly a keeper!

Excellent and delicious! I have extremely little experience cooking and followed the recipe as written. Due to kosher restrictions, I used beef and chicken flavored bullion cubes dissolved into the appropriate amount of water instead of actual chicken and beef stock. This allowed me to use cheese for the final steps, which I think was much more critical to the final outcome. I made this for my wife on her birthday, and she absolutely loved it, and keeps asking for it!

This soup is really good, but I used half chicken broth & half beef broth.  I also only used shredded Gruyere cheese & I took the thyme leaves off the stem & left the leaves in the soup.  I did not add the parsley & paprika, but they were not missed.  Next time I may only use beef broth.  I used low sodium broth & would recommend using full sodium broth.  For the wine, I used a not too sweet port which gives the soup an interesting dimension, but may try a drier wine next time.  As written, I don't think I would like the soup, but it's easy to adjust to your own tastes.

Fantastic!  I made this tonight.  I was determined to follow the recipe exactly because of the rave reviews and number of saves.  Unfortunately I was out of Thyme of all things.  I used Tarragon instead..not the best choice but it still came out fantastic.  I'll make this again and again.   Note:  This soup takes 10 minutes to cool enough to be eaten without getting second degree burns.

This recipe is very, very similiar to my own version.  I add garlic to the onions while onions are cooking, I use beef and chicken stock from the carton instead of canned, omit the vinegar and add my secret ingredient --- a cup of coffee!!!

This was FANTASTIC.  I had French Onion Soup at a restaurant not long ago and thought that I had never tried making it.  So this is the recipe I used.  VERY good.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I don't eat bread.  So I ate it without.  This is one of those recipes that is easy & delicious and...will be used again!

I love French onion soup!  This was really good, but I could taste the wine a bit more than I would have liked.  I don't find red wine to stand out when I use it in other recipes, but I'm not a big red wine drinker so I will either use a bit less or use a white wine instead when I make this next.  And I will make it again!

This IS a great soup recipe. The only thing I would change the next time is to use less chicken stock and more beef stock or beef consume. I've never used beef base as another reviewer mentioned, i might ty that as well. It was very good as is but just not beefy enough for our tastes.

This is the best French Onion Soup I have ever made or tasted.  It's better than the restaurants in my opinion.  
I get together with my 3 best friends for coffee once a month and made this for our get together shortly after Christmas.  

They also said it was the best French Onion Soup they have ever tasted.

The balsamic vinegar is a weird ingredient but it makes the broth clear.  I was doubtful but amazed.

Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will surely be making it again.

This soup was awesome!  Hubby thought it was great.  Was a little too salty for me.  Probably will use low sodium broth (either chicken or beef) next time. Only had swiss (Baby Swiss) on hand and just the dried herbs. Got a little carried away with the balsalmic vinegar. Still was wonderful. Didn't have red wine on hand so I threw in a little white wine. If you get the bread nice and brown, the edges remain crunchy. Will be making this often. Best French Onion Soup we have ever had!  Thanks!

Excellent!  I think next time I will try a different type of red wine (I used cab) I also used "Texas Toast w/cheese" in place of the French Bread toasted because I had it on hand and didnt want to purchase a loaf of french bread that would go to waste.My opinion is that 30 minutes cooking the onions in the first place is too long...

I never thought I'd like this recipe -- chicken broth, in a french onion soup recipe!? However, it turned out better than most other recipes I've tried and you can't even see or taste that it's mostly chicken broth. (I do think I switched them around though and used mostly beef and some chicken). I used Very Dry Sherry instead of red wine, because I think it tastes phenomenal in FO soup. Definitely a keeper.

My hubby loves french onion soup and has been wanting me to try it at home for 4 years.  I finally got the oven safe crocks and last night printed out this recipe to try.  WOW I don't think I will try another recipe!  I was so excited because I had everything on hand.  I did only use 3 onions instead of 4 - which I felt was fine.  Also used Italian style croutons instead of bread slices, its what I had but I think we like it better with croutons anyway because its easier to eat.  The only wine I had was Marsala, so fearing it might make the soup too sweet I only used 1/3 cup instead of the 1/2 called for and it was fine - to compensate I added a little water and a bit more worchestshire.  Also did not have fresh herbs, so I used about 1 Tbsp. dried parsley and approx. 1 tsp. dried thyme and omitted the bay leaf.  Used swiss cheese for the slices and for the shredded I used an Italian blend which had Asagio, fontina, mozzarella, etc.  Broiling on the middle rack for just over 4 minutes was perfect....the cheese had crusted and was nicely browned - I feared I had burnt it but I think I pulled it out just in time!  A bowl of this and a salad was enough for us for dinner, and I have leftover soup to freeze.  I plan on trying this recipe on company too.  Thanks so much to the submitter for your 30 years of perfecting this recipe!

I hate to be the sole naysayer here, but this soup was just bad. My whole family threw their noses up at it, and this is a family that could live on French Onion soup. This recipe is very similar to how I make my own, with the exception of the red onion (I use only vidalias), the vinegar and the worstershire. The flavor was just way, way, way too salty with an acidic taste. I also normally use beef and chicken stock, so I am sure the broth, along with the worstershire, contributed to the salty taste. I will stick to my own recipe, which is raved about from now on.

After reading all the fantastic reviews I decided this was definitely a recipe to try.  Unfortunately it didn't turn out for me at all. For whatever reason mine reeked of wine and tasted nothing like any french onion soup I've ever had. I was quite disappointed.

Superb.  I have made this recipe multiple times and every time it has received rave reviews.  I personally add a bit less onion, but that is my personal taste.  The first time I made it I used the full complement and still got plenty of compliments.  Great recipe!

This is the closest recipe I have found for that awesome French Onion Soup. Maybe the wine I am using is not complimenting the soup like it should, but this was really good and my favorite thus far.

I've never attempted to make French Onion soup but after seeing all the rave reviews, I had to try this recipe. No doubt about it, this is the best soup I have ever tasted! It was easy to make and made a terrific appetizer for our London Broil. Thank you so much for sharing!

Great recipe and relatively easy.
I went with some others and used (herbed) croutons rather than bread, but the hubby said that he would prefer without flavored crouton, plain would suit him better.
We also both thought that this was a bit earthier than we would have liked, but that's probably just our particular pallete.
All in all pretty darn good. Easy, and delicious!

Yummy! I have been searching for a French Onion Soup recipe similar to the one my mother made, and the is the closest I've ever been able to find! My local grocery store didn't have fresh bay leaf, so I had to used dried, and I used provolone cheese (because I LOVE it). Otherwise, I followed to the tee, and it turned out great. My boyfriend, who says he's never been a fan, thought it was awesome. Thanks for sharing!

This was as good as everyone said it was.  It had a slightly more "gourmet" flavor than those I've had at casual restaurants, but we loved it! For those who, like me, never drink wine and thus never have it on hand,  I substituted (for the wine) 1/2 c. of grape juice soured with 1 tsp. of red wine vinegar and is turned out just great.

Excellent, easy to prepare and quick.  My only changes were that I skipped the salt as it is totally unneccesary given the broth additions later (even though I used low sodium broths) -- and I used a pre-shredded cheese mixture from one of the now-common pre-packaged zip-lock bags of cheese (asiago, parmesan, mozzarella, etc).  Also, I left the bay and parsley in and removed it later without going through the twine tie step.  I used cooking sherry for the wine.  Great recipe!

I would give this 6 stars if I could!!! French Onion Soup is my ultimate comfort food, and it doesn't get much better than this! Sometimes I'll substitute Parmesan for the Asiago, and use dried herbs instead of fresh ones, but otherwise I stick to the original recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly and made this soup a few nights ago to break in my new Le Creuset stockpot that was gifted to my husband and I for our wedding. Wow, this soup is amazing. I didn't have a bay leaf, or sprigs of fresh herbs, so I just used the dried versions and everything tasted awesomely. Instead of 4 onions total, I used about two large (one sweet yellow, and one red) onions that I sliced super thinly and that seemed plenty for us. For the cheese component, I used two slices of Provolone topped with several slices of Asiago cheese, placed on thick slices of French bread that I had placed over the soup. I broiled under the broiler until the cheese was blistered and melty. This is the most unique and flavorful French onion soup I've ever had.

Was very good - followed recipe exactly.  I will go with Swiss the next time I make as I spent $21 on Gruyere cheese (2 bricks).

That was outstanding!!  I only had sweet and yellow onions, so I used what I had and was thrilled with the results.  I used swiss and fresh grated asiago for the cheeses.  I'm sure this will be a staple for cold winter nights!  Awesome recipe!  Thank you!!

I'm adding my vote for this delicious onion soup.   The worcestershire and vinegar take this over the top.  My boyfriend loved it as well!  But then he likes everything I make (lucky gal that I am!!)

I've been wanting to try my hand at French Onion Soup for a while now. I chose this recipe over Julia Child's only because this cooking time was shorter. This turned out not to be true in my case. The onions took nearly 90 minutes to caramelize. There was so much liquid accumulated, I had to drain it off to get them to brown. Not wanting to lose all that great flavor, I added it back in gradually with the broth.  I did not add the Balsamic Vinegar since the flavor was already amazing!  Couldn't find Gruyere cheese at my local store so used Munster & Mozzarella.  I took the suggestion of some other reviewers and used croutons instead of toasted bread. Worked fine. Next time I'll try the bread for comparison. 4 stars is only due to the cooking time. This was truly delicious!  I love that it can be made a day ahead for company and then easily finished for the table.  Excellent soup!!  Will be making this for a long time to come!  Aunt Tilly

This was SO good.  Aside from not buying fresh thyme (sprinkled a bit of ground thyme in instead, but did use fresh parsley and the whole bay leaf), I followed the recipe exactly.  I had French Onion Soup for the first time on a very intoxicated night in Vegas... we had $100 room credit at theHOTEL that we hadn't used and it was our last night, so we blew all $100 on room service :) I was skeptical but my male suitor told me it was to die for.. this soup was just like that.  I had made a recipe awhile back that I saw in a magazine that was extremely sweet and nothing like my experience with this soup in Vegas, but this was spot on.  It's exactly what I remember, so tasty.  This soup was very robust and hearty, I  near licked my bowl clean and was peeling bits of cheese off the side of the ramekin and baking sheet.  Mmmmm!  I wish I had more!  I used gruyere with a bit of mozzarella and parmesan on top as well, then after I pulled them out of the oven I sprinkled a bunch of crispy onions on top!  Ha!  So tasty.  I forgot the paprika.  Doh!  Anyway, just make it, and make it as it's written.  It's very good!

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed the directions as written and we managed to get five bowls of soup. We just didn't have the cheese overflowing over the edges of the bowls, but it was plenty. I also used onion and garlic flavored croutons instead of the bread to make it easier. This was so easy and I was able to keep it on the stove while waiting until it was time to bake them with the cheese and serve. I had never made French onion soup before, but I will be making this recipe again for sure. Thank you so very much for this delicious and easy recipe! Five star all the way.

"delightful" "lovely" were the words coming out of my husbands mouth while he ate this :)  I made almost as directed but had to improvise homemade vegetable stock with half a chicken stock cube and we had swiss emmental in the fridge so we used that for the cheese.  Would definately make again and again.

I loved this. I need a bigger pot to make it in next time though, because my onions steamed instead of caramelizing properly. I did wind up getting them caramelized a bit once I was able to put my full attention on them though. I used dried herbs -- 1 tsp parsley and 1 tsp thyme. I'd have used fresh if I had them available, but dried worked ok for me. I'd use this recipe again if I had a craving for French Onion soup, it's better than Panera (and mine was less salty because I made my own broth). Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with everyone that this does turn out quite good.  I would suggest one minor modification, however.  As a general rule, I always season beef with at least a little bit of garlic.  I followed the recipe but noticed it didn't have that extra little zing.  A quarter to a half teaspoon of garlic powder changed all of that!  You don't actually taste the garlic- no one will ever know that its there.  It just accentuates the flavor of the beef.  Goes great with a roast beef sandwich :)

This is one of the best recipes out there for French Onion Soup. I occasionally replace the wine with Sherry but that is personal preference. If you want to impress your guests stick to the recipe. You can't go wrong.

Great recipe to base your soup on. A couple tips. I used provolone cheese. Which is the cheese used in most restaurants. I ended up using 1/2 the chicken stock because I prefer a beef base broth. The chicken stock is a must, but just not that much. I used Merlot and it did have a sweeter taste to it. Next time, I'll probably use a red wine that is more dry. All in all it is a great recipe once you put your own twists on it.

I thought this would be good based on all the reviews but blecht. Not good. Maybe it was because of the wine I used, merlot. I've had better soup from a packet.

This soup is to die for! Wonderful flavor..yum. The only thing I did differently was that I added about a Tbsp. of olive oil to the butter so the butter would not burn & also, I didn't have fresh thyme or parsley so I used about 1/4-1/2 tsp. of the dried stuff. This soup has such a rich flavor to it. If I could, would give it 10 stars!

My first attempt at French onion soup was a hit! I forgot to pick up the fresh herbs so I cut the top off of a tea bag emptied it and filled with the right amount of dried retied it with its own string and simmered it with the broth. My husband said Excellent which is a feat as it his favorite and he get it at every place that has it on the menu!!! as I scaled it to 2 servings since its not really a kid friendly soup. I may try it with sherry next time as some have suggested. Its really rich and filling! I topped with provolone slices, a small amount of grated asiago and shredded swiss since I was running low on just swiss. I WILL make again!

The best soup I ever made!!!   I made this soup for 14 people!   We used two large deep oven pans on the stove.   We divided the recipe into each.    Beacuse of the large amount of onions needing to be carmleized, this worked out beautifully!   We had to wait about 45 minutes for carmelization.   We used more low sodium beef broth and less chicken broth.   We used a dry, full bodied Merlot for the wine.   It turned out so well!!   We keep the heat up on the pans a little long.   The soup reduced a lot.   We poured in more beef broth, Worcestershire, and Merlot to allow for more broth.   We also had it on the stove for 3 hours before we served it!    We toasted the baguettes in the oven and used only caved aged Gruyere Cheese.   This was a hit!   I will defiantly try this recipe again!   Next time we are going to allow the soup to simmer for a couple hours so the reduction is less pronounced.

This was really good and pretty rich.  As another reviewer said the salt helps  to carmelize the onions when cooking it on the stove, so don't leave it out at this step. When first cooking the onions I stirred them less often to help them carmelized stage, but as they became carmelized I would stir more often to prevent burning. I used swiss cheese and mozzarella because I couldn't find gruyere or asiago, but these cheeses didn't have enough flavor to contrast the broth and I ended up pulling a lot of the cheese out - so I will use gruyere and asiago in the future. Also,  for toasting the bread, I put the pan on the highest shelf - but make sure to watch the bread because it will start smoking if left for longer. For melting the cheese I    had the top of the bowl at 6  or 7 inches from the burner because I was concerned that my bowl would break. At this lower position, the cheese still browned very nicely and I didn't even need to wait the entire five minutes. Finally, I stored the extra broth in the refrigerator without the cheese or bread and then just heated the broth up on the stove the next day, and toasted the bread and added the cheese the next day.  For the wine, I used  an inexpensive grocery store brand because other flavors covered the merlot so it didn't make that much of a difference that it wasn't a "nice" merlot. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe to the  T and it was perfect. Far better than any French onion soup I've ever made before and better than any French onion soup I've had in a restaurant. At first I saw all the onions after I sliced  them and sent my husband to the store to buy more ovenproof bowls. It turned out the recipe was true to the count and I didn't need the extra bowls. I would try the recipe exactly as he is before trying to tweak it because it is perfect. Thank you for sharing!

While my husband and ever-picky father-in-law liked this soup, I felt that it was a touch too sweet.  Next time I will use 3 red onions and 1 sweet onion.  To give it that savory dark, savory taste that I crave when I think of french onion soup, I think I will also use half chicken broth, half beef broth (or consomme). I also agree that half the butter and half the wine would also help. (Make sure to avoid 'sweet' red wines.)  Tip: instead of toasted italian bread, consider toasting an asagio flavored bread.  I used a loaf of rustic three-cheese (Mozz/asagio/romano) semolina bread from my grocer's bakery dept.  Awesome with this soup.

My personal preference is to use all beef broth and I did not have fresh thyme, so I just added dried.

I made this the other night, and it was fantastic! I was shocked, as it was my first attempt at French Onion soup. 

The only thing I changed was that I went half-and-half on the beef and chicken broth -- in the end I think I used 32 oz of each (Low Sodium!). It created a really hearty flavor. Also, I didn't have the fresh herbs, so I just threw about a 1/2 TBSP each of the dry version into the soup, it didn't seem to make the flavor worse. :)

Sixth soup of the year and they keep getting better.  I do not order French Onion soup, but made it for coworkers.  Everyone loved it and said it was restaurant quality.  I tried it myself and will be making this again and again.  Amazing soup.  Makes the whole kitchen smell amazing!  No changes at all!

This soup was so delicious, and exactly what I was looking for.  I made this without the wine, purely because I didn't have any on hand.  Just used more beef broth.  I also used 2 sweet onions and 2 white onions.  Even delicious with store bought croutons instead of the bread.  I served it to a friend and she demanded the recipe!

This is a phenomenal rendition of this favorite of mine! As is typical of me, I made a few alterations, but only to suit my palate, not to modify the integrity of the soup.  I prefer to flip the broth quantities (14 oz of chicken, 48 oz of beef) I also double the wine and add a touch of ruby port.  I also make roasted garlic parmesan crustini's for the bread, instead of just plain bread, but I like an adventure.  Fantastic soup!

Hands down, best recipe on this website. I made this for my family of picky teens tonight. They do not like soup or onions so I was certain this would be another fail. I was shocked to have all 4 of them ask for 2nds!!!

Fantastic recipe!  Will definitely make again!  I don't eat Onion Soup but both my husband and brother-in-law loved it!!  I used the French Bread recipe from Janet Vink and everything came out great.  The only substitution I had was that I used dried herbs instead of fresh.

Great flavor! After reading some reviews, of course I made a few changes to suit our family...No red onions; instead I mandolined 4 yellow Walla-Walla sweet onions to 1/8". I sauteed them on low with a lid for 20 minutes, then added the salt, turned up the heat and the onions turned out PERFECT! Made my own clear beef broth from roasted ribs and Trader Joe's Organic Beef Stock. Used 64 ounces total. No red wine, just 1/4 cup of Dry Sherry. 1/2 teaspoon each of dried parsley and thyme, crushed to a powder. No vinegar needed since I didn't use red onions and cannot imagine vinegar in this yummy soup, but would have added it at the end one teaspoon at a time, checking for flavor if I was going to use it. The soup did not taste either beefy enough or salty enough for me, so I added some beef base to make the flavor pop. Toasted chunks of baguette (my own!) and for cheese I shredded a mix of Gruyere and Smoked Mozzarella with a topping of Grana Padano Parmesan. With a twist of fresh ground black pepper and a dusting of paprika on top, it was perfect! I had WAY too much broth though...maybe my onions were too small, but next time I make this fine soup (and there WILL be a next time) I will double the onions. This time, I just fished for all the onions with a slotted spoon to fill the little crocks, poured on the broth to 3/4 full, stuffed the top with the toasted bread, covered with cheeses and broiled; we ate like hoggies and I was happy to give this recipe 5 stars!

I used homemade beef stock for this and it made it so rich and hearty! The balsamic vinegar really adds a nice touch. Great recipe.

This is so good and forgiving too! I needed a cheap meal for my family and had a bag of yellow onions. They were rather strong so I just used 3 large instead of the 4 large called for. I kept everything else the same. Tasted wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing this delicious treat and putting an end to my craving for french onion soup!

This had a lovely taste, but had way too many onions.  Someone else mentioned they wanted more, but for some reason, I hardly had any broth.  Next time I'll use less onions (and I won't have to cry as much)!  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not a huge cheese person so I used some fresh mozzarella and sprinkled parmigiano reggiano on top and a little bit in the soup and it was nice and mild flavored for me and the kids... even they liked it!

We really enjoyed this soup. I used extra chicken broth instead of the beef, with no ill effect. I took the advice of buying good balsamic vinegar.

Follow the directions given. OR modify it however you like. When you think you have perfected the French Onion Soup, add some "beef base".  It comes in a jar. Start out with small amounts until you perfect the flavor that suits you. Takes a great recipe to a higher level.

I cut back on the worcestershire, red wine, and balsamic vinegar in efforts to allow the beefy onion flavors stand out.

This soup is brilliant.  Wonderful.  The better half said he would happily eat it every week.  Even my über-critical parents liked it!

I followed the recipe as-written as far as proportions are concerned, but I only had one red onion, so I used one red and three sweet.  I sliced the onions as thin as my mandolin would allow (a bit less than 1/8 of an inch), as they seem to caramelize more evenly when they're the same thickness.  I cut a piece of potato bread to fit the top of the soup crock and then toasted it, as I didn't have french bread.  This was acceptable, but got soggy faster than french would have.  Also used half chicken broth and half beef broth since that was what I had on hand the first time.  My balsamic vinegar wasn't the best quality, and I bought a better, less astringent bottle for the next batch of soup (and for tomato, basil and mozzarella salads and sandwiches since tomato season is on its way).

This soup was as delicious as I had read about in the reviews!!  I just made it tonight and could NOT wait to review it!  My boyfriend loved it too, and he usually doesn't really like the actual onions in French onion soup, but loved these and we both licked our bowls clean.  I made almost exactly per recipe, except Omitted red wine, and used dry herbs instead of fresh.  I may use a hair less Worcestershire next time.  I had absolutely no problem getting the onions to caramelize

This is the best french onion soup that I've had!!!  In my opinion, it  by far surpasses the upscale restaurants' soups! I will definitely be making it again and again. I used sliced French baguette for some and parmesan ranch/onion croutons for the others. (I didn't have full size ramekins, so I had to use smaller Corningware ramekins/casserole bowls) It turned out good, however, using such a small bowl, the bread overwhemed the broth and it was slightly dry...

I will definitely make this again and again as it was easy to put together and it's delish! 

Thanks so much, Jersey Tomato!!!  If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would!!!

Thanks so much Jersey Tomato.
 I love it! I'd like to suggest to those who are having trouble with caramelization that it may be due to the wrong type of pot in which you are using. Many people do not realize that a super-duper heavy-bottom pan/pot is really and truly needed to properly cook.

I thought the cooking time for the onions was great. However I was not a big fan of the red wine taste that the soup had.  I also wish that I would have used all beef broth.  I added some beef base and some dry mustard to this soup.  It still was not the flavor I was looking for.  I will move on and try another recipe.

Very tasty! I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 more for my issues with it than because of the recipe. My onions never did really caramelize like I expected them too even after almost an hour. I finally gave up on expecting golden as they were starting to go to mush. I over filled my tablespoon with the balsamic, so I might have gotten a little too much in, but not enough to ruin anything. I will be more careful next time! Also seemed a bit salty without adding any more salt at the end. Next time I would use low sodium broth for at least part of the total broth. REALLY, REALLY good though! Will make again.

I made this soup for New Year's Eve.  It is an awesome recipe and quite easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe as written except for using mostly beef broth.  The balsamic vinegar added at the end truly rounds out the flavors.  I will definetly make this again!

This was excellent. I didn't change a thing. The balsamic vinegar was just enough, didn't really notice it, so I am sure it added some depth of color and flavor. Had a lot of onions, probably could have used maybe another small can of broth but other than that, I have nothing negative to say about it. Will definitely make it again and probably not change a thing.

I was looking for a recipe like the restaurants serve. I had never found it until now.
  This soup has a wonderful flavor to it. I used onion rolls for the bread. My family loves it so much, they request it at least once a week.

I always order this at restaurants and each place has a different tasting soup.  I usually find it much too salty but this recipe was not.  The only odd thing is that it was really sweet tasting.  I agree with other reviewers and next time I will use white onion instead of sweet.  I also thought I would have WAY too many onions when I cut them (I filled an entire mixing bowl) but they shrank down a lot.

French Onion soup has been one of my favorite dishes ever since I was a kid. My dad and I used to have a bowl after sailing in this little houseboat restaurant right near the harbour. It has never come out this good before. I substituted a milder french cheese and added some cheddar. I also glazed the onions with a bit of maple syrup. REALLY good.

Amazing!!  At first the amount of onions that we cut up looked to be too many, but after they cooked down it was just perfect!  We used dental floss to twine the herbs together for those of you who are wondering what to use...

Pretty good, but I thought I could taste the wine too much, so next time I will reduce the amount.  Also, not the recipes fault, but I CANNOT fine broiler-safe crock bowls!!  (help anyone?)

This was wonderful!  Made & shared with some friends and we all loved it!  Takes a little time (and work slicing the onions) but the results were faaarrr better than any I've EVER had in a restaurant.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and friends liked it alot.  I think next time though I'll use more beef broth than chicken.  It wasn't beefy enough for me.  I also have a suggestion for those with kids or not enough oven safe bowls.  After broiling the bread, broil the cheese on top of it.  You can then set the cheesy bread in the bowls full of soup (cut it up for the kids).  The presentation isn't the same, but it is just as delicious.

OMG!!! Honestly this is an AMAZING recipe! The only thing I changed was I used regular onions because I had them on hand but my goodness this is hands down the very best thing I've seriously EVER made.

Awesome...this is as good as our favorite restaurant's version that we compare all others to.   I've got one high BTU burner on my cooktop...so that plus doing the onions in a large skillet for more surface area to work with put my carmelization process real close to around a half hour.   Definitely need to keep an eye on that part.  Then I transfered to a stockpot and continued as the recipe stated. Used a really good Merlot and a balsamic from Modena.  My grocery store doesn't sell Gruyere, so I was pleasantly surprised by the asiago slices with shredded swiss on top...glad I didn't find the expensive stuff!  Thank you for sharing the recipe...I found you by Googling "best baked french onion soup ever"...and at least this time, what I read on the internet WAS true...bonjour!  ;)

Great Recipe. Can be a bit Labor intensive but that is all on a matter of preference. My only advice/changes would have to be in the amounts of beef/chicken broth. These are interchangeable but it does depend which kind of broth you prefer. I generally do less chicken broth and more beef broth. The beef broth gives a bolder flavor. Second change would be i used Swiss and mozzarella cheese. They are cheaper and more readily available. I have used Gruyere(which is most traditional)but i did not like the flavor(most likely due to lack of knowledge of using the cheese). Honestly a great recipe relatively cheap and wonderful presentation for holidays or special events.

We used 4 white onions.  I did not like the french bread, swiss cheese and asagio...  If I make it again, I will likely use Texas toast and another variety of cheese.

I've made this twice now, the first time with red and yellow onions, the second time with all yellow. Both times I used organic low sodium Better Than Bouillon beef and chicken paste rather than canned broth. 50 percent of each. The first time I used fresh herbs, the second time dried. Both worked fine. The only major suggestion I have is to cut the bread super thin, otherwise it soaks up too much of the broth and leaves the soup a little dry.

My husband and I LOVE this soup! I skip the bread and just use croutons in the soup, cover with 2 slices of swiss and broil for a couple minutes. Serve after a nice salad and you have a great meal!

Absolutely fantastic!  I don't like parsley so omitted that and used white wine, only because I can't drink red and the amount was small enough I could't justify the red turning to vinegar.  It made 6 generous portions for me with more cheese (Gruyere and Asiago) and bread (I used a very rustic crusty french bread) than called due to the additional portions.  Was sceptical about the balsamic vinegar but WOW it was perfect to round out the flavors!  Thanks SO much for the recipe.  And the base broth freezes wonderfully!!!

This soup was AMAZING!! I didn't use the fresh herbs but rather used dried herbs. Also I didn't have a bay leaf. I also switched the beef and chicken brothes measurements- I used 48 oz. of beef broth & 16 oz. of chicken broth. It was easy and delicious!!

I've never made Onion soup before even though I am a soup lover. Me and my family loved this meal. It was simple to make, satifying and economical. Thank You for this recipe.

Oh boy!!!
 I made this for my Hubby for Old years night and he was raving about this for the rest of the week. 
It is better than any Gratinee I've had at fancy restaurants.   
I made my own beef stock ( why buy stock when you can make it) and only had sweet onions.
Didn't even need to add salt afterwards as the vinegar,worcestershire sauce was more than enough.

WOW!!!!

Wowzer!!!  Sooo good.  I used low sodium chicken broth and did not add any more salt.  It was perfect...my guest favorite dish for the night.

I was afraid to try this because I thought it was supposed to be all beef broth, but it was great!  Just realized I forgot the vinegar, lol.

It was great to taste.
Though I felt like it took hours to stir onions it's still great to cook again.

Very Good.  Next time I might add beef consume instead of broth to add a tad bit of richness.  However, this is a great onion soup.  5 star quality!

loved this recipe, have tried a few other french onion soup recipes and this is definitely the best so far. I did find that when we ate it the next day it tasted even better. So I think I will always make it a day ahead and then reheat. Didn't alter the recipe at all.

I made this soup for my husband (who LOVES French Onion Soup) and he says it's excellent and well worth the 5 star rating.  Only difference from original recipe, was we used Havarti cheese, because the store didn't have any Gruyere.

AWESOME!!!  DH was feeling under the weather so I made a batch of this soup and he is feeling 100% better.  Added more wine (I like wine!) and did not add extra salt (didn't need it).  Try this soup for a wonderful warming dinner and for its healing properties.  No one likes a sick husband...

Delicious soup, although a little time consuming! So worth it though! A perfect marriage of flavors, but I think next time I will use more beef broth and less chicken (instead of the reverse as stated in the recipe) since I like a more bold flavor.

EDIT: I made it again, this time using a 32oz carton of beef broth, and almost a full 48oz carton of chicken broth. I liked it even better! I also upped the thyme (I used 4 sprigs) and used 2 bay leaves.  NOTE: This makes WAY more than 4 servings.  I'd say in the very least 6 full onion soup crocks, maybe 7.

Thanks for sharing. Probably the best French Onion Soup I've ever tasted. I did add a tad more red wine because my husband likes the flavour and added no extra salt as I am very careful about use of salt. Other than that it was made as described.

Followed Jersey Tomato's review and notes.  Turned out wonderfully.  I ended up not finishing my dinner portion so I packed it up for lunch the next day thinking the bread might be soggy and gross--was even better leftover!

I followed the reciepe almost exactly, except I added more cheese than it called for because we are huge cheese lovers. I thought it was wonderful!  I plan to make one change next time in order to please the taste of my family, I will cut the amount of onion down because it is quite a hearty onion soup and my children would eat it better with less onion. I toasted up lots of extra French bread to dip in the broth & melted cheese...AMAZING!

Very good recipe:) I prefer using stock rather than broth for a richer flavor.  Try slicing the onions poll to poll, they seem to hold a better shape this way. Turning the bread slices into croutons instead makes eating this soup much easier. I think it would be nice with fontina cheese- it melts beautifully and has more flavor than mozzarella in my opinion.

This is a the best onion soup ever!  Thank you, Jersey T.  And when the broth/stock is home-made and the baguette is your own crusty day-old -- this soup is heaven!  My friends insist that I make this soup for their birthdays -- somewhat of a tradition!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

SUPER EASY AND DELICIOUS!  This was the first soup I have ever made (being a chili and stew kinda gal), and it turned out EXTREMELY WELL.  It tasted just as good (if not better) than the restaurant I first sampled it in.  I used provolone and swiss cheese on top (the more the better!) with the asiago cheese on tippy top.  As a nice little addition, I used the rest of my french bread to make grilled cheese sandwiches with the extra cheese I had too - HUSBAND LOVED IT! :D

On a cold fall day, this soup is perfection! My picky husband absolutely loves it, and I do too. l make it in extra big batches so I can freeze half for another chilly weekend. Every time the season changes, I think about the different dishes that I get to look forward to, and this dish is definitely what comes to mind when it starts to feel like fall.

This was a great recipe. I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce, because I didn't have any (not very common around here) and dried thyme instead of fresh. Thanks for sharing - a keeper!

Excellent french onion soup!  DH and I both loved it.  However I may change up a few things next time to see if I like it even better.  Use half beef broth, half chicken broth and only 1/4 c. of wine.  I think I was looking for a little more beef flavor and a little less wine flavor.  It's still excellent as is though.

Very good soup!  Just as good as the restaurants!  : )  I made it exactly as the recipe states - except for the cheese.  I used shredded mixed-Italian cheese.  It was sooooo yummy!  Perfect for our cold snowy weather right now!

I followed the recipe exactly, but burnt the onions...  I suppose I should have turned the heat down really low after the butter melted since it calls for such a long cooking time...  Later, I tried this adding more butter and lowering the cooking time, was geat!

An excellent find! I had bare ingredients--one yellow onion, no herbs, no wine.  I quartered the recipe and used two beef cubes with two cups of water.  As I was stirring in everything, I thought it needed something a little sweeter, so I first added a tablespoon of brown sugar, followed by another tablespoon after tasting it.  Then I added a chicken cube since it had become too sweet, and I must say, this hit the spot.  I also only had romano cheese, but this actually tasted pretty good.  I will definitely make again, and probably keep my changes!

This soup turned out great! And I even didnt add all the herbs it called for. I only had dried parsley which I sprinkled in. I did not add a bay leaf. I didnt have any string or anything to tie up the thyme leaves so I just put them in the broth and removed them later which worked fine..they were still intact. I followed some suggestions to just use croutons and I did cut the Swiss cheese down a bit...it was still super cheesy. A delicious soup!

Used some beef consommé, less chicken broth, and added garlic.   Also added extra wine.  Perhaps the best French Onion Soup I've ever had.

Fantastic Recipe.  I think I had the heat on too high, because after 20 minutes the onions were caramelized and the bottom of the Le Creuset was jet black.  The only thing I did differently was toasted up some croutons I made out of the no-knead bread I had made earlier, and draped the cheese over that.  It was fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is THE BEST French Onion soup recipe ever! I've tried about three and even put my own spin on them and nothing compares to this. The only thing I did differently is use all red onion since that is all I had on hand. Don't skimp or skip any ingredients if you want that restaurant quality soup we all desire.

Delicious!  Recipe is perfect!  The flavor combos just leave your tastebuds speechless!  MMmmmm is all you can get out!!  Spoon in another bite.  I served it in smaller bowls as a side dish to the steak tips and smashed garlic potatoes, but honestly this soup took front and center over the beef and potatoes!

Great base recipe! I made this without the red wine, Worcestershire sauce, thyme or rosemary but instead with sauteed garlic and ginger, Ezekiel bread for the toast, and a Danish blue cheese. Will be adding this to the regular rotation.

This is amazing! It has wonderful flavor and is a meal in itself. I served it with a green salad and a glass of the same red wine I used in the recipe. I was a little intimidated by the amount of preparation but its quite easy. Just follow the instructions! I thought the onions would burn if I cooked them that long and it looks like so many onions, but they cook down! This was easy and turned out great! One of my new favorites!

I was dumb founded this am when my boyfriend took my last can of F/O to work and I had none for our pot roast.  I had to find a replacement and fast.  I searched and found one prior to this but it lacked in the flavor I was looking for.  I wanted Bold and Rich and all I was getting was buttery and bland.  Thank you for saving dinner.  The recipe prior to yours had the base of this one so I was able to improvise and combine all the much needed ingredients from yours into it.  I do not know of any other way to cook roast to my palate without the F/O and thanks to my past experiences with deviating from this recipe neither will my boyfriend.  Thanks to you tonight he will be asking how I improved on an already perfect recipe.  Only you and I will know that it was your rescuing me today that made it so.  Many thanks and for the best pot roast combine this with 2 cups strong black coffee and simmer in crock pot all day.  I have the Best broth and gravy ever to look forward to tonight.  I hope you enjoy the shared recipe. Kudos on a recipe that is fatisimo.

very good.  not exactly quick preparation, but worth it.  no need to wait for the stock to be ready to start broiling the bread... you can do both simultaneously to save time.  i broiled an extra piece of bread and cut it up as croutons for the salad i served along with it.  i'll make this again...  you need a big pot!  mine wasn't big enough so i had to halve the recipe... no biggie though :)

I am sorry to say I really did not like this soup.. It tasted a bit off. Could be the wine I used, not sure. Also, are red onions typically used for French Onion Soup? I think that may have been part of the problem..

Excellent.  I have tried many French Onion Soup recipes only to be disappointed.  This recipe does not disappoint - very good, very flavorful.  Only change was to add 3 cloves minced garlic a few minutes before the onions are done carmelizing (I add garlic to just about everything.)  Will definitely be making this again, and again.  Thanks so much for submitting.

Excellent.  I loved it.  I had to make a couple changes b/c of ingredients on hand, but it still turned out delicious.  I used half chicken stock and half beef stock - 32oz of each.  Thought I had Balsamic Vinegar but couldn't find it so had to use apple Cider Vinegar.  I will try it according to recipe next time but this tasted great too.  Just so good!  I also used croutons b/c I didn't want to go out to store for bread and it worked in a pinch, I know it's not the same but it was good.  You can also make your own croutons by cubing bread, tossing with butter and toasting.  I'm going to have to go out and buy some oven-safe bowls now!  I put it in bowls and put it under my toaster broiler, which worked great.  Just use oven-safe bowls for this obviously. lol

This recipe is wonderful! Thank you Jersey Tomato for sharing. My only piece of culinary advice to a novice chef/cook is when caramelizing the onions...Do not forget the salt (or opt out of adding the salt as you feel it may make the dish too salty) It is very important to the process; helping the onions to release their juices creating that syrupy effect.

Good, I used Organic broths and it was much saltier than I would have liked-my rings were tight the next day! It had great depth of flavor- only could manage one bowl.  I did the toasts alone and topped the soup in mugs since I don't own ramekins (yet!) - upped recipe to serve 8...

Wow, this soup was absolutely delicious... AND it's even better the 2nd day!!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe, with a few minor adjustments: I didn't have any Thyme, so I just added fresh parsley and bayleaf.  I added 3 minced cloves of garlic (and didn't get an overpowering garlic flavour - if anything it enhanced the flavour).  For those that commented this soup is missing 'something', try adding fresh garlic and see if it helps - I think it adds a layer of depth to the soup, and the outcome is truly fantastic!  Also, it took me a good hour or so to carmelize the onions - but it was well worth it. This soup is better than what we've had in restaurants.  My husband was craving it again just days after I'd made it.  I can't wait to make it for friends and family.  Will definitely make this again and again!!

If you're looking for run of the mill French Onion Soup, look elsewhere; if you're looking for AMAZING French Onion Soup, this is truly it. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out excellent.  Thank you so much for submitting it.  And to the person below me who only gave it a couple stars because they missed the wine and Swiss?  This recipe called for both - did you review the wrong recipe?

This is an excellent dish. I get rave reviews from everyone I have ever served it to.  We had a big soup party at work and I made this. Since I couldn't do the baked cheese on top I took sliced bread italian bread and toasted it in the oven with cheese, then when you put it in the bowl with the hot soup the cheese gets all melty, but the toasted bread stays somewhat firm and doesn't get all goopy.  Stayed well in the crock pot all day.

I love-love-love this recipe.  I use different cheeses than it states. The magic in this soup is not the cheese, it is the carmelized onions and broth.  Follow the carmelizing instructions!!  I never actually have 2 of each onions when I am in the mood for making this soup, so don't worry too much about that.

This onion soup is a favorite in our home.  But beware!  The onion smell will permeate everything in your place for days after.  But it's SOOO worth it.  Fresh Parsley is key and instead of red wine?  Bourbon.  Just do it!

I'm sorry and I do appreciate you sharing the recipe but we were very disappointed in it. I had a difficult time getting the onions to carmelize and then realized maybe I shouldn't have used grey salt for that.  What I thought would be a fairly easy dish to prepare ended up taking 3 times as long to make and the ending was nothing like we expected.  I ending up throwing the rest of it away. We both love French onion soup but this just wasn't the recipe for us.

Searched all over for a good french onion soup recipe with no luck--there was always something missing.  So glad I found this recipe!  I've made it twice & it's the best!  I made it exactly per the recipe the first time & it was a wonderfully rich, filling soup.  Second time I did use croutons.  Definitely worth using actual gruyere cheese.  The best!

Very good.  I made a few changes just because they were things I had on hand.  I used my homemade beef stock, which was already seasoned so the only seasonings I added were salt & pepper.  I used croutons instead of bread thanks to other reviewers suggestions.  One thing I have disliked about this kind of soup is the big hunk of bread you have to chop up in your bowl so great idea!  Also only had swiss & parmesan so used those.  This was so quick & easy.  Tasted as good as the french onion soup I have had in restaurants.  My husband loved it too.  This is a keeper & I will be making this again, maybe trying the Gruyere & mozz cheese next time just to see what it's like.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good soup JT! I used fat free/low sodium beef broth for this and carmalized my onions a bit quicker by adding in some sugar while they were cooking. This is my hubby's all time favorite soup and we all thank you! BTW, I just love the town of Lambertville!

Ok, I'm going to raise my hand and say I didn't like this.  I followed the recipe exactly, even used the chix/beef broth as directed (I've always made FOS with only beef broth).  It tasted oddly "beefy".  I tasted it after the 20 minutes at medium and really disliked it but then added the balsamic vinegar hoping it would salvage it.  It ended up with some strange beefy/acidic taste.  I know both worcestershire (which I think is the "beefy taste" culprit) and balsamic can sometimes improve a FOS recipe, but in this case, it really didn't.  I was disappointed, the reviews were awesome!  Thanks for sharing it though :)

I have searched this site for many recipies for french onion soup, and this is by far the best one. I personally beleive that the balsamic vinegar adds that restraunt style taste that I was looking for! I will surely make again!

My fiance is a huge fan of French Onion soup, so I made this for him for Valentines Day dinner, and he said it was the best he'd ever had. He just kept whispering "ohmygod" between mouthfuls. I can't give it a better review than that!

Very nice recipe...thank you.  I finally got around to making it yesterday and we liked it a lot.  We have a "usual" recipe which takes much less time but this one has a whole different flavor.  I'm going to have to make our usual next week just to see which we prefer.  Nice presentation on this one for company, glad I tried it.

This was delicious!  My hubby gave it 4 3/4 stars b/c I didn't have red wine and just added additional broth. I used 1/2 t ground thyme in lieu of fresh.  The soup was on the sweet side (and I used a combination of red and yellow onion - no sweet onion) but I thought it was delicious, rich and warm.  So glad I tried this!   P.S. I just realized I forgot the salt when carmelizing the onions - maybe the lack of salt contributed to the overall sweetness?  Next time I'll remember that and also use red wine.

This was really good! I made a few modifications right off the bat and there's a couple of things I would change next time though but it's a great start.

First off I used 1 tsp of dried Thyme and Parsley instead of fresh because that's what we had on hand. To steep them I put the Thyme, Parsley, and Bay Leaf in a coffee filter and tied that up with white thread so that they wouldn't get into the soup and make it grainy. I also set the pouch inside of a strainer with a handle so it wouldn't get lost in the pot.

I also used Dry Sherry instead of red wine because that's what we had on hand and I heard it was good for french onion soup as well.

Instead of the Gruyere, I opted for the Swiss because my grocery store didn't have Gruyere cheese.

Finally I didn't sprinkle the paprika over the tops, I don't think it needed it.

So, I was happy with and would keep all of those changes for next time with the addition of one other modification:

Both my husband and I thought that it was too much of a chicken broth to beef broth ratio. It was still very good but had a chicken-y kind of taste to it too. So next time I plan on doing equal parts Chicken Broth and Beef Broth (so 31 fluid ounces of each) to see how that turns out.

But this is a great base, we both LOVED the cheese choices and it has a great flavor, just needs a few changes for us personally.

I have a large extended family and every year we vacation together they request this soup.  I cook the onions twice as long and also extend the simmering time out to an hour this allows the flavors to really mix and it also helps the soup become thicker, which I like.  I make homemade croutons out of rosemary bread allowing the family to decide how much bread they want, plus the flavor of the croutons with the soup is amazing.

Absolutely fabulous! Hearty on its' own, this can make your whole meal. I appreciated the tip to use salt during the caramelizing process, it makes it so much easier to get a nice rich finish to the onions.  I used regular yellow onions, since it was what I had on hand, and it's still a winner!

Absolutely the best French Onion Soup I have ever eaten/made/had!! I am a big fan of making soups in large quantities and freezing them for my housemate and I for dinners, and this is no exception. Since I do love simmering soup all day, I can wait for the onions to caramelize into a lovely golden mess; the smell is heavenly! No disrespect to the recipe creator, but I did use the seasoned croutons and a nice big handful of the Trader Joe's Swiss and Gruyere shredded cheese, and the gooey melting goodness is beyond compare. This is a soup to die for!

Oh wow!! One of the first recipes I did not change a thing.. And followed the exact directions.. So Amazing!! served with TriTip sandwiches and the meal was out of this world! Yes, it's full of salt but I am one of those few that would rather live and eat instead of being miserable with bland foods..

Loved this soup.  So did my daughter.  I was a little worried as I always make my French Onion Soup with congac not red wine but this had nice depth in flavors. I made for dinner and then for the lunch the next day.  Be sure to put the bread on top before adding the cheese as I forgot to do this when I made for lunch and could not figure out why my cheese kept sinking to the bottom on the soup bowl while i was broiling.  Then when I figured it out I added the bread and it formed the crust like it was supposed to. This soup is great along side a hot roast beef sandwhich so you can dip the sandwich in the soup.  This will be my go to French Onion Soup recipe.

This is just wonderful, have made this many times. I generally use all sweet onions(no red), so I can skip the balsamic step. This soup is very forgiving.Have used red and white wine with great results. I do have one (hopefully)helpful hint;instead of sliding full soup bowls out of the oven, I simply broil the cheese on the bread and pop that on top of the bowls of soup. Much less stressful, only slightly less beautiful. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I doubled it with no problem at all.  Just have to be patient with the carmelizing of the onions!  This is he BEST recipe I have ever had for French Onion soup.  I order it in restaurants, but am usually disappointed.  The restaurant soups do not compare to this one.  I follow everything exactly as stated in the recipe except I use croutons instead of the bread because it is easier to eat!  Thanks SO much for posting this, Jersey Tomato!

Ooo-la-la - really authentic French onion soup!  Better than most restaurant versions and fairly easy to make.  I followed the recipe with couple of exceptions - didn't have fresh thyme and it took over an hour for the onions to get properly carmelized - perhaps I had the heat too low but it worked since did not need excessive watching and/or stirring. Well worth the effort for a really fantastic onion soup - will definitely make again.  The presentation is impressive enough for company - but the taste is what delivers the goods.

This is not the fastest soup to make, but the recipe is simple and it is absolutely delicious. I recommend putting the soup bowls on a low oven rack for the last step so there is time to fully melt the cheese before it gets too browned on top.

I would have given this recipe if not for the balsamic vinegar, I suggest not adding it. Before I did the soup was perfect it was sweet and savory. I added the exact amount required in the recipe and the soup turned bitter, it tasted of balsamic vinegar and all the other flavors were lost. pretty disappointed because it would have been really good otherwise.

absolutely wonderful, but it probably wouldn't have needed any salt at the end. the soup tasted amazing straight out of the pot but the broiling process evaporated some of the liquid and made it a little bit too salty.

French onion soup is my all time favorite soup....this recipe hits the ball right out of the park for me.  The only change i did was is added dijon mustard to one side the the frech bread and faced that side down in the soup.  The dijon mustard just adds a little bit of something different to the flavor.  It is only a hint of dijon but it compliments the soup very well.

This is an outstanding recipe as-is or with many of the modifications suggested by others.  I've made it many times - increasing the amount of beef broth vs. chicken, varying the amount of red wine and worcestershire to both darken and to taste. I do always add some balsamic vinegar as others have recommended, but please use a decent quality one with some body/sweetness.  I've also omitted the thyme and pepper, used dry thyme and parsley in a tea ball for a strong herb seasoning, and white pepper for a nice kick.  The real key is to cook the onions slowly over medium heat with frequent stirring until most of the released liquid is gone and they are syrupy. You will know you've got it when you taste that sweet syrup!  Again, an outstanding recipe with lots of opportunity for creativity.

I followed the recipe exactly as directed. Very good and we both enjoyed it. Although I'd rather use Sherry or cognac instead of Balsamic Vinegar at the end of cooking, I could really taste that vinegar flavor. It was a bit too sweet for me and I'll use all yellow onions next time. The other change would be Swiss cheese, although the Gruyere was good it just didn't taste as good as Swiss does.

So yummy!!  If you don't have bowls that can go in the oven, put your bread on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with whatever cheeses you are using.  I often only have mozzerela and parmesean.  Broil the bread and cheese  until nicely browned & bubbly.  You can then transfer a slice of cheesy bread to the top of each bowl of soup.  A handy alternative to buying oven proof onion soup bowls!

Delicious, left out the balsamic vinegar and fresh greens and it still tasted great! Used more beef broth than chicken broth. Used Parmesan and mozzarella on the bread. I love this!

I didn't really like making this soup.  It calls for frequently stirring the onions for 35 minutes.  That's a lot of stirring.  My onions, also, never became gooey.  I tried different temperatures to see if that would help.  Maybe I used the wrong onions or  something, but it didn't turn out like I thought it would.  It was bitter from the burnt onions.  I did not finish eating it :(

I loved this recipe!!  Very tasty!  The only thing is, even though I followed the recipe to the "T"...I had enough soup for 7 large, completely filled ramekins!  Has anyone else had this happen??  My onions were large, but not that large!  Oh well, enough for leftovers!

I'm not a big fan of French Onion Soup but Hub is.  I did a few cheats with what I had on hand but I must say that it couldn't have been any better.  I used 4 sweet onions, chicken and beef bouillion granules, 3 T. dried parsley and 1 t. thyme.  I would just toast the bread in the toaster next time for better control.  Used a good brand of Parmesan in place of the Asiago or Mozzarella.  Didn't have ovenproof bowls/crocks so put it in a 9" square casserole.  I know that's quite a few changes but when you live in a rural area, you have to use what you have in the house a lot of the time.

A winner every time!  
SUGGESTION:  use any left over broth mix to make gravy.  I sautee mushrooms, make a roux, and use the left over soup as the liquid.

This was my first attempt at french onion soup, and I was extremely pleased!  My entire family loved it!The only thing I did different was use a sprig of Marjoram instead of Thyme, and thats only because I picked up the wrong one at the store.  But it still tasted wonderful!  So happy I found the perfect recipe on the first try!

I made this soup today - LOVED IT.  It's a simple recipe and I love the flavour of adding the balsamic and worchester.  I added a cup of Red wine though and only about 3 tablespoons of butter to the onions.  I also used about 4 small bay leaves because I love the flavour they add to soups.  Next time though I will add a more concentrated beef broth though to give it a really 'rich' taste.  Aside from these little tweaks!  PERFECTO!  I will make this again..........and again.......and AGAIN!

The key to this soup is to make sure you carmelize the onions. a long time. lol.  I used four sweets because I didnt have any red on hand. I cant stand Worcestershire sauce, and didnt need the vinegar since I hadnt used the red onions (as per the OP). Other than that, exactly as directed, but used croutons and gruyere cheese.  Fantastic. Thanks so much.

I was 100% satisfied with this recipe, aside from my slightly burnt tongue from eating it too fast! I used a non-stick skillet with a lid to ensure carmalization because of the wide base and low sides. I also couldn't find a 48 oz can of Chicken broth,,,so I used 2 cups of prepared Chicken broth by Campbells and 2 cups of Beef. This was my 1st time making onion soup and I am happy to find the recipe I will use from now on! YOM YOM YOM!!!!!!!

Wow!  I made this soup last night and just had the left overs for lunch.  This soup is simply fantastic!  The only thing I didn't have was mozzarella and I used Gruyere which, unfortunately, I shredded so it didn't overlap the sided of my little crocs nearly as much as I would have liked.  Sliced is definitely the way to go.  This soup is deliciously complex and by far the best french onion soup recipe that I have ever made!  The red wine and balsamic vinaigrette and the fact that the onions are so decadently caramelized makes all the difference.   The thyme and bay leaf were beautifully subtle but equally magnificent contributors.  Ms. Jersey Tomatoe, I congratulate you on a job well done!  Thank you!!

Outstanding!  I altered the recipe by doubling it, only using yellow onions, omitting the wine, using fresh chicken broth, using beef bouillon with water, using regular white vinegar (1 tbsp for the doubled batch, in case not being the correct vinegar would be a big deal), and put the spices in dry (crushed to bring out the flavors more). Lastly, I used a submersible blender at the end and pureed the whole thing to be smooth.  
I thought it was heavenly, so flavorful and buttery/creamy.
I wasn't planning on this being dinner for the kids, so I just made it at the same time as broiled shredded BBQ chicken sandwiches.  I put the two together (dipped the sandwich) and it was a pleasantly surprising combo!
I will definitely make this again and try to make it more true to the original recipe, topped with toast, cheese and paprika.  
THANK YOU for this recipe!

This recipe halves PERFECTLY. I followed it to the T (using a cabernet sauvignon for the wine), except that I halved the recipe for less people. Amazing. There is no need to change a single thing.

It's good, but not for us.  I wanted a more beefy saltiness flavor than winey sweetness.

I normally don't write reviews, but this was fantastic! Only major change was I had more beef broth on hand than chicken so I used 48 oz. beef and 14 chicken. Still tasted like it came from a gourmet restaurant. One tip is don't be afraid to let the bread get stale for a couple of days. Gave it a little more body once the broth soaked in. Family raved delicious!

WOW!!!! sooo good!! only changes - i didn't have the worcestershire sauce and switched the beef and chicken broths... having a snow storm here and it is perfect for lunch - and four in the freezer. I toasted the bread, shredded/sliced the cheese - put in separate freezer bags, then combined into a "FOS" freezer bag so it will be just as "fresh" when i come home from work :)  thanks for sharing!!

This was easy and delicious.  Unfortunately for me, I did not have the individual bowls so the cheese didn't work as well as I would have liked, but it was still wonderful.  Will definitely try this one again.

Soooo good!  This soup has so much depth of flavor.  I have made it as written and with alterations based on what I have and it is always great.  I always freeze my beef broth after making roasts or prime rib.  It makes an great addition to this soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

UPDATE: I have been using this recipe as a base for many months now. I use red wine vinegar instead of red wine, and white wine (just to deglaze). I LOVE this soup! It is not salty, but sweet and tangy. This soup is the real deal! There are so many flavors colliding at once on the palate. sweet, salty, savory! I made a few minor changes based on not having ingredients on hand. I used 2 cooking onions in place of the red because I did not have any red onion and added a hint of sugar while sauteing to help caramelize and sweeten. All I had was beef stock, so I used 1/2 of a carton which filled a 14.5 oz chicken broth can, and another 1/3 of a can after that. I used only two cans chicken broth as well. As far as seasonings go, I used 1/2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/3 cup red wine, 1/2 tbsp balsamic vinegar, and kept herb amounts the same. I made my own homemade garlic crouton and melted Swiss and mozzarella on top in the oven. Did not have any fancy bread on hand. Next time will be sure to use red onions. I can imagine what it does for the flavor of this soup

Loved this recipe. I make it vegetarian by substituting 1 t turmeric + 1 t soy sauce per cup of water (in this case, 2 cups) for the beef broth. Didn't have any Worcestershire sauces, didn't miss it.

This smelled so wonderful while cooking! Unfortunately, I took the onions a little too far, and they burned. Now the soup has a smoky/gross flavor. I'm still giving the recipe five stars because it worked. My error isn't the submitter's fault.

This was really good. I used some homemade broth left over from the slow cooker french dip recipe on this site, along with 1 can store bought, and a large container of chicken broth. I used only 1/4 cup wine as another reviewer suggested. I added the balsamic along with the broths instead of later as the recipe stated, not sure if it made any difference. I would recommend letting this sit overnight to let the flavors meld, it was much better the next day reheated for lunch. I used havarti and swiss cheese on top, it was a good combo.

This soup rocks! I altered the recipe to accommodate for my vegetarian palate and what I had on hand. I used only sweet onions. I used vegetable broth in lieu of chicken broth and distilled water and 1 tbsp of soy sauce instead of beef broth. I eliminated red wine and used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic vinegar. As another reviewer suggested, I made croutons (out of seven grain bread ends) instead of using Italian bread. I used shredded aged Asiago and slices of Havarti. I was amazed at the rich flavor. Will definitely make again and again. Thank you for the recipe :)

Delicious, simple, fairly quick, and the aroma reminds me of stuffing.  I did not have red wine on hand, so I substituted a couple tablespoons cider vinegar and 1 tbsp of brown sugar.

It definitely has a rich, full taste.  Ceasar croutons work great if you run out of bread.

This recipe is wonderful. Many people who wrote comments wrote about substitutes to ingredients. Here are some that I tried. Dried or frozen parsley works fine, also dried thyme. I placed these in an aluminum tea holder. Kitchen Bouquet (used to darken gravy) can be used to darken the soup if the onions did not caramelize well - this does not change the taste.  Better than Bullion (a paste in a jar) can be used with water instead of broth (both chicken and beef). This makes the cost of the soup less.  Better than Bullion is the ONLY bullion I could find that didn't have MSG or GMO ingredients.  My brother who owns a restaurant said to add about a Tablespoon of cream to a bowl of soup - and don't use the bread and cheese.  This settles easily in your tummy  and you do not have to buy the cheese and bread.  The taste of the balsamic vinegar in the soup is prominent on the day you make the soup. After a day in the refrigerator, the vinegar blends in more with the other flavors in the soup.  You can get good thin slices of onions (and no tears) using the larger size ceramic knife (available at kitchen stores) and on the internet.  This recipe will fill 2 one quart mason jars if you want to freeze it.  I tried tripling this recipe and it did not work so well. There were too many onions in the pot and the onions did not caramelize well.  I gave some of the soup to 2 neighbors. They both raved about it and wanted the recipe.

This worked well!!  I did make some changes.  I made a vegetarian version by substituting vegetable broth for the beef/chicken broth.  (I also managed to find a Worcestershire sauce that didn't contain anchovies.)  I tried to make it healthier by substituting olive oil for the butter.  I did not have fresh herbs, so I used dried ones.  Overall, a success, and fairly easy for a relatively inexperienced cook like me.

OMG!  So yummy!  Didn't change a thing except for provolone instead of the swiss.  I used Merlot and it was perfect (there didn't seem to be a lot of reviews that mentioned what kind they used).  Thank you, Jersey Tomato!

Collin made this tonight and it was 5+ stars! He said he used white sherry instead of red. That was the only substitution.

WOW, that's all I can say.  This soup is phenomenal.  I've never made french onion soup before and this was definitely simple enough for me.  I didn't make too many changes except I switched the amounts of chicken and beef broth since that's what I had on hand.  I didn't realize how much the onion would cook down so I didn't use the amount called but next time I'll follow the exact amounts.  I also will probably only put half the worchester called for but that's personal preference.  Overall it was easy and fantastic.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've always been a fan of french onion soup, and eager to take a stab at making it from scratch. I stayed faithful to the recipe for the most part, however I used 26oz cartons of beef and chicken stock (one of each), about 10 pink peppercorns, and Scamorza/Provolone as my cheeses (I'm fortunate enough to live in a place where I can get both fresh). My red wine I used is Masi Valpolicella Bonacosta, as I had read it pairs well with soups. I will certainly be making this soup again and again.

So good! It was more convenient for me to use yellow onions I had at home so I added a bit of sugar to them during the caramelizing stage. I also used port instead of red wine, and just used dried herbs instead of fresh. Was definitely a hit!

This was a huge hit with my roommates.  It had wonderful flavor and I used homemade croutons vs. the bread b/c it makes it easier to eat.  Everyone was pleased.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loved this soup -- even my 8-year-old (a finicky eater who at first said she didn't want any of it) told me how good it is.     I quadrupled the recipe and am freezing half of it now. (It all just barely fit into our largest stock pot.) It's a feat to stir 16 finely-sliced onions at once, but stir them frequently [with someone else holding the pot in place, if you're making this much at one time] lest they burn. I also left the seasonings (which I had tied up in cheesecloth) in the soup about a half hour longer than the recipe said, as it took a while to simmer and I was going by taste at that point.    Of the eight sweet onions called for in the recipe, I instead used large yellow onions, as I had them on hand already. I also used grated (rather than sliced)  Gruyere and mozzarella for the cheeses, omitted the paprika and for the bread used the French Baguettes Recipe by Judy Taubert, here: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/French-Baguettes/Detail.aspx.     This is the first time my 20-year-old niece ever tried French onion soup, so her frame of reference for it will forever be skewed to this high mark -- it's that good. It took us together three hours from prep to finish to make just this much of this soup, but it was really worth it to make that French bread to go with it, so take that extra step if you can.    Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jersey Tomato! It's a keeper.

I have tried other French onion soup recipes and this one is by far the best!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't have any red onion so I used all Vidalia and omitted the balsamic vinegar and parsley.  I also added a tiny bit of beef bouillon granules to give it more of a beef flavor.  Yummy!  Will be making again!!!!

Love this recipe! I used all chicken broth (I usually have some in the refrigerator or freezer) and added 2 beef bouillon cubes, to get the beef flavor. I've also made it with and without the mozzarella cheese, and I prefer it without.

I made this on Saturday for dinner and my husband absolutely loved raved about how good it was.  The balsamic vinegar gives it an additional flavor boost too.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I did not add any more salt at the end because it was already fine for our taste.  It was such a delicious soup that we not only had it for dinner on Saturday and Sunday, but I made it again for dinner last night too.  Great French onion soup, thanks so much for sharing.

I made this as my first attempt at homemade French onion soup.  Wow, it was great!  Even my kids liked it.  I didn't have fresh herbs for step 2 but instead used dried herbs wrapped in a coffee filter.  We also didn't have proper cookware for the broiler, so we used a blow torch, and it turned out great anyway.  Yum!

I have been searching so long for a decent french onion soup recipe and this one is it.  I have made it a couple of times and I think depending on the brand of wine you use you can get a slightly different taste.  The french bread can make a difference too.  I use a heavier french bread and I thought  this made the bread hold up better in the soup.  I did not have the fresh herbs so I used just a dash of the powder versions and the taste still came out excellent.  This is so good!

Wow! Beautiful presentation, great taste. In colder weather, I crave soup and this certainly hit the spot. I used a combination of vegetable and chicken broth, leaving out the beef because that is what I had on hand and the soup was a last minute decision.   It made for a lovely lunch and I'm quite sure I'll be using this recipe again.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was as good, if not better than the fancy resturant versions! Been trying to duplicate those for 20 yrs and could never seem to get the taste I wanted. My search is over! Thank you!

AMAZING!! I didn't have any crocks so I broiled one side of the bread and then added the cheese to the other side and made sure I covered the bread then broiled it! I had placed the bread on aluminum foil so all the overflowing cheese came right up with spatula. Then placed the bread in the prepared soup bowls! YUM! YUM! We even reheated it the next day and my husband thought it was even better!

my husband and i love this recipe, i used a stick of butter though instead of 1/2 and did sourdough bread bowls instead of slices, and used provolone cheese with mozzarella because they really complimented each other with the flavor of the soup.... with definetely make this soup often

This was not horrible but it certainly was not great!  There was too much broth and I think the chicken broth should be replaced with beef.  The cheese part was good though.

I've made this recipe several times and each time I've gotten stares as though my friends could not believe they weren't in a French restaurant! This is simply a fantastic recipe! I just recently moved and lost my printed version of this and tried to search for it... it doesn't show up when you search for French Onion Soup w or w/o the gratinee! Luckily I had mailed this to myself so I have it again! I tend to add a touch of bourbon and cognac just for the flavor. Other than that, I can say that this is one of the best recipes I have. Thank you Jersey Tomato!!!

This was definitely a great tasting soup!  However, my sister-in-law is a professional chef and owns her own catering business.  One of her signature items is her French Onion soup.  I have to say that hers is still our favorite :-)

This was an ok onion soup.  My husband and I didn't even save the leftovers...they weren't bad we just didn't want any more lol)  I followed the directions exactly (I do that with every recipe first time) and may use it as a base and change it around to suit my taste.  It just wasn't quite as rich/deep and smooth as I personally like (although by the ratings you can tell I'm in the minority hehe).

This was the most incredible onion soup recipe I have ever tried!  It is the only recipe I will make from now on.  The broth is perfect!  I did have to use white wine only because I didn't have red wine on hand.  You must try this!

Great recipe! Better than I had at some fancy place on Sunset and Vine! My question though is did you use flat leaf parsley or curly leaf? I used curly leaf because it's growing in abundance in my garden! Any difference?

OMG - this is the BEST french onion soup I have EVER EVER had.  my kids (8 and 6) helped me make it and both loved it - and my 6 year old doesn't really like onions.  I told him to try it and he loves it.  I am telling all my friends - this is better than any restaurant soup!!!  by far!!!

This was absolutely the BEST french onion soup I have EVER had.  It is DELICIOUS!  It's got a very deep, rich flavor.  The only change I made was that I used croutons instead of bread on top, and topped with shredded asiago.  It was PERFECT!  Thank you so much for such a tasty recipe that will stay in my family forever now!

unfortunately our house came down with the cold bug.  My husband of 2 months wanted a "comfort" food and asked me to make this!  I was scared, but so glad that I did!  My 8 year old daughter loved helping me and it was easier then I had first thought!  I did however make a few changes...not because I wanted to, but because of what I had on hand.  i used the fresh herbs except the bay leaf...i used dried Italian seasonings instead.  was a little scared of the wine and was not too sure what kind to use so I used a half cup of some red sweet wine that I had already.  fresh garlic and it was a SMASH!  THANK YOU For submitting, will make again...it is a must with the hubby! Kids did not care for the onions but ate the broth...they are picky! But even they too want it again! :0)

Words cannot say how beautiful this recipe is!!   I made this for some friends, and every one loved it.    Jersey Tomato I personally want to thank you for posting this recipe.   I will always refer to this recipe for my French Onion Soup. I have searched for a "classic" french onion, and I believe I will get none other than this.    I did not have any chicken stock- so I use all beef broth.  As well, I had no cooking sherry, so I used some of my favorite red wine.

Wow!  I made this tonight and it was unbelievably good! I've had French Onion Soup before, both homemade and in restaurants, but this is hands down the best onion soup I've ever had.  I was skeptical about caramelizing the onions for so long, but it is well worth the effort.

This soup is fantastic;it takes a while for the carmalization of the onions, but it's well worth it. Even people that don't like French onion soup raved about this. Just make sure you use the Balsamic vinegar or you will end up with gray soup.

This was phenomenal! Tasted just like you would get in a restaurant. Had to use dried thyme and parsley as I didn't have any fresh. I used swiss and mozzarella for the cheeses. My onions caramelized in about 25 minutes and the soup only needed 2-3 minutes under the broiler.

This is fabulous. I left out the ingredients I didn't have, like wine and balsamic vinegar, and substituted a jumbo yellow onion for the reds. I will make this again.

Hmm, unlike a lot of you, I didn't like this version. French onion soup isn't a particularly difficult soup to make so I expected a little more given the exception of some of the ingredients. For us, the wine was sorely missed, as was the Emmental Swiss. I had leftovers so I froze that. On a second sampling, I made some home built whole wheat garlic croutons and heaped that in with the Swiss. It was better but then the Worcestershire became the issue...I'll not make this again, there are far far better recipes out there for this simple elegant soup. It would seem that this recipe has been edited, it now includes wine and swiss cheese. It WILL be better. I'd still ixnay the worcestershire.

This was easy to make and tasted great. I used dried parsley as had none fresh, and also skipped the wine (added a spoonful of brandy instead). Definitely as good as in french restaurants!

OMG - this is absolutely fabulous! I've been making the same onion soup for over a decade and everyone loves it, but now that I tried this I don't think I'll ever make that one again.  I doubled the onions using all regular onions since that what I had, dry herbs instead of fresh, and substituted the Worcestershire sauce with 2 T. soy sauce. I cooked the soup for about an hour, and served it with grated cheese and croutons. My kids were having thirds and the adults were bowled over.

Completely fantastic. Like others, I used only beef stock. I also mixed the butter with a bit of olive oil, and used dried herbs, since that was all I had. We ate just soup with a quick salad of romaine, Granny Smith apples, and bacon and are still stuffed two hours later!

This was a pretty good recipe for French Onion Soup! I made it today and loved it, however I thought the wine was going to over power it, it did'nt! I felt it could have used some garlic or something, it was missin somethin, I just can't figure what it is.

This has become my famous soup. Every time my husband and I have French Onion at a restaurant, he says, "Yours is much better than this one." I am terribly slow at slicing, so I bought a mandolin. It helps a lot. Also, it really is worth the time it takes for the onions to truly caramelize. A few times I've jumped the gun and it hasn't tasted as good.

Really good french onion soup, but there is still something missing to be able to mark it as excellent.  However until I figure out what that is, I will use this recipe.  Great directions, easy to follow, I just feel like it is missing something from restaurant quality.

This is great and my wife loved it. I added a little bit of cumin and this help broaden the flavor.  Next time I make it I may use more beef broth and less chicken broth.  Great recipe and it is going to be a lot of fun to 'tinker' with.

This is the best french onion soup I've ever had.  I don't think it needs the tsp of salt though since chicken broth has so much salt in it already.

I didn't have the fresh thyme, but otherwise I made this exactly as directed.  We enjoyed it very much and I'll hope to make it more often.  The diameter of my bowls was too large for the bread and cheese to neatly seal, but it was still very good.  A great change of pace on a cold evening.  I served it with a romaine/pear salad.

Mmmmmmm..  loved the deep almost mysterious flavor of this yummy soup!! Didn't have any twine for the spices so I used a tea ball that a neighbor had given me. Worked great!!  Thanks for this delish recipe!

This was an amazing recipe! Here are my 'tweaks' do to what I had: (1) used 44 oz. of beef broth and 18 oz. chicken broth (perfect combo.) (2) used cranberry juice in place of the red wine, worked perfectly. (3) didn't have any parsley, so I omitted it & only had ground thyme, so I sprinkled some in. (4) Didn't have French bread, so I used some sourdough croutons - really good idea to use, easier to eat; you don't need a knife and fork to break through the bread when you eat it. (5) Used Swiss cheese slices & shredded cheese from a bag of mozzarella/Parmesan mix. It took only 4 minutes under the broiler-and of course, don't forget to keep your oven door cracked when you use your broiler- or your food will burn/char! Definitely worth a try, and it didn't take 35 minutes to cook the onions - so it really isn't too labor intensive. :)

This rates 5 stars, as is. But the second time I prepared it I made a few changes that made it even better, sort of combining this with "Department Store Onion Soup" (also from this site). Rather than chicken and beef broth, I used all beef broth, cooked the onions 1 1/2 hours, rather than 35 minutes, and I used white wine, rather than red. Thanks, Jersey Tomato, for a GREAT soup!

Good recipe.  The only thing I'd change next time is to make the broth all beef, no chicken to make it a little meatier tasting.

This was very good, I wanted to make some french onion soup like I had on my honeymoon and this really brought back memories! :)
 Don't rush the onion caramelizing step, that's very important.  I don't think I cooked mine long enough.  It was still very tasty but lacked the right texture.
 Also I didn't want to put my soup bowls in the oven, so I melted the cheese on the bread on a baking sheet under the broiler and then set that on my soup.  It worked out fine!

This soup is okay but it is not as flavorful as the simple french onion soup is. My husband said it was good but not great.

LOVED it!!! This was my first attempt at homemade french onion soup. It was somewhat time comsuming but OH SO worth it. I actually served it to company as an appetizer, which was a bit risky since it was a new recipe for me. However, our guests loved it as much as we did. Don't skip any of the steps as some of the other reviewers said they did. Just follow this one EXACTLY and if you're a fan of french onion, you will be grateful you took the time! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

My husband is a French Onion Soup aficionado. He craves French Onion Soup every time we go out to a restaurant. I have never tried to make it home until now. I followed the recipe using French bread, Swiss cheese and Asiago cheese. I did sprinkle a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top which was not in the recipe. The taste of the broth had a very nice flavor, compliments of the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar. I might try using a little more Worcestershire next time. My husband really liked it as did our other guests. I would definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe was absolutely divine! Unfortunately I didn't have any red wine or sherry on hand. It was Sunday, and the liquor stores were closed! However, I did have a decent white wine and it actually did the trick. I used swiss and gruyere on top. I also browned some very finely minced garlic with the onions. This soup was fabulous. Make this recipe! Thanks for sharing it!

Fantastic recipe.  I've tried other French Onion Soup recipes before and they always ended up very bland.  This did not disappoint, in fact, I was pleasantly surprised as to how well it came out.  The only modification I made was adding 2 cloves of garlic to the sauteing onions...and added a dash of light soy sauce to the mix.  I didn't have any red wine, so I ended up using Savignon Blanc.  Net time I'll add a Cab or Merlot.

Ok, I had really high expectations of this recipe because it had such great reviews.  The soup was just ok.  It was very sweet tasting.  I think it was the vinegar.  Anyway, I followed recipe to the tee and I just wasn't impressed.  I'll try a different recipe the next time.

I doubled the recipe and used 9 onions. Might add a few more next time!I LOVE onions... I used Sutter Home Family Vineyards White Merlot wine. Has a nice flavor in soups, not too dry and pretty - inexpensive. Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! Glad I doubled it - won't last long!!!

Absolutely the best onion soup I have ever had!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could, because what makes it even more wonderful is that I made it in my own kitchen and did not have to pay $6.00+ for a bowl at a restaurant, hee hee.

I ended up simmering it about 15 minutes longer than required (according to taste), but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.

In the future I may make some changes, but that is only in the search for a vegan version to serve to some vegan  relatives.  

Thank you so much for this recipe, and also thanks for clarifying the need for salt to carmelize the onions- I am normally a no/low-salt cook unless there is a reason for it.  Since I used unsalted butter and low-salt broth (you didn't specify), I figured that early dash of salt which was needed would be just fine.  And it was- it was perfect!!! 

Excellent onion soup, which I added to my collection and will forever make in lieu of my old standyby- Mom's.  (sorry Mom!)

I had never made a french onion soup before and really never liked any I had had; in fact I don't even like onions all that much. I made this for my husband a french onion soup lover. He loved it and the big suprise was that I devoured it too, carmelized onions in all!

This is my third time making a DOUBLE recipe of this. Onions in Texas are gigantic so occasionally I add a bit more red wine or chicken broth if needed. Out of necessity I use 32oz of chicken broth and 32oz of beef broth but it is purely because it’s easier. The original recipe is perfect as-is. Thank you so much for sharing!

The only change would be to add more broth, more liquid but this is not a salty broth and lacks no flavor, was just low on broth. Excellent
I just saw I missed the 48 oz of chicken broth! My bad. Great recipe

This is so excellent! My picky family loves it! I used more beef broth than chicken and it was lower in sodium. I prefer gruyere along with the mozzarella, but that is just personal preference. I used 2 sweet Walla Walla onions and 2 yellow onions. It took 50 minutes or more to caramelize the onions. I cubed up some stale sourdough bread for the top, then sprinkled on the cheese. It was heavenly! I've made this several times and will keep making it often, thanks so much for the fabulous recipe!

Delicious! This is a favorite at my house. I don’t have the right containers to broil the soup and the bread/cheese so I place the cheese bread on a foil lined tray and then add to the soup whenever I want.

I followed the recipe, using all vidalia onions, gruyere and fresh mozzarella (shredding myself), and it is outstanding.  My guests literally said, "Make this again, and again, and again".  

Thank you very much for this recipe!

when my husband & I go to our favorite bar, we order French onion soup, this recipe is just as good.  I had some caraway rye bread that I used  for the  crouton on top, it gave it a nice/different twist  other than plain bread

It gets some more umpf with a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of "all spices", also its a bit tastier with dry white wine instead of the red one ;-) I am not using red / sweet onions - only the white/yellow ones,- and lots ! Its a little pot of french heaven on your table !

The best recipe for French Onion Soup! I'll never try another recipe. I am convinced that the secret is the combination of beef and chicken broth. I have never liked vegetarian recipes I've tried, and I've never liked the ones that only have a beef broth either. Also easy to make! Just follow the directions!!

Amazing recipe!!! I made a few minor modifications: 1) I added slightly more balsamic (3 table spoons). 2) Instead of broiling the bread, I used my toaster to a slightly crunchy level. 3) I put two slices of provolone cheese and shredded Gruyere on top to cover everything. Outstanding result!

I made this recipe for a small local pub I worked for as part of their changing soup menu. I quadrupled the recipe for our patrons but did not serve it in individual crocks. We toasted fresh garlic croutons for topping and added shredded mozzarella just before serving. It was a hit and sold out fast! I will definitely be making this for family and friends in the future.

Perfect in every way! I used long buns instead of an entire loaf of French bread. It was much easier  to fit the pieces in to the bowl, cut in to while eating the soup and it gave the crust more crunch.. Broiling for 5 min set my fire alarm off. Next time I will place the bowls on the middle lower rack.

I've made this several times. The only thing I did different was to use dried spices, not fresh (fresh are hit or miss at my grocery store). It is phenomenal. Better than any I've had in restaurants. I'm making it at this moment to serve for a first course during Christmas dinner tomorrow. I think it tastes even better the second day. I just make the soup, cool it then refrigerate over night, heat on stove next day and then top with bread and cheese and broil. The overnight refrigeration helps to meld the flavors even more. If you make this I strongly urge you to follow the recipe and not alter it before you've even tried it.

Absolutely delicious!  I used provolone cheese, texas toast, and dried spices instead of what the recipe called for and the soup was fantastic.  A must-have recipe if you love French Onion soup!

Tried this recipe out. I had the soup simmer for 12 hours, after which I added more chicken stock to replace the liquid which evaporated. Tasted great.

Very good!  I used 2 big white onions and 1 sweet.  I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used dried. And I used sherry cooking wine because that's all I had. I like the addition of the balsamic vinegar. Very good!!!

I LOVE this recipe. It tastes like the french onion soup my grandma always used to make. I never add the red wine because I rarely have it on hand, but I do have to say that the balsamic addition at the very end is the weirdest, but for taste, the most important part of the recipe. Instead of using cans of broth, I use boxes of stock (one each) and the results are delicious every time.

Not sure what happened, but this was not that good to us! We have a vegetarian so I used Vegie broth in place of the beef & chicken. It might have been that, or the bread I used. Not sure, but not really interested in making again. :(

My 11 year old daughter and I made this. It definitely rivals that of nicer restaurants. We will be making this again. Our personal preference is for more broth.

Best recipe by far! I had to make a few substitutions (dried seasonings no red wine and provolone cheese), but it was still great! Definitely holding on to this one. Thanks!! 8)

It was fantastic and probably the best French onion soup I have ever had.  The onion soup can be prepared ahead of time and then reheated before adding the bread and cheese, so as to make timing more flexible.

I did not follow the recipe exactly. I do not like cooked red onion so I used all vadalia onion. That is the only change I made. I don't think it made a whole lot of difference. I just think red onion should be raw in a salad or on a sandwich (my opinion). Anyway, this soup did it for me. Love it will make it again. I used French bread and one other time croutons. Like them both.

Awesome, quick and easy.  I'm one of those cooks who uses what I have on hand.  It's Vidalia onion season so I used all Vidalia onions.  I usually use my own chicken broth, but didn't have any so I substituted 1 chicken bullion cube in 14 oz water.  I also didn't have the cheese, so I used provolone and fresh Parmesan.  Last but not least, used my favorite croutons because I didn't have the bread.  I think I will use croutons from now on; they were much easier to eat.  It was truly awesome.  Thanks for the recipe.

DELISH!  Perfect savory balance.  Cut French bread into slices just thicker than normal bread to maintain crispness in soup. Mix your favorite cheese not just mozzarella.

This was the best soup I've ever made! I added garlic powder to the onions (2T), and extra salt at the end (again, 2T). Plus I made it vegitarian with "no chicken" stock. Super fab! Cannot recommend it more!

This is VERY good.  It really wasn't hard to make at all, just time consuming.  I had to accustom my taste buds to the red wine taste at first, but oh my goodness.  I am very pleased with this dish!

I made this last night and it was really good!  I lost my other french onion soup recipe that was more basic and used only beef stock. For whatever reason I could not get the onions to caramelize. Most likely, I was being impatient!  It was still good.  I used yellow onions and only 1 red. I used a good Zinfandel for the wine and a teaspoon of dried thyme since my store did not have fresh. Topped with a slice of Swiss and Gruyere.  This paired nicely with a Caesar salad.  I will make this again.

A simple recipe that makes a delicious soup. I also experimented with making a vegetarian version using Better than Boullion's "no chicken" and "no beef" bases, and that also turned out nicely. Just prepare 6 cups (48 ounces) of chicken base and 1 3/4 cups (14 ounces) of beef according to the directions on the jar. Tastes almost like the real thing!

Mmmmmm.  We have a couple of 12oz ramekins that we served this in.  I cut the recipe down to the 1 serving size and was still able to give us each a substantial bowl of deliciousness.

Made this last night for New Years Eve dinner and we loved it. My girls really like French Onion soup and they said it's the best they've ever had. You could taste the sweetness of the sweet onions which I've never experienced at a restaurant. And it wasn't overly salty which is another plus. This one is in my recipe box for good. Thanks!

Really good! Didn't want to buy fresh seasoning since I already had the dried Parsley, Thyme, and Bay leaf in my cupboard.  Still turned out great not using the fresh seasoning. This one was true to the five star rating it has been given. That is why I have bothered to come on here and say it was great. Most of the time I am a little disappointed with the recipe, but not this one.

Holy sodium! No way would I make this without low sodium or no salt added ingredients. I used unsalted broth and butter, plus I omitted the asiago/mozzarella cheese. It is quite delicious! Some reviewers have said that the sweet onions make it too sweet but I personally liked that little sweetness. Will make the reduced sodium version again.

I made this last night and it was the best French Onion soup I've ever had. I used a thick-cut Swiss on top instead of Gruyere because I didn't know how to pronounce it at the deli. I can't imagine it tasting much better with Gruyere, though. I also just used 4 regular bulk onions and that was just fine. And I used dry thyme instead of fresh.

I made this soup tonight, on a whim, using what I had in the house....It was excellent!  I love french onion soup, and this soup was as good, if not better than any french onion soup I've had in my favorite local restaurants.  The only modifications I made were that I did not add parsley or red wine (as I didn't have any at home) and instead of using sliced bread, I used leftover homemade garlic bread from dinner last night and cubed it and toasted into croutons. I also used equal parts of chicken and beef broth as I am a fan of beef broth.  I can't imagine this made much difference as the soup was still superb!  This is the first time I have made french onion soup and will be adding this to my repertoire!  Thanks!

This soup was very good! The only problem was that the sweet onions made it a bit too sweet for me. I think it would be even better if you used 2 yellow onions or 1 yellow onion and 1 sweet onion instead of 2 sweet onions.

We made this soup and took it to a dinner party.  It was a huge hit!  Many people said it was the best french onion soup they'd ever had.  Much much better than Julia Childs' version.  The only change we made was to leave out the balsamic vinegar at the end because the soup tasted so good already and we were scared to mess it up.

I have tasted a lot of different French Onion Soups before, and this is really the perfect recipe!! 
SO DELICIOUS. I used Swiss Cheese and Mozzarella, and followed the recipe exactly.  
I wouldn't change anything about it.

This recipe is simply wonderful!  I made it with only one change, and that was reversing the beef and chicken broth mixture as I like more beef flavor.  It is very simple, I had no problem at all with the onions caramelizing, and I used the onions that were recommended as well.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!  It will be a permanent addition to my recipe box.

This was great! I adjusted for 2 servings and made a few changes: I used half as much sweet onion as suggested (it just looked like too much onion for not enough broth), I calculated the amount of broth and divided it evenly between chicken and beef, I think the recipe calls for too much chicken. I subbed cilantro for parsley, eliminated the bay leaves and paprika (don't like the taste of either), and used a shade less red wine than suggested (Yellowtail Shiraz). I don't have broiler-safe bowls, so I just added torn up toasted bread and shredded mozzarella cheese on top. My boyfriend loved it! I think some of the negative reviews might have to do with the wine used--choose a decent brand.

Although a little time-consuming, this was a keeper of a recipe.  My first ever attempt at French Onion Soup, and if I'm being honest, it was the red wine that lured me in to try this.  You can't go wrong with red wine as an ingredient, right?    It is helpful to know that a non-stick pan does not work for this, otherwise I followed the recipe without exception or substitutions and would not change a thing about it.  It was fantastic and I will be making this again in the future.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

We tried this recipe for Christmas dinner, and it was absolutely delicious! Onion soup used to be a family favorite, but our allergies have prevented us from enjoying it while dining out due to gluten, dairy, and soy allergies. I did make a few substitutions including using red cooking wine instead of red wine and omitting the parsley as I had none on hand. It was delicious nonetheless. This is most certainly going into our favorite recipe book!

I thought the person was crazy when I read it but, after making it, I actually tend to agree with another reviewer that the sweet onion was a little too sweet for this particular dish and I also feel like it called for too much liquid.  Other than that this was exceptional.

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING! I fully plan on making this again soon. I cut up sliced french bread to better fit the crock pots used. The measurements are perfect for the standard. Asiago and swiss were great. I made this as it's my mother's favorite and she even had a second helping with Gruyere! I have never been much of a fan of this kind of soup but after trying this, I think that's changed! Thank you for the recipe!

Everyone loved the soup!!  Even my finicky children.  We are a GF family so we substituted the bread with GF bagels.  Toasted them in a reg. toaster and diced them up.  Diced Swiss cheese and tossed them with the bagels and used them like croutons.  Another member was so right on ... the balsamic vinegar makes a big difference !  5 stars all the way! Thanks for the recipe.

This is absolutely the most phenomenal version of a restaurant style french onion soup I have had the pleasure of recreating. Others have been far too salty, or the cheese combinations didn't seem to fit; but this one hit the target!! Fantastic recipe, you must try this!!!

Excellent. Easy to do with a mandolin slicer for the onions. Love the bubbling cheese and crouton. When putting leftovers into containers, I didn't keep all of the onion in the soup... A LOT of onion slices are leftover in the bottom of the pot. Instead, I froze them for future use in a crock pot roast. Thanks for sharing - I will make this again!

Great French onion soup recipe!  I tried a diff recipe a few yrs ago and it turned out just "ok".  Not good enough to want to make again.  Recently found this recipe and decided to give it another try. Followed it pretty much as written, except substituted 2Tbsp of evoo for 2 of the 4Tbsps of butter. Not sure it really makes a diff at the end of the day, but I feel better about less butter. ;).  Chose the cheaper cheeses (Swiss & Mozz combo) and think they worked just fine.  Not sure if the recipe calls for too much balsamic vinegar and/or red wine though. Seemed a little over powering ... Will def cut back on both next time even though underestimated the measurements to begin with.   Will make a gain for sure!  THX for sharing!

Truly dissappointed in this recipe, after all the good reviews, I thought it woudl be great, but I guess I just prefer a much thicker full bodies french onion soup.  SO my search will continue.

This was my first attempt at French Onion soup and it came out great!  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used a tsp. of dried.  Be careful when broiling the bread.  I ruined two batches!  Unfortunately I didn't have crocks so I just used regular bowls.  I will get crocks before I make this again though because it wasn't the same just using a bowl.

This recipe is delicious! I use yellow onions and a bit more red wine. Also, I didn't use the vinegar but am sure it would have added great flavor! Full-bodied and flavored soup, will make again!

WOW!!  This is a truly awesome French onion soup recipe!  My husband and I just spent some time in Paris and we both agreed that this was better than ANYTHING we had there.  The only thing I did differently was to use bullion cubes (one beef and one chicken) in water in place of broth b/c premade broth is hard to find where I live.  I did grate some Parmesan inside the soup mix before adding the cheese on top.  Excellent!!

Excellent soup!  I used all regular onions instead of red and added 3 TBS of flour to the caramelized onions, stirring for a couple of minutes before adding the liquid.

This is soup is amazing! I sent over some mini bowls for my mother and her boyfriend to try... The verdict is that I'm making this as part of the Christmas dinner menu! I only made a few changes. I used butter-flavoured margarine, bouillon cubes with water and dried herbs (so I just added them to the broth, but did remove the bay leaf obviously). I may have used a tad too much balsamic vinegar but it didn't take away anything from the soup. I used regular toast bread, a Norwegian Swiss-style cheese and mozzarella. I think the paprika should be optional is it just adds colour, no flavour. Next time I will try to caramelize the onions more, perhaps add a bit of garlic and use crusty bread.

Not a bad recipe... I just don't think i am a huge fan of this type of soup. Other soups are more exciting and have more texture.

I was really unimpressed. My husband and I wanted a good french onion soup recipe, because we love it. I decided to go with this one based on reviews and the mass numbers, however, I would not make again. It was not terrible, but wasn't rich enough, just wasn't right.

This recipe was close to what we've been searching for! I liked the combination of Gruyere swiss and Asiago. This recipes also goes well with Mozzarella and Asiago (or Parm) instead for a milder touch.   Also, If you had trouble caramelizing the onions, you may have not cooked them long enough. It took almost 20 minutes for us to fully caramelize them.

Very good! I used a little less broth (total of 56 oz, half beef, half chicken), I used dry herbs (1sp thyme, 2tsp parsley) and just left them in.  I only used Swiss to top it off and it was still wonderful. Thanks!

I thought this was very, very good! I am giving 4 stars because I prefer it a bit beefier so I think next time I will decrease the chicken broth and increase the beef broth. We really enjoyed this though. With a glass of the wine I put in the recipe and a green salad, it was a perfect dinner.

This was fantastic! I may have had my stove down too low, but my onions took quite a bit longer to cook down. More like 45 - 50 min for me. I added a bit of garlic to the browned onions and a touch of all spice while it simmered. Seriously my new favorite. My dad even said it was better than my mom's *shhhh!!!*

Wonderful recipe! The flavor was so rich! As I am calorie conscious, I found it useful to strain some of the margarine I used off of the top of the soup right before serving and the flavor was still divine! I also used vegetable broth (made from veg boullion) and two white onions and it still worked wonderfully.  I cooked mine all day since I have acid reflux issues, and the onion turned out very soft and mild, perfect! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This soup was everything I hoped for - warm, gooey, delicious awesomeness! I followed the recipe as written, using Shiraz for the wine and 1 slice Swiss cheese per bowl (cause I'm on a diet and a budget). It absolutley tastes better than  restaurant quality...so good, I want to eat it every day!

Great flavor! Just as good as my favorite restaurant french onion soup.  I used all sweet yellow onions, one 32 oz. box low sodium chicken stock, and one 32 oz. box low sodium beef broth.  Used homemade croutons for the bread and two slices of provolone on top.  Delicious!

I've made this three times now.  The first two times I followed the recipe and it was great great great.  I don't order french onion soup at restaurants anymore because I know I can just make it at home.  The third time I took the advice of someone else's review and just threw everything in my slow cooker for 7 hours.  It was good. . . no longer great.  The onions do not caramelize like they need to.  If I were to use the slow cooker again I would definitely do the first step and caramelize the onions and THEN put everything in the slow cooker.

Jersey Tomato, you have made me a very happy girl!  I followed the recipe to a T (but had only cream balsamic so reduced it to 1/2 TBSP...next time I'll reduce it to only 1 TSP or make sure I have balsamic vinegar in the house).  This is by far the best French Onion soup I've had. Thank you so very much for sharing!!!

Jersey Tomato, this is some rockin' good French Onion soup (or Gratinee if you want to get fancy)  ;o)  I followed your directions to a T, figuring if there was anything I'd do different..  I'd do it next time.  But it turned out ~AWESOME~ without a bit of tinkering.  One word:   YUM!!  Thank you J/T ~ :o)

Perfection!  Followed recipe to the tee.  Don't think I filled ramekins high enough, next time will fill higher and add a little more cheese to make sure it's totally covered.  But soo good!!!

Finally! I've found a great french onion soup recipe! This one is just as good, if not better than any I've had in restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly and had enough for six of us. Thanks for the great recipe.

SO good!  Have wanted to make french onion soup for about 15-16 years now & have always been afraid to try!  I'm not sure what I was so afraid of...Used dried thyme as I didn't have any fresh, didn't use parsely but did stick in the half a bay leaf.  Not a big Swiss fan, but it was great!  Used Mozzarella over the Asiago.  Hubby didn't like the bread in bowl, but I'm used to this with my FO soup soggy bread is OK with me on this dish.  This receipe is a keeper for sure!

Very Good!!  I used dried parsley and thyme instead of fresh and I didn't have a bay leaf.  I also used 2 large sweet onions and no red onions.  Topped it with toasted french bread, swiss and provolone cheeses.  Delicious!!  Will definitely make again.

My husband thought this was the best homemade French Onion I ever made!!! I used all beef broth - rather then chicken.  I also only had dry spices - so I used those rather then fresh.  I added a few buillion cubes as well. Thanks for a great recipe - I am making it again today!!

This is absolutely my go-to base recipe for French Onion Soup.  With a few changes, this was easily one of the better French Onion soups I've had (short of using homemade veal stock, of course).
-I used all beef broth instead of using part chicken. This was the only completely essential change in my opinion.  It's SO much richer in flavor with the beef broth.
-I replaced half the balsamic with soy sauce; adds richness and prevents excess acidity.
-I added some sugar as needed. The need will largely depend on your broth and onions.
-And this one's for my mom.  She LOVES that "better than bullion"/"demi-glace" type stuff and I know if she were making this recipe, she would absolutely add a tablespoon full of veal demi-glace. Definitely delicious, but too expensive for me to bother with!

I made this vegetarian by using Frontier beef flavored and chicken flavored broth powder.  It turned out great!  I made my own crusty bread to top it off out of the book Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day.
I used swiss, mozzarella and parmesan cheese.

I made this French Onion soup for dinner tonight and it was really good!  I followed the recipe exactly with one minor modification; I used 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar in place of the 1 Tbsp (did this based on other reviews of strong balsamic flavour).  Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will reduce the amount of Worcestershire by half (to 1.5 tsp).

Fabulous!  I hate to rate a recipe I've changed, but the only changes I made were using herbs de provence instead of the fresh herbs, and white wine instead of red - those were what I had on hand.  I also added swiss cheese with the mozzarella on top.  It was delicious, and hubby gobbled up 3 bowls.

Made as directed except I used Sherry instead of red wine (didn't have any) and I think it made a fair bit of difference in the flavor.  Still wonderful but a tad sweet.  Omitted parsley.  Used dried thyme.  Did not add any extra salt or pepper.  Definitely restaurant quality soup.  Will make again & again.

This is the best French Onion Soup I've ever tasted.  Need to cook onions longer than 35 minutes though to get them carmelized.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly - it will be how I cook this soup from now on!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

WOW is all i can say, this soup was perfect.  I have a resturant i get this from and it is so good, but not all resturants are great.  This has now been made a staple in my house.  Yumm-o i did not toast the bread and i have no problems with fighting with the bread it breaks off nice and easy.  i am in heaven right now Thank you

A good recipe worth trying if you are willing to put in the effort.  I felt like the work that went into it far exceeded the end results (not to mention that my house smelled like onions for a couple days).  It wasn't the thick, rich soup that I'm used to getting (Outback steakhouse has really good french onion!)  I think I'll save this soup for eating out and just enjoy it then.

This soup is delicious! I am a vegan, so I used vegetable broth and left the cheese off. I also used white cooking sherry instead of red wine because that's what I had on hand, but it was fantastic. I love the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar and it didn't need any seasoning other than the tiny bit of salt and a little pepper. My father is an amazing cook, and this recipe is as good as his French onion soup.

Very good and I have eaten it in Paris where they like to come around and pour wine right into your soup. I made a vegetarin version for my daughter using vegatable broth. Just kind of have to taste as you go on that. She liked it though.

I made this exactly as directed and it turned out so well my wife wanted to ban my from entering her kitchen and showing her up. I can't stand French Onion Soup it always taste like wet cardboard covered in cheese and I always look at it on the menu and pass knowing I will be let down. This recipe however burst with flavor and is soo simple to make I honestly played video games while cooking this.

VERY GOOD.  However, I found that if the recipe is changed to serve 2 people, there is still more than plenty for 4 people (big eaters).  When we make the recipe for what it says serves 4 people, it serves 8, etc.

This was nice and simple to make, although I thought that the flavor was just a little off...maybe too much chicken soup vs beef broth?

This is the best soup ever. I follow the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I do not like onions at all......now I'm a fan. Will make it again and again.
*****Update Nov 18th**** I made it again last night for company, they loved it!!! I now crave it all the time. Easy, simple and elegant. I load the top of mine with tons of cheese.

Oh...my...gosh! I've been searching for the perfect french onion soup recipe and my search has ended. I found this just in time for winter, and I'll be making it a lot. This has everything you'd expect from a truly great french onion soup. I was skeptical about the balsamic vinegar, so I only used 1 t, but 1 T would probably be fine. Oh, and I didn't have kitchen twine so I just threw the herbs in and fished them out later. That worked fine. One quibble - I'd say it makes more like 6-8 servings.

Tried this over a year ago and agree this is the BEST homemade FOS I have tasted. My family just loved it. It really tastes like you have spent hours making it too. Great recipe.

I make a onion soup similar to this but I use mushrooms and a beef soup starter, it's like a paste, fuller flavor, and the mushrooms make it taste beefer, I also add a table spoon of sugar to my onions at the start, they carmelize better. My family loves it, it's better than outbacks, try it you'll see.

Cost efficient!  Will make again & again.  Make sure to use MSG-free broth!  (Swanson makes a good one.)

Wow! What an amazing recipe! Very easy to make and the creator was telling the truth when they said it was restaurant quality. Even my incredibly picky, hates everything with onions boyfriend loved this recipe and looked longingly into the pot for more.  I only changed one or two things: a clove of garlic crushed in with the onions, equal parts beef and chicken broth, small cubes of bread as opposed to slices, and I probably added more salt than necessary. (Warning-Definitely smart to wait to see how it tastes before adding more salt at the end with the pepper.) My oops, and it still turned out terrific. If you love French Onion, this is the recipe to try~ thanks for posting it!

WOW!  This is the first onion soup recipe that is very easy to make, didn't require hours to complete and is restaurant quality.  Soup was fuoll of flavour, delcious, not saltly and a hint of wine in the background.  I actually was able to portion out six hardy servings.

My fiance and I are both crazy about French onion soup, and we have it at restaurants as often as possible. This is the first recipe I've found that is BETTER than most restaurant French onion. I followed the directions exactly and we fought over the leftovers!

AWESOME!   My family and I loved this.  We made very minor  changes  -  mostly because we  didn't  have certain items  on hand  (fresh herbs/wine)  but this was  exactly  what we've been looking for, Restaurant-style!!  Oh,  we added  sliced portobello  mushrooms and it was really good!

This recipe has my grandma's seal of approval! French Onion soup is her absolute favorite!!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I used a comnination of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and shredded mozzarella chese instead of the swiss(what the recipe calls for). Other than that, this soup is Awesome!!

Very very good.  I only had Better Then Bullion for the beef broth and Williams Sonoma chicken base for the chicken stock- and it still was so so good.  My husband who is a mad french onion soup lover thought this was on par with the best he's had out.

Delicious! My husband is a very discerning French Onion Soup lover... me, not so much. He loved this soup and I liked it too, much better than the ones I've had in the restaurants, which always taste too beefy for me. I think next time we might cut the bread into smaller chunks, but other than that, we'll make it exactly the same.

This was a great French onion soup. I made it because it most closely resembles a recipe I used to have from friends in France, and this soup tasted very much like the soup I remember being served at their house. I used beer instead of red wine, because that was what I happened to have on hand. I also used far, far less cheese, but it was plenty. I rubbed the croutons with a clove of fresh garlic before placing them on the soup, which added some extra flavor. The portion size of this recipe is HUGE. I made half the recipe for the two of us, and still have leftovers for tomorrow. That's not a bad thing though! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Very very good!  The only change I made is that I did not have any fresh parsley or thyme leaves so I added a pinch of dry and turned out great.

Incredible!  Highly recommended--just like a restaurant.  Next time I might let the broth boil down a bit more to increase the onion:broth ratio, but otherwise, it was excellent.

Fantastic as-is!  I thought it could serve way more than 4 though...maybe by soup bowls are smaller?  After finishing this, none of us had room for the main course. Very filling!

I found this recipe to be the best French onion soup recipe ever!  I used low salt broths since most French onion soup’s seem to be salty, this one wasn’t.  The two cheeses I used were Swiss & mozzarella.  Instead of regular red wine, I used cooking red wine.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I served it with a garden salad for a light dinner and everyone was stuffed!

Excellent recipe! I’ve made it twice now. I’ve read a lot of the reviews, but not all. Only one of the other reviewers suggested caramelizing the onions in a slow cooker, and that’s what I did also. I highly recommend doing this. It takes a while (about 12 hours) but needs very little attention, just stir a couple of times. The next morning add the other ingredients right to the slow cooker. So delicious!

Yes I loved it. I used the Swiss and the Mozzarella cheeses. Next time I may try the other kinds mentioned just to see what the difference is. Also I used just the sweet onions as I did not have any red on hand.

YUUMMMM
I didn’t have fresh herbs, but I was able to steep some dried herbs in the soup as it simmered, and we don’t eat land animals so I used vegetable broth. Selection at my local store was limited, so I was able to get Swiss and Asiago cheeses. So, so, so yummy! Will save and use this recipe whenever we want French onion soup from now on!

Loved it, very flavorful and easy to make.  just be careful toasting bread in the boiler.  I put on the top shelf and set them on fire in 45 seconds.  middle shelf for batch 2 turned out perfect

This is great! The first few bites were perfect, but after a while it started tasting a little to vinegary to me. Would cut the vinegar just a bit next time. Thanks!

Great recipe.  The only change I make is to use mostly beef broth or stock and a lesser amount of chicken broth.  I also hate the mess the melted cheese makes.  Don't get me wrong, I love the drippy cheese at a restaurant when I don't have to do the dishes.!!  But at home I top the baguette  with the cheese and broil it in the oven.  I have also used Texas Toast slices that I bake and then let dry out for a few hours.  And I use whatever cheese I have-provolone, mozzarella etc.

This is the very best French onion soup you can make or buy at a restaurant!  I’ve been making this for years . It’s rich and delicious. I almost always add a bit more Worcester sauce . That’s the only change . Be patient while caramelizing onions . Takes awhile but oh my goodness worth every minute. Btw this is the only review I’ve ever made ! Make it !

This is a great French onion soup.  When I make it, though, I make it for a crowd (double recipe) and I've found that topping, broiling and serving is a frustrating bottleneck.  I solved this by "pre-topping"... I buy a good, dark, hearty rye bread and slice it.  Toast the sliced bread, top with cheese, and place on a cookie sheet.  Then I place the cookie sheet under the broiler as I dip up soup serrvings.  Then I place the broiled cheesy toast on the soup & serve.  Voila.

First time making onion soup and this is one of the best things I’ve ever made.  Just so delicious. And I made it vegetarian with vegetable and mushroom stock and no beef it was wonderful.

I used beef bouillon instead of chicken broth.  Result was a much heavier texture and bold flavor.  Better than most restaurants.

Excellent and seemingly forgiving recipe reading all the reviews. Used low sodium broths, but added a tablespoon of sherry and a bit of soy sauce and fish sauce (probably a tsp each). The flavors all blended nicely and gave it a bit more complexity.

Had it for part of a birthday dinner.   Excellent!! I doubled the recipe with no problems.  Though, I didn't use the Asiago or mozzarella cheese mix.  Our family enjoyed it.  This is a must for my recipe box!!!  This  is a keeper for sure!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Just what I have been looking for in an onion soup.  I have made it several times and sometimes substitute Sherry for Red Wine.  Very tasty both ways.

Followed the recipe to a T. It was very good but missing that depth of flavor that you get from a restaurant. I used regular red cooking wine and a mix of Asiago, gruyere, and provolone cheese. Definitely worth making again.

This recipe is absolutely perfect as is, in my opinion.  Delicious every time.  Like other reviewers, we use croutons instead of bread just because they have a little seasoning, which is nice, and also easier to eat.

I followed this recipe as-is but had no red wine so I used cooking sherry.   The flavor of this was amazing!  I read through the reviews and made sure to cook the onions a bit longer and they were melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I served this as a first course and it made 10 servings when using 4" ramekins.  I would definitely make it again and have it as a meal with a big salad.  A perfect Fall and winter warm-up soup!

Sooo yummy! 
Of course I had to alter it a bit.  I added potatoes & carrots to make it a bit more filling.  Lets hope it freezes well, as Im trying to stock up on freezer grab & go lunch meals.

Fantastic French onion soup recipe. The only tweaks I made were about one more tablespoon of butter and upped the ratio of beeth broth to chicken broth. so yummy.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as is. It was good. I had to tweak it the second time. I like olive oil instead of the butter. The wine has to be DRY. I am going to try white one of these days to see what happens. Beef consommé is a WAAY better option. And fontina cheese is another good choice.

This recipe did not disappoint - just got back from a 2-week vacation in France and had 4 different onion soups while there - all four were outstanding- this is better! My family is going nuts eating it!

I substituted the wine for a splash of Kitchen Bouquet, the fresh parsley with celery leaves, and the cheeses for Munster and Colby Jack because it's what I had on hand, but otherwise pretty much kept it the same. Tasted exactly like the restaurant's! I was really surprised how well it turned out.

This was excellent! I only changed the broth ratio, using 2 cans of chicken and 2 cans of beef.  And my bread wouldn't fit a whole slice in the bowls I was using so I just cut the bread into small cubes and toasted it that way and put it in top.  Other than that I made as written.  Sooo good!

Wow, I didn’t change a thing.  It was absolutely amazing; my husband and I loved from first to last spoonful.   Only mistake I made was to use shredded gruyere cheese.  It was what I had on hand and, since it was shredded, I used too much.  It was a pain slicing the required number of onions, but I peeled and froze for 20 minutes, and that did cut down on tears.  I froze what was left into individual portions in freezer baggies and we are looking forward to “leftovers”.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is by far the best French Onion soup I have ever made. My wife even said it was the best she has ever consumed. Only difference was that I only used chicken broth and left over kidney bean water  from yesterday instead of the beef broth. As well, I only used half the onion called for because I was going to make less for just the two of us. That being said, I used one liter chicken broth, instead of the 1.4 liters called for. With these changes I still got 4 servings and had some left over. I do plan to use this recipe again and it will be added to my favourites list to be made again.

You fry the onions and throw them in the broth then boil them.

MAKE IT!!!!! I used one slice provalone and one slice Swiss on each bowl instead, but this recipe is amazing! Go with the low sodium chicken broth if you don’t like your soup too salty, I did and it was perfect to us! I went with regular beef broth. I highly recommend this easy, delicious recipe!!!

Really easy and tasty.  I'd never made French Onion Soup before but my hubby had a craving.  He went to the store and bought plain swiss instead of gruyere, because he's cheap.  : )  That's the only thing I'd change about it.  Yummy and cooked in about the time the recipe indicated.

I combined this recipe and one from a ‘soup’ cookbook.   I added a few cloves of minced garlic to the onions after 10 minutes of onions cooking.   Sugar and salt with thyme instead of just salt.  Caramelizing the onions- the higher the heat the more constantly it needs stirred. I used med-med high high heat. Once they were brown/caramelized, I added 2T Flour and stirred it, in and cooked briefly, and then added the liquids.   I also used croutons instead of toasted bread. And always used shredded gruyere cheese!  Yum!

I never made onion soup before and thought I would give it a shot. At first I only used white onions but then thought it looked like it needed more so I fried red onions and added them. I was reluctant to add more than 1/2 tbsp of balsamic as it tastes fabulous right now but may decide to do so once we are closer to eating it. Making this is easy; frying the onions is time consuming but I used a no stick pan and salted them and they carmelized within 15 minutes. I did not add all cheeses as it just seemed like overkill and unhealthy so used only gruyere. Used garlic bagel chips for the bread as was recommended by a friend.  A lovely soup for a cold winter night. I would recommend this one.

I have maybe five different French Onion "Soup" recipes I use, but now I can toss them all and keep this one. Perfect as it is! I like to experiment, and will try alternate cheeses, but then...Don't mess with perfection.

I know my F.O. Soup, and this recipe is really good. I used Chianti (the kind you would drink- never cook with wine you wouldn't drink!). I didn't have parsley, so I left it out, and didn't top with paprika.  I used Gruyere and mozzarella to top it. I also flipped the amount of beef broth with the amount of chicken broth, just because of availability. Let the onions SLOWLY cook for the full 35-45 minutes (I add a pinch of white sugar to help with the caramelization. Delish!

This was fantastic!  I used slice provolone and grated mozzarella to top the soup and both worked just fine.  This will be a regular menu item at our house from now on!

I think this might be my first review on this site - but I just had to do it.  This recipe is amazing.  For those of you that want restaurant quality French onion soup - this is it!  I did make some subtle changes:

- I cooked the onions for about an hour - which is needed to get that nice, syrupy consistency
- I used Sherry instead of red wine.
- per the suggestions from another comment, I used a Lipton tea bag (emptied it) to place my thyme, parsley and bay leaf - so much easier to remove.
- I switched the beef/chicken broth ratio so that it was more beef than chicken.  In fact, next time, I may do all beef broth.  I just love a hearty beef flavor.

Other than that, this recipe was spot on - if not superior - to any restaurant version!

I made this  in slow cooker.  And used bones from Christmas Prime rib -(3 ribs , bay leaf, carrot and celery) which I put directly into cooker after carving most meat away and covered w/about 50 oz. water, raw sliced onions, and remainder of ingredients substituting any salt w/ 4 beef bouillon cubes. Cooked for about 12 hours on low. Then pulled out bones, bay leaf, carrot, celery.  Season to taste.

I substituted my homemade turkey broth for chicken broth and it came out wonderful.  I will make it again perhaps substituting dry sherry for red wine.  This is a great recipie!

It turned out really well. My family loved it. The only thing I did differently was that I rubbed a garlic clove on the toasted bread after it came out of the oven before topping the soup.

Wife just made this because I’ve been bugging her to make French Onion. First off, tastes nothing like the other French Onion Soups I’ve had. This was the most “yuk” of all. No flavor other than butter and greasy from. The  in an envelope from Lipton is better than this and that is only good for dip or adding flavor to other dishes. I would have given this a negative rating if possible. -37 to be precise. Would not recommend this recipe to anyone.. 17 thumbs down.

I have to report that this was the most delicious and foolproof French onion soup I've made in years of family tradition. I did a quick saute of the onions just to soften them. Then put them into a sous vide bath at 190 for about 20 hours, add the ingredients together and simmer, and WOW, raves all around. Only thing I would change is make it with half beef and half chicken stock, and I used dried spices. Sure, I would SV the cat if it would hold still long enough, but the time and effort and wondering about carmelizing onions the old fashioned way is all gone, while I slept. That is the contribution of SV into my cooking.  DELICIOUS!

I have not tasted this yet but every time I make a keeper dish my puppy goes crazy when she smells the odors.  This dish has her running all over the house...except for the kitchen which I keep her out of.  But she is pacing and my neighbors are asking me what is that wonderful smell.  OMG I love it already!

It is YUMMM!!  It is critical to mention the use of the wine or sherry (that is what I used) to DEGLAZE the pot after the onions are done caramelizing.  This is important to preserve all of the yummy flavor bits that have browned at the bottom of the pot.  I also caramelized a little longer and slower to get extra flavor.  I doubled down on the bouquet garni herbs and added one extra onion and two extra cans of broth to make a larger batch.  I let my broth simmer with the lid off for 20 minutes to condense the flavors at the end.

Excellent!  I reduced the serving size to three and used more beef broth (stock) from a carton than chicken broth. Cooked onions a little less time as they were browning too much. For the toast, I used ciabatta bread that had to be used up. I sliced it, drizzled each side with garlic-infused olive oil and sprinkled with salt and garlic powder. Baked at 400degF for 5-6 min (browned too much when cooked longer). For the cheese, I used gruyere, a little grated parmesan and Swiss. The broth is rich and beefy. Comfort food at its best on a cold fall night. Thanks for the recipe!

So good!   I wouldn't want to have this by itself though.  We also made "good cheese" grilled cheese sandwiches to serve with it and it was so delicious.  Dipped our sandwiches into the french onion soup and had a great autumn feast.

Caramelized my onions in the Instant Pot using butter, salt, pepper and a bit of baking soda. Sauté onions in butter, add the rest and stir for 5 minutes. High pressure for 20 minutes quick release. Sauté for 10 minutes more and done.

I made this a little “wrong” I forgot to add the Daly until later and I thought I had balsamic vinegar and didn’t and we don’t drink so I have no wine. It still was SO DELICIOUS! Tonight I’m making it “right” grape juice instead of wine though. So we’ll see! I’m excited!

I really enjoyed this Recipe a lot! I didn't like how soggy the bread got, but the cheese and soup was amazing. I could eat this all the time!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would! Holy is it ever good! I couldnt find fresh herbs (Sunday of Canadian Thanksgiving!) so I used dry herbs in a loose tea infuser and it worked wonderfully! I was also skeptical about the amount of onions but trust the recipe!

This was delicious! We made the recipe as directed, and it’s as good or even better than French Onion from a restaurant!
* Recipe states 4 servings… we used standard oven soup crocks and have leftovers for 4 + more servings. (My soup crocks =  1.5 cups of soup,  leaving room for a chunk of toasted bread.) * Using both red and white onions, rather than all white does make a difference in flavor. * We have also tried adapting, to cook onions and broth in the Instant Pot (before adding cheese and broiling; we’re  not monsters!)... It worked, BUT onions didn’t get to the carmelized stage, so we lost that flavor. I think we’ll go back to using the directions as written. It’s worth the extra time standing at the stove and stirring!

I made this recipe exactly as described and only have 2 real changes/suggestions. First, i would change the directions about cooking the onions to say ABOUT 35 minutes. Mine were  carmelized and almost soupy at around 28-30 minutes. While I know all stove tops differ, saying an exact amount could lead to burning/ overcooking.  Second is the same issue but with the bread and broiler. Same thing,  ABOUT 5 minutes... mine was done in 1 minute or so on each side. Other than that it was delicious. I used merlot as my red wine but that's a personal choice.

I love this soup!  Note for next time though....  I used bouillon cubes and I didn't look at the fl oz of broth I needed.  It translates to 62 fl oz and four chicken and one beef packet.

The broth came out amazing and it was overall very tasty.
I switched up the cheese a little. I had Swiss, mozzarella and a bit of Applewood smoked cheddar for kick. 
Delicious. 10/10 would eat again.

This is my husband and my favorite soup and we get it whenever we go out so I was apprehensive to make it assuming there’s no way to make it as good as some of our favorite restaurants.  NOT the case!!  This is amazing and we couldn’t believe how much we loved it. Now he’s asking for it all the time!  Thank you for sharing!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a bit too sweet.  Next time I’m going to try using regular yellow onions, more beef stock and a touch of cayenne.  Definitely enjoyed it but not the best I’ve ever had.  Might also cut the balsamic in half.  Will need to play with it for awhile but a great starting place...

This was a good recipe. I have made French Onion soup many times before so I think I had an advantage regarding caramelizing the onions. I did not use red onions so I also omitted the vinegar. It was still very good. 

It did smell strongly of wine while cooking. I ended up bringing it to a boil to burn off some of the alcohol and added more broth to counteract. But, after the oven it was delicious! Just took a little tweaking.

I did find this very good and yes I would use this as a base. I did find it lacking in depth and richness. I will try this recipe again, perhaps it was something I did wrong. Thank you for sharing.

Followed the Recipe exactly.  I may have left it on the stove a little long, but it was absolutely amazing!  I would use a different bowl next time as the slices of cheese did not hang over the sides, but all in all, it was great!

Taste wonderful!  Where’s the soup?  Mostly onions in a little broth.  I’ll make again, but certainly will triple the broth if not quadruple.

I made this today. My husband orders onion soup at Panera all the time and he thought this was better. The only thing I changed was that I used 1/4 tsp of dried thyme because I didn’t have any fresh. It was delicious. I’ll be making it again and again.

Was perfect! I subbed in 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1/4 ground thyme since it was what I had on hand. Looking forward to trying this on guests in the future.

Excellent, very happy with results.  Looking for tips on freezing leftovers?  Freeze soup first then put toasted bread & cheese on top?  Will give this a shot...

This was really great but I had to add a fair amount of salt. I used beef stock which, I don’t think, was very salty, hence adding more. My only advice, taste as you go along. *****

Just made this for dinner, following the ingredients exactly. I did modify the instructions for use in my Instant Pot.  My very well mannered DH kept unconsciously saying yum as he ate.  He also keeps repeatedly saying he can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow  Great recipe!

Turned out delicious! I can’t eat gluten so I didn’t have the bread with it. I followed the recipe to a tee except added a tsp of sugar along with the salt to the onions to help them caramelize as another reviewer said to do. I Cooked it in a Dutch oven and the onions took about 35 mins just like the recipe says. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Exceptional flavor. I have made a few other versions of French Onion Soup and was frankly surprised in my taste test. This recipe is fabulous! 
I weighed my onions at about 2 1/2 pounds of red onions and 2 1/2 pounds of yellow onions before slicing. I made as directed but cooked my onions a least an hour. When the sides start to brown/caramelize I use a little water to speed this up. A tablespoon at a time and only in the area that is browning...maybe a total of 1/2 cup water.  At the end I used 1/4 cup sherry to deglaze.
Made the recipe other than this as written. 
I did freeze my leftovers in portions...obviously, before the bread and cheese. Freezes great!
Try this recipe. You won't be dissapointed.

My family loved it!   I made it vegetarian by using mushroom stock (sorry to all you, Onion soup  purists) ... vegetarian here.   It still turned out very hearty and flavourful just the same.

Delicious! It seemed like way too many onions at first but it was perfect. Patience is definitely needed on the carmalizing. I sprinkeled a little bit of sugar to help them along at the end. So worth It. The only changes made is I used dried parsley because it is what I had one hand and I made croutons out of a baguette. Also used equal amount of chicken/beef broth.

This is absolutely delicious! I usually don’t rate recipes but this one is excellent, restaurant quality! - Just a suggestion, when adding the bread, buy a baguette and slice and put in toaster then put in soup and add the cheese and broil. Thanks for sharing, it’s a keeper!

I thought this was extremely good and VERY easy to make!  I wish I had soup cups that could withstand the broiler because I think the browned cheese on top would've made it even better.

I will absolutely make this again. It came out great!  The only things I did a little different where: using 1 red, 1 sweet, and 2 yellow onions; and used a little more of the herbs in the bundle including a couple cloves of garlic (and for some reason it took my onions longer to carmelize, i think it was because they were too crowded in the pot I used) Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was amazing, very flavorful.

I've made this soup over and over again. I always add about three tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and use dry herbs in a loose tea infuser. Other than that I follow the recipe

I was in process of making home made French bread to go with this when the soup was done before the bread and we ate the soup without the bread.  Oh my gosh, it was still amazing without the bread and cheese in it!!!!

First rainy fall day of the season and soup is the perfect meal for it.  This is a wonderful soup!  Made it as written but didn't have red wine at hand so substituted 3 tbs of good sherry (is used in some fo soup recipes).  My husband said he would give it 5 stars if it was a little beefier and a little less thyme, but he's very finicky.  A rich, flavorful broth and would be a good "company" course or stand alone meal.

This is amazing! I would double (or maybe even triple) the beef and chicken stock..or water it down. Very strong flavor. Also, maybe a half TB of balsamic vinegar. Besides these few tweaks I would highly recommend! Will be making again.

Good recipe - just used low sodium broth to help reduce the salt.  Tip: remember to put the bread in the bowls BEFORE putting the cheese to broil .   Though it was well appreciated by all.

I didn't have red wine, so I substituted more beef broth in its place. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Here's my feedback - caramelizing the onions took MUCH longer than the estimated time. This was my first time caramelizing onions, so I didn't realize that my big pot wasn't ideal for caramelizing that quantity of onions (also, they should be cooked over med-low). Next time, I'll either split the amount between 2 frying pans or cook them overnight in the crock pot (per the Pioneer Woman's suggestion). The flavor was great but my well-toasted french bread soaked up most of the soup in my bowl before I even took a bite, so I had to add more soup from the pot.  Maybe it's a sin, but next time I'll serve the bread on the side and put the cheese directly on the soup. (Don't tell anyone.)

I have never made French onion soup. This was very easy and slime to make. I would have given five stars, but I was not a fan of the balsamic vinegar. Next time I will not add that.

SO good!!! This recipe got me more compliments than any other dish I've ever made. The hard work pays off. A beginners tip: Don't let the obscene amount of onions scare you, the sheer volume decreases a lot once the onions are caramelized. If you find your eyes watering too much when chopping, Light a match and put it in your teeth every few minutes. The sulfur combats the onion juice. I also do not recommend using Swiss and mozz, it is more than worth the extra couple bucks to get the gruyere and asiago. Dig in!!!!

Made this tonight and loved it. I used white wine instead of red as I prefer the flavour components better, and while the soup turned out paler than you'd expect, it certainly didn't fall short in flavour. The Worcestershire sauce is a nice tangy touch I've never come across before in an onion soup recipe. Simple recipe with big flavours - everyone can have onion soup

Ridiculously delicious! Have made this multiple times and it is by far our favorite. Just follow the recipe! We used swiss and asiago. We don't have oven safe soup bowls so we use the dutch oven to cook and broil, scoop out what we want and refrigerate leftovers. The bread held up well overnight and we can enjoy the following day. 5 stars!

Love the recipe as it provides a great foundation. I had to be creative as I was missing some of the basics in the recipe, ie the broths. So I used a package of onion soup mix cooked and added to the caramelized onions. For the cheese toppings I used a couple of slices of racketeering cheese and added a bit of grated Parmesan to the asiago. Tasted great! Will definitely make it again, next time with the right broths"

Probably would not use as much wine and vinegar next time, it had a sweeter flavor i didn't want as much. I think i'll do majority beef broth too.

This has to be the best spin on French onion soup Ive ever made. I used to take the easy way out by using a home made french onion soup recipe then would add some beef consume along with a can of campbells french onion soup to boost the flavor. I will say this recipe was a little tedious but well worth it.

You seriously can't go back to the restaurant for French onion soup. This recipe is a keeper. Three teens give 2 thumbs up.

This soup is excellent. It did end up taking about an hour to carmelize the onions though. I followed the ingredients and directions as stated, except I only had the parsley. I also ended adding 2 more cups of beef stock just to stretch it a little more for our big family. Yum!!

Incredibly good.  I used a pressure cooker to caramelize the onions.  So easy, and faster!  Do a google search:  pressure cooker caramelize onions, it is first one to come up.  I don't like wine, so I just left it out . This soup is fantastic!  

Feed it to my sis-in-law, she is so picky, SHE LOVED IT.  

I am in trouble now, she will be asking for it all the time!

It did not indicate at what point you added the onions...could someone clarify? I finally added them after the stock had simmered for 20 mins. But I believe it should have been sooner in order for the onions to absorb the broth and, ergo, the taste. Please let me know if I'm correct? Otherwise I will make sure the onions are thinly sliced and skip the red onions. Sweet onions or regular are sufficient.

Like some others I did not caramelize the onions first just placed them and the butter in the crock pot, Did not have any low sodium beef broth so I just left out the salt, Used cream Sherry and  followed the recipe otherwise. This Was as good as or better then some of the better restaurants that I have had French Onion soup.

Very nice recipe with authentic taste from what I would expect in a restaurant. I was a bit short on onions so I added one shallot. Well worth the patience required to cook the onions as per the recipe. Substituted swiss and a bit of sharp American for the Gruyere as it was not on hand.

I substituted Provolone for the Mozzarella and added 1/4 cup more red wine. This soup was even better after 1 day in the refrigerator.  I served this soup with fresh sourdough crusty rolls and a bottle of 2009 Bordeaux. A fantastic way to spend a cold wet winter day in front of the fireplace. I will make this one again.

This is epic. Everyone loves it. I don't usually have the fresh herbs so I'll use dried herbs. I also use 4 different types of onion.

I have never written a review after 10 years on this site.  I made this exactly as written and it was fabulous!  Served with a caesar salad and some garlic bread and it was the perfect sized meal - even for my husband who is a big eater.  Better than at a restaurant!  Thank for sharing with us.

Mine turned out a little sweet, which was odd for a French Onion soup. It may have been the choice of wine. I used Menage A Trois Red, which is a little sweet. Also  we could taste the balsamic vinegar.

Great recipe!  I was a little sceptical about using chicken stock in French onion soup, but it was great.  I used provolone cheese instead of Swiss and grated parmesan cheese on top of it.

Family loved this. It was robust in flavor I made own twists where I could, like with the wine I used a sweet wet wine flavor that I drink  that I had around the house instead of what the recipe called for and I used more beef stock than chicken because I  didn't write down my grocery list the right way but I liked it better.  Plus, to make the soup go a bit further the next for dinner, I used some of the soup in my turkey burgers, but because of the stock and making these for the first time they were very juicy but whill make it more like meatloaf and add breadcrumbs to hold it together, but overall very good flavor for a meat that can be very dry. I will DEF make again!!!

This recipe is AMAZING! If you want a rich, restaurant style french onion soup, this is for you! Made for Christmas Eve dinner for two and ate every drop of the leftovers. The only thing I changed was to use swiss cheese only and we were lazy and didn't toast the bread. It was still perfect.

My family loved this to start our Xmas dinner!  We didn't have enough oven-safe bowls to broil the cheese and bread but I managed to do it sort of family style in a few small backing dishes and that actually worked great.  I think we'll be doing it next year!

The only changes I made was adding maybe another cup or two of water, I used buillion cubes, and I didn't have fresh thyme so I used about half a teaspoon of dried thyme. 

My fiance brags about making the best French onion soup ever back in his day and he really liked this. I loooove French onion soup and order it whenever we go to the keg and this was very very comparable. I had 3 bowls hehehe. It was very delicious. 

And you can either use croutons or you could totally just cube up some regular bread in your pantry. I did and it was fine. 

I did find though, that 4 large onions would have  been too much for the amount of broth the recipe says to put in. I used 2 large onions and a small to medium sized one and it ended up being a bit too much for the ratio of broth but that's OK cuz I love onions :) excellent recipe. Thank you!

Delicious! I wanted to make this vegetarian friendly so I skipped the Worcestershire sauce and used a combination of vegetable and mushroom better-than-bouillon and it was still fantastic.

WOW, simply WOW! I made a pot of this soup tonight and it blew my mind!  It was as if I was actually IN France eating it! I used a good dry sherry since I had no red wine in the house, 2 huge Spanish onions, dried herbs (the parsley and thyme, 1/4 tsp each),  a pinch of garlic powder, swapped the broths - using more beef stock and less chicken (low sodium), and a tsp of Gravy Master to the broths = adds a darker "beefy" color and some depth to the soup. I used my enameled cast iron Dutch oven to caramelize the onions, in 2 T of clarified butter (Trader Joes Ghee) and 2 T EVOO.  It took about an hour for the onions to get to that perfect state, stirring every 5 minutes at first, then 2 to 3 towards the end. Don't leave out the fond - those delicious browned bits that accumulate in the bottom of the pan during the caramelization process. To loosen the fond, pour a little wine, sherry, or beef broth in the pan after the carmelizing and scrape up the bits with a wooden spoon. I also sprinkled about 1/2 tsp of flour (Wondra) onto the onions and cooked for 2 minutes before I added the broths. This slightly thickened the soup, but not by very much. I added 1 tsp of honey-infused balsamic vinegar even though I did not use red onions, and it actually stepped it up another notch. 10 stars for this super soup !!!!

I used all beef broth instead of beef/chicken.  

For my topping, I used gruyere and swiss, with a light dusting of parmesan and paprika.

Best onion soup ever!

I love French Onion Soup.  My husband never liked it and wouldn't eat it.  We've been married for 24 years and he wouldn't budge.  Now he is addicted to this recipe for French Onion soup.  This is by far the best recipe for this soup I have ever tried.  The only two changes I made was to add 48 oz of both Beef and Chicken broth and I don't add any additional salt or pepper at the end, it doesn't need it.  I add additional broth because I love the flavor of the soup and I like to have a little extra because some cooks off.  Thank you Jersey Tomato!

Part of this was my fault -- I did not have wine so used Sherry; added a different flavor.  I did not care of the red onions, so next time I would stick to just yellow onions.  I added sliced mushrooms (Bella) and that added a good texture.  But it was easy to make and I made it recovering from the flu -- eased my throat. Thank you!

Use about half the butter. For a more subtle and sophisticated version, replace the red wine (it's too much anyway) with 1/4 c. sherry. Sweet onions make the soup a little too sweet - stick with yellow onions - about 4 lbs. Omit the Worcestershire and paprika; use salt, pepper, thyme and a bay leaf. A chemical in red onions tends to turn the soup gray & cloudy, corrected by the addition of balsamic vinegar.

This soup was fantastic. One change I made was I used 3 lbs of onions which consisted of 1 large yellow onion and 3 medium sized sweet onions. I also sautéed the onions in one stick of butter in a non stick oven proof pan for 1 hour on 400. I stirred them every 15 to 20 minutes. Then I transferred them to my stock pot, added the salt and finished them for 5 more minutes on a medium heat. This caramelized them. Then, I added the 1/2 cup of red wine and cooked them for another 3 to 5 minutes to cook out the alcohol. After that I followed the rest of the directions. Restaurant quality for sure. I will make this my go to soup recipe. Flavors were spot on!! Thank you!!

YUM! Truly the perfect blend of flavors.  I used sourdough bread and let it sit overnight, after toasting to make it crouton-like.  I also let the soup cook longer--uncovered--to allow it to thicken.

Thanks, Jersey Tomato!

Use packaged caesar croutons instead of french bread. They are easier to eat rather than trying to cut through the bread with a spoon. Plus you can get a more even coating of toasted goodness which allows for the cheese to go where you want it.

This soup is soooo good!  I have been looking forever for a french onion soup recipe that used beef and chicken broth.
It reminds me of the soup at one of our favorite restaurants and I will be keeping this one for my "go to" onion soup recipe.

Excellent! This is definitely a restaurant quality recipe. I made as written except that I used more beef stock (my own made from roasted beef bones and aromatic vegetables) and an extra red onion. I will make this again and again!

Fabulous soup, super easy to make. I use any kind of onion I have on stock, only ever used mozzarella cheese, and not picky about the bread...we like it toasted before it goes into the oven.

I just had a question. I don't cook using alcohol, is there something I could substitute for the wine? Thank you for your help!

I have made this recipe quite a few times and it's always a hit. The broth is very rich as a French onion soup should be, no lacking flavor with this one. The only thing I change is I use croutons instead of a slice of bread. It's just easier for my kids to eat. My compliments to the author of this recipe.

This soup was absolutely delicious! I did not make any changes to the recipe. I've made crockpot French Onion soup in the past and I thought that was good until I had this. I will definitely be making this again.

One of my favorites. I substitute chicken broth with beef broth in addition to what's asked for and I put 4 beef bouillon cubes in as well. Been trying to mix some corn starch in some of the beef broth before adding to thicken it a little more.

This came out perfect for me. I made no changes to the recipe. It needed no salt at the end. It is a rich soup worthy of a meal rathe than a starter.

Turned out great! Except next time I will used half low sodium broth and double the entire recipe because of the onions. You have to constantly keep stirring the pot or the onion will stick to the pot and burn. But wonderful recipe and I will defiantly be making it again

This a wonderful recipe for French Onion Soup. My hubby and I prepared this one together (we made no changes to the recipe). It turned out wonderfully and we were both very impressed. This one is definitely a keeper! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Perfect. Made it with all beef stock because that's what I had already but interested to try with the chicken stock. Will certainly make again. Makes more like 6 servings, but not complaining.

I substituted the dry herbs because I didn't have fresh. I used cooking sherry as well. I also used smaller twin baguettes which I added 2 toasted pieces to each bowl. Oh so good!!

This was so good! Better than I've had in restaurants.
I did use an artisan bread, I think croutons would be easier, I'll try that next time! But such an easy base recipe!!!!

everyone loved it. 
I made a few changes. 
Double the butter.
No canned soups. So I mixed 1 pkg turkey gravy, 2+/- tsp consomme powder and 10 cups water. 
Melted the cheese straight into bowls and served with sliced baguette. 
I realized at the table that I forgot to add the wine. But everyone still loved it. Next time I would add the wine, but if I don't have, I wouldn't go nuts.

I made this for a lunch party and it was a huge hit. I only made a couple of minor changes. At the beginning, on the melted butter, I added the salt as directed plus a half a tea spoon of sugar to help caramelizing the onions . I also used 2 cups of the wine (just my taste). It was so good people wouldn't believe I made it. 5 stars!!!!

Going to make this again and again. Quick and simple. I used dry herbs and no bay leaf.  Took 30 min plus to cook onions.  When they started coming apart I added other ingredients.  Because we like the Worcestershire sauce, I added 3 Tbsp more. 
Cheese for us was mozzarella as it's what I had on hand.  Very good recipe and will make again.  Using both chicken and beef broth was excellent.

Even my husband who doesn't usually like soups tried some of my daughter's bowl and then went and got a full bowl for himself! I'm gluten-free so had to make it without the bread and it was still phenomenal. I also added about a cup of chopped mushrooms, and used white wine and dry herbs because that's all I had on hand. All the delicious flavor of restaurant-quality soup but without the overload of sodium!

This soup was fantastic! I doubled the wine and vinegar, but my balsamic was really thick and sweet. I agree with the poster, THIS is the soup you WISH restaurants would serve.  I'll be keeping this recipe in my rotation.

Delicious!  I used Swiss cheese instead of Gruyere, just for cost cutting.  Best soup I've made!  I didn't use the red wine, just a spot of sherry and I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 chicken broth.   Really tasty soup.  Husband and daughter loved it.

This is a fantastic recipe! I've been making this for 4 years now. Instead of red wine I use red wine vinegar. I added a bit more of all the liquids until I got the taste I wanted and I used the spice thyme instead of fresh!  Also took the idea of the croutons instead of bread! Highly recommend this recipe.

Amazingly good soup! I actually forgot to add the vinegar but the soup still turned out delicious and the color was right on as well. Excellent recipe!

This is a good recipe. I did add a full cup of wine, a tablespoon more of  vinegar and 2 tablespoons of sugar. It was perfect for me .... :)

I followed the recipe to the T and it was fabulous! I will absolutely make it again. It's perfect for a casual dinner at home yet still elegant enough for entertaining. I highly recommend giving this one a try.

I'd never had French onion soup (I always thought it would be too oniony), so I can't say how this recipe compares to others, but I  loved it. Like others, I broke my bread into pieces before broiling the soup; other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is a keeper!

Perfect for a snowy day.  It doesn't take long at all and the entire family felt they were at a 5 star restaurant.  I don't use many fresh herbs so I substituted them for dry.  1/2 tsp of parsley flakes and about 1/8 tsp ground thyme.

Awesome!  I just made the soup portion and skipped the bread and cheese topping, but the recipe is excellent.  We will try the full recipe at some point, but the soup is incredible on it's own.  My wife loved the recipe and encouraged me to make it a regular part of our diet.

Good recipe,had to make just minor changes to accommodate what was in my pantry. Used half and half amounts of chicken and beef broth and tasted great.  I didn't have any bay leaves or fresh thyme.  I added about a 1/4 tsp of ground thyme instead.  My onions took a lot longer to cook down but I did keep them on a lower heat out of fear of scorching them and making them bitter.  They were so sweet and delicious. This will be my go to for french onion soup.

This was my first time making French onion soup, highly apprehensive that it would not turn out as well as I wanted it to. Not only was I pleasantly surprised, my girlfriend raved about the taste! I've worked at many restaurants which serve this soup, and this was by far, my favorite recipe. I will make it over and over again. Instead of using sweet onions, I used yellow and simply added a tablespoon of sugar. Simply delicious and easy to make!

This was my first attempt at making homemade French Onion Soup and it was outstanding!.  I used low sodium broths, and still added the full amount of salt to the onions while cooking.  I hesitantly added the red wine, since my husband doesn't care for the taste of wine in cooking, but once I added the balsamic vinegar, the whole recipe transformed.  It was magnificent!  Instead of whole slice of bread I used cubes, so easier to eat, but it tasted soooooo good!  Can't wait to make it for company!

I made this according to the recipe with the exception of the onions. I was trying to get rid of a large bag of Vidalia onions that needed to be used. And... they were perfect! Sweet and hearty is what this recipe calls for. This is pretty much my go-to recipe for French Onion soup.

I thought it would be harder to make French onion soup at home... now I know better. The only beginner tip is that carmelizing really does take time. Loved this recipe!

Most times when making something for the first time, I follow the recipe exactly as written, and rate on those results, then adjust it to my own taste if/when I make it again. Unless I know how and what to adjust to my own taste preferences from the start. This recipe did not disappoint, and I'd make it again exactly as written and still be pleased with the results. I liked it so much, I made it again the following day because my family ate all of it the first day. However, the second day I adjusted to my taste. I just used the regular yellow onions that are cheapest in the grocery store. Then equal amounts beef and chicken broth, but I highly suggest using both broths, it taste so much better than just beef. Then I left out the parsley, and used white pepper instead of black pepper, only because I like that it's less gritty. And the final change is to the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Although the end product with them was still wonderful, I think one or both of them makes it a little to *something* that I could do without. I'm probably going to leave out the vinegar this time, and maybe both next time. I also use whatever cheese/bread combination I have on hand. It hasn't made that much of a difference to me when I use the exact cheese/breads suggested.

I followed almost  the exact instructions and it was really, really good!  Only change was 32 fl oz of chicken broth and beef broth because that was how they portion it at the store (I was lazy) and I toasted slices of sourdough bread but then cut them into bite sizes before adding on top of soup and adding cheese before broiling.  I can't wait to serve this on Christmas Eve (today was a practice run).

My is this good! Sadly, I try to stay away from bread (it's a carb thang) so I didn't add it. I also used Mozzarella (it's a calorie thang) instead of the cheese called for.  Still, this was delish. And healthy too. Thanks!

I tried this for the first time tonight. Overall it was a decent soup, but I'll be making changes for next time. My family and I felt it was too sweet and acidic. Next time I will use yellow onions only and no vinegar.

My hubs called this soup "beautiful." And he is a super finicky eater. We didn't have Worstershire (spelling is off, sorry) sauce so I splashed a little soy sauce in. Tasted great, did not need any more salt than that used at the beginning of the recipe. We will eat this again.

This a great recipe, I did make a few changes because I didn't have red onions so I used yellow, and sweet, I caramelized them in bacon fat not butter. I also used only beef broth and 1/3 cup of red wine, and I added a sprig of fresh rosemary to the herb bundle.  I always rip the bread up into small pieces so it is a lot easier to eat. I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used provolone and the asiago cheese. Before you add any salt try your soup first I didn't need to add any extra salt. While I did change the recipe a bit the base recipe is a very good one, everyone loved the soup there was no left overs. I will definitely make this again, thanks so much for posting it.

Delicious! I took me over an hour to Carmelite the onions. I did add 2 T of Sherry, as I prefer the flavor. Used 2 T of red wine vinegar instead of balsamic as that's what I had. Also, used 32 oz of boxed beef broth and and supplemented with cubed biullion in liquid  to make total liquid. Discriminating and picky hubby said "that's really good"

This was good, and I will definitely try it again. I think the next time, though, I will reverse the chicken and beef broth amounts. In fact, I think I might go stock instead of broth. The taste wasn't as full as I had hoped.

My sister loves French Onion soup, so to lure her out to my house for a visit I made it and it has become a family favorite. We like it with a lot of onions so I double it up. Great recipe, thank you!

This soup is awesome.  I used dried spices (it's all I had) and no wine as I didn't have any of that either.  I'm sure it would be great with the wine, I'll try it that way next time.   Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this soup for my family tonight and they absolutely loved it! Compliments from the very first spoonful.  I adjusted the serving size to 5, which called for 3 red onions and 3 sweet onions, but I cut it down to 2 of each and it was plenty per bowl.  I typically don't like a large bowl full of onions when ordering it in the restaurant. I didn't add additional salt at the end, as I used both provolone and asiago cheese to melt over top, and knew that too would add enough salt.  The flavor of the soup was absolutely incredible! I will definitely be saving this recipe to make again!!

Best french onion soup ever. I used dry herbs instead of fresh, and the store didn't have asiago so I had to skip that. I forgot to add the paprika at the end, but it turned out great. Can't wait to try it with the asiago, fresh herbs and not forgetting the paprika! I cooked the onions for an hour, nice and caramelized and super melty. I made it the day before serving so the flavors could meld further. I re-heated the soup before adding the toast and cheese on top and popping into the broiler.  A BIG HIT!

I simmered my soup in a slow cooker all day and it really made the flavor come out.  I used Cabernet Sauvignon for my wine. Lacy Swiss and mozzarella cheese.  I used equal amounts of chicken broth and beef broth as they came in 32oz containers.

A pretty solid recipe for French Onion soup. The onions take a while to caramelize (close to an hour) You can't rush this! I don't think it tastes like traditional restaurant soup but it is delicious. I added some Sherry vinegar in addition to the balsamic.

I made this on the fly, and it was amazing! I didn't have all of the ingredients but it still turned out awesome. My 2yr old daughter asked for more and drank her bowl clean! I will make this again and be a little more prepared- I can only imagine how truly good it must be!

AMAZING. The only thing I did differently was to caramelize the onions very slowly, for about 75 minutes, as I had the time. Rich, deep flavors. I also cut the bread into smaller pieces before toasting. Makes it a little easier to eat. 
Still amazing - just sometimes now I caramelize the onions the day before. It helps to get rid of the 'aroma' of the raw/cooking onions, esp if you are having people over.

I've made this wonderful onion soup many times.  I use Cabernet/Shiraz red wine; it gives it a deep rich flavor. I also make my own beef broth using beef shank; I cook it until the meat is falling apart done.  We like the little bits of beef in our onion soup. Other than making my own broth, I follow the recipe.  It's a yummy excellent recipe; thank you Jersey Tomato!  Rose

This hit the spot!  I did not have the red wine available and it still turned out great.  This did make a soup that contained more onions than found in most restaurant soups so I may scale back by about an onion or so next round (depending on the size of onions available at the store).  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This recipe is fabulous. Thanks so much! I have just recently tried French Onion Soup and can't believe it took me over 30 years to try it, so I wanted a good recipe to make at home. My onions took about 45 minutes to cook and caramelize. I followed all directions and measurements except for one. I am allergic to molasses which is in Worcestershire sauce, so instead, I substituted 2 tsp of "Better Than Bouilon" beef soup base in place of the Worcestershire sauce. It worked great as a substitute. I also used an organic Balsamic Vinegar which is a lot purer. No caramel coloring or added nitrites. I am not a wine person so I was a little clueless as far as that goes. I used a Charles Shaw Cabernet Sauvignon. This recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely the best French onion soup I have had yet!!!! I pretty much followed the recipe exact except the following: added more broth, used cooking sherry instead of red wine, and only used sweet onions instead of red onions, omitting the balsamic vinegar.  I used sliced Swiss and asiago; so much flavor and delicious!!! This will be my go- to recipe from now on. Thank you for submitting.

This soup is delicious! Seriously the best French onion soup I've ever had. The flavor was rich and well-rounded. I used 4 very large yellow onions, fresh herbs and a good dry red wine. I didn't have enough chicken broth on hand, so I used 48oz of beef broth and 14oz chicken broth. It needed no additional salt or pepper.

Tripled the recipe!! Used half yellow half Vidalia onion- (no sugar needed). Otherwise followed it to a T and it was GREAT. Beats Panera by far (although it does take longer to make and is time consuming))

Instead of using the sweet onions, I used regular brown onions - the first time I tried it, it was too sweet for my taste.  Second try was much better with just the brown onions.  Will definitely make again!

Wonderful soup.  Didnt change a thing.  I have made it four times now and just make sure you cook the onions until they are very done.  Once I made it without herbs and once with chicken stock only and it was still excellent!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner at his request. He's always loved French onion soup and I'd never made it before. We both thought it was incredible. I read the recipe wrong when purchasing the ingredients and thought I needed equal amounts of chicken and beef broth, so that's what I ended up using when making the soup; however, it didn't seem to affect anything.

I tried this since I had most everything to make it except for the bread... However, tomorrow is Thanksgiving and I happened to have a bag of Petridge Farm Country Style Stuffing... What a cheat, but I used it!!  That's right.  It was already seasoned nicely so I topped the soup with it and added a couple of slices of swiss cheese and and handful of diced mozzarella atop of that.  Put it under the broiler for about 10 minutes... it bubbled and browned and it tasted awesome.  The flavors of the seasoned stuffing really worked.

French Onion Soup is one of my boyfriend's favorite things to order at restaurants. I thought I would give this recipe a try- and he absolutely loved it.
I had a substantial amount of broth left over after preparing four bowls. It only took about 2 1/2 minutes to properly melt the cheese before serving. Comfort food at it's best- an absolute keeper!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now. 
This time I cubed my baguette and melted butter,  mixed the butter with a little parsley,  thyme and bay leaf.  Then brushed the cubes with the butter mixture,  toasted them for 1 min and repeated twice more.  
Used this finished cubed bread to top the soup, melted the cheese and Yum!

I had never tried making French Onion Soup before, and I was surprised I pulled it off on the first try! I specifically waited for my husband to be out of town so I could test it before making it for him. I will definitely keep this recipe around!! :D

My husband and I love to cook.  Neither of us as ever attempted French onion soup before, but love it.  We chose this recipe because of all the rave reviews.  It is AWESOME!  We did make some changes though (we just can't leave anything alone!)  We used a full stick of butter with the onions because we couldn't get them to caramelize with only 4 Tbsp.  We used 20 oz of beef consomme and the rest beef broth because we like a beefier flavor.  We put garlic in most everything, so added two cloves of garlic, minced.  My local grocery was out of fresh thyme AND parsley, so we had to skip the parsley and used dried thyme leaves.  Of course, at the end I forgot to add the balsamic vinegar before broiling the soup, but it didn't hurt it.  Next time we will have to compare and see if it changes the flavor.  We tried the Gruyere cheese with 2 cups and swiss with the other 2 cups.  we used shredded mozzarella.  The Gruyere was much better!  We will be making this again soon, and sharing it with family!

This is so good I had to post a review. I did use 1/4 cup sherry and 1/4 red wine, that is the only change I made.  The balsamic at the end concerned me, don't forget it though, added another in depth flavor.
Fantastic!

While this was very good, I think I prefer a richer beef stock instead of the chicken. I would also let it reduce a little more...the broth was very thin. Otherwise, the proportions were right on and it tasted good.

Excellent. Took a little longer than stated but well worth the wait. Had swiss, mozz., and asigo cheeses. Three red onions and only one sweet onion. Will make again. Very filling

Delicious! I'd been using my own variation of a recipe from pampered chef for years.  This put a twist on that. This came out so well. I only used salt, pepper and parsley (dried) to taste. I made it yesterday and had it today. I think having it sit overnight heightened the flavor. Can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

I've made this recipe many times and it is perfect.  I've changed many things along the way according to what I have at the time. Different onions, wine, broth combinations and it doesn't matter it always come out fabulous.  However, I never sway from the salt in the onion or the vinegar at the end, they're a must! Thank you for posting :)

Apparently I'm getting to the party about 8 years late, but add me to the list of cooks that loves this recipe.
My fiancee recently was glowing over a bowl of French Onion Gratinee at an expensive restaurant, and I wanted to surprise her with a comparable bowl. Bottom line--she loved this soup over the restaurant dish.
I used all beef broth--lo sodium, and added no more salt than that required to caramelize the onions. Too, I'm not a big fan of red onion except on my bagel, so I used sweet yellow onions exclusively. The Asiago cheese on top of the Ementhaler was scrumptious and the broth was very hearty. We ate by candle light and the slurping was soooo romantic. Thanks for the best onion soup I've ever had!

This soup is FANTASTIC!!  Both my husband and I are huge French onion soup fans and both agreed a local restaurant was the best we had ever had. Until now that is. This recipe is every bit as good as our "old best" we had ever had. Have made 3 times and will make it again and again. Thanks so much Jersey Tomato for this recipe.

It definitely did not hit the spot for me.  Even using the vinegar, my soup was murky looking. I also don't think I liked it with red onions.  Also, I prefer my cheese to be provolone.

I added a little more beef broth than the recipe called and instead of just soaking the herbs and spices, I just added them to the mixture.

This is an excellent recipe.  The only bad is it takes so long for a soup.  But if you are prepping other things it is a great one.  It meets my carb and protein all in one dish and man it is filling!  Even my kids who arentsoupfan liked it.

Yes, a definite crowd pleaser! I made this for Christmas Eve last year and everyone loved it. A few months later, I tried experimenting with another recipe to see if we could improve. It was a resounding "no."  I am just getting ready for this year's Christmas Eve dinner and believe me, I'm sticking with this one!

Great recipe... only went with all beef broth and added more wine and worchester.  Nice flavor, went with dried basil and parsely but fresh thyme.  Use swiss and shredded moz on top.  Can't wait to try leftovers tomorrow when the flavors marry overnight.  Thanks.

Deliciously balanced, full flavored, and hearty.

I swished a cup of broth around the sate'e pan and added it to the broth as well.  I used bouillon instead of fresh broth.

Serve with salad on a lazy Sunday.  Perfect.

Good as written except the balsamic flavor was a bit too pronounced at the end. I rather like the flavor but my husband does not and neither did my guests. Next time I would use less, perhaps half a tablespoon. Also, way too much time under the broiler as written. Keep an eye on your toast and later your soup crocks.

All I tasted was the red wine and balsamic vinegar.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and even simmered it longer hoping to cook out that odd wine flavor.  I think I like the recipes with all beef broth better as well.

Now I know why there are over 700 reviews of this recipe. This soup is fabulous! I ate almost a 1/4th of the soup right out of the cooking pot after it was done. I am going to use home made French Baggette bread, Swiss cheese and mozzarella cheese this evening when we have it for supper. Next time I will use the better cheeses. It is too bad I couldn't give it more stars.

I followed the recipe and it was really lacks flavor to me. My husband didn't like it at all. Disappointed to say the least because FOS is my favorite soup. It just really pales in comparison to the ones I've had before. :(

This was very very good.  Did not change a thing, except did both gruyere and swiss.  It's even tasty without the bread and cheese. I will be saving this and making it many more times.

This is an amazing soup! I only had yellow onions and I used Texas Toast croutons and cheddar because that is what I had on hand, but I will definitely make this again and again - I cant wait to try it following the recipe as stated.

So simple and almost decadently rich even with only the swiss cheese instead of gruyere.

This recipe has a lot of sodium so I modified by using unsalted butter and low sodium/no sodium broths.  This recipe is great the way it is and I love French Onion soup.

My husband, girls and a guest loved this!!!  I added leeks to the onions and I only had mozerella cheese, so just used that, but the substitution worked out great.  Fun lunch for guests.  Also, I made the soup as directed early with the exception of adding the vinegar, and left it in the crock pot for a few hours so I just had to do the last step when people were ready for lunch.  Great recipe!

Absolutely amazing. French onion soup is one of those fabulous dishes that you can add just about any flavor combination to, and you can't ruin it. Perfect for a rainy or cold day!

I made this using veggie broths instead of meat broths (we are vegetarian) and it was delicious! We didn't even have any leftovers.

I'v only just finished making this soup for the first time, its supposed to be for a dinner tomorrow night and OMG its delicious!! It took longer than it says but I wasnt in a rush so maybe did everything slower and simmered it longer. Having never made FO soup before I researched alot (new bf to impress), found this one had heaps of great reviews so gave it a go. Hope it heats well tomorrow, if not will keep it as an on the night dish - absolutely love it!!

I've made this recipe several times using the exact ingredients.  The last time I made it, I was doing several things at once and forgot about the soup and it cooked down more than it should have.  I didn't have any extra chicken or beef broth, so I used a can of vegetable broth.  That batch was by far, the best batch of French Onion soup I made.  My husband had been pestering me to make that soup again!  That's how I know a recipe is awesome!  The key was the vegetable broth!  I also kept the herbs in the soup while storing it in the refrigerator or freezer.

OMG OMG OMG.  This is as good as some of the restaurants I've gone to, and better than most!  We double the recipe, then freeze in serving sizes for us.  All we do we defrost, heat it, and then do bread and cheese on top!  Delish!!!!

Excellent recipe!  Since I don't eat beef products, I used chicken stock instead.  I also did not have sweet and red onions and used regular yellow onions.   Despite the substitutions, it was fabulous, and will stay in my recipe box for a long time.

Loved it, then modified it according to what I had on hand.  Used all yellow onions, and all turkey stock that I had just made and needed to use. Also I used sherry- personal preference for this soup. Will make again and double for the hubsters ton take to work. Baddabing delicious.

really wonderful soup!  I made this with a slight variation, did not have parsley and think I omitted the paprika.  How ever this was so good and made plenty.  We had left overs a few nights later and it was still fabulous.  I'm making it again tonight.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of using croutons instead of bread as noted by other reviewers. Big mistake! At least for me. The flavor of the croutons altered the taste of the soup and the texture was horrible. Without the croutons it would have been perfect. Excellent soup!

Absolutely love this recipe.   Have made it about a dozen times now and it's always a hit.  I switch out different onions and always just a little more red wine and always let it simmer just a little longer.

This is the best french onion soup Recipe I've found, yet. In fact, it's so good, I think I'll just stop searching for the "holy grail". I made it to spec, adding baby swiss and shredded parmigiana on top. I will make this many times over. Thank You!

I lost this recipe and so happy to have found it again.  Much better than restaurant FO soups.  I have been very disappointed that some ofour local bistros (people say they are great) do not live up to the hype.  The the ingredients, wine and gruyere cheese are the key to this soup.

Every restaurant that has FO soup I try and am always disappointed b/c I know I can make it so much better using this recipe! I usually use less red wine 1. because I'd rather drink it and 2. I want the onion flavor to be more prominent. The double cheese on top is also an awesome extra touch. This recipe stays good for a week in the fridge so make extra! This is how FO soup is meant to be done.

Perfect! I had to use no salt beef broth only because I'm on a sodium reduced diet, but with all the flavors from the other spices absolutely wonderful! Thank you!

I halved the recipe.  There was not nearly enough broth for my liking.  I think next time I would double the broth called for.  The broth was all soaked up by the toasted bread I put on top.  Also, the broth was too sweet.

This is just about the best French Onion soup we've ever had.  We have had the soup in many restaurants over the years but this takes the prize.  We ate nothing but soup the night I fixed it.  Great for a main dish as well as appetizer.

This was my first time making French Onion Soup, and it was great! I used Sherry rather than red wine, and added more beef broth than chicken. It was pretty good; and it is important to sautee the onions for the whole 35 minutes. I used the BIG slice of swiss cheese. The soup was a hit, it made plenty, and I'll be making it again!

This soup is the best of the best!!!!  I made it exactly like the recipe states and it was WONDERFUL.  I recently had French Onion Soup in Paris, but there is no comparison.  I think the secret is taking time, about an hour, to carmelize the onions and a really good red wine in the soup.......and to drink with the soup!!!!

Best recipe we've found! Tastes just like a restaurant's...maybe even better. I made a few adaptations, just because I didn't have everything I needed on hand.  Used 48 oz. of beef broth and 14 oz. of chicken. Didn't have the fresh parsley, thyme, or bay leaf...so I subbed a pre-made french onion soup packet for the flavors. Only had mozzarella so that's all we used. TASTED GREAT even with these substitutions. Will DEFINITELY be using this as our french onion soup recipe from now on!

Fixed this recipe for Christmas Eve and it was a HUGE hit.  Without qualification one of the best if not the best French Onion Soups I've ever had and this was echoed by family members that are very picky eaters.  Followed the directions with one excption and that was the Gruyere cheese. Being a transplant patient I have to stay away from non pasteurized cheese of which Gruyere is one of those. The lady at Harris Teeter who works the cheese speciality section found a to die for substitution, AFON CLEDDAU (spelled as it appears on the label).  It is a EXTRA MATURED WELSH CHEDDAR. Everything else remaind the same. If you have to use pasteurized cheese this is the one, trust me.  If you're looking for that WOW factor, this is THE French Onion 
Soup to fix.

OH MY!!! this soup is delicious. I am a big fan of French Onion soup and order it often when we eat out. I wanted to make it a long time ago, but never gave it a try, being afraid it would come out a disaster. I am so glad I did. After having all the ingredients for over a week since I bought them I decided to come up with PLAN B for dinner (just in case). But it was perfect. It is super delicious, and even though it takes a while to make it, the cooking process itself is super easy! It tastes just like the restaurant's. My husband and I both loved it. I will make it again, and again, and again. Thank you, Jersey Tomato!!!

I had high hopes for this, but it was a disapointing recipe. I found it too sweet and much more bland than I expected. It was lacking that salty, fuller-bodied beef flavor that I prefer in my french onion soup. If I tried this again I would probably swap the amounts of the chicken and beef broth (or nix the chicken broth altogether), add more worcestershire, and stay away from so much sweet onion; but as-is this is not a keeper.

It's a lot of work but so, so worth it. Do not skimp on the caramelization process--it completely changes the flavor. My mom loves this soup and always asks me to make it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my family yesterday afternoon, and loved it. It was easy, fun and quick to make.  It is even better the second day.  I did not have beef or chicken broth, so used bullion cubes which made it too salty, but still good.  Next time I will make the broth myself and am sure it will be even better.

I've made it the posted way but have also made it "lighter" by using olive oil instead of butter. Both taste great but the olive oil version is lighter in color, taste, and body. Considering how many servings of this soup I consume when I make it, I prefer to make the olive oil version. I have also added minced garlic (about 1 -2 cloves) after removing the bouquet garnis. Yum.

Added 1 teaspoon brown sugar to the onions before starting to cook them down, and deglazed the pot with 1/4 cup good quality sherry and the red wine before adding the stock. Have had nothing but rave reviews from friends and family.

We live in Turkey, so we had to make a few substitutions, but it still worked great! A creative inspiration if you don't have cooking twine:  I was glancing around my kitchen and a half-used teabag caught my eye. Use a teabag string. It worked perfectly. I also broiled the whole thing in an oven-safe pot because we didn't have any oven-safe bowls that were the right size/shape. The presentation wasn't as impressive, but it still tasted great. I followed the recipe to a tee, and would likely do so next time.

I made this recipe tonight. I had to improvise since I only had red onions, but even my picky husband had two bowls and couldn't say enough about how great this was. I will make sure that the next time I have red and vidalia onions...I can hardly wait to make it again. Thank you so much for this recipe...it's a keeper with me!!!

I typically am too busy to review a recipe I find, but this one was worth a quick note.  It is SUPER easy to make, and it is DELICIOUS.  I made it just as the recipe called for, and I couldn't have been happier with the result, as were all my dining partners.  Thanks for a great, warm, quick dish.

This was excellent!  But I didn't have any broiler safe bowls, so I just melted the cheese on 450 degree oven for around 10 minutes.

This was excellent again, this time I didn't have beef broth, so I used chicken broth and vegetable broth.  It was great!  Plus I didn't have fresh herbs, so I took a mixture of dried herbs and put them in a tea bag (that I opened from a tea bag I had in the cabinet) and threw that in!  It worked!

I have made this soup so many times. It is by far, my favourite!!! I only leave out the red wine but it's still consistently amazing.  My husband is always telling me that it's better than any restaurant-made french onion soup. We no longer order it if we are out.  Best recipe out there!

Ok, seriously amazing. I have never posted a review before now. This soup was so incredibly tasty and flavorful. I went by the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Reheated leftover soup the next day and I think it might have even been a smidge better reheated, if that's possible! This recipe now has a permanent spot in my recipe box.

This recipe is just GREAT!  I have try different recipe but this one is just perfect to enjoy.  I am impress and will adjust next time.  I think that onions for "LARGE" may need specific measure because its lot onions, I woud like taste broth too.  I will try 2 LARGE onions for next time.  I think I am going to make for rest fall season.

I use the corton from Texas Road bag that can found at Wal Mart, but depend on your location.  Again, it just not long cook as I remember my mom made that take forever for her to cook.  This one is just jiffy to cook.

The only thing I change is not fresh herb but dried herb.  I use ONE Table of thyme leaves and  TWO Table of parsley. Also paprika in mix with vinegar.  

Thank you for share recipe!

Followed recipe as written.  Onions didn't really get carmelized, but it was outstanding anyways.  Better than any FO soup I've ever eaten.
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

There's nothing like a room full of people who suddenly get silent when they sink their mouth buds into this soup and the room gets silent!  It is probably the best recipe I found on this site.  Worthy of ten stars.  No tweaking.  Just use the best products available and serve in individual heated bowls.  Thank you for sharing!

absolutely the easiest and most delicious recipe for French Onion soup. Guaranteed to be a party favorite. Helps that my garden provided the thyme and parsley, but really really it was so so so great. Was very easy to follow and my guests were really impressed

Delicious and makes the house smell heavenly.  Allowed the onions to carmelize all afternoon over low heat.  Made a couple changes due to what I had on hand...4 yellow onions, omitted bay and parsley, added several sprigs of fresh thyme, soy sauce instead of balsamic.  Wonderful fall comfort food.

Simple and fast. I used all chicken stock and it came out great. We also used multigrain bread and light cheese to cut the calories down. Delicious.

I had tried an failed to make french onion soup before with a different recipe so I was a little nervous about trying again... but it was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, which isn't something that I am always good at, accept I used boullion instead of broth for the chicken and beef. My husband loved it!

I loved this soup and made it per the recipe except I doubled it for a eight course dinner for eight.  I failed with this recipe.    I was plagued by some the same problems others have commented on.  I cooked the onions for 2+ hours without getting them to caramalize.  The end product DID turn cloudy and grey, unappealing even if it did taste heavenly.  The leftovers tell the story.  Only two bowls were cleaned out, and more than half the soup was still in the crock.  I should have noticed how many ounces of liquid was going into the original recipe and realized that was more than enough for eight.  Lastly, this was the most involved recipe in my dinner party, (part of the fun of this dinner party was all the recipes were untried).  I would make this as a main course next time, not as a soup.

This takes some time to prepare but is an impressive combination of flavors.  I used 3 vidalia + 1 red onion and swiss cheese with a sprinkle of mozzerella on top.  Yum!

My family really enjoys this recipe.  The only complaint I have is that there are too many onions and not enough broth if you follow the recipe exactly as written.

This was a great FOS. I substituted 1/2 the butter with olive oil, and omitted the bread crouton to make it a little more lowfat. Topped it with grated swiss.. A great winters eve light supper!

I have a few questions and I couldn't find an option to email the recipe author.  1.  Does it matter if I use fresh parsley and thyme?  And should I use Italian Parsley or just the regular kind?  2.  re: Red Wine, should I get a merlot, cab etc?  I would expect the type of wine would affect the flavor of the soup.  (or am I just over thinking things)  Thanks so much!

This is one of the best onion soup recipes I've found.  I used maui onions that gave it an amazing flavor and did increase the amount of onions and my husband loved it.

I used provolone just because I don't care for Gruyere or Swiss, but it was still fabulous.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Very good. Not as "beefy" as I would like, my husband called it "to oniony". However, I used the leftovers as a marinade for London broil and it was fantastic!!!

Fabulous.  I live in Louisiana, so the food here is extraordinary. This recipe fits right into the quality of cuisine here.  I'd be proud to serve it at a dinner party or gathering.

Not bad, but not quite the taste I was hoping for.  My husband liked it, but I think I made too much of it.  Any ideas for smaller portions - without feeling unproductive?

We've had French Onion Soup in some of the best restaurants in the world.  This is the best we've ever had.  I made it exactly as described.  I usually alter recipes, but this one is the exception.  FANTASTIC!!!

My husband had been dying for me to make FO soup forever.  The only tedious part is the onions, but once you are past that, it is a piece of cake. I too used more beef broth instead of chicken. Also, when you cook the onions, don't burn them, it causes them to have a very bitter taste, be patient :). Awesome, awesome recipe!

By far superior to the recipe I was using before.  My wife has been begging me to make it at least twice a week since.  The only suggestion I have is that you take at least an hour to carmalize the onions (definitely use vidalias too-they sweeten the soup).  It brings out the flavor so much more.  Also, spend the money to get a really good gruyere...it makes a big difference.

I've been searching for this recipe since I had started trying to make this soup at home.  This is absolutely the best tasting french onion soup I've had so far.  Any sample taken when the wife and I go out to eat will now be compared to this one.  Thanks!

I didn't care for the flavor of the broth in this recipe.  I love French onios soup and thought this would be perfect, but wasn't impressed.  I think it was the fact that there was so much more chicken broth than beef that I didn't like.  I will stick to my old recipe, but thanks for the recipe, anyways.

The soup was absolutely fabulous. I followed the recipe with 2 changes. I caramelized my onions with butter and worcestershire sauce and used dried spices rather than fresh. I omitted the salt in the end of the recipe because I felt that the soup was just right. An the end result was a huge hit in my house. My kids who hate onions even ate the soup. My husband raved about how good it was all night and even the next day. I will definitely make again.

I've used this recipe for years now- and it continues to be my favorite recipe for French Onion Soup. I prefer this over a restaurant's soup as well. But I should add that I've always left out the wine, used dried herbs, and most of the time just used plain yellow onions (even though I have used the types the recipe calls for- tastes great either way). Soups are usually quite forgiving- just adjust to taste.

Absolutely fantastic.

We don't have cans of stock so I used 2 beef cubes and 4 chicken cubes combined with 3,600 ml of water.

I always adjust recipes but trust me... just make this as is first!

The taste was off to me. I did not care for the addition of the wine. I usually use sherry and think I will stick with that for the future.

WOW! Followed recipe to a TEE (except for the thyme-just forgot to buy it) Serve this to guests..and they will consider you a GOURMET COOK!!! AND..I didn't even use the pricey cheese..just used mozz. and swiss - SOOOO GOOD!!!! 

***AGAIN: Follow recipe exactly - don't be afraid of adding "that" balsamic vinegar (which I certainly was)- all the ingredients just work!! YUM!

Excellent.  I added a bit more wine and next time I'd probably use 1 less onion as I found it to be more like a stew consistancy rather tham soup by the time the bread soaked up alot of the broth.

I made this soup for the first time for my husband and I last night (01/01/08) because we love French Onion soup, it is awesome!  This recipe truly lives up to it's description and I plan to share it with all my family and friends.

This was a very good recipe.  I actually tried it for a family event that we were having.  Although I did not add quite so many onions (I couldn't quit crying and had to stop cutting)it was received very well.  Yummy!!!

This was very good.  Better than any french onion soup I've ever had.  I only had fresh parsley so used only that.  Also, I used a mixture of swiss cheese and mozzarella.  It was good with the swiss but next time I will try the asiago cheese or maybe provolone.  I don't think I'd make with the swiss again.   Excellent.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow.  I messed up and it still was amazing.  I was SO tired and had no business even cooking, so I added 1/2 RED WINE VINEGAR instead of red wine...you know what it was a tad tart but SO GOOD!!  It was fun assembling and presenting.  Resturaunt style.  Easy, cheap, filling and delicious.  Thanks so much!

The soup was very good but a little too sweet for my liking.  I will try it again and maybe use only one sweet onion.

Amazing recipe!  I was craving french onion soup and had never made it before.  All I had was yellow onions and dried herbs, but this soup was UNBELIEVABLE!  Great recipe!  This one is a keeper.

I've made this soup twice since finding it two weeks ago and loved it both times. I've varied the ingredients a little depending on what I have (type of onions, cooking wine, beef bullion) and it still comes out great. I even save what is left over and reheat it the next day....its still wonderful. I've been looking for this recipe a long time. Excellent!!!

Takes a long time to make this soup, but it ended up tasting really delicious.  The only thing that ruined it for me was the balsamic vinegar, so I recommended decreasing the amount as much as possible.

Overall it was pretty good. Be sure to cut the bread to shape of the bowl so it fits right over the top of the soup and add lots of cheese on top.

The freaking best!  I used Swiss, Provolone & Motz, b/c it is what I had and it was soooo cheesy & so good.  The only thing I will do different is break the break up before putting it in the soup.  I did not like the big hunk of bread that was hard to cut w/ a spoon, but that is a minor change.  The soup was excellent!!!!

This was my first ever attempt at making French Onion soup.  I've only eaten FO soup at places like Panera Bread, so I don't exactly know what an "authentic" FO soup tastes like.

This soup is, however, quite good.  My husband also really liked it and he is rather picky.  

I was a little afraid that I had too many onions after I finished chopping.  Red and Vidalia onions are rather large as it is, and I purchased some of the smallest ones that my grocery store had.  They cooked down nicely, though, and it looked like the right amount once the broth was added.  I did not add any salt at the end, but I probably would the next time in order to offset the strong balsamic flavor.  The only comment I have is that the flavor is a little "balsamicy."

Just like from the restaurants! This was fabulous and so easy to make! I used aged swiss instead of gruyere, because it is a bit cheaper and the audience was better suited with it. I also doubled the mozzarella, because I can. ;)

I thought overall that this recipe was great, although I personally will decrease (or eliminate) the worcestershire sauce when I try it again. It had too strong of a presence in the flavor for my personal taste.

This recipe does make more than 4 servings. I don't know if it was the recipe, or the cartons of beef & chicken stock that I used (Emeril's), but it was just good. I am spoiled though, the best French onion soup is found in France! However, I would try this recipe again and try a different beef/chicken broth.

I tried this recipe on my In-laws and my husband. Everyone loved it. It was easy and delicious. I did use the gruyere and asiago cheses, which made it more expensive.I think if you used swiss and mozzerella it would be delicious also.

I really loved this recipe.  The only thing I'll do differently next time will to be to save some of the onions to add part-way through the cooking time, since I'd like to have some al dente pieces.

I made this recipe because I couldn't find my mother's old recipe, but this was an outstanding substitute!  Everyone raved, and I couldn't have been happier with the results.  Try this recipe first, you'll have no need to look further.

very, VERY good, and my kids loved it too!  I didn't have oven safe bowls so we just put the bread and cheese in the bowl at the end (which melted nicely) and it was still delicious, and easier for the kids to eat.  YUMMMY!  A new favorite! Thanks!

The absolute best I have ever had.  I did not want to open a bottle of red wine so I used the advice of another and mixed 1/2 cup grape juice with 1 tsp red wine vinegar.  THE BEST !!!!!!!!

this was excellent!  just a tad too sweet, next time I'll use more red onion and less sweet onion and add more worst sauce!

I love this soup, even though I hate onions!  Because I'm not an onion lover, I only used one of each onion, and it still turned out great.

Excellent. I used two red onions, one white onion and one sweet onion. Didn't have fresh parsley or fresh thyme, so I used the jarred stuff, and I don't think that hurt it at all. I let it simmer all day in the crock pot on "low".  We loved it. Good recipe.

I served this on New Year's Eve to our gourmet dinner club---it got rave reviews.  I tripled the recipe and it made way to much!  I followed the recipe exactly and I really loved serving it to this group.

I found this recipe last night and just made it.  (I am eating a bowl as I type this review!)  This is by far the BEST French Onion Soup recipe I have tried yet!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  (I used a combo of Asiago and Mozarella cheese - a delicious choice!)

This was wonderful. Great flavor and very easy to make. Girlfriend LOVED it and rated it as a 10+++! Will make again soon since it's winter time. 
Does anyone know what to do with the leftovers? Can you freeze this soup? Only 2 of us eating it and we had plenty left over.

***** PLUS a few more stars!!  EXCELLENT recipe, better than I have had in any Restaurant.  Did not alter the soup recipe at all.  Perfect and my guest devoured the entire pot!!  I didn't even use bread on the top, just sprinkled some shredded swiss cheese and it was amazing!

Wow, I am currently making the soup.  It smells, looks, and tastes fantastic!!  And that's without the bread and cheese on.  I can't wait to serve to my husband.  Thanks.
