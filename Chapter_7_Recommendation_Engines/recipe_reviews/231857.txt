Due to availability, I omitted the chives and shallot, added shrimp and peas with the first round of adding broth and subbed blue cheese for gorgonzola. Adding a milder cheese won't work, you need the oomph of a stinky blue or gorgonzola. And even then, I think adding salt would be advised, which I didn't do. This needs to cook at least 20 minutes, it took about 26 for the rice to absorb the liquid. Lastly, I subbed red wine for white but if you're wanting a presentation, definitely use white. And salt!

This is a wonderful recipe! Very flavorful with the roasted garlic & Gorgonzola cheese. I used a pinot grigio for the wine.
This will compliment both chicken or seafood.

Recipe was easy to make. I've never had blue cheese before so it was a new experience for me but as far as introductions go it was pretty good. It is a very rich food and it sits a bit heavy on your stomach. I wouldn't recommend this as a main dish, seems it would work better as a side dish.

This would be five stars if the liquid amount was correct.  I needed much more liquid to get the rice softened, and I've made risotto numerous times so my temps were correct.  I just added more vegetable stock (instead of chicken) until softened.  I also added double the cheese and used a 6 cheese Italian blend because we are not a Gorgonzola family, and I omitted the white wine (used stock instead) due to an allergy and a recovering alcoholic in the family.  Very tasty and very easy, just time consuming as risotto should be.
