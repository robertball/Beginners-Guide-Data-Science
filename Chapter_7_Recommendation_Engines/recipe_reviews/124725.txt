Wow, wow, wow, wow... Did I say WOW?! I made these for the daughter of a family I nanny for who will barely eat veggies. This sounded like the perfect way to sneak some in. After making 12 muffins, I had enough to fill a small ramekin and make a giant muffin that I thought about keeping for myself. After one bite, I wanted nothing more than to take the other 12 home myself! Only changes: I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1/4 c applesauce, and 1/4 c veg oil. The only thing I didn't do that I'll do next time is peel the zucchini before shredding, therefore making the zucchini completely invisible. Overall, this is the best muffin recipe on this site!

These muffins are delicious!! I took some of the other suggestions. I doubled the chocolate chips and added a shredded, peeled apple with the zucchini. I did not have mini choc. chips, but regular worked just fine. For added fibre, I used half whole wheat flour. I only added half the oil - still very moist! I don't like nuts in muffins, so left them out. I doubled the recipe and it made 18 large muffins. Note: the batter is VERY thick, but once the zucchini is added, is perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loves these muffins.  I make them often.  The last time I made them, I grated 2 apples and added them to the batter.  The muffins came out incredibly moist and sweet.  My son loved them so much he insisted that I post it.

This is a fantastic way to use up zucchini.  I make mini-muffins, as opposed to full-sized, and my kids (and husband) eat them up!  

My changes: a dash of nutmeg, dash of ginger, dash of cloves.  A 4oz cup of applesauce with a splash of oil to complete the 1/2 cup and brown sugar instead of white.

These were great, however I did make a few changes. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil--it's what I had on hand. I also used the regular sized chocolate chips--not mini, and used 1/2 cup of them. These are great--especially warm or reheated in the microwave.

I have made this recipe several time now.  My daughter, who will eat nothing green, asks for these muffins!  She even grates the zucchini to go into them.  I have made them with all the oil and half oil and hald applesauce -- both are great, can't really tell a difference.

So easy and SO delicious! I did what other reviewers did and used double the chocolate chips. I also grated an apple and put it in. Gave it a little more flavor. Very moist. mmmmmmm

I added a pinch of cinnamon instead of the full amount, used lime juice instead of lemon juice(because I was out) and added more chocolate chips. Very good!!

These were fantastic muffins!  I love zucchini bread and wanted something that could hold up better than sliced bread.  I followed the recipe exactly except to add a bit more chocolate chips.  If you try this recipe, please keep in mind that you can taste zucchini, it is not like a regular choc. chip muffin!  My kids did notice a difference, but I will keep trying to persuade them to eat!  I plan on making this over and over again!

The second time I made this, I liked it much better.  I don't know if I didn't cook it long enough, or what.  I do know that the second time I followed the recipe the way it was (plus extra choc chips) and the first time I did half oil and half applesauce... but I don't know if that was what made the difference.

I made three small changes--I added a teaspoon of baking powder, used melted butter instead of vegetable oil and I upped the mini chocolate chips to a half cup. I got exactly twelve biggish muffins. Mine were done at just over 20 minutes. Out of twelve muffins, two remain. My husband and two boys absolutely loved them. I think these would be great with cinnamon chips, too.

I doubled the batch and they were still gone in a day. I followed the oil/applesauce and flour recommendations and they were beyond excellent. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

This was a very yummy recipe! I will totally make it again. I did make a few changes to make it a little healthier. I exchanged 1/2 cup of the white flour for 1/4 cup wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and doubled the chocolate chips. Used apple sauce instead of oil too. Otherwise I followed everything else exactly! Oh, but I made 6 large muffins and baked for 30 minutes instead of 12 regular size muffins.

I need to use up a lot of zucchini so I made this recipe and  a brownie recipe.  My husband raved over these.  I wish it used more zucchini, but other than that it is a great tasting recipe.

Just made a double batch of these today-- SO glad I doubled the batch.  I ended up sending some to my neighbor (he loves them), my kids love them, and I froze some for future use.  Awesome recipe as is.

My pickiest eater requested that I make chocolate-chocolate chip muffins. I really need him to eat more vegetables, so I looked for recipe that had zucchini in it! This recipe rocked the house! The only changes I made, were that my kids wanted CHOCOLATE-chocolate chip muffins..... so I added a box of Sugar Free Instant Chocolate Pudding, and instead of using 3/4 cup sugar, I used the pudding pix, and 1/2 cup Splenda. I used a blend of whole grain flours instead of all-purpose, 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce...... but followed the rest of the recipe. They came out GREAT, and I've already been asked to make them again!

These muffins are easy and delicious.  I added 1 grated apple and used Hershey's CINNAMON chips, instead of chocolate chips. My son eats 2 in the morning before going to work and my husband takes them in his lunch box for a quick, healthy munchie.  Thanks for the great recipes!!!!!!!

The only change I made to this recipe was to omit the walnuts (I'm allergic) and increase the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. These were amazing, my daughter and I made them with friends and they asked for seconds (a mighty feat when speaking of children under 9)!

Very tasty and a great way to use your zucchini! I put more chocolate chips in and blended the zucchini instead of grating it because I can get my boys to eat them if they don't see the actually zucchini:)

Great muffins; very moist and tender. Tripled the recipe, which made exactly 35 muffins. Subbed 1/2 unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 oil. Used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour to every 1 cup of AP flour, and could have probably used more without them being too dense.  Omitted nuts. Doubled chocolate chips, but will use less next time. Oh, and had no fresh lemon juice, so used the jarred stuff. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I really wanted this recipe to work for us.  They went together easy.  The taste was fairly yummy.  Unfortunately no one could get past the smell to enjoy the taste.  The zucchini smell was very strong and unpleasant.  I won't be making these muffins again.

These were excellent; however, I decided to make changes before I'd ever tried them...  I chose to double the recipe and used 1 cup of really great olive oil and added 1/4 c. of powered baking chocolate...so that they looked like cupcakes!  I eliminated the lemon juice and used half and half in place of the milk.  These were awesome...

Perfection! I omitted the chocolate chips and the walnuts, looking for a healthy/trick way to get veggies into the little one. :)   These were fabulous.

Fabulous...I made these with all whole wheat flour and I added 1/4 cup of oat bran and 2Tbl. of flaxseed and replaced the oil with all applesauce and these came out so good, very moist and scrumptous. Only thing was I only got 10 muffins instead of 12, maybe I made them to big. Hmmm.

I used half plain yogurt and half the oil (canola) instead of veg. oil, and used 50% more chocolate. Also placed a chocolate chunk on top of each. Muffins came out moist and delicious!

I did follow some of the ideas other people had mentioned and combined it all into one.  I used a 1/2c wheat flour, 1/4c oil, 1/4c apple sauce, a little less sugar than called for and 2 tablespoons cinnamon. AWESOME! Next time, I'm using 1/2c sugar. I also used regular size chocolate chips - about 1/2c.  RAVE REVIEWS!

I loved these muffins!  I'm sure the full amount of sugar would have been great, but I'm trying to cut back, so I only used 1/2 cup sugar and they were still great!  I used 1/4 cup grapeseed oil and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the vegetable oil, and I used whole wheat pastry flour.  My kids and husband also loved these muffins.

Very good! I substituted 1/2c. whole wheat flour for 1/2c. of the white flour, which I think lent a nice hearty flavor & texture. I will definitely make these muffins again!

AWESOME MUFFIN!! Make sure to bake for the time given or else the chocolate chips will fall into the muffin. Can be baked without the zucchini. Moist and tasty for everyone to enjoy.

Great alternative to traditional muffins.  I did sub both 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil for the amount called for.  Also used equal parts combination of unbleached a.p. flour, whole wheat flour, and almond meal.  Additionally used 1/2 amount of turbinado sugar.  Turned out fabulous.  (16 servings size)

Excellent recipe. I took out the walnuts (didn't have any), used half zucchini half carrots and made muffintops instead...just dropped them by the spoonful on a cookie sheet. Prior to baking, I topped them with streusel topping (butter, brown sugar, cinnamon). They spread out a bit to get a nice crispy edge, but still retained a soft middle. My toddler thinks they're a treat. She thinks she's eating cookies for breakfast and I get to sneak vegetables in her breakfast. Double win! Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

These were good but I didn't add enough chocolate chips so they weren't great. But, there's a simple solution which I will try next time... more chocolate chips! I also followed other suggestions to add an apple. Worked great!

Like others, I used just less than half wheat flour, a shredded apple, and walnuts in part. I probably used too much zucchini--tripled recipe and added about 3.5 c.

Yum!  Made a little healthier by using whole wheat flour, agave instead of sugar, canola oil, and adding in some apple for moistness!  Will definitely make again!

Replaced half the oil with applesauce and a third of the a p flour with whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier.  Also replaced half the white sugar with brown sugar.  Added more chips also.  Didn't change the basic recipe, just tweaked it and loved it!

Delicious!  I used half oil, half applesauce, as well as half whole wheat flour, but they still tasted very indulgent!  Will definitely make these again - very quick and easy to throw together too.

These are fabulous! I stuck to the exact recipe, but made them into mini muffins. Soooo good, my kids LOVE them!  The second batch I added some quick cooking oats and it turned out just as great.

These muffins make you say "WOW!!!" So delicious that I made a double batch, of which one was a loaf of bread. 
Bake the bread version of this recipe at 400 degrees for 1 hour or till testing demonstrates they're done. I used 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup applesauce to "lighten" the recipe a bit. I also used dark chocolate (regular sized) chips and BAM! So good.

Awesome recipe!  The only changes I made were adding more cinnamon, using almond milk and not putting walnuts in (food allergies in our house).  They are so moist and delicious.  My husband ate almost all of them in the first night, next time I will for sure double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband said they were the best yet!   I suggest greasing the muffin cups instead of using paper as the muffins tend to stick to the paper.

I was looking for a muffin with hidden veggies to help my 3-year-old get all her servings.  Even though she saw me put the zucchini in and told me that she doesn't like it, once one of these yummy muffins was in front of her, she changed her mind!  I did use about half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I also substituted applesauce for most of the oil.  Great muffins!

Great recipe - so moist! I used 1/2 tablespoon of cider vinegar in place of the lemon juice (was out of lemons) and doubled the chocolate chips in place of the walnuts. I also baked as a loaf at 375° for 40 minutes. Fabulous, will make this again!

As others did, I used apple sauce to cut the fat, did half whole wheat flour, and brown sugar rather than white. I meant to make them as is, but after I had hauled out all of the stuff I realized I didn't have enough zucchini. I just added the difference (it was about half a cup) of frozen bananas. 

Also, I added a heaping tablespoon of cocoa into the dry ingredients to make 'em really nice and chocolatey. As well, I used only a tsp. of lemon juice and added it to the milk before adding it to the rest of the wet ingredients to make it a bit like buttermilk (the end result looked a bit dry b/c I added the cocoa, so maybe I should have left the whole amount of juice in, but I was worried about over curdling the milk. Instead I added a splash more oil once it was mixed.) 

Of course I used extra chocolate chips (had to omit the nuts since the kids' school is nut-free.)

So, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, since they were more banana-chocolate than zucchini-chocolate but the results were DELISH! They barely lasted a day.

These muffins are FANTASTIC! I am not even a fan of zucchini and I love them! I did change the recipe a bit though, I couldn't find peanut butter chips, but did find peanut butter & chocolate ones. I didn't really want to pick out all of the peanut butter ones, so I made peanut butter chocolate chip muffins. Yummmy!

Excellent, Jared loved them.  Used frozen zucchini, must make sure it isn't too liquidy.

Wonderful recipe. Modified recipe a little. Grated one half of an apple with zucchini (then measured out heaping cup) as suggested by other reviewers. Also mixed in 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder, and used 1/2 cup mini choc chips. I think using 1/4 cup and sprinkling some on top would be good too.

Very yummy.  It makes such a "pretty" looking muffin.  I will definitely be making these again.  I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce and I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour (in place of some of the all purpose flour) and extra chocolate chips.

My daughter said they were better than the ones we buy from a specialty baker. I substituted applesauce for the oil and added a bit more chips. They were moist and flavorful.

These were good, but I wish I had doubled or even tripled the chocolate chips...or included cocoa powder, as they weren't chocolate-y enough (my son wouldn't even try them because he could see the zucchini, but my health-conscious daughter liked them).

Oh my wow.   These are amazing! I also made them multigrain and subbed 1/2 oil for sauteed apples. YUM!  These were DELICIOUS.  Definitely a keeper!!  I decided, once I ran out of zucchini, to get in the mood of fall and make these with pumpkin.  All I had to do was add 1 cup pumpkin puree in lieu of zucchini, put in some nutmeg, and add a little extra milk and oil.  PERFECT!  Everybody loved both recipes. :D

AMAZING! Everybody loved them. Because we wanted these for breakfast, I healthed 'em up a bit by using whole wheat, regular, and oat flour.  I also cut the sugar a little and used brown instead of white.  Then I used half olive oil and half applesauce.  No one knew they were low fat, multigrain, and that they had veggies.  When I ran out of applesauce, I decided I had some apples and some time, so I put chopped apples in a saucepan and sauteed them until soft with some cinnamon.  I subbed half the oil for it, and I swear... best thing ever!! Best muffins I ever made.  Then I decided once to try it with half oil-half yogurt like a friend suggested to me.  DO NOT DO IT.  DO NOT!!  They turned out hard and rubbery on the outside and gooey and gross on the inside, even after baking them at 200 for 20 more minutes.  I would recommend using half oil-half sauteed cinnamon apples.  Very yummy and very healthy :)  Thanks for the recipe!!

Makes about 30 mini muffins.  They were ok - you can't really tell they have zucchini in them.  Easy and quick to make, but nothing spectacular.  I would add a touch of nutmeg or pumpkin spice next time - they needed just a tad more flavor.  If you're looking for a quick & easy way to use your garden's bounty, this recipe works well.

A great recipe - with or without the chocolate chips.  We did half our recipe with them in and half without and all of the muffins were moist and yummy.  Easy to make; always a great way to use up extra zukes from our garden.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Amazing, amazing, amazing!  I used whole wheat flour and added 1 yellow declicious apple, grated.  For the younger kids, I would make sure to peel the apple first (or use 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead), as the texture of the apple skin can be a problem for little ones.  My kids devoured these.  They freeze well in a Ziploc bag, but of the 5 times I've made this and doubled the recipe, I've only needed to freeze them once!

I made some substitutions due to dietary needs and what I had on hand and my husband, 5 year old and 13 year old all love them.  My changes were: I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour, egg beaters in place of the eggs, splenda in place of the sugar, almost doubled the chocolate chips (regular size), and in place of the oil I used 1/4 oil and 3/4 pumpkin puree from a can.  I omitted the lemon juice since it didn't seem like it would go well with pumpkin.  I also skinned the zuchinni so it wouldn't be so obvious in the muffins.  I used cupcake pans and baked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes.  Perfect!

These were really good cinnamon muffins. I think next time I'll leave out the chocolate chips because the flavors didn't really mix that well. My boyfriend thought they would be better as a loaf of bread because of the texture.

Had a little zucchini to use up, so I made these into mini muffins for my kids to grab as little snacks.  They love them, and say they can't even tell that there is zucchini in them.  I used applesauce instead of oil, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Great for snacks!

Yummy, thanks for the recipe! I did add more choc. chips, and maybe more zucchini (I didn't measure) I used regular choc chips and I think that the recipe is right mini would have been better. Thanks again!

Best advice is to double the recipe because these won't last. I forgot to add the milk and these still came out delicious.  I used 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown.  Flour: 1/4 cup oat, 1/4 whole wheat and 1 cup white.  Didn't have lemon juice and used 2/3 cup shredded apples and 1/3 heaping cup zucchini (peeled).  I am going to make a second batch now with the milk for comparison.  These are going to go into a muffin-gift-basket.  Presentation is worthy.  I saw no need for extra choc chip since they are mini's they balance out well in texture, flavor and visual.  More I think would put out of balance.

Deliciously moist muffins! Though, instead of adding walnuts to the mix, I chopped them up and sprinkled a few on top of each muffin cup before placing the pan in the oven - I also added a little bit of sugar, too (makes for a nice sweet crust). Try using a large (6-cup) muffin pan next time... fill each cup 3/4 full and you've got yourself a gourmet muffin! Thanks for sharing!

These were fantastic!  My son loved them.  I am always happy to find a recipe with fruits/veggies in them that he likes.  I took another reviewer's suggestion though- peel the zucchini so that none of the green shows.  That way, you def. can not tell there is any zucchini in it.

OMG - these are fabulous!  Very easy to make and taste delicious.  I made my first batch with my four-year old daughter this morning - followed the recipe as is, but excluded the walnuts.  The second batch is in the oven as we speak - experimenting with half wholewheat flour this time.  I used a yellow zucchini (because that's what I have growing in the garden) and you can't see or taste the zucchini at all.  Will be making these on a regular basis.  They beat the zucchini brownies hands down!

This & the blueberry zucchini bread recipe are the first zucchini recipes I have ever made & I am hooked.  Definitely double the recipe (you can always freeze the left overs).  I used 1 part whole wheat flour to 2 parts all-purpose.  Used regular size chocolate chips and agree with other reviewers that if you consider this a chocolate chip muffin recipe, you will definitely want to increase the amount of chocolate chips.  I followed the recipe, but will most likely double the amount next time.  Batter was nice and thick so I could use my pampered chef scoop to place the batter into the muffin cups for little spilling and quick clean-up.

I don't think I'll make these again.  I changed the recipe according to other reviewers' suggestions, but I don't think that was the problem as I often change the recipes to make them healthier in the same way that I altered this one.  I subbed in half whole wheat flour, added a cup of shredded apple, cut back a little on the sugar and on the oil.  I also added more chocolate chips - couldn't resist!  We ate them all but it was slow going.  They were nowhere near as good as the mocha banana chocolate chip muffins on this site (to which I make the same healthier changes).  I'll go back to those instead.  I think maybe I found the combination of zucchini, cinnamon, and chocolate to be a strange one ?

Fantabulous! Oh so good and was the easiest way to sneak in veggies for a visiting finicky child.  I was happy to use zucchini that I picked from my garden and although maybe not great for my waistline, great for the kids to try.  The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup shredded coconut and used regular size chocolate chips.  Everyone loved them and I doubt they will be around by the end of the morning.  Great recipe!

AWESOME!! I made these for a swim meet and they were gone in 2 min!! I changed the recipe up just a bit for a higher protein "punch" using whole wheat flour and almond "flour" also used coconut oil! Only complaint is I didn't make enough :). Thanks for the great recipe!!

These were the perfect accompaniment for our breakfast today; not only delicious, but allowed me to use up the last of the zucchini in the fridge.  Bonus!  I did use 1/2 w. wheat/all purpose flour and 1/2 applesauce/oil; peeled and shredded the zucchini finely so it would blend in.  I used pecans since I didn't have walnuts and let the 1/4 cup of choc. chips overflow just a bit.  :-)  The leftovers will be perfect for a quick pre-church Easter breakfast tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe, Janet--I will definitely make these again!

Made these last night, and they are DELICIOUS!! Doubled the choc chips, used brown sugar, allspice instead of cinnamon, and I also added grated apple. Definite success!

yep these are awesome. only thing i did different which tons of others suggested was i added a full cup of chocolate chips and i added a bit more shredded zucchini. also i used brown sugar instead of white, i always do when it only calls for one type of sugar. these were exactly what i was looking for in a muffin for snacking or breakfast. thank you we love them

Excellent! I used whole wheat flour instead, light vanilla soy milk, cut out some of the sugar, and omitted the lemon juice. The batter was a little thick so I added a bit more milk, but the end results were fabulous! Very delicious! I will definitely be making these again!

Loved these!  I was able to adapt to make them even healthier but using all applesauce instead of oil.  Sold these at a basketball tournament and I sold out of them!!!

I took some of the suggestions in the reviews and doubled the chocolate chips, added shredded apple, and substituted 3/4 cup wheat flour instead of doing all 1 1/2 cups white flour. i also have someone in my family who can't eat nuts, so i sprinkled nuts ON TOP of half of the muffins and left half of them nut-less for her.

Delicious and my two children loved them!!. I used all organic ingredients, safflower oil, organic buckwheat and wholemeal flours and added chia seeds, LSA and quinoa flakes instead of walnuts and they were delicious and had the added bonus of being extra healthy. Will be a family favourite.

This was delicious, I subbed half the oil for applesauce, did 3/4cup whole wheat pastry flour & the rest white flour, also grated a peeled gala apple and threw that in. Turned out fantastic. The toddlers were screaming for more!

made these for a 2nd grade class and they all loved them!  I left out the nuts cause of allergies in the class.  Can't wait for zucchini season so I can make them again, and again!

These are great!  I've made them several times.  Sometimes subing whole wheat flour (all or part), brown sugar for the white, and sometimes I'll throw in milled flaxseed.  My 1st grader packs them for his morning snack at school.  Great way to use up frozen zucchini too (thawed and drained).

I wanted to make these a bit healthier so here were my changes as I doubled the recipe..
I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, splenda instead of sugar, and almond milk instead of regular milk. I also didn't have apple sauce so I used canned pineapple that i pureed in the juice in substitution of the oil. Added a dash of nutmeg and cloves as suggested by another reviewer.

They turned out very well even with all my healthy substitutions. =)

I've made a million muffins, but none like these!  And they are so simple to make.  I have learned to read the reviews before making anything.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I also added a tsp. of nutmeg.  I used a tad less oil and added a bit of applesauce (not for health, but for flavor)!  After filling the muffins, I sprinkled just a tad of crushed Heath Bar on each.  Oh, yeah, I forgot, I added a Tbs. of sweetened Coco to the dry mixture.  These are to die for!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Best muffins ever!!! My kids are so picky about eating their veggies that this was the perfect way to "hide" them!. They just couldn't get enough of these perfectly moist and delicious muffins. I followed the recipe exactly and I couldn't be happier with the results. Will definitely make again!!

This was the perfect way to use all of the extra zucchini I got this year!  The batter seemed a bit dry before I folded in the chocolate chips and zucchnii so I added about 1/2 c. more milk and it worked great.

I made these exactly, except no nuts, and the flavor was really good. I only gave this 3 stars because the texture just wasn't pleasant. I think next time I will puree the zucchini in the hopes of a smoother texture.

Yummy! I really like this recipe, I doubled it to use up zucchini. It was a great way to have a quick dessert on hand. I used regular chocolate chips as I didn't have the mini chips and they worked out fine.

These were super moist and good!  I did what others said and swapped out some of the oil for applesauce and used whole wheat flour.  I don't think it matters, I just like using whole wheat flour/applesauce to make them a little healthier.

Amazing. Enjoyed by all. Love giving a nice treat like this to my son that is not overly sugary. Did half whole wheat, half all-purpose flour. Did half oil, half applesauce. Added a shredded apple too.

These muffins are superb!  I've made them twice now -- the first time, I used the oil as recommended and left out the nuts.  The second time, I substituted applesauce for the oil, but put in about 1 T of oil.  They came out nice and moist.  I also froze several of them, and they're great toasted too!  Definitely a keeper!

Love,Love,Love these muffins! I too used half applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil and used whole wheat flour instead of white. YUM!!!  This one is a keeper for sure!

These muffins are very delicious and very moist. I did make a few changes...1/4 cup oil & 1/4 cup applesauce, and I did half wheat flour/half white flour. The recipe made 12 regular size muffins, and about 12 mini-muffins. The only thing was that the regular size didn't rise very well in the oven.  The mini size cooked for about 10-12 minutes and fluffed up beautifullly.

excellent! My kids eat them up like I was giving them candy, even my picky 4 year old. My father in law has even declared them good. Not often I find a recipe that everyone enjoys. Will definately be making these a lot.

Delicious and easy! I ended up doing what others have by substituting applesauce for the oil. I used more applesauce than oil. The texture and taste was outstanding. This is one I will be making again and again. Thank you for sharing!

Made a few modifications to this.  Apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil, and whole wheat for 1/2 c of the flour, also omitted the nuts.  

The resulting muffins were pretty delicious although pretty dense and a little dry.  Next time I'm either going to oil the muffin liners on grease the pan as the papers stuck to the muffins.  (Boo.)

Would like to play with this one a little more.  Pretty good though.

*****Recipe was great***** I did double the recipe and used whole wheat pastry flour instead if all-purpose and subbed half the vegetable oil for apple sauce. Peeled the zucchini first, doubled the chocolate chips, and filled two loaf pans and made it into bread. "Perfecto!!!!!"

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly delicious!  Just a helpful hint - 1 cup of grated zucchini took about a whole medium sized zucchini.

Great!  I did them as mini-muffins (everything is better to a 2 yr old when it is mini, right?) and cooked for about 13 mins.

Amazing....my hubbi and his friends ate them all up. Time to make more. also gives me a reason to use up the garden zucchinis that grow like weeds! This is what I did: reduced sugar by 1/4 cup (reduced salt to match the reduction in sugar), grated apple to replace half the oil, used dove milk chocolate chopped into chunks (my hubi loves chocolate). added 1/4 cup more zuchini. came out SUPER moist. Next time I will try with some brown sugar and no oil. It was so moist, I don't think there is any need for oil.

Really nice.  Perfect homemade snack for my three little kids.  A couple changes I made: Used white whole wheat flour, used 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 applesauce and used regular choco chips because it's what I had on hand.  I will make these again!

Very good and very moist muffins.  I omitted the walnuts and chocolate chips to make them a bit healthier.  I also substituted half of the oil with apple sauce.

I was looking for a zucchini muffin similar to one at a local bakery. I left out the chocolate chips and made sure to lightly fold in the wet and dry ingredients together. To help the crust, I preheated the oven to 375 degrees, then turned it down to 350 once I put the muffins in the oven. They turned out perfect! A little crispy around the edges, and light and moist in the middle. Thanks!

These are very good...though not very flavourful...so I added applesauce, flax meal, cocoa powder and a bit of pear juice and they are so moist.  I made mini muffins and froze a ton.  I also pureed 2 zucchinis and I think that kept it moist too.

These were awesome and a treat I didn't need to feel guilty about.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white.  Instead of using vegetable oil, I used an additional 1/2 cup of zucchini.  I also used half Splenda, half sugar and doubled the chocolate chips.  They were dense muffins, but tasty!

Yummy!! I added golden raisins which were great. And I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of oil. If you are trying to make it a little healthier this is a  great substitution. No need for the oil, they taste perfect this way.

Yummy muffins. My 5 and 6 year olds gobbled them up, only briefly asking "what's the green stuff"

very very moist and yummy.  first time, left the skin on but that only cued my toddler into the fact that they must be healthy therefore yucky!  next time peeled the zucchini so that he'd never know.  be careful though... if you pack your zucchini in the measure, you'll use too much and they'll have a little too much moisture to keep their texture. very yummy and will use over and over again!

Made these with Gluten Free flour and they were amazing!  I used brown sugar as another reviewer did and I also (accidentally) used more vanilla than called for and it was great!

I really liked these muffins but they were a little too sweet especially with double the chips...like a cookie replacement or dessert muffin.  Next time, I would not add the chips and would reduce the sugar a little.  I also got very good results replacing the vegetable oil with half canola oil and half applesauce.

Very tasty! The first batch was made exactly as stated and were excellent. The second I was taking to a friends who has a daughter whom is allergic to citrus so I omitted the lemon and still they were just as good. A Very nice tasting and moist muffin. I recommend to all looking for a good recipe that can be adapted as well as left alone.

I gave it three stars because it may be that this recipe doesn't adjust well to gluten and casein free.  I've done other zuchinni bread type recipes that converted just fine though so I had higher hopes for this one.  I wouldn't make it again and I don't think i'd bother making it the regular way either, I just don't think there is enough flavor in the batter and i'm not a big fan of mixing cinnamon and chocolate.

YUMMY!!!  I made these this morning in an effort to use up some of the over abundance of zucchini that is coming in from my garden.  I did follow the advice of some reviewers and double the chocolate chips, plus I only had regular size chips on hand.  I also used raw sugar and cut the amount down about a 1/3.  I used 100% whole wheat flour, but it was fresh ground, not store bought and I ground it finely.

These are fabulous.  Our kids loved them. Very moist (do not drain zucchini) and great consistency.  I baked muffins in paper liners and at 18 minutes on 350 they were perfect. Any longer they would have been dry.  I doubled the chocolate chips (used regular size) and did a 1/3 cup walnuts (could even have gone to 1/2 cup).  Highly recommended.

OMG. These are absolute heaven!! I have made them about three times now and just can't get enough. My only problem is I was thinking it would be a good way to sneak zucchini into my 3 year old's diet, but instead I'm just eating them all! I up the vegetable content by almost doubling the zucchini called for by the recipe. Enjoy!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I used this to teach a baking lesson to my Brownie Troop. I followed the recipe as written but did double the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup.  My eight year olds were very skeptical at first and did not think anything made with zucchini would taste good.   Everyone LOVED these when it came time for tasting.  Thank you for sharing the recipe and to the other reviewers for all the helpful comments.

I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of 1/4 cup of the oil.  Oh, and I doubled the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. They are fabulous.  My 2-year old daughter gobbles them up and thinks they're cupcakes!

I have now made these 3 weeks in a row for my picky children.  (I was smart enough to double it this last time.)  I have gotten away with 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 3/4 whole wheat flour (or even 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/4 c wheat germ), and slightly less sugar without any complaints.  I also used applesauce for part of the oil and increased the chocolate chips as previous reviewers suggested.  Can't say enough about this outstanding recipe.  Thanks for the easy breakfast.

Excellent muffins!  Moist and delicious!  I added extra chocolate chips instead of nuts due to family allergies, other than that I followed he recipe exactly and they were just perfect!  Great way to sneak some extra veggies into our diet!

YUM!!!    SO glad I doubled the batch.  Trust me, just do it!  I made a few minor changes that made these healthier without compromising taste.  The double batch made sixty mini-muffins.  My modifications - I used whole wheat pastry flour, reduced the sugar to a little less more than 1/2 cup, used @1/3 cup veg oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce (for the double batch)  Did not have walnuts but these were still great.  I was hesitant about adding the lemon, but I really could not taste it.  The minis took about 12 mins to cook.    Now as long as my toddler can't see the green...

These turned out amazing. I followed the recipe to a T except for the lemon juice because I didn't have any. I think they turned out just fine without it. I will definitely be making these as healthy snacks for the family.

I never had zucchini before but grew some in my garden and needed a way to get rid of it without tasting it...and this was perfect!  I made it according to the recipe (besides regular chocolate chips and no nuts)and they are delicious.  Just made a second (and third) batch tonight to freeze!

Wonderfully moist and tasty! I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and reduced the oil a bit too. I used large muffin cups, so the recipe only made 11. I will definitely make them again!

Let me first state that I LOVE MUFFINS! Also, finding any muffin recipe with hidden veggies that tastes great is a plus. So, its no surprise that I ended up loving these muffins. Included this recipe in my "All Zucchini Dinner/Breakfast" inspired by Pam-3BoysMama. For dinner I served "Baked Vegetables," "Savory Cheddar Zucchini Muffins," "Zucchini Chocolate Cake," and "Zucchini Stuffed Chicken." I made this recipe while I cooked dinner but didn't have them until the next day for breakfast.

I get soooo many compliments whenever I make these.  What I really love is they go together so quickly that I can make a double batch in the mornings as I get ready for work.  My co-workers are treated to warm muffins when I arrive :)

These are EXCELLENT!! Very moist and delicious. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup of brown sugar, changed the oil to 2 TBSP of olive oil plus 1 snack sized container of applesauce, and baked them as mini muffins (350 degrees for 15 min). My 22 month old daughter and husband loved them as much as I did. Thanks, Janet!!

The reviews sounded good so I thought I would give it a try.  I found the muffins to be very moist and flavorful.  I made three adjustments: added 3/4 cup of oatmeal, increased the zucchini to 2 cups shredded and added 1/4 tsp of ground cloves becasue I love the flavor of cloves.

YUMMY!!  They turned out fluffy, sweet and perfect!  My son loved them and I got to sneak at least a little veggies in him.  I will definitely use this recipe again. I followed the recipe exactly and will probably stick to it.

This might be my favorite muffin ever. Because I eat them like crazy, I try to make them as healthy as possible. Here it is: substitute half applesauce for oil, use whole wheat flour, decrease sugar to 1/2 cup and I use dark chocolate chips. Tastes fantastic to me!

Absolutely delicious!  We followed the recipe to the letter except...  egg  yolk only, no egg white due to allergy.  No nuts (my son is allergic to those too), so I used double the chocolate chips instead.  The kids, me and Grandma all love these muffins!

Well, these are just plain awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly, only I added more chocolate chips.  At least, I assume I did- when it comes to chocolate chips, my measuring cups need not apply!  I made these into mini muffins (I am out of cupcake liners, and if you could see the sad state my ancient, but much loved, regular sized muffin tins are in, you would know why I am hesitant to bake in them whilst they are naked!)...and they took about 12 minutes to get that lovely brown color.  Very moist, very delicious, and I thank you for the recipe...I am sure it will be a usual suspect in my recipe box :)

These were excellent! I used half AP and half whole wheat flour, canola oil instead of vegetable, regular sized chocolate chips, and pecans instead of walnuts, all based on what I already had on hand.  They were wonderful and they only thing I would change would be to add more chocolate chips.  Thanks for the great recipe. I will definitely make these again.

Brought these to preschool when it was our turn to bring snacks and they were a huge hit!  I even upped the nutritional value by using 3/4 c. whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. applesauce and adding extra zucchini.  Did leave out the walnuts though.  My 4 y/o frequently requests these.

These muffins are absolutely delicious! It's a nice way to sneak in some veggies to my picky 3 year old. I did make some substitutions to make them even healthier. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup all purpose. I also used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and zero calorie sweetener for baking instead of sugar. Lastly, I sprinkled some wheat germ on top right before baking. They came out moist and delicious. Some of the best muffins I have ever made!

I am normally a big fan of zucchini muffins like this.  I could not find my usual recipe, but found this one with rave reviews and gave it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they were dry, bland and there was far too much cinnamon for my liking.  The only reason I gave it a 3 is because they were still all eaten.  Normally I puree the zucchini so the kids do not see it, so the shredded zucchini was a tough sell for the kids; although they still ate them. I have found my original recipe and will go back to that one from now on.

So good!!  I didn't measure the zucchini, just shredded a medium sized one.  I used 1/2 to 3/4 cup of MINI chocolate chips (the mini work so much better), didn't use any nuts, and replaced the oil with applesauce.  They are so yummy, and moist!

Seriously wonderful muffins.  Used all applesauce instead of oil and it did not become that dense/spongy muffin applesauce sometimes makes it.  Light, fluffy and moist-my husband loved them!  Thank you!

Doubled the recipe, added two shredded apples and almost an entire zuchini, plus a bunch of golden raisins.  Delicious!  Should have tripled the recipe for all the "stuff" I put inside, though!

These were fantastic!  I made a few changes...I substituted agave nectar for the sugar, omitted chocolate chips (I didn't have any on hand) and added flax seed to them.  They turned out very moist and delicious.  I froze half of them to make for a quick breakfast for rushed mornings.

This is the only zucchini recipe that everyone loves. It's very flexible and forgiving. It is a 5 star recipe as it is, but is also a 5 star recipe if you substitute whole wheat flour for part or all of the all purpose flour listed. Enjoy!

These are awesome. So moist! I cut the salt in half, because the first time I made them they seemed overly salty. I could eat a dozen of these, but I have a feeling they aren't very healthy!

YUMMY!!!  took the advice of other reviewers and added a shredded apple and 1/2 wheat flour.  You can't even tell  they have great flavor and texture.  I could eat the whole batch!   Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper.
REVISION:  I've used this recipe 4 times now.  Once with whole wheat, once with frozen zucchini (thawed & drained), once with fresh zucchini, and all with 1/2 wheat 1/2 all purpose flour.  Everytime they turn out GREAT!!!  This recipe is fantastic.  When using all wheat flour they turn out a little more crumbly but still great & super healthy.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.

I agree with others: WOW! Great muffins! I used a little less sugar because i loaded them with raisins and chocolate chips (used regular size chips and they work fine) and used about a third of whole wheat. I could eat all of them!

These are delicious!  You would never know they are
good for you too.  I added some additional chocolate chips for the chocoholic in me.  They will be a great hit with the family.

Made the recipe as is.  It was amazing!  The recipe as it's made comes out to 200 calories/muffin (mine made 14 muffins.)  It was a great use for leftover zucchini.  I will take the chef's suggestion and eat one every morning on the way to work!  I thought it was the right amount of chocolate chips and walnuts for a healthy muffin.

Awesome recipe ... Muffins are moist & delicious!   I took some suggestions and used only 1/2 the oil and replaced other 1/2 with unsweetened apple sauce, also doubled the choc. chips.  Amazing!   Freezes delightfully !

I have 4 boys and all make faces when there are vegetables in anything I make. But this is a very fun and tasty way to hide the vegetables. I tried to follow the recipe, but didn't have enough zucchini, so I added a little bit of a mashed banana. Then I didn't have the chocolate chips, but had a candy bar, which I crushed into pieces. I then baked the muffins into mini-muffins. I baked my first batch and tried one and it was wonderful. I do plan to make it again with the suggestions of others. I can't wait to finish this batch and pass some out to my neighbors.

These are amazing I have made these SEVERAL times in the last couple weeks. I did use regular chocolate chips and didn't use walnuts (as not a big fan of them) My kids and husband loved them as well... you didn't even know there was zucchini in them!

Delicious! I didn't have walnuts on hand so I used pecans instead and they were still yummy! I think next time I'll try it with half wheat flour to make them even healthier.

A good, light muffin.  I'm going to make a second batch right now! I made a few modifications:

Subbed half of the flour for whole wheat pastry flour, and added two tablespoons of wheat bran as well.

Omitted the lemon juice and added extra vanilla.

I added a tablespoon of ground flax seed to the wet ingredients.

Added golden raisins instead of the chocolate chips.

This recipe is amazing.  I made it according to the directions and didn't change a thing.  I made 12 muffins and they were so good I turned around and made another batch and this time made 24 minis.  This is a keeper!!!

They taste great. I topped with mini chipits to make them appear more chocolatey. If you are trying to sneak in the zucchini for kids, make sure you peel off the green peel, otherwise the green zucchini peel is too obvious and your kids will point out the "green strings in the muffins".  Also next time I would use less cinnamon as it was overpowering.

Great recipe! Muffins are very moist and not too dense. I substituted 1/4 c whole wheat flour and 1/4 c ground flax for 1/2 c of the white flour. Will definitely be making these again!

Very easy & very tasty…plus they filled my kitchen with a wonderfully warm scent. Okay, the "warm" part wasn't so wonderful in July…but they're still wonderful muffins!  Just make sure that you thoroughly fold in the zucchini to ensure uniform muffins.  Enjoy!

We love these! Including my picky 3 year old son.  I like to bake in bulk and freeze for future use.  Perfect for breakfast, snack or dessert!  Yum!

I love these muffins!  I doubled the recipe and decided to freeze half.  I made a a few substitutions with adding a cup whole wheat flour to the white, 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil, 1/2 cup brown sugar along with white and doubled the chocolate chips.  I also left out the nuts. Remember measurements were for a doubled recipe.  These are very dense and filling but taste great...especially warm w/milk. These are great since you can do different variations, and I think they all would taste delicious.  One reveiwer recommended adding apples which I may try next time. Enjoy!

We grew zucchini in our garden and made these delicious muffins. I did add a shredded apple and doubled the chocolate chips as suggested. Fun, easy and kid friendly. My four year old helped prepare and stir the ingredients, which made him even more excited about eating them. A great way to add some vegies and fruits.

These are a summer MUST HAVE!  Every year; we make a large amount of these & freeze the majority for the winter.  That way we can enjoy them all year round.  I add extra chocolate chips & also have found that white chocolate chips taste great too!

These were great!  I doubled the chocolate chips like previous reviewers mentioned (I think they would be good either way).  I also didn't shred the zucchini but instead sliced it and threw it in the blender briefly.  I have a toddler and if she found shredded and/or chunks of anything in the muffins she would have refused to eat it.  They received the toddler "thumbs up" and my husband who doesn't like fruit or veges in his desserts liked them:)

Wow, these were great!  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except that I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for part of the AP flour.  They didn't get too dense, so I might try substituting more next time.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the white sugar, which added great flavor!  Other than that though, this recipe was great! I made half with chocolate chips and half without, and both were amazing - though for my personal taste I liked them sans chocolate.

Soooooo Delicious!!!

I added only 1/2 cup of sugar and used apple sauce instead of oil... saves a ton of fat without compromising the flavour!!

Next time I would add more zucchini...

Definitely will make these again... and again... and again!!

Thought these were really yummy! I used regular size chocolate chips (1/2 cup) and cut the walnuts (preference). As listed, it made 15 regular sized cupcakes, which took about 17-18 minutes to cook. I will definitely make them again, but I think I will double the recipe and make in a jumbo muffin pan!

I followed some of the suggestions on here and used 1 c. regular flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. applesauce, and added some more chocolate chips.  Everyone raved over these and thought they were delicious!

These muffins were very tasty!  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and they were still very good.  I realized in the middle of assembling them that I only had olive oil on hand so I tried it and they still turned out fine.  I didn't really know what to expect since I've never baked with olive oil before.  Great way to use up some zucchini from the freezer!

I rated them based on ease of preparation since they're still in the oven baking and I haven't tasted them yet. I made quite a few changes. I omitted the chocolate chips (eventhough I love them) and used blueberries instead just to make them more health-friendly. I used half the oil and replaced the other half with applesauce. I also used a yellow zucchini because I bought some at the local farmer's market. I don't think that will affect the flavour. Very simple to make.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, and 1/4 C Fiber One crumbs for 1/4 C flour, and the muffins were fabulous and a bit healthier than the original recipe.  One more cup of zucchini used up!

Made it exactly as written, with no changes, and these were perfect!  I may try using part applesauce/oil, and even some of the other suggestions posted, but if you like a recipe to work the way it is submitted, this one DOES!  :-)

These muffins were a total hit with my family.  Everyone loved them!  I'll make these again and again, I'm sure.  I made them exactly as the recipe states, only I used about 1/2 cup of regular sized chocolate chips.

DELICIOUS! These were excellent. I made two more batches this week. Per others recommendations, I put in closer to 1/2 cup mini choc chips (but for less sweet one I think 1/4 would've been fine) and I'm not a nut fan so I omitted those, but these were great!

Excellent recipe. I did as others suggested I used 1/4 apple sauce and 1/4 oil. I also used regular size chocolate chips, next time I will use the miniature chips. I also added a few chips to the top. Very moist and very good

The whole family loved these muffins.  My husband will not eat zucchini normally, but now he is raving about these muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly, and took another reviewers advice and peeled the zucchini first.  It made the veggie less obvious.

These were so wonderful! My kids gobbled them up and I did change the recipe a little like other suggested to make it a little more healthy! I used whole wheat flour and half oil and applesauce and doubled the chocolate chips.

My husband accidentally bought an English cucumber rather than a zucchini. I decided to try these muffins anyway ;o) They actually turned out pretty darn good! Added a handful more chocolate chips than the recipe called for & used 2 heaping tsps of cinnamon (we like spice). Will defiantly try these next time with Zucchini. Highly recommended

I just made these this morning and was surprised at how good they were, yet so simple to make.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and use regular chocolate chips, increased to 1/2 cup. We like nuts in everything so I also increased these to 1/2 cup and did not chop them too fine so that you get some 'crunch'.  Excellent muffins that are good for you and not too sweet.

Nice crumb and very moist.  Could use a bit more depth in my opinion...a bit more spice?  Orange zest?  crushed pineapple?  something...but great recipe all in all.

These are very tasty. I wasn't paying attention though and added a whole 12 oz bag of mini chocolate chips instead of 1/4 cup. Oops...that was a bit much so will definately be reducing those next time. Regardless, they're very good - you can't even tell there's zucchini in them!

these are so yummy!  i did make a few changes though.  i doubled the recipe because i had 2 zucchini i had to use up.  i also had two over ripe bananas, so i added those as well.  i added the mashed bananas to the oil mixture before adding to the flour mixture and it worked out well.  I also put half a bag of mini chocolate chips in.  instead of making muffins, i put in two loaf pans.  i had to bake it at 350 for 1 hour.  next time, i may reduce the amount of oil and/or milk if i add the banana -- that way it shouldn't have to bake as long.  but as it is, it is extremely delicious and very moist.  yummy!

Not the prettiest muffins I've ever made, but tasty and moist.  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I think next time I will use half whole wheat flour to give them more substance (and make them a little healthier!).

Followed this recipe to a "T"; I felt no tweaking was needed and they turned out delicious!  I made them in mini muffin tins for my daughter's class at snack time.  They were gone!  My daughter loves veggies so they weren't an issue for her; although I had to giggle to myself knowing all the other students had no clue and readily ate them up!!!

Yum! I am eating one of these delicious muffins hot from the oven. Moist, tasty and perfect! I made a double batch, and used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce as others had suggested.

I got a pile of zucchini from my friend, so my daughter and I made these before going to school. It took maybe ten minutes to get the batter ready. I used just over ½ cup sugar, around 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, and I ended up adding some more milk because the batter was so thick I couldn't stir it. I used around 1/3 cup white chocolate chips and no nuts. Two tiny zucchini gave me around 1-1/4 cups shredded, so I threw it all in! Mydaughter couldn't believe it was that "yucky" vegetable! Thank you for sharing, Janet. This is one of the better zucchini bread recipes I've tried!

Awesome recipe!!! They were moist and not too sweet. The only thing I changed was that I added ground flaxseed and more chocolate chips.

SO GOOD!!  I made some changes, but still 5 stars, as I'm sure they would have been fantastic as is.  Used all whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil, added 1/2 t. nutmeg and 1/4 t. cloves, used vinegar instead of lemon juice (didn't have any lemon juice), doubled the choc. chips and walnuts and zucchini, and added 1/3 c. wheat bran.  My kids LOVED them as much as I did!  Such a great way to sneak in some more veggies!!  Will definitely make them again and again.

These are the best muffins I have had in a very long time, "very moist" with lots of flavor. The only change I made was reduce the sugar to 1/3c, reduced the oil to 2 tbsp. and replaced both with apple sauce. Will be making these again and again!

I was looking for recipes for zucchini so I thought I would try this one.  I followed the directions exactly as written, and while all of the individual flavors weren't bad, cinnamon and chocolate just do NOT go well together for me.  Sorry.  I will stick to normal zucchini bread from now on, or try replacing the chocolate chips with raisins (since in my opinion raisins and cinnamon go together MUCH better than chocolate and cinnamon).

I loved these! Had to sub the veg. oil for olive oil, but with all the delicious flavors you couldn't even taste the difference.  As per others reviews I added a grated apple and almost doubled the amount of zucchini and it turned out perfectly!  Amazing!

These are so *GOOD*!!  I made a few adjustments, but nothing major. I subbed 1/2 C of whole wheat flour for some of the AP, used 1/2 of the oil it called for and replaced the rest with unsweetened applesauce. I didn't have any lemon juice, so I used half the amount of white vinegar. Skipped the nuts (don't like 'em in my bread products) and used regular sized chocolate chips. I made a second batch with golden raisins instead of chocolate chips and they are really good too.  My 2 year old (who's latest word is "fuffin") gobbled one up in record time and begged for another one.  I will be making these again!!!

One of the best zucchini muffin recipes! Perfect as is (five stars)! But along with the others, adding a twist to them is always fun! I made them into a semi-glorious morning muffin by adding a handful of raisins and a shredded carrot. I also used have wheat flour..that's just a given whenever I bake. Truly wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

These were divine!  I usualy do not review recipes but after baking a batch of these delightfully moist muffins, I felt I needed to express how pleased I am with it.  I have a plethora of zucchini growing in my garden and was desperately searching this website for something "new" to try.  My son is the king of picky eaters and after frantically inhailing three of these muffins straight from the oven, I stood by amazed and shocked.  After trying one myself, I felt no changes needed to be altered to the recipe.  They are very easy to mix up-batter is quite stiff until the zucchini is added which ends in perfect consistency.  I baked mine for twenty-three minutes and they were golden brown delicious.  I decided to make a second batch, this time omitting the chocolate chips and upping the vanilla to one tablespoon which creates the perfect breakfast on-the-go snack.  These could not have turned out any better.

I have zucchini coming out my ears and a friend coming to visit for a couple days so I asked her what zucchini treat she'd like.  She requested zucchini bread with chocolate chips.  She hasn't had the chance to taste them yet but my husband and I have!  Now I can get him to eat zucchini!    Fantastic recipe!  I doubled it, used all whole wheat pastry flour (as I always do), cut the sugar a bit, used applesauce for half the oil, reduced the cinnamon a touch, and used fewer chocolate chips (regular size).  Perfect!

I've been making these muffins for 2 summers with the abundance of zuchinni from my garden and they are a favorite on mine.  I always double the recipe and use 1/2 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of applesauce to cut down on the fat.  I recommend 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of 1/4.  I also substituted blueberries when I didn't have chocolate chips of hand and it turned out great and was a tasty vatiation.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

Awesome!  These were a big hit.  I made some small adjustments to make it a little healthier -- 1/3 of the flour I replaced with whole wheat, 1/2 of the oil I replaced with unsweetened applesauce, and 1/3 of the sugar I replaced with the equivalent amount of stevia powder.  Still delicious!  I also over-measured the chocolate chips, just couldn't resist. :)  So good!!

I doubled the recipe, planning to freeze half.  My sons had friends over & stormed the kitchen asking "what is that delicious smell?" They devoured almost 24 muffins in one afernoon, even after I told them they had zucchini in them. One even asked to take the recipe & some zucchini home to his mom.  I'll be making more tomorrow.

Excellent muffins!!My toddlers didn't even know they were eating zucchini. I did make a few changes, used 1/2c wheat flour 1 c white, 1/2c white sugar 1/4c brown, and lastly, I didn't have any lemon juice. Still very good.

These muffins are amazing. I seriously cannot stop eating them. They are way better than I expected. I will be making these again and again. I doubled the chocolate chips, but otherwise no changes to this recipe. YUM!

Fantasic recipe!  I took cue from another person who said her kids devoured them right out of the oven, and doubled the recipe.  I am glad I did.  I substituted a little of the flour for whole wheat flour and since I only had regular size chocolate chips I threw in extra to ensure each muffin had plenty.

I amended the recipe to make it a bit healthier. I substituted 1/2 c apple sauce for 1/2 c of the oil, added a mashed ripe banana, used 1 c of whole wheat flour and 2 c regular flour, and used only 1 c of demarcara sugar. These were delicious! I doubled the recipe and made 18 giant muffins and 12 mini-muffins. Great recipe! Thanks!

I am a cook at a very nice sit down deli, and I made these the other day. One of my co-workers hates zucchini, and I asked her to try these, she couldn't believe there was zucchini in them. I give these 5 stars, because when customers walk in the door I love to watch their expressions when they smell something yummy in the oven.

Made exactly as written. Doubled it. Very moist, everybody likes them.  Took 25 minutes in silicon sq.muffin cups.  I had to use reg. choc.chips as that is what I had.  Next time I will use less choc.chips.  Just a little to sweet for my sweet tooth! Will cut it down next time.  Keeper recipe for sure.  Thx!

This was a great base recipe to take and run with.  I substituted about 1 cup old fashioned oatmeal for part of the flour, cut back on the sugar and added a bit of honey.  I also cut the oil in half and they are still as moist as can be...  Just my way of making a tad bit healthier.  Thanks!

Delicious!  The only changes I made were to double the recipe, use half WW flour, use mainly brown sugar, add some shredded carrot to make up the balance of zucchini (didn't have enough) and omit pecans substituting chocolate chips.  Very moist and tasty.  Next time I will try using 1/2 applesauce instead of oil.

Loved these muffins!  The only thing I did different was to replace the oil with applesauce.  They turned out moist and certainly didn't last long at my house!

ATTN: Weight-Watchers people: these are AWESOME. If you follow the following specifications, each muffin is only 3 points: 60 grams semi-sweet chocolate chips, 28 grams walnuts, 1 small grated apple, 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, use half whole wheat flour and half white flour, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar (instead of all white sugar), 1/2% milk instead of whole, and 2 small grated zucchinis (no need to peel). It actually makes about 14 muffins because of the extra zucchini and apple. VERY FLAVORFUL and full of fiber. The mix will seem very wet, but they turn out moist. Check them at 20 minutes with a toothpick and then continue baking at 2 min. intervals until toothpick inserted into muffin comes out clean.

Delicious- substituted half the oil for some homemade spiced applesauce to cut the fat and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  Made mini muffins that took 11 minutes to cook in my oven.  Doubled the recipe and it made approx. 60 mini muffins! Sprinkled with powdered sugar to make them a bit prettier. Perfect for a big dessert party we are having!

I made this WITHOUT the choc. chips-added blueberries to half the batter instead- fantastic! I was looking for 5 star zucchini recipes and this one worked great! The batter IS really dry until you add the zucchini; then it seemed really wet but it baked up great- super moist and easy!!

Great muffins, but I did change a few things. I didn't have any Chocolate chips so I left them out also, I used cinnamon apple sauce instead of oil, because of this I would cut back a little on the cinnamon next time. Healthy and really good.

First of all, I had a lot of zucchini so I tripled the recipe and I also made some changes. Like others, I added one shredded apple (I kept the skin on).  I only used 1/3 the amount of oil and substituted applesauce for the remainder.  I omitted 1/4 cup of sugar and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. I doubled the chocolate chips (and it still doesn't seem like enough). I also split the flour - half whole wheat, half white. 

With all these changes the muffins came out very tasty!!!  The first batch was a bit too moist (maybe due to the added apple) and so I just added some more flour to the remainder.  The following batches had better rise.  All were very good! Will definitely make again!

Currently my favorite muffin recipe!  Moist and delicious. I used half whole wheat flour, brown sugar, and a small container of apple sauce with a bit of oil to top it up to 1/2 cup.

These are SO yummy!  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white, 1/4 C applesauce plus 1/4 C melted butter instead of 1/2 C oil, 2/3 C sucanat instead of 3/4 C white sugar, and pecans instead of walnuts.  They were very moist and flavorful.  It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups all the way though because whole wheat doesn't rise very well), and they were almost all gone in 1 night.

Perfect recipe as is!  I just dont add the walnuts.  I make em in bite size mini muffins.  Such an easy recipe to follow!  I always have most of the ingredients on hand.  I usually only need to purchase the zucchini and sometimes the chocolate chips.

I was disappointed with the muffins - after reading all the reviews. The "most helpful" review said it was the best muffin recipe on this site.  Uh-unh. It's an ok muffin, but not exceptional. I made it as written & with the substitutions of whole wheat flour & applesauce. Neither version was anything more than o.k.

This recipe is delicious.  I always make a double batch and it makes 24 regular size muffins and 24 mini muffins.  I use all coconut oil in place of vegetable oil.  One shredded apple in a double batch adds a lot of moisture, but is not necessary.  I make these every year when we get giant zucchinis from our CSA

I like to use 1/2 the amount of oil recipes call for, added more milk, & used cocoa powder for a chocolate, chocolate chip treat.  I did triple the recipe (had tons of fresh zucchini) so I used 1/2 C cocoa & made 2 doz muffins & 1 loaf.  Great recipe!!

Yummy! The batter seems quite oily before baking but the baked muffins taste awesome. Next time I will try substituting half of the oil with applesauce.

These were delicious, my entire family loved them and it is not often that all 4 agree! Even our babysitter, who eats like a bird, ate 4. Adding zucchini was a great way to use up a surplus I had while moistening the muffins. The only change I made was subbing 1/2 the oil with applesauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this into a cinnamon recipe, by adding an extra teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a whole bag of cinnamon chips! Also added a 1/2 cup of applesauce to make it even more moist... SUPER YUMMY!!!!

I love these. I always double the recipe and use dark chocolate chips. I don’t measure them, just add whatever I feel. I like to make a couple mini loaves then freeze a bunch of muffins.  They are great to heat in the morning to add to breakfast or afternoon snack.

I had some left over zucchini in the freezer that I wanted to use up.  Made these, and my kids just loved them.  I Used yougart instead of milk (vanilla)  turned out just fine.(split the oil with 1/2 oil, 1/2 apple sauce) Again turned out just fine,  My kids perfer these over the bananna chocolate chip ones! Good way to get a different veggie in them...

These muffins were GREAT!!!  Even my very picky 4 year old can't get enough of them!  I left out the chocolate chips & the nuts because some don't like chocolate & everyone in my family hates nuts.  They were perfect without them.  I have had to make these twice this week because they go so fast.

This was an excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and didn't put the chocolate chips in, which would be good I'm sure.  I have zucchini in the garden now so I'm going to grate some up in 1 cup packages for use in the winter.

I, like another reviewer, made these vegan by using commercial egg replacer (Ener-G brand) and soy milk.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose; half raw turbinado sugar and half organic brown sugar; and half 1/2 almond extract and half vanilla.  I also omitted the chocolate chips entirely and added more walnuts, as I wanted the flavor of the zucchini to come through--chocolate would have overwhelmed it.  They rose perfectly (sometimes an issue with vegan baked goods) and were quite good.

Mmm..mm..moist!  I admit I couldn't resist doubling the cc's as suggested by other users.  Since they are falling off the tree by the bucket fulls this year, I also added 1 large pear, shredded along with the zucchini to yield an additional 3/4 cup of shreds.  Then I added 1 1/2 cups raisin bran to make them hearty.  It's a stick to your ribs and maybe your thighs kind of muffin!  This recipe will be a new favorite in my personal recipe collection.  With the added ingredients, I filled the cups to the rim and yielded 14 beautifully, golden brown muffins.  The added ingredients did NOT dry them out, instead the juicy pear bettered the end results.  My picky toddler gobbled hers up and begged for seconds! A sincere thank you for sharing Ms. Pierce!

You can easily double the amount of zucchini in this recipe, which you should do if you have more than you know what to do with!  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil instead of the entire amount of oil.  I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and threw in a few more chocolate chips.  This is a great recipe and we'll be pulling these muffins out of the freezer ALL winter.

Great!  I used whole wheat flour, Sucanat (unrefined sugar), hemp milk, and carob chips and these still turned out fantastic!!!  A wonderful light muffin & very tasty.  Next time I would double the recipe to make more.  By the way, I used half of a medium zucchini to get 1 c. shredded.

Super easy to make, they stayed nice and moist. YUM! I used 1/2 cup regular chocolate chips instead of mini chocolate chips and they were delicious. I shared them with my coworkers and they thought they were great! Perfect way to use up some zucchini!

These were soooo good! Thanks for the recipe! We quadrupled the recipe and they were mmm delicious. We had some in mini circles, some in medium, some in bread pans, and some blueberry. The blueberry kind was flat though on all but I haven't gotten to taste it yet. I tried the mini kind w/o the blueberries and they were simply amazing! Thanks for this great recipe!

I followed the recipe, except I doubled it and used 1/3 wheat flour & 2/3 white.  I was surprised that I didn't like the muffins much.  They seemed to taste a bit bitter (the chips) - and I use these chips all the time in cookies.  I think it's because the muffins aren't very sweet to counterbalance it.  My husband agreed.  Maybe our perception (which is obviously very different from everyone else who rated these) is because I've always made zucchini muffins from my mom's recipe & hers is much sweeter & had many more spices in it.    Having said that - my 2 year old thinks they're delicious & is having one for breakfast right now.

Wow! This is now my all time favorite zucchini muffin recipe. I used unrefined sugar instead of white (always do) and were fabulous! 2nd time subbed 1/2 the flour w/ oatmeal...a little more crumbly but WOW WOW WOW! Thank you for a great recipe to use all that zucchini in the garden!

I doubled recipe and added a cup of apple instead of just zucchini. And substited the oil with apple sauce. They worked out great.

Yum!  This was my first time making this recipe and after reading some of the other comments I made a few substitutions:  1/2C whole wheat flour and the rest all-purpose white; 1/4 C oil and 1/4 C applesauce; I peeled the zucchini and I used dark chocolate chips.  This was kid and baby (12-month old) approved!

Delicious!  I think it could have used more zucchini though.  I used 1 cup and 1/4 cup of zucchini and still thought it could have used some more.  They were still really great though!

There is a reason this recipe has a 5 star rating, it is great!  I have made these muffins several times and I thought I should put in a rating.  My son has a food allergy to milk and eggs so I had to use soy milk in place of regular and egg replacer in place of the egg.  I also used regular size (dairy free) semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the mini ones.  Following the advice of other reviewers I doubled the amount of choc chips.  I also cut down the amount of oil to 1/3 cup and added in 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also didn't add in the lemon juice this time and they still came out great.  My 3 year old loves these muffins and so do my husband and I.  Great recipe, thanks!!

This is fantastic.  I also added shredded apples (1/2 an apple, but I only made 1/2 the recipe) and it was great.  Used egg whites and soymilk as substitutes, and it tasted great.  Thanks!

For those of you who shred and freeze zucchini like myself, this recipe can successfully accommodate without much fuss. As others did, I subbed applesauce for half of the oil and 1/2c wheat flour for that much all-purpose. Additionally I measured out 1c thawed UNSQUEEZED UNDRAINED frozen shredded zucchini, omitting the milk in the recipe to compensate for the extra liquid. My main criteria for good muffins (aside from taste) are 1) light, moist texture and 2) substantial rise. These satisfied both, and with a little less cinnamon and sugar were still tasty, too. For whatever reason they did stick rather obstinately  to my silicon pan. Hmmm...

EDIT: I have made this several times over the past year and have experimented every time. I made this recipe over this past weekend and doubled it as it is ever-so-popular! I used less sugar, shredded 2 zuchinnis and an apple, used half apple sauce and half oil. I baked 12 muffins and the rest went into a loaf pan. If you make a loaf, be careful to watch your time. I checked mine every ten minutes, and I think the loaf was ready in about 45-60 minutes. These are unbelievablely yummy and versitile - try it today! 

Wow! 6 stars! These are so moist and delicious! I made quite a few changes as I'm trying to eat healthier and they still came out beautifully. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup regular, about 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce, swapped the walnuts for pecans (what I had on-hand), left out the chocolate chips and added 1/2 a grated apple. Mmm-mmm good! I had a difficult time stopping at one!   Next time I might try adding some raisins and perhaps some grated carrot. Also think I could make it even healthier with all whole wheat flour and full 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil. This recipe is a great staple and will definitely go into my regular rotation! Thank you!

This is an extremely easy recipe that turned out wonderfully.  I pretty much followed the directions to a T.  Differences: I was slightly short of a cup of zucchini once I shredded it (didn't seem to matter) and I had only full sized chips (I chopped them up with a knife).  Threw a few chips on top.  Half of the dozen are milk chocolate, half semi-sweet (I like the semi-sweet, she likes the milk chocolate).  Next time I will make a double batch if I have the zucchini.  Great use for zucchini you've left in the fridge too long.

Reduce sugar to 1/2 c, replace oil with applesauce and do 1/2 c zucchini & 1/2 c carrots. Delicous and less calories.

These were great! I followed others' advice and did 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil in stead of 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I also made them in a mini-muffin pan. My very picky 3 year old who always states that she hates zucchini could not get enough of these! My 11 month old also really enjoyed them. I will definitely make these again, and probably double the recipe next time so that I have enough left over to freeze!

My picky teens love these for grab and go. I try to have these frozen on hand in a ziplock bag. A fairly healthy alternative to junk food. A few changes to make healthier: I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated.  1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil. I increased the nuts for more MUFA. Next I will try 1/2 whole wheat flour.

These are wonderful!  Even my grandson, who won't eat zucchini, loved these and asked for more.  They're great to freeze ahead and have a quick, easy breakfast.  I add some wheat germ to boost the nutritional value.

I just made a double batch of these delicious muffins and they are fantastic!  I read and followed some of the other reviewers suggestions.  I used 1/2 of the suggested regular flour and 1/2 wheat flower for the added fiber.  I also used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 vegetable oil.  The muffins are so moist and my son has already had two!  Yay for hiding veggies and using up leftover zucchini!

I might just stop making zucchini bread and stay with this muffin recipe from here onward!!!

My husband does not like any other vegetables than potatoes, corn, green beans and peas.  I made these muffins about a month ago and he said he liked them.  I guess I didn't believe him until he handed me some zucchini out of our freezer this afternoon and said 'PLEASE??'  These muffins are so easy and so moist.  I didn't change a thing. I will always make a double batch when I make them because they just don't last very long!!

This recipe is great!  I usually change the last 1/2 cup of flour to whole wheat, and add extra chocolate chips.  They always turn out perfect, and I generally make a double batch and freeze them.  20 seconds in the microwave brings them right back to perfect - absolutely excellent with spreadable yogurt butter melted in the middle!

These were delicious. To cut out the fat I used apple butter instead of the oil. I also used less sugar because the apple butter is a bit sweet.

These were delicious! I actually left out the chocolate chips and walnuts, but added wheat germ, and used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour. As a side note, I used a touch of nutmeg to spice things up a bit, as I thought they would turn out a little bland without it. I also substituted cinnamon applesauce for the oil.

After baking them I wrapped them individually with "Press N Seal" and then tossed them into a gallon sized ziploc freezer bag and froze them. My husband and 2 year old son absolutely adore them, and with these changes they are even healthier!

Very good with a few modifications.
1. I actually had a melon that wasn't sweet and instead of throwing it out I made muffins out of it.
2. Instead of chocolate chips added raisins, they just sounded like a right addition to muffins instead of chocolate.

Very delicious!!  My kids and daycare kids love them!  I made them and they had them for breakfast and snack that day!  Who would have thought they were healthy!!  I did use applesauce instead of any of the sugar, so they were not quite as sweet, but when you care for 10 kids, the less sugar, the better!  My non-healthy husband even said they were good!  I made mini-muffins instead.

Wonderful recipe with loads of zucchini.  I used a mini muffin tin and they turned out great, I only baked them for about 12 minutes and recipe made about 3 dozen.  I will definitely be making this one again!

yum! I did sub 1/2 the oil with apple sauce which made it very moist. I didn't have any lemon extract either. I used butterscotch chips and put 1/2 cup instead of a 1/4 instead- turned out great! I'm going to make more for my coworkers!

My husband and I both loved these muffins. You could add more chocolate...but I followed the recipe and found it to be a nice little addition to the zucchini and walnuts! Yum!

These muffins are so good. Sometimes I up the nuts and choc. chips to 1/3 cup each and throw in about 1/4 cup coconut. To be really naughty, frost with cream cheese frosting!

Delish! I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and used half oil, half applesauce, as well as added raisins and a pinch each of nutmeg, ginger, and clove.  I kept the skin on the zucchini, and omitted the nuts.  The muffins were hearty and tasty - I was cooking for three 8 year olds and they gobbled them up.  Next time will try with half wheat flour and a little less sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe.

they are good, the chocolate chips don't blend good with the rest of the flavors (i don't think).  my kids like them just because chocolate is in the name of the recipe.

I made these last fall when someone gave us a zucchini.  The only addition we made was to add some raisins (my husband loves raisins!)  Sent them into work with my husband and they were a hit!  I planted my own zucchini plants this year and they are producing like crazy...I'm going to go bake a batch of these muffins right now!

Oh so yummy! I doubled the recipe--24 muffins--and followed the tips left by Lookin2Cook4GoodLookin--the review that starts, "Wow wow wow wow..." I left out the nuts. It only took my muffins 15 minutes to get done. Any longer, and the bottoms would have burnt. I will make this from on! Thanks!

I didn't have the mini chips, either - so I used regular sized semi-sweets and doubled them, as many other reviewers did.  I had an overgrown zucchini from the garden, so I cut around the seeds and put the seedless pieces through the salad shooter to grate them.  Fabulous, I will definitely make these again!  Thank you!

Muffins were good. Moist and fulfilling. My husband and I ate them. Our kids didn't like them at all. I think it was that "healthy" looking thing that turned them off. Next time I will make cup cakes out of them and put some topping like sprinkles. I think that will do it for kids. You just can have it all "healthy".

I've been craving Zucchini bread but when I ran across this recipe I just had to try it. Absolutely wonderful! It always bothers me when people rate a recipe and then say "I made a 'few' modifications" and then go and change the whole recipe around but I have to admit that I did take a few of the other reviewers suggestions and reduced the oil a bit and added about half a grated apple (to make up for the loss of oil). Amazingly moist and delicious! Thanks so much for sharing.

I followed some other reviewers and used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce.  The muffins were very moist and flavorful, loved them.  I realized all my choc chips were gone after I'd started the recipe, so I used white Choc chips instead, and they tasted great.  I bet butterscotch would be nice with the light cinnamon flavor as well.  Great recipe, thanks!
