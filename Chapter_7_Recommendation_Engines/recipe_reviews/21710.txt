Great base recipe for those of us that like to tinker with recipes. I had 4 cups of leftover ham that I ground. I mixed in the pickle relish and other ingredients in recipe. I did add about 1/3 C. diced pineapple (that was cooked on my ham) and added 1/2 an 8 oz container of whipped cream cheese. I also added minced grn onion and a few shakes of hot sauce. YUM! I don't recommend adding salt until you taste it. Let rest in fridge overnight & then, YUM - on crackers, rye bread, whatever...I love it with my few modifications! Idea/Edit: I only had about 1 C ground ham I needed to use or toss out. So, I mixed in liver sausage (about 1/4 C) and rest of ingredients with a few tweaks. Another yummy spread. Just giving ya'll ideas

My husband requested a ham spread for sandwiches but I've never tasted one before, let alone made one. The first time I made this recipe I used mayo instead of miracle whip, opting for the olives instead of the relish. He liked it, but said it needed more "zing." With the second try, I used a mixture of Miracle Whip and and mayo (we are cutting down on sugar, which Miracle Whip contains) and he said it was perfect! I like it very much as well.

my husband loved it when I used the onion but the kids didn't.  The next time I made it I left out the onion and everyone loved it!  We used the pickle relish, not the green olives.  It was easy to prepare.

Very simple way to make ham spread. I will usually make this after Easter or Christmas with the leftover odds and ends of the holiday ham. I don't usually keep dill pickle relish on hand, I'll throw in two garlic dills. I also don't eat "salad dressing", I use Hellman's mayonnaise. All this really needs is a little fresh ground pepper. Grandma made this for the kids when we were little, now I make this for mine. Best on saltines. This also is good using a pound of un sliced quality bologna.

Great use for leftover Christmas ham! Even my 3yr old daughter liked this. I added extra mustard, but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out yummy. Don't have a food processor, but used a hand-chopper and the ham got diced up just fine.

Yum! I had two thick slices of ham leftover from Thanksgiving (maybe 2/3 or 3/4 of a pound total), I omitted the onions, I used more like 2 or 3 tablespoons of dill relish, the teaspoon of mustard, and maybe 1/3 cup of mayo as I don't care for Miracle Whip. I didn't measure anything, just added it in. Oh, and I don't have a food processor, just one of those little mini-choppers. I chopped the ham up (took maybe five or six pulses) then put it in a bowl and added the other ingredients. It tasted great immediately after mixing, I'm sure it'll be much better after sitting in the fridge awhile! A quick and great use for leftover ham. Thanks, Pat. :)

Not too bad!  I have been looking for a ham spread recipe like my mom used to make when I was a child and this one may be a good place to start.  Will have to "fiddle" with it a bit!

I had about a pound and half of leftover Easter honey ham that I needed to use up. So my ham was sweet enough to use regular mayo, we don't like sweet mayo. Didn't have dill relish so chopped some kosher dill pickles, and a red sweet onion. Since so many reviews said this was missing the "zing" I added a big wooden spoonful of chopped pickled jalape√±o peppers and dash of cayenne. My husband said he liked the sweet and spicy taste and was much better than my mom's plain ham spread. Great on crackers or wrapped in a sandwich wrap with lettuce and tomatoes.

I liked this recipe for a number of reasons: homemade is always better that deli made, you control the amount of fat/junk in the ham going in, and it tastes really good!  Great idea for leftover ham!  I doubled this recipe and used Dijon mustard. Dijon is more mild and next time I will use yellow mustard for more zip! Thanks for posting!

I've made this for years. When ever there is leftover ham from the holiday dinners my family asks me to make "Ham Salad".  Let me tell you that it doesn't last long in my house. I love the saltiness my self.

For those looking for that extra zing, I added a tablespoon of apple cider vineger and it really helped. I have learned to use vineger when recipes are lacking that tang you crave.

This is a decent spread.  STill is missing something, not sure what.  I added yellow mustard for zip, miracle whip onion flakes, celery salt & relish.  It' just missing something, not as good as the store made kind.  Still going to keep looking.  This is ok and will do.. but just not quite there.

This was pretty good. My kids love the saltiness in this recipe...me I melowed my portion down a bit with extra reduced fat mayo. It was totally simplet to do, I mixed my batch all in the food processor instead of dirting up another bowl.  It was very easy and delicious. I will make this again, oh and served on fresh bakery bread instead of store bought hamburger buns, that was a key to a great sandwich for my kids.

This is a good basic recipe.  However, it turned out a little dry and needed some zing.  I had used mayonnaise and added an extra 1/4 cup, which fixed the dryness.  I also added an additional teaspoon of pickle relish but it still could have used more.

Easy. I did the whole thing in the food processor starting with the onions. I used a bit more than 1/4 cup mayonnaise in place of the Miracle Whip. I also used twice the amount of relish (sweet) and yellow mustard. 4 stars because it's easy but not   THE BEST ham spread I've ever had.

This WAS delicious! ;)  I just eyeballed everything, but added a little more ham to try to use it up.  My ham was already sweet from the coke/brown sugar I cooked it with, so I used regular mayo.  Used the mini chopper to get the right consistency for the ham, and I used only 5 green olives (didn't want to overpower it for the kids), as I had no dill pickles.  It was very good.  I will try again in the future, w/dill pickles. Thanks Pat!

I love this recipe!  I have been making it for several years and my family begs for it whenever we have leftover ham.  I use regular mayo instead of Miracle Whip, but that's it!  Keep in mind if you change mustards (like using Dijon as suggested above) you will change the whole flavor of the spread.  This spread is so delicious, I've even given it away as gifts at the holidays in a decorative crock (with a note to refrigerate immediately, of course).

Tastes a lot like the deli spread. I made it with sweet relish, because it's what we had, but next time I'll use dill. We felt it needed more relish, but didn't really measure it anyway. So glad to get this recipe!

This is such a good way to use up leftover ham.  I like to put it on toast or crackers.  I adjusted the amounts of the ingredients to suit our taste, but it is a really good combination of flavors.

I just made this spread and it is wonderful. I do not have a processor. I used the old crank meat grinder and it worked fine. I highly recommend this for everyone.
Thanks,
Bob

Made the recipe almost as written. I like to use a little mayo instead of all salad dressing. It adds some creaminess. Makes a good sandwich spread. I might try it next time with just straight salad dressing. But I will make it again.

I had a really low quality food box ham that was a very unpalatable texture. This recipe saved it and made it taste delicious!

My mom used to make this when we were growing up.  Tasted just like I remembered.  I made this yesterday as filling for the Salad Stuffed Shells from this site.  Used leftover ham and diced the onion.  Turned out wonderful and was a great addition to my tray.  Thanks, Pat Schwarz for posting and bringing back a nice memory for me!

As written, this recipe makes a ham salad that's too dry and a little bland for my taste.  I doubled the amount of relish (I prefer sweet to dill, but that's a minor deal), and almost doubled the mayo.  A little salt -- only a little - and pepper rounded it out and made a much tastier dish, while keeping the ham the star of the spread.

This turned out well. I didn‚Äôt have dill pickles so I used sweet pickle relish. I‚Äôll definitely make this again.

We absolutely Love it and it's so simple and quick. My daughter loves it also, so I make enough for her. Apparently  she's the only one in her family who eats it. Picky Kids.

This is almost spot on with the one my mom used to make.  She used mayo instead of salad dressing.  The other thing she would do sometimes, was to add grated cheddar cheese to the mix, spread it on English muffin halves and place under the broiler for a warm, melted, open faced sandwich.  Loved it!

Both Alex and Cece like it.   It's nothing spectacular, but with some additions such as ketchup and/or cheese on the bread when making it into a sandwich, it's doable.
