I made mine in the oven with a few minor changes to this recipe. I substituted one small fresh chopped onion, added some garlic powder and an egg and used 2 cans of soup instead of one. I put the meatballs in a casserole dish and popped them in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour and they came out perfect.

My family gave these a 5+++++.
These are easy to make I baked mine instead of doing them on the stove top.  Bake them for 1 hr. But I did everything as the recipe called for. Served them with mashed potatoes like other veiwers sugjested and salad. Will be making them again. =) =)

I took some advice from other reviewers and added 1/2 c. breadcrumbs and an egg to help hold the meatballs together.  To reduce the amount of grease in the sauce, use lean beef.  Finally, there was definitely not enough sauce; I added a jar of spaghetti sauce during the last five minutes of simmering to add quantity and flavor.  Overall, good stuff!

Great recipe! I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the tomato, tossed in a bit of oregano and it turned out fabulously. Next time, I'll cut the salt in half though.

I usually use 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of tomato sauce to thicken it up.  Also put thickly sliced green bell peppers and onions in the pot...best when baked covered in the oven

I made these meatballs with more salt and pepper, onion powder, a dash of italian seasonings and with Cambells ready to serve Cream of Tomato Soup without diluting.  I also added 2 eggs to help them bind.  I loved the flavor but with cooking the meatbals in the soup, the sauce was insanely greasy!  Next time I'll oven brown them first them simmer in sauce to cut down on grease.  Kids loved it

Like several posters here, I have been eating this since I was a kid...my mom used to make them and they were my favorite...then when I had my own kids, they loved them too...so does hubby...but adding all those other things takes away from the simplicity and great taste of the porcupines...I have started to add onion and garlic pieces...dried, to the beef...and I always use an egg to mix the beef and rice together to bind and hold together...I brown the meatballs, then when they are browned all around and cooked through, I pour both cans of tomato soup over the meat and let them cook a bit longer, on the stove top...this is definitely one of my favorites and always has been.  ps...I also have started using some bottled beef seasoning, or steak seasoning...McCormick's Montreal Steak, or Weber Gourmet Burger or Chicago Steak seasoing...or some of all together to the meat...not too much, just enough to lift out the flavor of the dish...these are so yummy!

A good starting place. I added a couple of tomatoes diced, (they needed to be used), a small can of tomato sauce, an egg and some bread crumbs.  I still had problems with them falling apart though.  I baked in the oven too.  Kids loved them! Served with mashed potatoes.

OMG, this is a great old fashioned recipe. I was just telling friends about porcupines and no one had even heard of it. This is just good old comfort food. I even use left over rice if I have any.  Keep up the good work - we love the old, easy stuff. The stuff we grew up eating.

These were awesome! I spiced them up a bit with a pinch of each rosemary, thyme, cilantro, pepper, italian seasoning, some minced onion, garlic, and seasoned salt. I also precooked longrain brown rice before making the meat balls. For the tomato soup, I used one 10 oz can tomato soup, filled that can with milk and added it to a bowl, then added one can of tomato sauce and added thyme, rosemary, ground parsley, and about two tablespoons of brown sugar. I cooked it all in the oven together for an hour at 350. It was definitely a hit!! Wonderful foundation recipe.

Great recipe, I needed a recipe without egg for my son who's allergic.  Second time I make it, I added lipton onion soup for a little more kick.

Very good flavor.  Although without an egg or something to bind it together, they fell apart on me.  Over all we really enjoyed it!

Very boring, I added extra spices and it was still dull. Nobody commented on it, nobody went for seconds. Not sure if I wold make it again. Dissapointed to be honest.

My Mom has been making this since the 50's and its the best. I make it for my family now and they love it. Sometimes and use Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Tomato soup and that is also good.

I have been making this for years and it is a great meal but I do not use instant rice and a bit of minced green pepper makes it even tastier.

I've made this for YEARS and my Mom before me - a family favorite. BUT...I use at least 2 cans of soup, 2 cans water and toward the end, one can of milk.  I like a LOT of gravy (I put in a large pot) and at the end thicken with cornstarch and water slurry.  I add more rice to the gravy at first and lots of salt of pepper and lots of creamy mashed potatoes and.....yyyuummmm.

My mother made these meatballs for many years and I've continued to make them over the years but we do it a bit differently. You definitely need an egg and some seasoned bread crumbs to bind the meat/rice mixture. I always cook some bite sized pieces of carrot and potato in water, drain off part of the water when the vegetables are done. I use two cans of tomato soup and add to the vegetables along with some chopped onion. Heat thoroughly and then add your cooked meat balls to the stew, heat and serve. Yummy!

Awesome! I added green onions and red peppers to the meatballs - so good! I also used a jar of speg. sauce instead of tomato soup. I served mine with garlic bread and steamed veggies. Next time I might add a little tomato soup to the meatballs like the recipe suggested. GOOD and EASY!

I have been making these meatballs since my mother acquired the recipe off the back of the Minute Rice box in the late 70's.  Everything is the same except it tastes better when you use Hunts tomato sauce instead of tomato soup.  The flavor is richer and more tomato taste and a thicker sauce.

This were pretty good - could have used some more flavor though!  I added minced garlic to mine and I also baked them.  I will make again because my (VERY picky) 2 yr old ate this up.  Next time, I'll use two cans of soup - it needs it.

Yummy! My mama used to make these = ) I changed it up a little...but still a great recipe!  Here are my changes: 1) Used Rice a Roni beef flavor and browned the rice before adding to meat.I added an egg and about a half c. or more of bread crumbs to make the mixture firm. I also added MORE onion and seasoning than this recipe calls... for.  2) Added the seasoning packet from the box to the soup mixture, as well as a sm. can of green chilies and about a half c. of ketchup.  3) Browned the meatballs...because I just always have any time I make them. it seems to make them hold together. I placed the balls in a baking dish and covered them evenly with the sauce. Not sure of bake time... 30-45 min depending on how well you brown them. = )

I don't feel justified in giving this a five.  Not that there's anything wrong with the recipe---only that I could not accomplish a worthy product through it. Most reviews said that grandma used to make this.  This, then, is a simple recipe that has so many nuances that only a grandma can do it right, and then not the first time. My meatballs fell apart, even with an egg included.  They had a radius of one inch, not a diameter--my fault, and a BIG one.  One can of tomato soup and a half-can of water seems awfully dry.   My meatballs wouldn't brown without falling apart.  I feel challenged!!!  We ate the residues, but, by Golly, I can do better.  Both of my grandmas are gone, as well as my mother and mother-in-law, but I'll study the comments until I can derive a WINNER.  I WANT these meatballs!!!!

Wow! thanks for the recipe.  I used to make this in the pressure cooker 10 min @ full pressure.  Sometimes I chunked up a few potatoes to cook along, the meat and tomato soup made great gravy!  Haven't had it since my presto needed a gasket seal and was told the gasket wasn't available because my cooker was obsolete!!

This is a good staple meal.  I always use a can of diced italian style tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

These were delicious and very easy to prepare. I agree with other reviews that maybe more sauce would be better. Overall, this is a great recipe.

This receipe is great as I am a working mum of a 2.5yr old, but I also made a couple of changes. I added in finely grated carrot and zuchinni into the meat mixture with a little mixed herb a cup of breadcrumbs and an egg. Also used a can of chopped tomatoes with the can of soup for the meatballs to simmer in. Delicious!

A friend of mine was having a birthday and said he really wanted these.  He described them and I was pretty suspicious, I wasn't sure I'd like them.  Well I was wrong.  These were amazing, The first batch's rice wasn't really done all the way but it was still good.  The whole thing was wonderful and I got some great pictures of them that I might add.  They're so aptly named, when I pulled the lid off of the pan the rice was sticking up just like porcupine quills.  Very cute.  Will definitely be adding this to my repertoire.

Great comfort food.  I used ground chicken instead of beef and browned the meatballs before adding the sauce. They came out great.

I have made this exact receipe for years and my kids love it.  I do use 3 cans of soup for extra sauce and serve with mashed potatoes.  My younger son is a picky eater, but loves this.  I make at least 3 times a month for dinner.  Quick and easy.

I have loved these since I was a little kid! Awesome served with mashed potatoes and veggies.  I do my own thing with these too and made a few variations to it. I put onion flakes (or diced onion), some beef boullion, dry mustard, pepper, an egg, and crushed soda crackers if needed and Minit Rice in the meat. I brown them then put them in the sauce in the oven and bake at 350 for an hour or so.  Also for the sauce I use two cans of tomato soup, put a dash or two of soya sauce in it, add spices to your own taste (I put basil and salt and pepper in it as well as the soya sauce).. or  use one can of soup and a jar of pasta sauce. If you want to try something different you can use chunky sauces or four cheese pasta sauce.. whatever your heart desires.  These are easy and a big hit in our house!

I used long-grain white rice instead of the instant and doubled the amount of simmering time, and it still never got done all the way.  Next time I think I will precook the rice.  My husband and kids still ate it though and said it tasted good, aside from the crunchy rice.  I did double the soup since we prefer a lot of sauce.  It's a really fun recipe though, so I will give it another chance for sure.

These turned out very good.  I did have to add another can of tomato soup.  And I accidentally used regular rice instead of instant.  So I simmered them about twice as long to make sure the rice got tender.  Definitely good over some plain rice or mashed potatoes.

Great recipe. Easy, quick. I did add an egg as a binder for the meat, and threw in some bread crumbs I had leftover. Also used half a jar of marina sauce (along with the tomato soup), and a small onion.   Was super moist, boyfriend loved it. Will be making again.

This is an old recipe my mom used to make when I was a kid.  But we used tomato juice instead of soup to simmer the meatballs in after they were browned.  We also threw in large chunks of peeled potatoes at the same time.  By the time the potatoes are done, so are the meatballs.  Love it!

My family loved these meatballs. I also used 1 egg, and instead of 1 can of tomato soup, I ended up using 3 just so there was enough sauce!

Made a few changes to this recipe. Instead of water, I used one can of skim milk. I also included one teaspoon of Worchester sauce to the soup and milk. Served this with mashed potatoes and bread, the family loves it! It's a great comfort meal.

These were horrible!  Very bland!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and did not like the final outcome at all.  The meatballs definetly need bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  They were too dry, and not enough flavor!

These were wonderful & extremely easy to make.  There was not enough sauce, so, next time I would double the tomato soup mixture.  I would also use less salt than what the receipe calls for.  Leftovers were a little dry.  I will be making this again.

I made these with ground turkey and Knorr's tomato basil soup mix - very low in fat.  I think that they'd be better with beef (what isn't?!) but if you're trying to cut back on the fat and cholesterol turkey is a good way to go.

Just like mom used to make!! The only change I make is I use 3 cans of Campbell’s tomato soup and increase the water accordingly, but we like the extra tomato sauce over the meat meatballs :)

I followed the recipe for ingredients except substituted tomato soup for the tomato sauce & then used a little less water. I also used brown rice. We enjoyed the meatballs.

This is a great recipe-for those who say it needs more soup-I always double this recipe and I use Worchestershire Sauce in the soup ! Tablespoon, no other  changes needed! Leftovers can always be frozen. We never have leftovers; there are 6 of us!
Enjoy!

Thanks for reminding me of this childhood fav.  Mom used to make them in the pressure cooker, but I baked mine in my cast iron skillet @350 for about 40 mins. Smellin' yum! And yes I did add a little more seasoning as I have big girl tastes now...just a little garlic powder and an egg to help bind them.  I only needed 1 can of soup but I added about 3/4c of water instead of the 1/2...was still nice and thick.

My mother used to make these, so I am slightly biased, ya know, nothing is as good as a childhood memory.  Use lean ground beef, and skip the instant rice, use real white.  Add an egg and a couple tablespoons of breadcrumbs in the meat mixture.  Saute the onions with fresh garlic if you have time.  It's a little sweet with tomato soup, I'm going to try a good tomato sauce next time.

I have been making these for many years but a little different. I add a little liquid smoke, a little rice in the sauce and bake them. And I have to say they aren't one of my favorite dishes but good for a change.

This was an interesting item.  They were much better the next day - after the rice had time to soak in the juices.

When making the meatballs, I add some Italian spices.  I don't add any soup mixture so they stick together a bit better.  Instead of mixing soup with water, mix with milk for a richer sauce.  Also, I bake mine in the oven - cover with foil and bake for about 50 minutes at 350 degrees.  Kids love these.  I love them with lots of salt!  Great comfort food - reminds me of mom!

I agree with many other reviewers.  These were incredibly bland, I won't make this recipe again.

This was a good recipe. Wasn't the one that I had lost, as that one was baked, but still good!

I thought this recipe was a little bland, but it was a big hit with my kids and easy and quick to make too.

Pretty bland, I much prefer the zesty meatball recipe (also found on this site) to this one.

It was a nice memory of what my mom used to make and it's good comfort food, but the meatballs fell apart on me and I feel like the sauce could use a little more of a kick.

Not a bad recipe.  It was filling, but missing something.

Very good.  Reminds me of my mom's meatballs when I was a kid.  Good comfort food.
