I hate to say this, but this was by far the worst thing I've ever cooked.  It was truly gross. I can't believe I put this in front of my children.

I am a vegetarian and I loved this.  I miss the richness of a good meat sauce, and even my semi-carnivore husband liked this.  I doctored up the spices a little, and used zucchini instead of okra as we don't care for okra.  When you first make it, you will think it'll never taste good, but give a good 24 hours in a crockpot, and you wil be pleased.

Sorry to say, but this really was not even edible.  Not sure what was wrong since I followed the recipe exactly.

I really, really wanted to like this . The other 2 1 star reviewer were right on.
