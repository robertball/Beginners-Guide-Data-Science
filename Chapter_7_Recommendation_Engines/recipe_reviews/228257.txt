I chopped up fresh parsley and dill and added them to recipe.  I used olive oil instead of avocado oil to iron skillet. Lamb burgers came out delicious and moist.  In fact, they were better than the ones I had in restaurant.  I made sure that the meat thermometer read 145 degrees.  Served with crumbled feta cheese on top. My husband couldn't get over how good it was.  He is on the no carb diet.

Couldn't get any lamb last minute but it was super tasty with ground beef too! The soy sauce really gives it a nice kick! Super easy and will make many more times.

Double the soy sauce and stick the patties in the freezer for 20 minutes to set. DELICIOUS!

I found this recipe when I needed a 'quick fix' dinner  using ground lamb.  These were very good - I used olive oil - served with potatoes and a veggie.  Good comfort food.

These are the best burgers Iâ€™ve ever had. Seriously, I even ate these with a low carb bun and it was absolutely delicious. I used beef instead since I can find that more easily.

These lamb burgers were really good! I used coconut aminos instead of the soy sauce. The coconut aminos covered up that lamby taste that I don't care for. Instead of feta I put a slice of provolone. Added some sauteed onions on top. So good!

I doubled the amount of low sodium soy sauce and fried these up in a cast iron skillet with olive oil. They were perfect.

So good you don't even need a bun. Great flavor!!! Will put the onion in food processor to chop fine the next time but that is just a preference of textures (and chopping abilities ??)

Made this with ground beef, and olive oil. Husband loved them and wanted me to keep the recipe! Doubled the soy sauce as some suggested. Definitely would do that again!

This was so easy!  I was looking for a recipe with little prep and using ingredients I already had.  This fit the bill, but I was skeptical.  However, it delivered!  I prepared it as described and then grilled them.  It was excellent.  I will perhaps add some additional experimental spices, but the base of soy sauce and onion is a keeper.  I didn't have feta, but I had some crumbled bleu cheese, and that worked out great too.

Wow! Never had lamb burgers before and these were awesome just as a patty without a bun! I didn't use any oil in the pan (because I forgot), but it didn't stick to the pan and I didn't need it. Next time I'm going to make the Chef John's Tzatski sauce and Chef John's pita bread on this site to go with this burger!
