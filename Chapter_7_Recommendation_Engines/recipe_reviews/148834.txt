We wanted a new potato recipe for our Christmas Day Brunch that didn't include cheese.  We live close to the Amish in Ohio and know that there cooking is excellent so I tried this recipe.

We called them potato pancakes as that is what thy looked like.  They were AWESOME!  Everyone loved them.  I made them at home and kept them warm in the oven before we traveled.  Then, kept them warm in my relatives oven before serving.  The only difference is they lose their crispiness by being in the oven which is fine for some.  I like them crunchy right out of the pan!

Also, I was in a hurry and forgot to add the onions.  Nobody seemed to miss them!

These are more like Onion Ring Patties then hash browns.  If you like onion rings, you will love these!  They may not be the best choice for breakfast though.  

Turn your heat to medium rather than medium high, or you will burn them to a crisp.

This Recipe was quite tasty...I used onion powder instead of fresh onion and I also had fried up bacon to go along with the Hash Browns and used some of the bacon grease with some oil...would make this again...

I also used red potoatoes, like another reviewer and left the skins on. I put them through my food processer to shred them, along with the onion. I did cut the recipe in half, and added 1/2 tsp. dried dill weed, and 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley flakes, and also a ran a couple of cloves of garlic through the processor with the potatoes and onions. I used peanut oil to fry them in, instead of regular veg. oil. My husband really liked them, and I thought they were very good also, although they do tend to be on the greasy side.

These are actually called 'potato cakes' or 'bleanies' in my area, but we don't use cornmeal or baking powder (they are much better without those 2 ingredients).

5 out of 5 with my changes-- I used only one egg, lots of Mrs. Dash, no oil, and broiled 5 minutes per side. (I lined my broiler pan with foil, sprayed PAM right underneath when placing the raw potato cakes and again when I flipped them and they didn't stick.)

Tried these today. Mixture was fairly wet & sloppy but they stayed together well in the pan and didn't break up when you try to turn them. tasted great.

I halved the recipe and followed it exactly, except I used onion powder instead of the onion. I got 5 big, yummy patties out of the batter. Tastewise, these were fantastic! However, they have a tendency to burn, and you really have to watch them; I had two of my patties char a little bit. Overall, these really are great hash browns, and they are quick too! Thanks for sharing.

These were Great! I made them this morning and didn't take but 10 min to prep. I also didn't have any cornmeal to i didn't add that or the baking powder. Oh and I added 1/2 tsp of onion powder since I don't like onions but love the flavor. Turned out to be the perfect amount. Will be making these again in the future :) happy cooking!

Should be called potatoe pancakes: Mine didnt turn out nothing like the pic. My potatoes were shredded to a bit finer bcuz I didnt use a shredder. One could not taste the potatoes at all.  You could smell it while baking but that's about it. The flour, cornmeal, and egg overpowered the potatoes -

I used red potatoes and left the skins on. I used dried minced onions instead of fresh. I omitted the baking powder, and added garlic powder.

Overall, these weren't any different from regular latkes that I make every Hanukkah.  They tasted great, and my husband loved them.

This was a good starter recipe for me.  I changed the method some and squeezed the potato shreds dry to get a LOT of the water out.  Helped tremendously!  I also cut the recipe down to suit 2-3 people.  I did not use anywhere near as much oil or onion and added some garlic powder to give more flavor punch.

Very tasty, next time though I won't add any oil to pan to fry them as turned out a bit too greasy but nothing patting them with paper towels couldn't "fix". I shredded the onion on the same box shredder I did the potatoes on and worked perfectly. Did make 1/2 the recipe as written and the other 1/2 with some additions, both ways were very good. Will be saving this recipe and making again. Thank you.

These were delish, leave out the 1/3 cup of oil to the mixture, you are already cooking it in oil, no need for all that extra fat. Make sure it's a small onion you are using, I pureed a bit of the mixture just so it would bind better. This recipe is going to added to our Sunday brunch recipes!!!

Yum-oH!  I followed the ingredients with the exception of corn meal (added extra flour) and used egg-replacer instead of real eggs. Kids LOVED them. Not a healthy food by any stretch of the imagination however I feel smidge better giving the kids these instead of McDonalds!

These were delicious!!  I added a little more oil than it called for when frying.  Maybe about a 1/4 c worth.  I also fried them on medium instead of medium high heat.  I could barely taste the onion in it and we aren't big onion fans.

These are the True Amish hash browns.  Always figured McDonalds got their recipe of hash browns from this old one.  They're excellent because of the corn meal, which adds PLUS vitamins!  After 30 plus years of making these, they are still VERY GOOD!!

Really yummy they had a nice texture. The only hard part is shredding the potatoes.  I will definitely be making this for the family again.

Very good.  We left the skins on and shredded the potatoes with a mandolin. We all used a little sour cream and/or ketchup...yum;)  ps be careful not too make them too thick

These were easy to make and taste great.  I left out the onion and replaced with onion powder.  Didnt use a lot of oil in the pan.  Will be making these a lot.

Tasted great. I did ease up on the oil, as I was frying them any way. Was easy and turned out great. Will make again.

Made these with leftover mashed potatoes, didn't have any cornmeal so just used breadcrumbs and they came out delicious.  I also added some garlic salt for flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I've tried making these twice--the last time on a griddle at 400 degrees.  Enjoy the flavor but no matter how thin I spread them mine come out "doughy".

I made these using half the amount of oil in the recipe and cooked them in my waffle iron. Yum, the family loved them. The next morning I made Eggs Benedict using the Amish Hash Brown as the base, a slice of Capicola meat, poached egg and then topped it with a home made cheese sauce and chives. I can't wait to make these for guests!

Interesting twist on potato pancakes (latkes) adding cornmeal.

I made these for a family dinner and they were a big hit!  I made some fried in the oil like it says, and some on a griddle without oil.  The ones in oil tasted a bit better and were definitely crispier, but they were VERY oily, so for a little less grease the ones on the griddle were still good!

These are excellent, and great reheated in the oven too! 
The only change I made was to use less oil in the recipe, just drizzled in a bit of olive oil.  Will definitely make them again.

This is really good! I made this for dinner using my electric salad grater and was  it very easy to make. I changed a couple things like adding the oil directly to the ingredients and then cooked them on a gas stove in larger portions (I think I made five patties) ten minutes on each side at medium heat. Came out pleasantly brown and appetizing! A keeper!

Loved it - crispy on the outside and good texture on the inside. I would have added less onion and I made sure to dry the grated potatoes in some paper napkin before adding them to the flour mixture. I also added some scallion for colour. Served the hash browns with some goat cheese mixed with scallion. Absolutely lip-smacking good!

Needs black pepper, and grating the onion avoids any harsh raw onion taste.  The cornmeal gives a slight sweetness so a little syrup on them works, sweet applesauce, or ketchup.

I don't often rush to write a review right away, but this recipe is worth it! Delightfully brown and crisp. Beware, they will go quickly! I tweaked a little; I did not peel the potatoes, and I added some garlic powder and some pepper, and cut the added oil by one tablespoon. This is already in my recipe box!

A variation I tried was to use sweet potatoes for for half of the shredded potato.  Excellent both ways.
