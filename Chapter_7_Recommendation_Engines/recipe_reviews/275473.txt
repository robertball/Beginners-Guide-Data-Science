Simple and good. I did end up adding another tomatillo because the ones at the store were really small this time of year. I know this sounds crazy but if you use fresh fried tortilla chips instead of the pre-packaged kind, the sauce almost has a fried green tomato taste to it. While I did like this sauce, I still prefer the more traditional all green tomatillo sauce.
