My family liked this recipe. I made a few changes. I omitted the pecans and added raisins instead. Added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added a 1/3 cup more water. They came out great. Try serving them with Mexican Atole. Yummy.

This recipe is a lot of work and we did not the texture or taste. I brought these to work and no one I work with liked them either. This just didn't work for us. Carolyn,Orange,Texas
