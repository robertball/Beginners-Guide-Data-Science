Great concept!  Of course, I changed several of the ingredients to fit what I had in the fridge and only used chicken (cut in strips).  But, the marinade was surprisingly good even without the ginger.  This is definitely a dish that I will continue to cook...a great light summer meal!

So good! Minor adjustments...I used what I had in stock, so instead of sherry or broth, I used some cooking white wine. I made it with chicken, added all the veggies, minus the salad greens,cilantro, and oranges (since I didn't have). I have frozen veggies, so steamed those up, and cooked with the seasonings and added the cooked chicken, rice, and veggies together, and it was THE BEST!  Hubby and son loved it! Thanks :)

WOW! No joke! I thought the reviews were a little over the top, but I have to admit it was darn good. I think that the marinade could be used in many other dishes. It was PHENOMINAL!!! FYI though skip the cilantro....totally not necessary.

This was very tasty.  My whole family enjoyed it and asked me to make it again.  I made a few changes based on our preferences.  I used all chicken, and substituted sugar snap peas for the broccoli.  Instead of naval oranges I used a can of mandarin oranges.  I did use mixed salad greens, but the next time I make it I am going to use all spinach.  This recipe is very versatile and is a great starting place if you like to 'make it your own', but is also great just as written.

I made this when my husband and I decided to start losing weight together. It was so tasty even our 7 year old asked to take some in his lunch the next day to school.

This recipe was excellent!  It is a light and tasty meal that is easily modified to include whatever produce is in season.   I didn't have timne to marinate the meat long enough, so I sprinkled on some Montreal Steak seasoning as it cooked.  It was a good shortcut.  This will be great meal for summertime...

This salad was excellent! It does take a lot of prep, so for us it is more of a weekend dinner rather than a weeknight. I used a can of mandarin oranges to make it easier. I used the chicken broth rather than the sherry, and it was really good. Definitely use the cilantro, it adds so much flavor! In order to allow premium leftovers, we left the meat, veggies, and salad separate and then stored each in separate containers. Thank you so much for a delicious, healthy dinner!

Great idea to put stir-fry on top of a fresh bed of salad greens! I never would have thought of it. I usually add them to the last minute or two of cooking, but this way wilts the greens without any more effort. Plus, it keeps a few crisp. I left out the beef. The marinade was excellent; I loved the chili pepper and the ginger together. Because it was a cold night, we also put red rice on the bottom. Thanks!

This was just ok. We followed the directions completely and it turned out bland.  I can't imagine someone proposing based on this recipe.

Loved this recipe!  I've made it several times and the family loves it.  I did cut back the amount of ginger and chile powder because we don't like it too spicy.

Awesome, a delicious marinade, and stir-fry. I used chicken broth, fresh Ginger, chicken only, canned mandarin oranges. Cut chicken and onions in marinade for about 4 hrs. Cut rest of veggies up stored in separate bag. Then cooked drained chicken and onions. After that cooked rest of veggies. Put it altogether and served over greens and oranges! Easy and delicious! Thank you for recipe.

I'm giving this a review because it is a GREAT start to many different things and wanted to give my take on how I made the sauce. I wanted something other than your typical "soy sauce/water" combo for stir fry. With a few tweeks after trying it as written, this is what I came up with.. Use this recipe for using the marinade as a sauce for stir fry:

3/4 cup chicken broth
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup water
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon cayenne 
2 gloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons corn starch 

The mixture will seem thin before mixing it in with your veggies, but it will thicken up after it is saut√©ed in your wok or pan.

I will say though, I think the marinade/sauce is GREAT as written for a marinade for meat, but as a sauce, you need to cut down on the salt or else it's too salty (hence the changes). I hope this is helpful!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  Definitely edible but a very confusing dish.  Followed the recipe almost as written, substituted the mandarin oranges for regular.  marinade nothing to write home about.  could have done this recipe with one or the other meat, no real reason to have both.  Used the mandarin oranges but maybe should have used fresh and taken off the skin so that the juice could have come through and into the sauce.   Otherwise there is no purpose for the oranges either. The cilantro is necessary if you want to taste cilantro, otherwise, don't know why it is in here.
This recipe is more like having all 3 courses of your meal in one.  Saves on dishes for serving but not on dishes used for cooking and keeping warm.
Definitely edible, if you have all these ingredients and need to use them all up.  Otherwise, i don't recommend.  I won't be making again, not even the marinade.

This was very good. Maybe my expectations were heightened too much by the other reviews, but I thought it was just "very good." My husband, on the other hand, raved about it and asked if he could take the rest of it to work for lunch the next day.

We tried this recipe tonight and there is no doubt it will become a standard meal for us.  This is an exceptional blend of flavors!  If you are looking for something new and more healthy for your family look no further.  I did skip the ginger (not a big fan).  Go ahead, add this one to your recipe box.  Do it!!
