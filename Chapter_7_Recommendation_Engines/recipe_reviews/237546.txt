This recipe is totally forgiving. We really liked the thickness of the recipe. The basil was wonderful but felt you could leave it out with the SPAM in it, but totally have it in the recipe if you used a breakfast sausage. It's a keeper for sure. One note....don't use baking paper cups...found out really quick they stick....foil baking cups. LOVED THEM!!!

I was craving spam one day, so I decided to make this recipe. Itâ€™s pretty good, but the taste of spam can be overwhelming. I would either replace it with ham, or decrease the spam and add more onions to offset its saltiness.

Quite dry. I made them exactly as written. I don't think I'll make them again.

I replaced the onion with green onions and the spam with ham, plus I added a large chopped tomato and some chives. The muffins were delicious! Lots of chunks of tasty stuff relative to the amount of dough. A very good base recipe for adding variations. Next time I think bill add some red capsicum.
