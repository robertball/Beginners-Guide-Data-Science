YUM! Great recipe. I do have to confess I didn't use cilantro because I'm not a fan (I know, I'm Hispanic and don't like cilantro - go figure) but I KNOW this dressing would be superb with it for those who are fans. Aside from the missing cilantro, I kept to the rest of the vinaigrette by using a fresh squeezed orange and two cloves of garlic. Note: don't be crabby to find dressing at the bottom of your salad; even with little oil the flavor manages to cling to every bite! A lot of flavor. This is a refreshing change from the usual dressings. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious - even with only 1 Tbsp of olive oil, other than that I didn't change a thing!  All I had to do was put all the ingredients into a mini food processor and let it go. It has a sweet, tangy citrus flavor that was perfect over mixed greens.

Using fresh Meyer lemon juice (my young tree is finally producing)and some orange juice, this was wonderful.  Served over field greens and baby spinach with some mandarin slices and almond slivers, this was delicious.

This was a very light salad dressing. I like a lot, very good flavor but I just thought it was a little too much vinegar. I would try reducing the amount of vinegar next time.

This recipe was great, I used fresh orange juice, but next time I think I may try bought orange juice, for some reason I think it would be more flavorful. Either way, it was quick and easy!

I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so used white and apple cider vinegar.  Also, I didn't have cilantro, so that was omitted.  Still, a wonderful light, tangy and sweet dressing.

Loved it! Delicious, light, and low calorie. Like other people have said, I thought it was a bit too vinegar-y...I ended up tinkering a bit and was happy with it when I added 1/2 a cup of rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tsp honey and an extra dash of orange juice.

Very good light dressing.  I didn't change a thing and it tasted amazing!  I may try the juice of an orange next time instead of using orange juice.  Goodbye bottled salad dressing....this is definately a keeper!!!

Unfortunately I didn't have any fresh cilantro, orange juice or dijon mustard, I ended up adding more honey and a clear fruit punch and squeezed a few fresh oranges, other than that it was very good, and had rave reviews from the in-laws. Next time I will try it with the missing ingredients.

Really good recipe, however wayy too vinegary for me. I choked on it and had to change the honey addition from 1 teas to about 2 Tbl. Go by taste. No cilantro used-don't like it.
If sufficiently sweetened, it's a great recipe.

Delicious, I used powdered mustard in a pinch and it was yummy.  I added some sweet basil.  Over spinach with red, orange, and yellow peppers with cucumber and scallions.

I was looking for a light dressing for my salad tonight and this worked great! Mixed greens, blueberries, peaches, tomato, scallion, fresh basil (yes, a hodge-podge as it's just me tonight!)...topped with this vinaigrette-it was a nice FRESH and light addition! I skipped the cilantro since I didn't have it and didn't want it in here even if I did have it. Also was lazy and didn't feel like mincing garlic, though not entirely necessary, I'm sure it would've been a fine addition.

This was good but thin. It doesn't use much oil so I expected this and wasn't sure how much the dijon and honey would thicken it. Some thought it was too vinegary but I actually thought it was quite "orange-y" instead. I substituted white wine vinegar for the rice vinegar though and didn't have cilantro. I added a couple of dashes of ground coriander to get that brightness that the cilantro adds but should have added more. All in all, this is easy and refreshing. I reduced it to 1/6 of the recipe and it made 1/4 cup.

Delicious!  I left out the honey and it was plenty sweet for me, but probably extra good with it in there:).  I served over mixed greens with avocado and feta.  So tasty!

I leave out the cilantro (more for how I am using the dressing than the cilantro taste), but this works beautifully for a general go-to vinaigrette.  Love it in a grilled asparagus and salmon salad (adapted from Bonefish Grill).

Quick and easy.  I didn't exactly measure out the olive oil, dijon, garlic (used 2 cloves), or honey, but it worked well.  Didn't have cilantro, so I didn't use it.  But, it was a great, easy dressing that I made in a pinch.  Will make it again and again.

Very good! I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so used red wine vinegar instead, so I'm not sure how much of an impact that had. I did think it was a bit tangy, so added more honey to taste. Thanks!

I added another clove of garlic, 1/4 cup of olive oil and another teaspoon of honey since it was too vinegary.  Also more cilantro to taste and a tablespoon of grated mild onion. Put in a blender on high for around 30 seconds. It went perfectly  with baby spinach , arugula, beets, feta cheese and candied pecans,,, so satisfying!

When I got out the ingredients to make it, i notice dhow much axid/citrus tere was compared to the small amout of oil. It was way too tart and too thin. I adjusted it with more oil and more honey untill I got it to taste reasonable, but by then I hada large volume of dressing!

I just made this for a kale salad (I'm recreating a local BBQ place's recipe,) and it is SO good! I added a bit of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of jalapeno juice for a bit of added zing. I will definitely be making it again!

Too bitey; even with reducing rice vinegar and increasing honey an extra teaspoon.  Not liked by 3/3 in my home.

I was hoping for something that would taste like a deli salad, but didn't care for this.

To vinegary. I'll try it again, but cut back on the vinegar, replacing it with more oj. also needs salt & pepper.

Very citrus-tangy. I added a little extra oil, was very liquidy. No cilantro. Added a dash of salt and pepper, blended in my NINJA for about 3 quickpulses. Amazing!!

This was a light and tasty change from my usual dijon vinagrette. I used 3 tbs rice wine vineagar and let the garlic sit in it a minute before adding the other ingredients. Used a good Maille dijon and threw in an extra tablespoon of evoo. I didn't have cilantro but bet that would be even better. Ate it immediately over black beans & romaine, but think this will be even tastier tomorrow when the flavors meld.

Worst ever!!!!!!  Too acidic, no balance. Had to add more honey, salt and orange peel to even taste the orange. I hesitated before making...should have followed my gut!  Lola

I was not crazy about this as a salad dressing.  My family, however, liked it.  I will try it again as a marinade.

I put more olive oil in there, it was a bit acidic. But the flavor was excellent.

Light and fresh tasting. Great for a summer salad.
