I did not have yukons, so I used new potatoes instead. Still was delicious.  I did add the juice of a half a lemon and a scant teaspoon of dried oregano.  Yes I will make it again!

Simply outstanding, truly enjoyed this dish.  Thank you Diana. Have a greek friend who says also great with rice in place of potatos and she sometimes adds chicken thighs, she browns them first in the same pan then lets them simmer with the rest of ingredients.

Excellent! I add a pinch of cinnamon-sounds funny but it’s added unexpectedly in some Greek dishes. There is not so much that you taste the flavor of the cinnamon-but that little pinch adds something.  Thank you for the lovely Greek recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I did use runner beans. This is true Mediterranean food. A few simple, real ingredients cooked naturally. This goes well with a chunk of cheese and crusty bread. Thank you for the recipe.

Really a wonderful dish. I grated  Roma tomatoes and used a small amount of Cavender’s Greek seasoning. Cooked till beans were soft. Just the way we Southern gals like them! Topped with a little feta cheese.

Comfort food at its best! The feta really makes it. Loved it with crusty bread. Will try again if I can find romano beans - I have a feeling they make it even better.

my experience making this dish the first time was, well. serendipitous. During prep I realized I had no tomatoes. I decided to substitute tomato sauce. after reduction, the result. was delicious.
