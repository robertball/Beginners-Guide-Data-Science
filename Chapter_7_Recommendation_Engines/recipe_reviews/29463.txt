Everyone raved over this recipe and wanted a copy of it. I would recommend perhaps a sauce for over it, as the recipe does not have one. I whipped up a Parmesan sauce that went great with the shells.

With the cup of mayo, I added about 10oz fresh crab meat from the grocery store and a 8oz bag of cooked "salad shrimp" (thawed), onion, cheese, and little bit of old bay seasoning. VERY TASTY! However, even with the increased meat, i feel it still could've used a little less mayo. I actually placed the seafood mix in a dish and into the oven to warm it up prior to stuffing the shells... Also, as suggested by another review, I lightly topped the shells with a warm parmesan sauce (bar of cream cheese, 1/2c parm cheese, 3/4c milk, dash of pepper & nutmeg- microwaved in a bowl for 7-8 min until creamy). This dish was a nice accent to our steamed zucchini... THANKS!

This was not very good.  It was the only dish on our menu that was untouched for the most part.  I think it is the mayo/miracle whip...  and the celery added a strange flavor that didn't make sense to me.  I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe turned out really good for my family.  Here's what I did differently, I did not add the minced celery because my boyfriend couldn't not find it in the store and I did not feel like chopping up real celery. Also, he said he could not find shredded Swiss cheese so I winded up cutting a block of Swiss cheese into tiny pieces. I also put it in the oven for a few mins and my boyfriend make alfredo sauce from scratch which I poured over top of the shells and put back in the oven for about 10-15mins

Made as written except that I took the advice of another reviewer and added some Old Bay. These were tasty and we enjoyed every bite. The only change I would make the next go around is to add a little more onion.

I made this for my family and it was a big hit. We love cheese so I melted some white shredded cheddar over the top. This will definitely be one of my “go to” meals.

I liked it a lot. Used mayo instead of Miracle Whip due to preference. Otherwise I followed as written. I didn’t need all the noodles though. I filled them pretty full for dinner instead of appetizer. Really good.

I really, really did not care for this one.  There was just something in the flavor, possibly from the miracle whip, that I just did not care for.  I might try again with mayonnaise, but probably not.
