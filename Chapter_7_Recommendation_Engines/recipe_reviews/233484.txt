This was a great sandwich! I did add a slice of cheddar cheese which was tasty!  This is a great way to have that Thanksgiving flavor in a quick way at any time of the year!

Sorry Butterball.  Wasn't a fan.  I was surprised, because I like all the flavors together, but the cranberry sauce just overtook the sandwich and made it gooshy and overly sweet.  I even tried remaking it with the dijionnaise in hopes to cut down the sweetness, and still wasn't a fan.

I couldn't find the Butterball brand so subbed store brand. While I'm not a huge turkey fan, especially that of the processed lunchmeat variety, I but was pleasantly surprised by the maple honey flavor. But this sandwich wasn't a favorite of mine. I guess I'm not much for savory turkey and sweet cranberry sauce together. For the cranberry sauce I whipped up Festive Holiday Cranberry Relish from this site (it is actually a sauce, not a relish). The sandwich looks beautiful when put together but just didn't suit my palate.

I made this up for my husband and he said they were ok. They would be better if made with homemade cranberry sauce.

This sandwich is deliciousness!!  A sandwich shop in the area makes this but adds stuffing to it and serves it on a roll.  So I did the same, using cornbread stuffing.  We both loved it, and it will definitely be a repeat with Thanksgiving leftovers.

As someone who refuses to let her cranberry sauce mingle with any other foods at Thanksgiving, I should have known I wouldn't care for this. My oldest son and I both decided to try it - neither cared for it. We finished our sandwiches but I would not fix it again. The mayo and cranberry mixture I believe are what killed it for me - it was just too odd of a flavor combo.

I used homemade rye bread and baby spinach along with the turkey and cranberries.  I think this was as good as the roast turkey it started from.  Thanks, Butterball !

When thinking about this health conscientious - you have fruit, grain, vegetable, protein, and minimal oil/fat. This is a great quick lunch to end on a full note. It's the thanksgiving sandwich you don't have to feel guilty for!

It gets 3 stars because you have to put cream cheese on one of the slices of bread.

We did not care for the cranberry sauce on this. But with that being said the turkey was fantastic. Very flavorful!

Delicious sandwich!  My family went crazy over it.  The cranberry gave it just the right hint of "Thanksgiving."

After all these years, I finally asked myself "...why am I eating this only during the Holidays, I love this sandwich?"  You can buy Butterball turkey at the deli all year,  open a can of cranberry sauce any time, and you're good to go.  I'm not a fan of smoky turkey (actually any smoky food), so the sweetness of the maple honey turkey and the cranberry sauce was a win-win in this house.

I loved this sandwich! I have purchased similar sandwiches for lunch and had no idea how easy it was. I always assumed the cranberry sauce was some type of special, time-consuming, to put together sauce. For the bread I used Ecce Panis multi-grain boule. It worked very well for this. I thought the maple honey turkey went with the cranberry sauce too, versus some other spicy or smoked flavored turkey. Only change I made was using lite mayo with olive oil and basically cutting the suggested amount in half which was plenty. I am also going to try the shredded lettuce again. It made the lettuce less dry. I just used a large piece of romaine, washed and dried it, and cut it into strips with a pair of scissors. Thanks!

I wasn't so sure we were going to love this sandwich, but we really did! The cranberry sauce added a nice and unexpected flavor. We did skip the mayonnaise -- I don't like it and BF didn't think he would like it with the cranberry sauce -- but otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Very tasty...thanks, Butterball!

LOVED this! I look forward to Thankgiving leftovers just so I can make this sandwich the next day (except I also add stuffing). I really never think to make this any other time of year, but I should b/c I absolutely love the tart/sweet with the turkey, crunchy lettuce and creamy mayo. Great sandwich..YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I usually  make this sandwich after Thanksgiving with leftover turkey (which freezes nicely.) Butterball lunch meat is available in the deli all year. The savory-sweet meat balances nicely with the sweet-tart cranberry sauce. If you like more crunch, like I do, you can either toast the bread or add more lettuce. Delicious!

I totally love this sandwich.  Anyone who knows me knows that my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving!  Mine always includes a Butter Ball Turkey.  My favorite leftovers is the coveted turkey sandwich.  I pile it high too with all of the ingredients in this recipe plus some leftover dressing (if there is any).  I made this exactly as written with the exception of the turkey it self. It was Butter Ball, but the Maple Honey wasn't available in my area so I used their fully cooked deep-fried turkey breast which I sliced and put on the sandwich.  The results were FANTASTIC!

I wasn't a huge fan.  Too me there needed to be a more prominent crunch factor and I didn't care for the mayo/cranberry mix.

Quick, easy, and very tasty - this makes for a wonderful lunch.   I used whole grain bread (preference) and it was a hit.

This sandwich was easy to put together for a quick workday lunch. There were mixed reviews in my house.  My husband was a big fan and thought the sweet & tart cranberry sauce with the savory turkey and hearty 15 grain wheat bread were perfect together.  He gave the sandwich 5 stars.  I personally did not care for the cranberry sauce on the sandwich and would have given the sandwich 3 stars.  I think if I made an aioli mixing the mayo and the cranberry sauce together I would like it better because it wouldn't be such a strong cranberry flavor.  If you are a big cranberry sauce fan though - give it a try!

This is SO GOOD. I actually had posted a very similar sandwich recipe to my blog this past January because these flavors just go beautifully together! I use only about 2 tsp of mayo on mine, and sometimes like to add provolone or swiss cheese and maybe some sliced dill pickles to change it up. This time I made it just as stated (just with a little less mayo, and used romaine leaves instead of shredded lettuce) and it is a FANTASTIC sandwich - perfect to pack and enjoy at work. Yumm! :)
