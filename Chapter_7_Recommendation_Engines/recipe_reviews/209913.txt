The gravy was easy to make and had a great consistency.  If only there was some taste other than such strong soy sauce, this would be great!

This was great!  I actually substituted steak sauce for the soy sauce & it was very flavorful!  I will use this recipe again!

I felt that this was a flavorless gravy.  I appreciate the submission though.  Thank you.
