They were very bitter.  I halved the recipe, but used the entire 1/4 sup of chocolate chips (and I'd use mini if you have them). THANKS for the recipe!

I normally don't like chocolate chips in my pancakes so to make the pancake still sweet without them I added some cinnamon and honey to it. With a touch of maple syrup Delicious!!

Mostly as is it was rather bitter, I imagine it would have been even worse and possibly unsalvageable if I had added as much baking powder as called for.  I used only 1 tablespoon not three.  I tasted one of the first pancakes that were cooked and they tasted rather bitter so I modified the recipe by adding, didn't measure anything, cinnamon, nutmeg and some agave.  After the modifications it tasted much better.

Before or after mods the pancakes were flat and almost crepes.  I even added a smidge more baking powder just in case the 3 tablespoons was not a mistype.  There was no difference in thinness either way.

I don't think I will make this recipe again....instead I think I will just use my regular recipe and just add the chips to it instead.

My 12  year old took one bite and said "bitter". I used 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Next time, I will lower the baking soda to 1 tablespoon and increase the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  Its not bad though, give it a try.

Great taste, I used powdered stevia instead of sugar. I will probably use a bit more next time.

Very good basic recipe. I did notice that the baking powder is an extraordinary amount, I only added 3 teaspoons of baking powder, not 3 tablespoons! Also, instead of adding the chocolate chips to the batter, I added them to each pancake after they were on the griddle, then flipped once they were ready to turn. They are more evenly distributed. With changes-- it is a great recipe!

Used egg whites and doubled them.  I whipped to a froth first which made the pancakes really fluffy.  I added cinnamon with a bit more sugar.  I also used Almond Milk.
