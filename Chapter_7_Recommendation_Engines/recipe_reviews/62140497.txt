I loved everything about this except how thin the gravy is., and perhaps too much onion. I don't know if thicker gravy is an American thing, but I've made a similar cornstarch thickened gravy using chicken broth and beef bullion  but without the red wine that I thought was a wonderful compliment to the sausage and mash.

I didn't have any beef broth, so I eliminated that step altogether, making the gravy thick and glossy. It was lovely over the potatoes. I served it with Brussels Sprouts sauteed in browned butter with pecans. The green, white and reddish browns looked fabulous on the plate.
