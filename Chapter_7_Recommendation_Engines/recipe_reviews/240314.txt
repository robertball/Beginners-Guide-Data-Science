Oh.My.Goodness.
I made these kind of last minute for a holiday party after my son got into the pumpkin bread I'd made.
This is so close to how I remember my  own Grandmother's cookies tasting, I'm actually trying not to cry. I've not had her cookies since I was a little girl.
Thank you for sharing this!!

To Erika, this is why you use cream of tartar.  
Why is cream of tartar in snickerdoodle cookies?

It’s what separates a tangy, chewy snickerdoodle from an ordinary cinnamon-coated sugar cookie. The acid in cream of tartar gives snickerdoodles their distinctive tangy flavor, and the chew happens because cream of tartar prevents sugar in the cookie dough from crystalizing into crunchiness. Science!

I made these for my son when he was little, but after he set out on his own there really didn't seem to be any reason to bake just for myself, so I stopped baking - which was one of my most favorite things.  That was 18 years ago (when he moved out).  I didn't realize how much I missed it until this year when I am baking with my three grandchildren (ages 9, 7 and 2 :-)  ).  This was the first recipe we tried and it is AWESOME.  The kids and I had great fun making such a wonderfully easy recipe.  We made it just as it said and the cookies not only got a rave review from the grandkids - but from my son and daughter-in-law too.  Thank you for posting this old recipe , not just because they are wonderfully tasting cookies - but because your recipe helped me find my happy place - shared with my three little blessings.

I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies turned out just perfect. The part is not too crunchy but not too soft and not too sweet! That little hint of cinnamon is always delicious! You really can't go wrong with these cookies!

Hubby chose snickerdoodles for me to bake tonight and I didn't have my old recipe anymore. So glad I tried this one! He loves them. Definitely will be making these again. 

I did substitute 3 teaspoons of baking powder in place of the tartar with baking soda. And after tasting the dough, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The warning in the recipe of the cookies looking "doughy" is accurate and appreciated! I was a little uneasy about how raw they looked at 7 minutes (400 degrees). But they finished beautifully on the tray and cooling rack. Very delicious, crisp on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside!!!!

Ok, I have some very picky snickerdoodle eaters, we have always used butter crisco or combo butter and shortening.  Well when we retired out of the US a few years back crisco is not an option and the shortening I can get might as well be lard...so after finally running out of my crisco stock I was desperate to find another great recipe like the one my family has used forever.  Well I finally found it!!! I didn't change a thing as I normally don't when trying someone's recipe for the first time.  I questioned at first no vanilla??? Then still didn't change or add a thing.  Every picky snickerdoodle person loved it!!! Normally butter only cookies take quite a bit of finesse to get them to taste right and texture to be delightful.  Well I did bake them at 350 in my oven on convection (convection temp actually 325) for 8 min like my old recipe, where we live I know my oven. Then let them cook and cool for an additional 3-5 min before transferring them to the foil covered cooling rack.  They were a hit!  My neighbors are snickerdoodle freaks and said this is better than my old ones and the best they ever had!  The same type of compliments to everyone I gave them too!  I am my own worst critic (hubby says so all the time) and I honestly would never change a thing in this recipe!  (Except maybe to double or triple it) Thank you so much for this recipe and sharing it!!! It's a keeper!!!!

It wasn't in the directions, but chilling the batter for thirty minutes made it easier to put on the cookie sheet. Adding just a little bit of vanilla also made the cookies the perfect sweetness for me

I'm in the midst of holiday cookie baking and I like trying new recipes every year just to see what's out there, so I don't often go to recipes others often make.  However,  I'm going to a friend's cookie exchange and her husband requested snickerdoodles so I decided to give this new recipe a chance.   I baked at 350 for 10 minutes-I know my oven well.   400 would be too much for it but it might work for others.  I also use a cookie scoop and drop them onto the sugar cinnamon mix then roll - works well for me!  These spread a bit but not really much as I fit a lot of cookies on one sheet,  making the baking process faster.  Bear in mind though that I cannot use butter due to an intolerance and butter spreads more than margarine. All in all,  a good recipe for  snickerdoodles- cookies I  like but don't make often only because there so many  other recipes to  try.  Thanks for the recipe!

I would love to make this again! Although the cookies are more cake like, they are delicious.  A few changes I would make when I make these for the holidays is to put in less butter (like 3/4 of a stick instead of a full stick) and to change to cook time to 12-15 minutes for a fully cooked cookie with a slight outer crunch.  Also, the sugar kept falling off so there was a lot of leftover cinnamon sugar mixture.  Overall this was a great recipe and will make it again with these few changes.

These are perfect. I was never a huge fan of snickerdoodles, but found out my husband is, so I made him a batch of these. He raved and raved. The only thing I changed was to add 1 tsp vanilla and bake for 8 minutes.

Was looking for a good cookie recipe that used a good amount of butter. Came across this recipe that had high ratings but very little reviews. I was not disappointed. I substituted the butter for Canna butter I made beforehand. I whipped the butter before as another reviewer recommended. I made mine a bit bigger, about 2 tbsp size. Baked for 9 mins. Perfection. Cookies with a kick.
My new go-to recipe for Snickerdoodles.
Thanks to Grandma Ruth!!!!

These turned out delicious, and I got multiple compliments on them! I didn't have cream of tartar, so I substituted 1 Tb baking powder for the baking soda and cream of tartar. Also, I made them probably twice as big as recommended (honestly, who makes such tiny cookies? ha!) so they needed 9 minutes in the oven instead of 7. I still ended up with 30 very tasty cookies. I will definitely make these again!

Pretty good !!! Although it did have a very buttery, sweet flavor to it, it was on the better side . I added 1 tsp of vanilla and one tsp of cinnamon in the batter and I enjoyed it much more!!!

Made them just as written and they're great! A little crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Yum. Will add this to the rotation! (I could definitely see adding nutmeg, cardamom, ginger, cloves, etc to the topping mixture for a little different flavor and they'd come out delicious too!)

This is definitely my new go-to recipe for Snickerdoodles!  Perfectly soft but with the slightest crisp on the outside from the sugar-cinnamon mix.  I followed the recipe almost exactly- I did add a touch of vanilla, and baked them for 8 minutes.  Letting them sit on the cookie sheet for 5+ minutes after baking is definitely important.  It allows the cookie to continue cooking without them getting hard.

Editing to add:  Several people, including die-hard snickerdoodle fans, have told me that these are the best snickerdoodles they've ever had!  I even overheard people at a party talking about them!

Followed most of the recipe but didn’t have regular flour so I used self rising flour and didn’t add cream of tartar, baking soda or salt. I baked for only 7 minutes like it said. So yum definitely will make again!

I substituted the cream of tartar with baking powder. I also added about a tbsp of vanilla extract. They turned out fluffy and crisp! Would make again.

DELICIOUS. Made no changes to the recipe, but I rolled them into balls the size of munchkins. I baked for 14 mins at 400 and they were crispy on the outside and cakey on the inside. Similar to churro in taste and texture. My second batch I baked for 8-9 mins and they were soft, chewy, and perfect.

Very amazing recipe!! It's perfectly fine to resize the cookies to any volume you'd like as long as they're uniform in size. I also went ahead and added an extra step for some visual effect; just press down the balls with a fork to add a grid-effect on top. It makes a nice visual pop for the cookies. The only reason I give 4-stars instead of a perfect 5 is because I do think these cookies are a little too sweet. I'm not Grandma Ruth and this is my first time making these cookies, but I'll have to see if I can lower the amount of sugar in a test. Otherwise, perfect bakings and results!! The step to leave them on the tray to bake a little longer is amazingly genius!!

I never made snickerdoodles before (actually, never even had one!), so I wasn’t sure how they should look & taste. Followed the recipe exactly but added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Baked the first batch for 7 min at 400 (375 in my convection oven) and let them cool 5 min before taking them off the cookie sheet. Second batch I baked for an extra minute or two & they were just darker & a bit crisper. Either way was yummy, but my husband prefers the crisper version (although he’s not rejecting the chewier ones)! I’m taking them to a bunch of teenagers tonight, so that will be the “acid test”

1-31-2019 ~I’m on the fence on this one.  I guess you could say I believe there are pros and cons, which makes it difficult to rate and review this recipe.  They indeed   have buttery good flavor, but I have no doubt that my adding a couple of teaspoons of vanilla contributed to that.  But with all butter, no shortening, they weren’t quite as substantial as they would have been with a blend of shortening and butter.  I really would have preferred these with more heft; bigger, thicker.  And, at seven minutes baking time, they were soft – very soft.  That didn’t appeal to me, as they tasted almost floury, doughy if you will, but it’s just how Hubs prefers them.  And he liked that the size was just right for a bite or two.  The bottom line?  Not a bad Snickerdoodle, but I’ll look for a recipe that includes both butter and shortening, that includes vanilla, and directs larger size balls of dough for a bigger, thicker cookie.  I rate them an ok three stars, while Hubs gave them an enthusiastic four stars.  Since this is high praise from him, I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and rate them four stars.

Oh my gosh! These are so good. I’ve made them for several gatherings, and they were a hit! I’ve never put bread in the storage bag, but it made them stay fresher for so much longer. I always have to double the batch in order to have them last the night!! Didn’t change a thing and turned out amazing. Thanks a lot!!

These are wonderful.  This recipe is almost identical to the Betty Crocker Cooky Book recipe (1960s), which I've always used.  Only difference is Crocker uses half shortening and half butter.   I saved this recipe so I don't have to fear losing it!  The cookies are reasonably thick with crisp edges with a chewy center.  My family loves them!

Cookies came out delicious. I had to add about a half of cup of flour otherwise the batter was too sticky and wouldn’t roll into a ball. I also had to cook I also had to cook them for about a total of 14 minutes because I made them a bit larger than the recipe called for. I’ll be making these again!

Well of course this is the very best Snickerdoodle recipe ever! I had a Grandma Ruth and this was her recipe to a T. It took me a while to perfect it but the key is not to over bake them. I think the author of this recipe must be a cousin using an alias??

Absolutely love these cookies.  Definitely follow the instructions on the underbake.  I've made doodles before but they weren't nearly this good - I think it's the cream of tartar.  These are now a family favourite!

Super simple, excellent cookie! I added about 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg to the dough and sugar cinnamon coating. It added a little more to this recipe. Now my family is calling the Paw-Paw’s Snickerdoodles

Solid snickerdoodles! Cooking for 7 minutes at 400 degrees resulted in a softer cookie, if you like a crunch to your cookie I would recommend cooking for 8-9 minutes.

Delicious! I only used 1 cup of sugar (personal preference) and did not have any cream of tartar. The cookies still turned out wonderfully, crisp on the outside and soft inside. I used dairy-free margarine instead of butter to accommodate allergies, which of course does not taste as good as butter. This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I am not even a fan of snickerdoodles but I will make these again!

The only adjustment I  did was to add 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough before rolling each portion in the cinnamon and sugar mix. I baked the cookies at 400 degrees on a parchment lined pan for 8 minutes, let them sit on the pan for 3 minutes after baking, then removed the cookies from the pan to fully cool on a baking rack. They turned out tender and fluffy on the inside with a light crisp on the outside. Perfection!

Great recipe! These cookies came out soft and delicious!  I like a little bit spicier snickerdoodle, so I added a half tsp of cinnamon to the batter then a pinch of nutmeg and cloves to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  The entire batch was gone in less than a day, my family loved them so much. I've made them twice since with the same results each time. Definitely keeping this recipe as one of my faves!

Holy cow these came out amazing!  I did recipe exact in every way including the 8 min time and letting cookies cool on the cookie sheet for a few mins before moving them.  They came out crispy on the outside and soft and somewhat chewy on the inside.  I coated some with only sugar for my little who doesn’t like cinnamon and she loved those too.  Will be making these often!

I made these as written and they were great! my oldest son wanted more cinnamon - he said they were good but need something more. SO- I added a tsp cinnamon and tsp vanilla to the cookie batter. Perfection! my family ate 2 batches in 2 days!!! slight crisp on the outside, soft and yummy inside! I used a cookie scoop for ease. 7 min. was perfect bake time. Thank you for this recipe!!! One of my best cookie recipes!

I love this recipe. Super easy to follow and the end result is delicious snickerdoodles. I didn’t make any changes and I followed the cooking instructions as written but in a convection oven. For the last set of cookies though, I decided to leave the cookies in an extra two minutes (I still left the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes). My husband likes crunchy snickerdoodles. He claimed they were perfect. I like the softer cookies but it’s nice to know I can make cookies we both like but I just have to bake his an extra couple of minutes. I will be using this recipe going forward.

These are excellent! Very easy to make and they firm up nicely once taken out of the oven, but still a little soft on the inside.

Amazing recipe! I used 1/4 cup of sugar & 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to roll the dough in. I didn’t want the cinnamon to be over powering. They turned out perfect.

Delicious! Following the instructions left the centers raw, though, so I added a couple of minutes the cooking time.

I made these cookies for a Christmas cookie exchange.  They were a big hit.  I made them almost exactly as directed with only the addition of 1 tsp pure vanilla extract per batch.  My whole family said these were the best cookies I've ever made.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Mine were a little doughy after 7 minutes of baking and 5 minutes of resting, so I changed mine to 8 minutes with 5 resting.  Beautiful and delicious!

Wow! I can’t believe how amazing these cookies turned out. I love the specific instructions on when to move them to the cooking rack. Made this recipe twice and both times were perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will never make snickerdoodles another way.

Really good, but how can butter and a bunch of sugar not be.
3 Stars because I could only eat one and the sugar rush made me want a celery stick.

These are so good! I cut the recipe in half but made no substitutions. I mistakenly baked the first batch at 350 so I cooked them for 10 minutes. I was worried but they were so good! I cooked the second batch at the correct temperature for 7 minutes and they were amazing! Shortening isn't something I regularly have but this recipe doesn't require it and is still amazing!

Best snickerdoodles I have ever tried. I used up all my cream of tartar and bought more to make these. My family loves them. I love that I usually have all of the ingredients I need to make them on hand at any given time. If you’re looking for a soft, chewy cookie, these are the ones to make.

This recipe was absolutely nothing special. The flavor was bland and the texture was kind of cake-ish. I also thought there was too much cinnamon in the sugar mix, which made the cookies a little bit bitter.

I baked them for a football party  at the last minute. They are AMAZING! 
If you are at a higher altitude you should cook them for 5 to 6 min.

I LOVE this recipe, I’ve never made cookies from scratch before and they turned out perfect! I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract but that was the only change I made. I was a little bit iffy of the 7 minutes but the cookies cooked perfectly and are still super soft! Will make again!

I made these today and they are wonderful made exactly according to the recipe. Seven minutes in my oven was perfect, just be sure and let them cool on the baking pan as instructed. Crisp around the edges with a chewy center , perfect! Thank you so much for sharing!

I baked them on 375 degrees on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet for 10 minutes. I also allowed them to rest for an additional 5 minutes on the cookie sheet after taking them out of the oven.

The best and easiest snickerdoodle recipe I’ve ever made. No changes needed. Letting the cookies bake out of the oven those last 5 minutes really makes a difference.

I added 1 tsp vanilla bean paste to the dough, and I baked them for 8 minutes.  I let them finish off on the cookie sheet out of the oven before pulling them to a rack to cool.

So soft!! My family are then so fast we're on our third batch just so I had some to share at work!! My kids don't like a lot of sugary treats so I was surprised I have had to make so many just to have some to take to both my clients.

I picked this recipe out of many snickerdoodle ones and am glad I did.  It worked better when I kept the dough balls closer to 1 inch than 2.  Very soft on the inside and a bit of crunch on the outside.

This is the best recipe I have found! Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. I did find that chilling the dough a bit before baking makes handling them easier. Then I place the dough in the fridge between batches.

I used double the cinnamon and sugar to coat and cooked for 8 minutes instead of 7 and they were perfect, just like my grandma used to make.

These are delicious! Soft and fluffy with just a little crisp from the cinnamon sugar coating. I doubled the cinnamon sugar mix and used almost all of it coating the cookies.

I made no changes to the recipe but no need to! They are great! My husband made them all by his self and they came out perfect. 
The only change I would add is vanilla. It just topped off the cookie perfectly. You could also add a little more sugar to up the taste of the cookie.
Also, be very careful to avoid over baking. They lose a lot of their lushishness.

This was a great recipe and did not have to use shortening.  I did want to use that.  I added a little vanilla extract to add a little more some some. I also cooked each batch at a different time so some would be soft and some more crunchy.  Also- add a half a piece of bread to any cookie container and the cookies will stay soft. If cookies are a little too hard then that bread will soften them. Yea on this recipe.

Cut down butter to 1 and 1/2 sticks and added cream cheese to equal 2 sticks. Added 2 tsp ginger to the dry mix and baked for 9 minutes. Oh my, so very good!! Crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside!

I made it exactly as is, but I lowered the oven temperature since my oven runs hot.  For me, they came out perfectly at 375F at 10 minutes, soft and puffy on the inside and just a bit crunchy around the edge. Next time, I'll double the recipe, as they sure didn't last long.

They were super easy to make! I followed the recipe like others have suggested and they came out perfect!  I had to chase my husband out of the kitchen so he wouldn’t eat them all!

The dough was a little sticky, so kept it in the fridge for 30 minutes. I used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar. Came out nice!

So delicious. I skipped the tartar since I have none, added a tbsp of lavender flowers to the mix and skipped the coating and it made beautifully delicious lavender cookies!!

I substituted 3 tsp of Baking Powder for cream of tartar and baking soda since I didn't have cream of tartar, and since baking powder is comprised of those two ingredients.  I doubled the amount of sugar and cinnamon to roll them in and sprinkled a little around each cookie on the sheet before putting them in the oven. Otherwise followed the instruments and they came out beautifully.  We loved them and will I will use this as my "go to" Snickerdoodle recipe.

These were fun to make and delicious once done. But a few were burned on the bottom.  I think the 400 deg temp might be a little too hot for my oven.  This dough is pretty delicate because of all the butter.  Next time I will bake at 375 and hope they don’t burn!

Win. I didn't know what these were really, never made this type of cookie before... but they are my bfs favorite. Made all of it within the time he left and came back from the store. Followed recipe exactly. Quoting him, "You made the *** out of these cookies. If u ever leave me, leave me with a batch of these cookies."

These cookies were really good. Very good flavor and soft on the inside.  I would recommend using a stand mixer rather than a hand mixer.

My husband requests these cookies. I have made them several times.

I made these & the only thing I did was add 2TB bro sugar to deepen the flavor. Stuck to the recipe after that & they are luscious right out of the oven. I did  bake them 2min longer. I guess we'll see if they get hard over night in a ziplock.....if any are left.

Tasty but I feel they should have been cooked longer. This problem could be my oven.  If I make again 7 mins is not long enough.

My old recipe for snickerdoodles used shortening which I no longer use in my kitchen.  I tried this one because it used only butter.  The only change I made was to add a tsp of vanilla.  These are delicious, every bit as good as my old family favorite.  Now this will be my new family favorite!

Very simple to make. Crisp around the edge and the rest of the cookie is soft. The round cookie balls spread quite a lot - something to keep in mind. I made these for a friend (gave these to him yesterday.) Today he asked me to bake another batch for him. I tried one and it was SOOO.. good. Looks like I'll be going into business making these snickerdoodles.

I've been looking for a good snickerdoodle recipe and this one is perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I think the trick is using all butter because the taste is amazing and so is the texture.

These are not quite as tangy as I remembered snickerdoodles being, however, that is why my family, who usually do not care for snickerdoodles, loves them. They ate them almost as fast as I could get them out of the oven.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!  I made the recipe exactly as written, except I cut it in half as I was short on time.  Soft and chewy and so tasty!!  I Did bake the second tray for 8 minutes and found the texture to be better.  Thank you for a great and easy recipe!!!!

I felt like baking something today but didn't want to go to the store, and found I had all the ingredients for these cookies! I have made snickerdoodles for years and this is a great recipe using all butter (good for me, because I was out of shortening). The cookies are slightly puffed, a little crisp around the edges but chewy inside. I added a teaspoon of vanilla when I added the eggs because I like it. Thanks for a good recipe that made my kitchen smell great on a cool Sunday morning! :)

Turned out perfect although I feel like they're lacking in flavor just a tad. Will make again.

I don't think they were good at all.  Put them in a zip lock bag & they were hard the next day. Will be going back to my original recipe.

the dough is so light and fluffy, super quick bake time, just an all around perfect cookie! I do advise keeping the dough in the circular ball form instead of pressing down - makes the cookies thicker!

This is by far the best snickerdoodle recipe I've used. Less flour. No milk. It's richer and the texture is perfect.

Excellent cookies!  Easy recipe, works out great every time.  Snickerdoodles MUST have that nice chewy texture.  To the person who left the one star review because she wanted to know why the cream of tartar is in there - cream of tartar helps cookies crackle on the top when they bake.

Followed the recipe exactly how it's written. Love everything about it. Worthy of 5 stars. Mine was not cakey at all--something I was worried about. Mine were flat, crunch on the outside, soft in the middle. Didn't alter anything from the recipe, I let them cool on the pan for five minutes, as directed.

This recipe was perfect.  I love snickerdoodles more than any cookie, except chocolate chip, but they are close.

Since I am allergic to wheat gluten, I use a gluten free flour.  I substituted the baking soda and cream of tartar with 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda.  

The cookies came out beautifully.  

They tasted awesome and they set up very well.  Which is usually an issue with gluten free baking but not with this recipe.

Whether gluten free or not, this is a really great recipe.

While the baking time was not enough the cookies tasted ok. I would not recommend 7 min if you don't want doughy tasting cookies. Other than that it was pretty hassle free and I may try it again.

These are delicious and to me have more cinnamon than some snickerdoodles.   I used about 1/3 wheat flour but that was my only change.

This recipe is great! The cookies turned out soft inside with a slight crunch on the outside. The only thing I did differently was to refrigerate the dough before rolling the cookies so it wouldn't be as messy.

0% changes, 100% perfect! I make snickerdoodles every Xmas and Father's Day (and all the time between) for my DH so after 16 years I have tried a few recipies out. I have to say these are, without question, the best! Leaving them to finish 'cooking' on the sheets made them so soft and exactly right in the middle. The cream of tartar is just right too so there isn't that weird taste some snickerdoodles have. Wonderful!

Awesome!  Son's favorite cookies (tried it at a friends house) so I had to learn to make them for Christmas time.  It is the little things like this that make kids happy. So this is the first time I've made these type of cookies.  Tasted like the cinnamon toast crunch cereal but in cookie form.  I did learn that it makes a difference how long you cook the cookies. Cooking it at 7 min made them flatter but soft and chewy.  Cooking them at 10 min made them a bit puffier and less chewy.  So how long you cook them is your preference.  Experiment to what you like best.  I could see these in an ice cream sandwich!  I'll be trying that next.  Overall great recipe.

Pretty good! Kinda on the tart side. Mine came out lightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I baked mine for 8 min exactly. The only difference that I made was I used Red Mill Stone Ground Whole Wheat Pastry Flour. I like how they didn't spread much and were very easy to roll.

They are delicious and easy to make.  However there is a typo in the list of ingredients.  The list says 2 tbsp of sugar when in the body of the directions it says 1 1/2 cups.   Will make them again!!

My hubby LOVED these! We don´t have cream of tartar over here, so I added one teaspoon white vinegar.
