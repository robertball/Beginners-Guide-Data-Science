Great taste, lots of color ... an excellent salad!! In shopping for beans, I was surprised how many are canned with high fructose corn syrup! I couldn't find the correct size cans either (all had more than the recipe called for, but I used all the beans anyway). If you want to avoid corn syrup, here are the brands I found WITHOUT it: Pastene Kidney Beans, Shur Fine Pinto Beans, and Bush's Best Garbanzos. Enjoy!

This was delicious and made a nice side dish for grilling.  I used un-marinated artichoke hearts for a healthier dish and green onion for color.  I certainly recommend it!

This salad was excellent.  I made it for a pot luck at work and was asked for the recipe by tons of people.  The feta cheese is a great addition.

The dressing is perfect; somehow it brings out the sweetness of the beans.  I subbed black beans for the pinto beans and plain artichoke hearts (instead of marinated), and added a couple stalks of celery that I happened to have the fridge.  Even my 4-year-old liked it.

Okay, so now I am in love with Bob. Or at least with his salad. And I didn't even have some of the yummiest sounding ingredients. I usually am not fond of three bean salad. But this dressing with balsamic vinegar won me over. I confess though -- I added another 2 teaspoons of sugar. But probably not needed. I poured the dressing over frozen green beans (thawed), a can of garbonzo beans, a can of red beans, and three big green onions, chopped. Super good. I cannot wait to make it again and include the red pepper, artichokes, and feta cheese.

I thought it was delightful.  For breakfast, I sprinkled bacon on top and at it with poached eggs.

Awesome.  I omitted the artichokes but basically used the recipe for the dressing.  I added a little more balsamic but it was delish.  I also sauteed the peppers, onion, garlic and zucchini before adding it.  This will definitely be a staple in our house.

This is really good!  I’ve made several times and once I forgot to add the artichoke hearts and it wasn’t nearly as good, so I definitely won’t forget to add again.  I normally hate kidney beans but like them in this recipe.  The feta is such a great addition; I usually add a little more then called for.

Enjoyed, and so easy to mix up.  Added a can of drained green beans for more color.  Doubled the artichokes and feta cheese because we love it!  Makes a lot, so great for a "pot luck".

WHAT A GREAT RECIPE!!  I had most of the ingredients already, so I used canned black beans instead of pinto, and roasted red peppers in a jar instead of fresh.  Not only was it great on its own, but the next day I used it to top bagged salad and with grilled chicken strips.  LOVE THIS SALAD!!!

The only changes I made were to use 6 oz. feta and to halve the olive oil.  I also used artificial sweetener instead of sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Sorry, just wasn't crazy about this recipe.  I did not use marinated artichokes - maybe that would have added more flavor.

Really tasty side dish for burgers and hotdogs. I don't think the feta is even necessary - the salad is flavorful enough without it.

This was DELICIOUS!!!

Some changes I made: I added a large clove of garlic (crushed it in the garlic press into the salad) and some lemon juice.  I also doubled the amount of artichoke hearts and I left out the feta (don't like it).  

GREAT recipe, I will definitely use this often, thanks for sharing!

This is amazing!  I served it at a recent party and people were going back for thirds!  We've decided that we'd try this for the insides of a vegitarian taco as well.  The only thing I changed was adding a little bit more sugar to the dressing.

What a wonderful protein rich dish!  I can eat this for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  It is easy to take to the office for lunch and it does not spike my blood sugar so it fills me up without making me hungry a short time later. Highly recommend!

Great source of nutrients and great, fresh taste to it. Especially good when you let it sit over night (hold the feta until serving though if you do). For the health conscientious you can leave out the salt and the sugar (not that there's much to begin with) and it still tastes excellent. Thank you for this recipe!

Made this for my vegetarian friends, who all loved it. I used kidney & black beans only, I also added 1 can of corn for more color and it tasted great.

This bean salad was very good.  I did not add the artichoke hearts. 
I stretched this recipe for a pot luck by adding cooked pasta and there was enough dressing to cover the pasta.  I also added about 3 more Tablespoons of sugar.  I will try with Splenda when I make it for myself.

This is off the charts good.  The artichokes make it your not so average bean salad.  The flavors were absolutely outstanding.   I served this over rice.  Recipe said served 8- I did at a luncheon and purposely put it out a little late.  I ate this salad in 4 days!  Served over rice, perfect.

This was a decent recipe.  Nice flavor and texture.  I'm not a big whole garbanzo bean fan (i prefer hummus style), but overall a good bean salad.

I used white beans instead of pinto, and added green beans and used twice the amount of Feta. It would also be good with more artichoke hearts!

This recipe is a summer staple in our house.  A few years ago I wrote down the recipe and didn't write the name of the bean salad or site I got it from.  I am so happy to have found it online again.

Very good flavor.  Next time plan to use more artichoke hearts and feta cheese.

Great salad!!! I threw in a few extras..I used a green bell pepper and about 1/2 cup of roasted red pepper; I also threw in a couple of roma tomatoes. I didn't have any pinto beans and forgot to add the cheese. It was still fantastic! When I eat the leftovers today, I will add the feta! 
I also used a pomegranate vinegar instead of balsamic, which was really tasty!

Even though I used 14-15 oz. cans of beans instead of 12 oz., there was plenty of dressing.  I cut back on the salt a bit and still got complaints that it was too salty.  Next time I will omit the salt entirely.  Otherwise, it was a hit.  I definitely will be making this again.

Well this one is definetly a keeper!  It's easy to make, you can eat it guilt-free, and last but not least, it is absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend raved about how good it was and started telling me how we should start taking this salad to all the pot lucks we go to!  Oh!!! I did "step it up a notch" and put olives, green beans, and instead of pinto beans, I used white beans.  It really did turn out great.  Thanks for the yummy salad Bob!!

I wasn’t a big fan because I don’t really like marinated artichokes but my husband loved it and wants it again. It’s so easy to make which I love about it.

I did make a change to this salad by putting  my favorite beans (Butter beans, northern beans and pinto), red onion, more feta cheese and  leaving out  the red pepper, artichoke and condiments aside from Olive oil.  Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make it again.

This is the second time I’ve made this recipe. It’s delicious as it is but this time I wanted more fresh vegetables. I added 3 small stalks of celery, a yellow pepper because I didn’t have a red one, black and white beans as I didn’t have garbanzo or kidney beans. I also added two vine ripe red tomatoes. The results were totally yummy!

Didn't have artichokes, but it was fabulous anyway! The feta and the dressing are what make it wonderful. I used white northern beans, garbanzos and pintos, with celery, red and green bells and red onion. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

This was a very flavorful recipe. I made a few substitutions (seasoned pinto beans because that's what I had on hand, and black beans in place of chickpeas). Overall I really like the flavor of the dressing and it seems to be getting better and better the more it sits in the fridge. This is my first time eating artichokes, and I'm still on the fence about them. Next time I'll try a non-marinated variety and add more onion. Yum yum!

I really enjoy this salad.  I often take it to picnics and pot-lucks as an alternative to pasta salad.  I usually use black beans instead of pinto beans and sometimes add other vegatables like green pepper and celery.

This is really delicious! It is going on my short list of lunch options. Just have to wash down all that flavor with some strong tea or coffee after lunch.

This recipe was so good! I used reduced sodium cans of beans to make sure it didn't get too salty...and I think it came out great!  We served it along side a steak as an alternative to a green salad.

I thought this bean salad was excellent!! I thought I had marinated artichokes at home but when I went to make this I realized I didn't have any, so I had to omit them. It was still great though!

This was pretty good at dinner, but amazing the next day!  Next time I will allow more time to marinate.  Left out the feta as it's a no-no while pregnant, but it'll bet it's even better with it.

This one's a keeper--we love this salad.  Even my 7 year old eats it!  I usually use blue cheese instead of the feta, because that's what is usually on hand.  Other than that, I follow the recipe.

It reminds me of five bean salad, just not as colorful or sweet.  So I think its good just the flavors a little lacking.

The balsamic turned it brown. I didnt add peppers, but adding any colored pepper might help!  BUT it tastes great!!
