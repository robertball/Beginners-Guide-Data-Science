This was my third time trying out the recipe, I must said that the effort put-in in making the jam was really worth it, and the pastry was really light yet doesn't crumble. I have since modified the recipe slightly by adding an extra egg yolk for a richer color and 25g of icing sugar to the pastry and have used rock sugar instead for the jam for a shiny finishing and taste.  On the whole, this is really a fantastic recipe - all my friends and family really love these melt in mouth little tarts which I made during the Chinese Lunar New Year.  Thanks Diana!

love the pastry recipe, it's crumbly and very delicious. the pineapple jam itself was also very easy to make, although i must point out that it's critical to drain excess liquid from the pureed pineapple first, otherwise you'll be stirring for a very long time!

Made with all purpose flour and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of self-rising flour. Wonderful! Not too sweet either. Thanks for posting Diana!

So much easier than I thought it was going to be! Changes: I pureed fresh pineapple chunks in a food processor (No draining), then simply let it simmer with the sugar and cloves while I made the pastry. I only stirred it every few minutes (not constantly like the recipe said) and it turned out perfect! -simmered about 45 minutes total on low heat. The pastry was easy to make, and turned out flakey and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Made this twice and will make again.  These are my absolute favorite and a festive staple for my family in Singapore during the Chinese New Year holidays.  I added an extra yolk to the dough and about 1/8 cup of confectioners sugar as suggested by another reviewer.  Not too much of a difference to me.  I did however reduce the temp to 350 degrees which helped.  The first batch was a little too brown at 400 in my oven.  Leaving the dough in the fridge overnight makes it easier to work with.  Just for informations sake, 1 fresh Dole pineapple is perfect for the ingredients stated for the dough.

This was a really good tart! I cheated and used premixed just-add-water pie crust, as well as canned pineapple but it was still phenomenal.

Typo error in my earlier review. My apologies for that.  I used plain flour only and added a little more butter.

Making the Pineapple Filling (minus the Whole Cloves), Jam, was very tasty and easy.  I used my Immersion Blender to puree everything into nice smooth, and small, pieces.  There is plenty left over, so put it in a Container (and Refrigerate it) and use it for your Bagels/Toast/English Muffins/Yogurt (in the Morning).  Making the Tart Crust, fresh, wasn't too hard (but you must refrigerate the Dough overnight to get the best consistency to easily roll it out and to cut it).  The Directions on how to make the Tart shape is too confusing and thankfully I know how to make them already.  A 2" Flat Cookie Base, spread the Pineapple Filling Inside, and then layer a 1 1/2" Dough Ring on the top.
