I feel that I have to rate this recipe because one persons bad review has brough the rating down.  This is a simple and delicious recipe.  It is best if you use unflavoured breadcrumbs.

This was awful!!  Made it for a party and I can't say anyone really enjoyed it.  If it hadn't been for my husband's homemade spaghetti sauce we served with it, this would have been a huge flop!!  Definitely will not make again.

Very, very good. I didn't have any regular cornflakes, but I had honey-flavored ones. I mixed them with some Italian bread crumbs and had lemon chicken tortellini. Very unusual, and again, very good. I'll make this again.

I use ravioli too in a pinch, but these work better on a toothpick. These are always one of the first appetizers gone at my parties. I like to serve them with both spaghetti sauce and an alfredo sauce to dip them with. These are just like you would get in an Italian-American restaurant.

These were a huge hit at a recent party.  Everyone loved them.  I agree with the posters that said you need extra crumbs/eggs.  I doubled (at least) the recipe for crumbs and egg dip.  They are a bit of work, but WELL worth it.  I used a spaghetti sauce, ranch dressing and hot sauce as dipping.  Highly recommend the ranch....really good.

Great apps recipe.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added a little grated cheese and salt and pepper to it.  Made a tomato sauce, alfredo sauce and a pesto to dip in.

I thought these were very good and they were actually quite fast and easy to make.  I did use a bit more breadcrumbs (I made my own in a food processor) and I added a little grated parmesan.  I also used basil and thyme instead of the parsley.  I should have added a little more salt for some more flavor (I used about 1/4 teaspoon), but I will know for next time.  I will definitely make these again!  Thank you!

These were so good! I doubled the recipe for my coworkers, and they disappeared immediately. For a dipping sauce, I bought an alfredo sauce, but I made Simple Delicious Pasta Sauce from this site. Fabulous recipe!

Absolutely the best idea ever!  I used this along with several other recipes from allrecipes.com for a Baby Shower I hosted recently.  This was wonderful.  It took awhile to complete only because I made oodles more than the recipe called for, but otherwise this was wonderful!  One tip for anyone planning to make a head of time.  After deep frying, keep in a warm (200 degree) oven until ready to serve.  They stayed crunchy and warm! Yum!!

Pretty good; I found that it helps if you add about 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper, and 1 tsp. of garlic powder to the breadcrumbs/cornflake crumbs mix.  This will be really good for appetizers, thanks!

I made these yesterday for my husband before dinner. He loved these bite size treats so much that he ate my share and skipped the dinner. The only reason I am giving it 4 starts because the seasoning(crum mix) was way too less than the recipe calls for. I also added chat masal(indian store) itailian oregano mix ,thyme, and a lot og hot crushed pepper to spice up the crum mix. Wonderful. Thanks for the unique idea.

This was GREAT!  Just what I was looking for.  I didn't have any eggs, so I just tossed a little olive oil on them before breading them and it worked well.

I will definitely make again. It hit the spot!

I would never have thought of deep frying these! I was just looking for a recipe to use up the rest of my tortellini and this one sounded unique enough to try. Its delicious! The only suggestion I have is to at least double the crumb mixture. Thanks for the unique but very simple recipe!

Had these as appetizers for the GBPackers game. I used bread crumbs and cornmeal. Mine were kind of crunchy, I expected them to be chewy (they kind of look like calamari!). Very good with red sauce! I also served with Ranch but liked the red sauce better. My FIL did not like them, but he didn't try them with red sauce ! (:

I thought this was an inventive way of making tortellini. I was out of corn flakes so used frosted cheerios instead. I'm sure that made a diffence in taste, at least a bit. I will say a marinara sauce is deffinately needed for these tortellini. Overall good finger food.

All 7 of my children loved this variation on pasta served with sauce.   One of the kids even asked if I put the cheese in the pasta!    Others called it chicken and ate it all up.   thank you for sharing this recipe.

I'm rating this based on some changes.  Instead of tortellinis I used both cheese and beef raviolis.  Omitted the cornflakes, using just Italian bread crumbs.  I didn't measure the bread crumbs I just poured as much as I needed as I went along coating the raviolis.  Was a hit on a work potluck.  Served it with a jarred pasta sauce.

To make these a bit healthier I baked them instead of frying them. I did them on 350F for 10 minutes, and they turned out great! Still crispy and delicious. I had a hard time knowing what to dip them in though. I added some "Johnny" seasoning to the breading near the end and really liked the flavour it added. I found that I needed a lot more breading than the recipe called for in order to fully coat the pasta.

I first fried 2 tortellini for my husband and I to taste and we thought they were a bit bland so I added some garlic powder and a little cayenne.  This gave them more flavor and am thinking next time I will use Panko in place of the cornflake crumbs.  Also, as soon as I take them out of the fryer I will sprinkle with a 3 cheese blend from my deli as we can never have too much cheese.

Loved this idea - something very different for us.  I'm not crazy about tortellini, but I can eat most anything that's fried!  Delicious and pretty simple.

I made this for a football playoff party. It was a huge hit. Nice change from buffalo wings. I've also had fried ravioli but this was better. We couldn't stop eating them.

Wow! This was wonderful!! I used frosted flakes instead of plain cornflakes, it was what I had on hand also used fresh tortellini. Hubby loved it and he's very picky.. Alitte time consuming buy sooooo worth it!!

Very good, I needed a lot more crumbs and 2 more eggs though.  I used Italian flavored crumbs and no flakes.  Turned out great.

These were excellent and everybody loved them!  I used the breadcrumbs and corn flake crumbs as a base.  Use whatever seasonings you like.  There were a couple of reviewers who said ranch dressing was their favorite dip, which I thought was weird.  Turns out, it was my favorite dip too!  Well worth the time and effort.  I had a 19 oz bag of cheese tortellini and there were about 110 tortellini in it.

This was great and so easy. I added grated asiago cheese, dried herbs (I used seasoned bread crumbs but wanted more), and garlic powder to the bread crumbs. I also served with Alfredo mixed with some marinara. I only had frozen three cheese tortileni but cooked as directed, rinsed in cold water - and they worked just fine. They were a hit!
