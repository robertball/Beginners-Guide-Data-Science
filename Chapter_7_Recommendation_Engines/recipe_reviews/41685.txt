Great recipe, and super easy!  The vanilla wafers are a great idea.  I used fresh sliced peaches instead and it was really tasty.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  Not only was it quick, but really yummy too.  I did, however, change a few things about the recipe that I believe solved many of the problems listed in other reviews.  I used canned peaches in heavy syrup, so I gently rinsed them off, so it wouldn't be so sweet.  I crushed my vanilla wafers to a flour like consistency and made my crumb mixture like I usually make any crumb topping.  After putting the peaches in a baking dish and sprinkling on the topping, I baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 min.  The peaches were nice and warm, so I served it with a scoop of ice cream!  This version does take a little bit longer, but the extra 10 or 15 minutes is worth it, I believe.

Simple and delicious.  I took the recommendation of previous reviewers and used fresh peaches, slicing them instead halving them, and also doubled the topping.  I found it served 4 people instead 6.

I'm rating this a 5 star mostly for the quickness.  I would rate the taste a 3 or 4; but after working a 12 hour shift as a nurse and being able to have peach crisp in 5 minutes was fantastic!  I used 3 fresh peaches and microwaved for one minute to soften and warm as other reviewers suggested.  I then broiled with the topping and ate it with Cool Whip.  The perfect quick dessert!  I wouldn't serve this to company and it's not as delicious as real peach crisp but it is very simple, quick and tasty  & im my opinion worthy of 5 stars.  Thanks Chandra!

This recipe is so fast easy I thought it was too good to be true, but it really is wonderful.  It reminds me of peach cobbler.  The vanilla wafers make the topping so light and crunchy. I doubled the crust mixture and was happy I did. A great light dessert!  Thanks!

I couldn't believe how good this tasted because it was so fast and easy to prepare.  I doubled the topping as others recommended, and used 2 large sliced fresh peaches.  I microwaved the peaches in a covered bowl for 1-2 minutes before adding the topping and broiling.  I also melted the butter in the microwave instead of waiting for it to soften.  The peaches turned out warm and soft with the sweet crunchy topping.  This literally took only 5 minutes to make and served 4 people.  Would also be good served with ice cream or whipped cream.  I will keep this recipe on hand to make when guests drop in at the last minute.

Perfect use of all those graham crackers not used on s'mores over the summer! Even more delicious with vanilla ice cream. :-)

Loved this.  I am on weight watchers, so I used reduced fat vanilla wafers and carb clever peaches (sliced).  I got a great treat for very few weight watcher points!  Thanks!  This is a keeper. Quick and delicious!

This was very easy and tasted good. Changes I made-I doubled the amount of peaches and tripled the topping and used an 8x8 pan.

This was so simple and my husband raved about it.  I used fresh peaches and baked them at 350 for 30 minutes - I liked the way that crisped the topping - and topped with a sliver of vanilla ice cream.  Definitely a keeper!

Definitely don't need to put them in any longer than one minute. They are a tasty something different to do with peaches and go great as a side with a breakfast casserole.

Loved it!  It was a lot like a tasty peach crisp/cobbler.  Like other reviewers, I used fresh sliced peaches, doubled the topping and then served it with a dollop of Cool Whip.  It was so easy and so incredibly fresh and delicious.  I think the topping would also be good on other fruits like cherries, blueberries, pears, pineapple, etc.

I don't understand.  One minute under a broiler is not enough to heat the peaches; at a minute and a half the topping was beginning to burn, yet still was not "melted and bubbly".  I went ahead and took them out and ate a few but the peaches were just barely warmed, so I put the remainder back in the oven on the lowest rack for five minutes to try to warm them through, but they burned.  >>On the upside I doubled the recipe, using a 29oz. can, and it nicely fills a glass pie pan.  I can't imagine doubling the topping, though, there was plenty of topping already.

I served this at a New Years brunch yesterday  and everyone loved it. I baked the peaches with the syrup poured in the bottom of the baking dish. I served this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Next I will try with canned pears.

This is fantastic!  I have made it several times.  I heat the peaches in the microwave, then sprinkle the topping over it and bake. That way the peaches are warm underneath the topping.  I like to double the topping as well.  It also turns out wonderfully with granny smith apples (cook them first).  It is easy and delicious!

It's like a quick and easy peach cobbler. Next time I will double the crumb mixture.

This was a fast and easy dessert.  When peaches are in season, I use fresh ones and bake a little at 350 first.

These were really great! But to make it more nutritious, I ommited the cookies, and I cut up the peaches into small cubes when they were done and spread them on 7 grain whole wheat toast with 1 tbsp of organic plain yogurt! Get some fiber, protein, and calcium with your dessert!
