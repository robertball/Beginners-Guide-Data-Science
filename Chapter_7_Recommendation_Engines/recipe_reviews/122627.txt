Definitely delicious and really easy to make. I would suggest mixing the butter, sugar and vanilla first before mixing in the applesauce, egg. I mixed all 5 together and the butter wouldn't quite blend in. It's a great recipe though!

Moist and delicious!  However, this is not enough for two loaf pans.  I baked this in one 9x5 inch loaf pan for one hour and it came out nice.  I used sweetend chunky applesauce and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. I used 1/2 c. of brown sugar and 1/4 c. of white and creamed it together with the butter before adding the egg, vanilla, and applesauce.  This made it a little easier to add the dry ingredients. I kept everything else the same and just added 1 finely chopped granny smith apple. Very good!

I have made countless kinds of quick breads, from banana, zucchini, lemon, blueberry, etc, and this one is now at the top of our favorites list.  The high amount of applesauce and low amount of butter was its first appealing point to me, and the applesauce keeps this bread super moist.  The addition of the spices make the house smell incredible and your mouth water.  The raisins are the perfect sweet chewiness to this bread.  I increased the cinnamon to 3/4 teaspoon and added a glaze made of powdered sugar, apple juice and cinnamon.  I will make this so many more times.  I find it interested that the submitter said that this travels well in a lunch bad, because the only piece left of this is in my husband's lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a great bread recipe!

I made this but I didn't use applesauce.  I had a bunch of baby food pears that I wanted to use.  This turned out really good.  I also mixed rasins and dried cranberries, and instead of walnuts I added some toasted oats.    and with only 2 tablespoons of butter it was pretty low fat.  It was moist and yummy.  I know that I will make this again....even with applesauce!  Thanks for the great recipe!

After reading all the reviews, I prepared this recipe exactly as written.  I took one bite and realized immediately that something was missing, and after a re-read of the recipe I realized the missing ingredient.  I am so suprised that no one has commented on the lack of salt in this recipe.  Sweet  breads such as this taste so much better with 1/2 teaspoon of salt to balance out the flavors.  I hope to try this recipe again with the addition of this small amount of salt.  I gave it four stars based on this addition.  The bread is moist, but the spices are a little too strong for my taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

What a moist cake! I added a few things though: 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, chunky sweetened applesause (skipped the sugar), and I put a brown sugar streusel topping on to make up for the sugar and to give it a nice crunch. Since someone commented slpenda affected the cake I decided to reduce the amount of sweetness abd it turned out beautifully!!! I will deffinitely make this one again. Thanks!

This was PERFECT! I made the same changes that Angie Seaman mentioned! Increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and omitted the raisins. And I decided to use only 3/4 cup sugar, which worked great! And just like others have said, this doesn't make 2 loaves, just one! I love the fact that this cake is very low fat and very moist! It has a great apple/cinnamon spice flavor that makes your home smell heavenly while this is baking! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is really good.  I added extra cinnamon (1 t) and used pecans instead of walnuts, left out the raisins because they aren't my favorite.  The loaf was nice and moist even with so little fat.  I'll definitely make this again. It definitely isn't enough for two loaf pans - I made the whole batch in a large loaf pan and it baked for about 60 minutes.

I found it was a bit dry though - I added a bit of apple juice the next time I made it and it came out perfect. Thanks!

yummy, and not too sweet!!! This was great as a "first birthday" cupcake for my son. 
The only things I did differently was did 1/2 cup of the flour as almond meal and 1/2 cup was graham flour. Oh, and I just did 1/2 teaspoon of allspice instead of the clove and nutmeg, since I couldn't find those.

love it!  I too found the quantity SUBSTANTIALLY less than would make 2 loaf pans.  it's an excellent & simple recipe tho.  the only thing I did differently was sprinkle a cinnamon-sugar on top before baking, to make for a crispy sweet bite.

Pretty good, I nixed the raisins and topped the cake with walnuts and pecans! You can definitely taste the clove and nutmeg with this one! I also had to cook the cake closer to an hour.

Very good and was super fast. I didn't use a full cup of sugar and did add 1/2 tsp salt. I look forward to making again with whole wheat flour. It is toddler approved also! Thanks!

I just made this and it is delicious.  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cut brown sugar.  Also used 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup white whole wheat.  Used canola oil instead of butter.  I will be making this again.

This is super moist and yummy.  Fast to whip up and versatile.  I used homemade pear/blueberry sauce, reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tsp orange zest and used cranberries and pecans instead of raisins and walnuts. It came out wonderfully. Thank you so muck for the great recipe!!

this is the best recipe for a nice moist loaf cake! if you switch 3 ripe bananas for applesauce (add another tbs. of butter) and omit all spice but a pinch of nutmeg, makes a fantastic banana bread without the  bite.

Kind of ho-hum. Very faint flavor. Not too bold! Did put some whipped cream on it and served it as dessert. Probably would make a good muffin

This turned out really well, and a nice lower fat alternative to cakes and breads that use oil or shortening. I made it for Mother's Day and my parents really liked it. It seems more like a bread than a cake I thought. I used a package of raisins/cranberries and those ingredients made it like a fruitcake. It would make a great holiday bread to give away.
It did not have enough batter for 2 regular size loaf pans, I will try it next time in 2 small loaf pans.

This is a delicious bread and very healthy with only 2 tablespoons of butter.  I followed the recipe exactly but didn't add in the raisins because I didn't have any.  It is delicious and not overly sweet which I liked.  This recipe makes one 9 x 5 inch loaf and I don't think there's enough batter for two loaves.

Absolutely delicious. Moist and flavourful.  It produced one of the finest loaves I've tasted. I used freshly homemade applesauce, substituted pecans for walnuts and used 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cranraisins. I did find it only produced one 9x5 loaf and I had to add additional baking time.  I'm going to bake mini loaves next time - and to give to friends

Good - not awesome. I used homemade applesauce (from Sara's Applesauce recipe). 75% of flour was wheat flour, and I made them into mini-muffins. Don't get me wrong--flavor and texture was good, they just didn't blow me away and I'll keep looking for another. I iced some of them with a maple icing--from an idea I had from a different recipe I saw...mix maple syrup and/or extract, confectioners sugar, and a bit of melted butter until you reach the desired consistency and flavor. It was a nice touch. Could be good drizzled on it if you made into a loaf...

Definitely a keeper! I skimped on the raisins and wish I'd done the full cup. As normal, I did ~60% of the sugar, so those nice burst of sweetness from the raisins is pretty key. Overall, pretty easy to make and pretty yummy considering there's only 2 tbsp. butter. I also made a quick streusel (butter, sugar, finely chopped pecans, flour, cinnamon) which was nice on top.

Delicious! Very flavourful and nice and moist.  I only altered one thing, adding a 1/4C of dried cranberries as well as a 1/4C raisins.   This is a keeper!

Very good!  My 4 kids loved it.  A healthy snack.  I added crazins instead of rasins. I'll make it again soon.
