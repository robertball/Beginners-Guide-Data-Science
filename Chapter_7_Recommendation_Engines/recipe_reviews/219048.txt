Hi all,   Keep in mind, the objective of the final step is to get slightly crispy outside with a moist, tender inside.   The recipe says a "clove" of garlic ... I meant a bulb, but of course, garlic to taste, and for that matter, salt. Remember to adjust your salt and spices to the size of the roast, but broth doesn't need the same levels of increases. If you're not a salty person, salt the roast as you normally would.  If you feel like you're over-salting, then you probably are. Also, make sure you're using Kosher style salt. If reg. salt, use less. The level of fat on your roast also plays a role - more fat, less salt. Written a long time ago -- I don't use cans of broth, just the sealed boxes -- about 1 will do. I have also used pork loin, and it tends to dry out-- try to buy one with more fat than you normally would. Shoulder/butt is much better.

I often put the dutch oven in the oven at about 300-325 degrees, depending on how fast you need it to cook.    I have a summer version where I marinate the pork pieces in lime, garlic, olive oil, adobo chili sauce, cilantro, and onion.  I then grill outdoors to get the browned edges, and then set up a disposable aluminum pan covered with foil to do the braising in broth.  I keep it on the grill on very low heat until tender.  Then move the pieces indoors to finish with the same steps as the winter version.  

Some great ideas here - crock pot/ coke/beer.  It's not an exact science.  It's just a cooking technique.

i havent tried the recipe but if anyone out there wants to make a variation to this recipe, i recently saw a Mexican friend making carnitas (a whole pig) and what he put in for seasoning was coca cola, limes and lemons, laurel leaves, and cooking wine.  dont forget the salt and use its own drippings to keep it from being dried out, remember, carnitas werent meant to be diet food.

I'm very happy with how our carnitas turned out! I used a tenderloin and substituted a dark beer for the chicken broth. Very tender and flavorful!

So moist and with great flavor.  I never measure just cook by smell, but I upped the garlic, and used the juice of a whole lime.  Went a little heavy on the chili powder and cumin, and only salted the meat before browning.  Also threw in just a touch of cayenne for good measure.  Came out awesome! 
I used a pork loin, so I just left the meat in the dutch oven and let it work, after about 2 hours it fell apart with just tongs and stirring.
Put them in a flour tortilla with tomato, avocado, and a touch of sour creme.
Served with beans and elotes made an awesome Mexican night in!

I made this recipe tonight, and WOW!! Complete out of the ballpark hit with my family. I doubled the recipe for my large family. I used pork sirloin, as that is what Costco had in the 8LB quantity. Salt and Garlic salt, then into the pot with oil to sear in batches. I pulled all the meat out, and sweated the onions and garlic in the pan juices before adding broth, spices, and meat back to the pot. Up to high uncovered, then covered on low for 2.5 hours. I then upped the heat to high and uncovered the pot to reduce the liquid by half. The meat was falling apart as I put it in the baking pan to crisp up, I added the reduced liquid to the meat a half cup at a time over the next 30 minutes. SOOOOOO Good. Served this with onions and cilantro, home made guac, and home made pico de gallo on the side. 

One side note, I doubled the recipe, so should have used 8 can's broth...NO way that would have worked. I ended up using 5 cans for 8lbs of meat, and it was plenty. I also read the reviews and used the extra garlic. 

Awesome Recipe!! (Long time member here, this was my first review!) 

Thanks so much!!

I just made this, and it is awesomely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients. I did however cook it in the crockpot overnight instead of on the stove. Turned it off in the morning and after an hour or two, I shredded the meat and finished it off on a baking sheet in the oven.  I ended up using only one quart (4 cups) of broth in the crockpot.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe is perfect! I followed it exactly with one exception - I added about 1/2 cup of coca cola to the liquid while the meat was simmmering and it turned out great. My husband is Mexican and every time we are in Mexico, my favorite food is the pork carnitas from the little trucks. I have been trying to make something that comes close and this recipe is it. Thank you for sharing this. I will be making this one often!

I had every intention of photographing this. I really did.  But here’s what happened – the smell of this was driving me nuts the whole time it was cooking.  I mean it.  By the time we sat down to eat I could hardly stand my hunger anymore.  And once we put our carnitas tacos together with locally made flour tortillas, pico de gallo, cheese (for Hubs), lettuce and sour cream, I thought I died and went to heaven.  No exaggerating, this is one fine recipe.  I used boneless pork sirloin chops and, with the exception of using half the amount of Kosher salt called for, I prepared this exactly as the recipe directed, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I’ve already told you how good this smelled and this meat, this meal as we put it together, did not let us down.  The meat is SO flavorful, with a flavor all its own, so good I wouldn’t even think about messing with those seasonings.  I made this in the Dutch oven as instructed, right up until the simmering.  At that point I transferred everything to my slow cooker and cooked it on high for three hours.  I’ve made carnitas like this before, but never took the extra step of browning the meat first. I believe this is an important step that ought not be omitted.  My only criticism is with the salt.  Even using Kosher salt as directed (NOT table salt) the amount called for would have ruined this.  But given the heads up by other reviewers to that effect, I cannot in good conscience dock the rating for an otherwise perfect recipe.

I loved the cooking method for these carnitas!! Seriously best I've ever made or bought eating out.  I do admit I did a few things differently.  I upped the spices, did a dry rub on the pork and then fried it till crispy and brown before adding homemade broth.  I added an orange, juice and rind and more garlic then followed the rest of the instructions exactly.  AMAZING.  Like I said I only played with the spicing.  This is a great way to prepare carnitas.

Texture was perfect, but meat was waaaaay too salty. Salt overpowered the cumin and chili powder. 1 Tablespoon would have been plenty. Easy fix for an otherwise good recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! Just the right amount of spices and seasoning and I made sure I drizzled more of the cooking liquid on the meat towards the end and it came out perfect. To be honest, this recipe turned out restaurant caliber carnitas. Thanks for sharing!

Tried this for the Super Bowl and it was fantastic. I used a bit more of the seasoning for the braising liquid. 

When putting it in the oven, I made sure there was plenty of the juice so it would dry out. Having some now (the next day) and it's still nice and moist.

This was definitely a hit! I'll work it into my normal rotation, the kids love it too.

These were great. My daughter's little friend who was staying with us this weekend ate so many I thought she was in competition with my husband.  

This was a great recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use less chicken broth since my dutch oven wouldn't hold it all, and it certainly didn't hurt a thing.  My husband told me he could eat them everyday. 

I served them with fresh homemade tortillas and pico de gallo.  

Interesting aside:  I sent my hubby to the store to buy the meat.  He came back with a 4 pound boston butt and said, "They didn't have a shoulder, but this was just the right size."  I laughed and said, "Well, you did good, dear.  A butt is a cut from the shoulder."

I was leery about 3 tablespoons of salt. Basically, it ruined the meat. No amount of cheese or burrito wrapping made this recipe edible. Next time, I'll start with one tablespoon and go from there.

I have to say WOW! This was the best pork I've made in a long time. It turns out so moist and tender you barely have to touch it with a fork and it falls apart.  I had trouble keeping people's hands away from the pork while I was shredding it!  I know everybody gives it a good rating even though they make their own adjustments to it but I followed the recipe exactly and it turns out great!  No changes or substitutions needed! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was wonderful. Juicy and flavorful! I made this for a large get together and it got rave reviews. The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic and after reading many reviews I determined that this was a misprint and in fact this needs 1 whole bulb of garlic. Upping the amount of garlic and seasonings is the only thing I changed about this recipe. Definitely deserving of 5 stars!!!

I rate recipes based on the basic "bones" of the recipe. If I change quantity of seasonings to adjust for our preferences (we love heat!) without changing any major steps I still believe that I can fairly rate the result. That said, I added additional spices and one jalapeno with seeds to the liquid. I made a double batch hoping to have leftover meat for a second meal later. Wrong! Kids ate up every last bit. My 90 year old Italian grandmother swears the answer to dry meat is to shred then add some olive oil to the mixture. It has worked for me in a pinch but wasn't needed here as the pork was succulent.

These Carnitas were DELISIOSO! I'm so glad I found this recipe, they taste just like the Carnitas my Mother used to make when I was home. I used very little cayenne Pepper instead of Chilli since I didn't have any but it turned out fine, it gave it a faint kick of spice.  I made these for New Years Eve and every one loved them d!  It was sooo easy to make too. I will definitely be making these again.

WOW!   I've been searching for the perfect carnitas recipe and finally found it.   Hubby is chowing down as we speak and not speaking, just saying MMMMMMMMM a lot so I think it passed the test.  I did omit the garlic as I can't eat it  (which by the way is a complete bummer as I totally love garlic).   There are so many other complex spices in there that I'm not sure we missed it.  Other than the garlic, I followed the recipe as is and it came out perfect.  I used my 6qt enameled cast iron dutch oven.  A definite 5 star and multiple thumbs up recipe.

These are great. However you don't want to preheat your oven first if you're going to cook the meat in a Dutch oven for 2.5 hours.  The taste was great and my Hispanic hubby approves.

I used a pork loin cut into big chunks, 1 tbs. salt, 3 cloves garlic, extra oregano and cumin and rub the seasoning into the meat before putting in the crock pot with the chicken broth to cook all day on low.  Really good flavor.  I would like to try and make it in the dutch oven as written but the crock pot was the only choice since I wasn't going to be home all day.

I've made a few carnitas recipes from here an they were all equally good but these were by far the best.  I think I used 4-5 cups of water and 1 cubed buillion; covered and simmered for one hour, uncover, and continue simmering until reduced and pork is half way tender.  I then roughly chopped them up and sautéed in a pan with a little vegetable oil and poured some broth....super!!!  I think these would be super yummy as a stew with potatoes and peas.

I must say that this recipe is fantastic. My wife and I are from California but live in Germany currently, where one can not buy carnitas at a restaurant. I tried this recipe and it felt like being at our favorite little Mexican cantina in California. I added juice from a orange to the braising liquid. I also saw the correction for bulb of garlic and not a clove. Browning and basting the meat in the oven gave the carnitas wonderful color and texture. Enough said! I like this recipe so much that I am cooking this for a lunch time fund raiser at the high school where I work. Carnitas, cilantro, onions, lime, and a splash of your favorite brand of salsa picante, served on a warmed corn tortilla... Mark

I have made carnitas using some pretty labor intensive recipes, this was the simplest by far and the flavors perfectt.  Taking from one of my other recipes for carnitas I reduced the amount of chicken broth by a can and substituted orange juice.  It works nicely.  It's easy to remove the big hunks of fat during shredding so everything in the end crisps up nicely.  I recommend guacamole and  'Goya''s black beans and rice recipe to be rolled in with the tortillas for serving.  But this was so good plain worked very nicely.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I both thought this was excellent! Great flavor, and very moist and tender! Only things I changed were that I skipped browning the outside (out of laziness) and cooked it in a crock pot instead. I also reduced the broth by about half. This will definitely become a regular dinner in our house!

I made this and it was spectacular. I eyed the amounts and also by taste. I was skeptical about it crisping in the oven but it did!! I had wonderful carnitas, moist on the inside and crispy outside. I made some pico de gallo and warmed up some corn tortillas, it was perfect. The seasoning is perfect I didn't change or add anything. Huge hit for my family and even my 3 yr old granddaughter loved them. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!! :-)

My first time making Mexican food (other than from a taco kit).  It came out wonderfully!  I halved the recipe, as we did not need such a large batch.  

I followed the advice of another review by adding some cola to the liquid.  Very good call!  Note also the author's clarification about the garlic: I used 4 or 5 cloves, and it wasn't at all too much.  There is a lot of cooking liquid left over -- anyone have suggestions for ways to use it?  I hate to see it go to waste.  I used no fat, low sodium chicken broth, and it was plenty flavorful.  (And I normally don't like low fat anything).  Using a non-low-sodium broth may have made it too salty.

As for the oven heating stage, just cover the baking pan with foil to avoid any burning.  Don't forget to shred for a better texture.  (One of the photos shows a much chunkier version, which is fine if you prefer).   I also recommend garnishing with some cilantro at the end.  I paired this with a recipe for tortilla soup -- mucho gusto than Chipotle!

This was soo delicious ! Best carnitas I've ever made . Per suggestion of author I added more (double) garlic and one box of chicken broth . I used pork butt because it was on sale . I doubled the cumin because we like cumin, and I probably used about half the salt . Yummy ! Served it on warmed corn tortilla w quesadilla Mexican cheese and pico . Outstanding !

Followed exactly as written but added 1lb. of dried black beans to braise with pork...YUM!  Was feeding a crowd so I used 4lbs. pork butt and 5lbs. pork loin. I think the loin would've been too lean on its own. I used 3Tbsp KOSHER salt for the whole 9lbs.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe! Not only will this go in my rotation but I will never order carnitas out again :-)

I combined some of the ideas from the reviews, like rubbing the 1/2 spices on before browning, used 1/2 beer and 1/2 chicken stock. I also had to simmer mine for an extra hour, but that was probably my fault! It came out perfect!
I will DEFINITELY make this again! Also note the review from the original publisher of this said use 1 bulb of garlic, not 1 clove (more garlic = yummy!)

This is a great recipe for Pork Carnitas. Of course, I had to modify it to my liking. I seared the roast in my cast iron dutch oven and then added my chicken broth (32 oz box variety might i add, perfect for what I was doing). Then I added a bunch of veggies, different kinds of bell peppers (green, yellow and orange and red onion with yellow onion) gave it a beautiful color, along with three fourths of a jalapeno pepper (for that little kick), along with a bit of cayenne pepper. I left out the salt, the pork gives it enough of that. Didn't need to do all the baking and pouring of the juices. It's all in the pot. Brought all this to a boil on the stove top. Reduced to a simmer and it took me only little over 2 hours (cuts out a lot of time, which I know is precious to some folks). Pulled it apart perfectly, then I poured some of the juices to keep it moist and scooped all the veggies and ladled them on top. Mixed it up so that color comes thru when you put it on your taco or burrito.  Sold them at work and folks keep coming back for more. Works great with chicken too!

Tonight was the first time I've ever made carnitas, and let me just say....YUMMY!!!! I cut the recipe in half, since its just me and the hubby. After reading reviews I also cut salt in half and it was perfect! Otherwise I followed the instructions completely. My husband LOVED it as well and stuffed himself!! The pork was so tender and juicy and full of flavor!! I served it in home made flour tortillas with cilantro, onions and tomatoes and Barracho Beans on the side. I do think I will use beer in the broth next time! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!!!

I'm glad I read Nette's review of her own recipe before making this.  I used the whole bulb of garlic, as she said in the review, and I always use low-sodium chicken broth then salt to taste. Ours definitely wasn't overly salty. It was perfect.

The key is definitely the last step in the oven to crisp the edges of the meat.  It made the carnitas so much better than the ones I usually make in the crockpot. 

I served with warm tortillas, homemade guacamole and pico.  This one will be put into our regular rotation.

Very tender and tasty, I thought it would have a little more flavor though. Next time I will probably add some Montreal seasoning for a smoky flavor. I don't think it needed to be crisped in the oven either. I will skip this step next time too.

Holy cow these are FANTASTIC! This is my husband's new favorite meal, and he says they remind him of home in El Paso (a big compliment to this Pacific NW cook lol). My only changes are that I generally make this in the crockpot for ease, reducing the broth by half accordingly. After a long day the meat just falls into shreds itself & I finish by baking as directed. When it's just for adults (husband likes spicy) I add some peppers to the crockpot & then sprinkle the shredded meat with dried chipotle pepper before basting/baking. BUT, the recipe is perfect just the way it is - a winner for the whole family!! PS - I like my tacos with cilantro, onion, & a squeeze of lime. YUM!!! Thank you!!!

I made this for Christmas dinner, and I'm making it again for a  Super Bowl party!  It is so authentic, delicious and visibly appealing!  Talk about easy to make, although it does take a bit of time to ensure there are enough crispy pieces for everyone.  I made it a day ahead of time, chilled it, scooped off any grease and reheated it.  Delicious, healthy and relatively fat-free!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.  Oh - there's no need to preheat oven for such a long time...

Wow!!! These were delish!   The one hint I have is to trim the thick fat off the pork shoulder before browning.  also- try making the braised meat the night before, then chilling the meat in one container, and the sauce in the other overnight in the fridge.  Much easier to skim all the fat off the liquid and remove fat from the chilled meat chunks.  Finally- I know it looks like a huge chunk of meat- but consider buying an 8 pound pork shoulder rather than 4--- these are so good you will wish you made a double batch.

Very easy, awesome receipt.  I made them just like the receipt and added 3 juices of fresh oranges. I took the left over pork and put it in the broth that they were cooked in and made pork carnita soup. Best ever, give it a try.

I use this recipe as a guide, I honestly don't follow it very closely. I double the spices, use less then 1 tbsp of salt, and use a full lime. I also season the pork before browning it and use low sodium chicken stock (or I make my own stock and don't salt it). With carnitas you need to be careful with how much salt you use because the browning process gets rid of some of the moisture, but the salt stays. Also, to avoid drying the meat out completely, don't pull it into really small pieces, and baste in 7 minute increments instead of 10.

This recipe is in fact very good but I found it a bit lacking... I asked one of my friends who's mother is a excellent cook when it comes to spanish foods. She said her mother always  uses a sliced lime and and orange in the broth. I made it again using this recipe but added the whole slice orange and the whole slice lime and it was really great!

Yum!! I just needed enough for myself, so I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving and used a pork chop. Very moist and flavorful. I served with pico de gallo and sour cream.

Wow, is the word that comes in mind to best describe these carnitas!  I made the recipe exactly as printed.  My only change was to add about three tablespoons of cilantro to the broth while boiling the pork.  We had a 3 & 1/2 pork butt for four of us.  Not much left over!  Thank you Nette for the great recipe.  This goes into the keeper book for sure.

Just made these tonight for dinner and they were awesome! Followed the recipe exactly but added more garlic. I thought the meat would dry out too much in the oven, but if you put on a good amount of sauce every ten minutes as stated and more at the end it's great! We served these on corn tortillas with chopped white onion and cilantro and a squirt of lime. I will definitely make these again!

The recipe was GREAT. A bit to salty & chili was a bit overpowering. Also, as a bit of a change, I used a pressure cooker for 20 minutes instead of simmering for 2-1/2 hours - turned it into a pretty quick meal. I also cut down on the broth since it doesn't boil off in a pressure cooker. I only used 32 oz of broth and still ended up with a lot of liquid, which I thickened & used as a sauce. Outstanding! I will be using this recipe as a baseline in the future. Nette is right on that the final step in crisping it up is critical. A watchful eye under a broiler worked well, too.

Delicious.  I use slightly less salt and don't salt the meat again before browning in the oven, but otherwise I don't alter the recipe.   I also try to pare off as much fat as possible before cooking, since this has the potential to be VERY greasy (there's still plenty of fat after removing most of it).  Great flavor.

Juices were sooo good!  I enjoyed this very much.  I put it in the oven, but was so worried about it getting dry that I dredged it in juices before I put it in the oven and then kept putting the sauces on every ten minutes. I actually kept some of the juices on the side and put in a dish and then spooned it on my taco.  Very good and super easy!  I also used a tenderloin instead of shoulder.

This recipe was delicious! The only thing I would change next time is to use 1 tablespoon of salt instead of the recommened 3. Otherwise, it was a hit!

This was outstanding! My husband says this may be the best dish that I have made for him. I followed it except I put in a bit more lime juice and I had 32 oz of chicken broth so I just used all of it. I did not need to cook it for 2.5 hours, more like 2 hours. I used the extra liquid to saute some mushrooms and peppers on the side with afterwards. I also only cooked it in the oven for 20 min to brown the meat.

I made a 6 lb pork shoulder (less the bone because it wouldn't all fit in my Dutch oven). It was excellent. I probably could have crisped it up a little more, but it was tasty even like it was and we were ready to eat! We fed 5 adults and 7 kids, all with seconds and  thirds or more. I think we'd have kept eating, but we ran out of pork! Probably a good thing because we had warm apple crisp waiting for us! Flavors in this recipe are wonderful and easy to play with. This dish takes some time to prepare, but it's inexpensive, feeds a lot of people, would freeze well and tastes great.

Made this yesterday using boneless country style pork ribs. Loved it! I will definitely be making this again. I feel it doesn't need 4 cans of broth so I used only 2 cups and it was plenty. I added 2 large garlic cloves, and eyeballed the seasonings. I did not use 3 tbsp of salt - that would be a salt-lick! I just sprinkle the meat with kosher salt and add more when it was done before moving it to the oven. The flavor is wonderful!

This recipe is so easy, and it turned out perfectly. I forgot to buy an onion, so I had to omit that, but otherwise I followed the recipe as published and after about 3.5 hours, I had carnitas that were as good as any I've had in a restaurant. The last step of basting and baking is key to crisping up the surface of the pork while keeping it moist inside. Adding the cooking liquid will also keep the pork from cooking onto the pan, which I see someone had a problem with. I lined my pan with foil, just to be safe, but isn't necessary as long as you add liquid several times during baking. I served this on arepas with cabbage, cilantro and chipotle salsa. Nom nom nom.

This meat turned out really good.  It was done and tender after 10 minutes in the oven, so I didn't let it go another 20 because I didn't want it to dry out.  I have a convection oven, so that might have made a difference in the cooking time.

I've used this recipe several times and it's fantastic! Today I set it in the slow cooker in the morning and came home from work to a beautiful, fall off the bone meal. I used pork hocks - great price and absolutely fine in the slow cooker. Recommended!

I have made this at least 20 times since finding this recipe a few years ago, so I can't believe I'm just now reviewing it. TRULY 5-STAR. It is gobbled up by my picky kids and discerning foodie taco party guests alike. I love that no one spice or flavor tries to steal the spotlight - they all just work together to create this masterpiece of juicy, crisp-edged, porky bliss. As some reviewers note (and I believe the original author), the garlic amount should be a full head of garlic, i.e. all the cloves peeled and smashed with the side of a knife. Simply amazing.

DARN GOOD carnitas! This recipe might as well be carNEATas, it’s so simple and distinct. I’ve seen other recipes call for blending Turkey livers into the meat...what?! Why would anyone sully this swine with fowl meat? I found that inserting garlic hunks into the meat prior to simmering adds a wonderfully complex aroma. Seriously though, Turkey livers?? What the heck!

Good overall, but make sure to not add more than ONE tablespoon of salt.  WAYYYYYYY too salty. Unedible with 3 tablespoons of salt. I think the original poster  must have meant 3 teaspoons of salt.

This creates pork carnitas just like you get them in a restaurant, with crispy edges but overall juicy, flavorful meat. Don't skip the oven part, because that's what creates the crispy pieces, and don't skip putting the juice on the meat every 10 minutes while it's in the oven, because that keeps it moist and flavorful. We used pork butt which was well-marbled with fat. I definitely recommend using a fatter piece of pork rather than a lean one, just for flavor and juiciness. I served it simply, in a corn or flour tortilla with just onions, tomatoes, and cilantro for toppers. We also had some jalapeno jelly called "Sweet Heat" bought at the Kroger cheese counter that was absolutely perfect on these tacos. The sweet goes so well with pork, and the heat of the jalapenos was just right. Highly recommend that. To round our meal out, I made guacamole and Mexican street corn, with flan as the dessert. Yum!

I didn't have the full amount of chicken broth on hand the day I made these so I substituted a can of vegetable broth and two cups of bouillon-type chicken broth reconstituted. The flavor was ok but the meat was a little dry even with the added liquid when browning in the oven.

SSSOOOOOOOOO yummy! I reduced the salt the first time, forgot last time, it was still outstanding but I will use less next time. Only down side is we may stop going to one of our favorite Mexican restaurants, because we both think my carnitas are just as good with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Easy and delicious, even with using water instead of chicken broth. I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, and roasted garlic powder before sauteing, and I used about 8 cloves of garlic (see the original poster's comment). TIP: I like to keep True Lime powder on hand because it's not always easy to find good limes.

If you're looking for a fantastic Carnitas recipe, then look no further!  Wow, this was absolutely delicious! Made exactly as written except I halved the recipe (there's only two of us and it made plenty!) and based on other reviews I used only 1/3 of the salt.  Absolutely heavenly! Served with soft corn tortillas, guacamole, cilantro and hot sauce.  Mmmmmmm! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

Very easy recipe. I did make a few changes. I subbed bacon fat for the vegetable oil, reduced the salt by a third, and added the juice of one orange. I made it in my Instant Pot, and kept it on slow cook after the pressure turned off. We’ll be having this one again.

Full of flavor and a crowd hit!
Big Green Egg modification:  Slow cook the pork butt on the BGE until done.  Approximately 2 hours before meat is done, put all of the other ingredients in a crock pot on low.  When pork is done, shred into crock pot.  Amazing!

I made an almost 10 pound butt roast with this recipe in my pressure cooker for a large group. The pork was AMAZING! I did not use that much chicken stock though because you just don't need it in the pressure cooker.

How does this have such a high rating? I used a THIRD of the salt and this still came out entirely way too salty. It was almost inedible.

Simple enough. I brined the pork for 24ish hours, in an apple, orange, pineapple juice mix found at the grocery store. Then followed the instructions on this recipe. Instead of in the oven, I did it on the grill with lump charcoal. It turned out juicy, tender and delicious.

Don't be tempted to make slow cooker carnitas! Make this recipe instead to get the real deal. I find this is a great starting point for spice ratios, so you can adjust the salt and seasonings to your liking (I use much less salt and way more spice than called for). It's the cooking method that does the trick -- nice, tender meat with that addictive crispy crust. My husband and I eat this stuff like candy.

Delicious!  The whole family loved it with rice and corn tortillas.  I browned the pork in batches in my stockpot, since I don't have a Dutch oven.   I ended up with lots of extra sauce - it is too good to discard, so we'll be saving it for the leftovers.

It was nice and tender. I did sere it on the grill for the smokey flavor.  Would add a lot more heat next time. I like it spicier.

I've made this recipe 2 times before-its great! This third time, I made the chicken stock with water and chicken bouillon, then I added the lime juice and onion to it before pouring into the Dutch oven. This seems to bring out more flavor.

The shredded pork was moist and delicious! I liked it more than pulled pork on a bun.  It was fun to serve the carnitas on corn tortillas with all kinds of accompaniments: salsa, diced tomato, chopped red onion, cilantro, avocado.

Very  good! Make sure to do the frying at the end enough to get a good quantity of crisped, carmalized, whatever on the meat. It makes the pork double delicious

I had to make a smaller amount for 2 and reduced ingredients. Used a crock pot and I think I cooked it too long.  It was good but I cooked the flavor out of it I think.

Amazing recipe. I incorporated the recommended changes by the author (more garlic, less salt, 1 box of broth) and used a pork shoulder (Boston butt). I only cooked the pork for 15 min at 400 at the end as my pork was already crispy on the outside by that point. Carnitas wrapped up in fresh flour tortillas with pico de gallo - yum yum! The whole family loved it, even the kids.

I have made this about 15 times and this recipe thoroughly impresses anyone that I make this for. I have also made a slight rift on this from time to time- if you have a Big Green Egg, finishing it on the BGE instead of the oven adds great flavor. I create a serving bar for guests to top them with queso fresco, diced jalapeños, cilantro, pico de gallo and additional lime.

This recipe was delicious!  I did make a change on how I cooked it and if I make again I will cut back on the salt.   I increased the amount of garlic.  I also used a pork loin and cut up into small strips.  I marinated the pork in the fridge over night with all the ingredients except the broth.  The next morning I placed everything in a crock pot and then added 1 quart of homemade chicken broth.  Placed the crock pot on high and it was done when we got home from church.  We shredded the pork and I saved the broth remains for to make tortilla soup later on in the week.  Our whole family loved this recipe and will make again and again!

This was SALTY.  Next time I'll leave the salt out of the pot and only lightly salt before sticking in the oven.  Salt aside, it was delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again, leaving out most of the salt!

The only addition I made to the recipe was two of those tiny cans of Pepsi (Mexican-cane sugar pepsi) added at separate times during the simmering process. Rave reviews. Would definitely make again.

This was super easy and so good.  I need to figure out what to top it with, but the meat is soooo yummy .  Some reviews said it was too salty, but I think they added the salt when they cooked it in the oven  I followed the recipe exactlly and it worked out great.

I made this, and i am making it for a 2nd time today. If you can't tell i really enjoyed this recipe!I would recommend not using as much salt ,because the ONLY problem that i encountered was that it was way too salty for my taste.I used 2 Tbl spoons instead of  the 3.This time i am only going to use 1 Tbl spoon instead of 3.

I'm going to rate this a bit low mainly because of the amount of broth. By the time this cooks down, the broth flavor overpowers the pork. And I use 1/2 cup lard, which may not be healthy, but it's darned delicious. Also--a bit of nitpicking here--Why am I heating up my oven (to 400 degrees, no less) 3 hours before I'm going to use it?

Made this exactly as described. My husband and kids are Mexican and I try to bring them up making authentic Mexican dishes. This was great. Paired it with Spanish rice, Refried beans, and guacamole. Tastes exactly the way they make it at my favorite Mexican restaurant. Will make this MANY more times!

First time ever making pork carnitas and this did not disappoint!!! I used a 4 pound pork loin and followed the recipe exactly as described (besides the pork loin of course.. grocery store didn't have what this recipe called for).This was flavorful, moist, and just delicious. I will be making this again. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Loved this recipe.   So easy and sooo tasty.   I reduced the salt as just about everyone suggested and increased the garlic as the author suggested.   This is a much requested family favorite.    Best carnitas ever.

This is by far the best recipe I've ever used for Carnitas.  I will not use any other recipe ever again.  My friend and I make dinner on Saturdays and we rotate the cooking.  She mostly does it, and I bring the side things.  We usually always have the meal at their house because they have two granddaughters that we like to be with.  I would not change anything about this recipe.  IT IS PERFECT!

Made some Chipotle-style burritos with this. They turned out great! Served with black beans, sour cream, lettuce, guacamole, salsa, and rice all wrapped up in a huge whole grain tortilla! Sorry I don't have a pic!

The third time really IS a charm!  This was the third recipe I tried, and I swore I would never try again if I didn't like it.  Thank you Nette!  Except for using 1 tablespoon of salt, I didn't change a thing and this was perfect.  Paired it with some Refried Bean Soup and fresh cooked flour tortillas last night.  Today, it went into a quesadilla.  Delicious!

I wasn't so sure about baking the meat to make it "crispy" but da-gone-it, it's fantastic!  The meat is super flavorful without spicy heat so even the kids enjoyed it!

I doubled the spices/lime juice (minus the salt - 1 T was PLENTY) and mixed it with one cup of broth to pour over 7 lbs of smoked pulled pork (finished weight). DELICIOUS "pork tacos"!

This is a very nice and easy recipe for Carnitas.  I cut the chicken broth to one can.  Wonder if it is a typo as the cooking broth was sooo yummy. I was surprised at how flavorful as I kept with the seasonings pretty close. I think the only other change I made to the Carnitas was the garlic.  I like to use my three finger scoop method from a jar of minced garlic to many of my meat dishes that call for grlic..   Next time I'm going to add a bit of beer.

This was very good though I did cut back on the salt. I also added a jalapeno and Cilantro since I had some growing in the garden. Once it was done and shredded it I skimmed some of the fat off the reserved liquid and put it in a fry pan and tossed the meat into it to get crispy. Oh my that was so good.

I made this over the weekend for a Mexican/Spanish inspired potluck that we hosted.  Because of time and the ridiculous humidity that we were having, I decided to make this in the crock pot.  I browned the meat before putting it in the crock, used all of the ingredients exactly as stated, and cooked it on high for 10 hours.  We had a 4.3lb pork shoulder and 10 hours was the perfect amount of time.  I opted not to put the finished carnitas in the oven to "crisp up" as the original instructions directed, although when I have more time I will definitely add this step!  The result was a delicately flavored, moist, fall-aparty (like my word? lol), porky treat.  We served them with the traditional carnitas fixin's of cilantro, tomatoes, red onions, and lime; but we also added salsa, guac, fried onions, various cheeses, and sour cream to the table, for the non-traditional.  We served small flour tortillas and cilantro lime rice with this, which were equally great as a vessel for the pork.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy it and there were hardly any leftovers.  My only suggestion would be to add a little more chili powder or some thing similar to up the spice level (if you're into spicy these really were not spicy at all, but that could have been due to cooking in the crock pot as well).  Next time I'm going to follow the exact cooking method which I'm sure will be even better!

It was my first time making carnitas! All I have to say is! That they came out better then some I have ate at the restaurant. They were super moist and tender. I added some bay leave which it didn't called for it,but I like the flavor better with it. I will make it again... My family was impressed with this meal.

I love this recipe!!! Don't judge me, I had to do some modifications (my hubby can't have certain foods because he has severe indigestion). I omitted the onion and chili powder. Because of this I doubled up on the garlic and lime. Everything else I followed to the letter. My husband and my kids asked for seconds! I made mine a little spicy by adding a little adobo sauce onto the tortilla. I love the fact that I can brown and boil and come back to it later. I browned it, added the rest of the ingredients, then went back to work. Set a timer and my nanny turned the stove off when the timer went off! Got home from work hours later, shredded and browned the meat again in just about 45 minutes. SOOO easy, sooo tasty.

You can also cook it in a really small dish, the smaller the better so it does not dry out and is cooked in its own fat! Extra flavor :D Cook it in the oven covered with tin foil for 2 hours.

Tried it once with great success. My tweaks: used big bottle of hard apple cider instead of broth. Also, I baked it for 20 minutes, basted twice. So tender with excellent flavor. Will make again!

I made this recipe pretty much as listed except I doubled up on the garlic and spices plus my roast was only 2.5 lbs.  It was so easy to make with ingredients that were already on hand; I loved it and will definitely make it again.

Great jumping off point.  Most people hit upon the cola, garlic and salt issues.  Few other tweaks you may want to consider...I used Serrano chilies and one navel orange.  Great flavor.

This was delicious and full of flavor! I doubled spices in the broth mixture and added cayenne pepper for some spice. After removing the meat from the sauce mixture I pulled meat apart and placed on baking sheet. Sprinkle all same seasoning again (so by this time I've about tripled if not quadrupled the amount of seasoning used) used in the cooking broth onto meat, including garlic powder this time and salt to add more flavor. Mix and then broil for 10 min, stirring halfway through.

great recipe.  My husband and I both loved this as well as my 10 month old twins.  My husband asked if we can give it more than 5 stars! I will be making this recipe again and again.  I will shred the meat more when it is baking as we loved the baked flavor and texture of it.

Comes out incredible if you DO NOT use 3 Tbsp of salt. I use about 1/2 Tbsp for the entire recipe. The one time I used the amount listed on the recipe, it was not palatable. But, everything else about the recipe is perfect. Really tasty carnitas,and I've made it for quite a number of gatherings. It is awesome.

This is a staple at our house.  I always double up on the chili powder, cumin, and oregano.  Be carful with your salt can turn out to salt if you like o generous with your seasonings like me!

Excellent recipe. I used a pork rub before I started the process. It sat for 24 hours and I'm sure it made a difference. This is a definite recommendation.

Cooked this in electric pressure cooker after browning pork and vege's in oil.  (I cut pork into 1 inch cubes and sprinkled with flour). Did not have all the spices so added a jar of salsa and it made a very yummy sauce. We spooned sauce and pork right out of the cooker over rice. Topped with chopped onions and tomatoes, grated cheese and dollop of sour cream. Sooooooo good, husband really enjoyed.

5 out of 5 stars!  Made this a few times now, followed the recipe exactly the first time, then tweaked it the next few (just changing what went into the pot while the pork was cooking in the broth), and every time was a huge success.  The whole family loved it and keeps asking when I'm going to make more.

I tried this and adjusted the servings for 8, it still called for 2 tablespoons of salt which I thought was a lot but I did it anyway, I think that next time I will only use 1 tablespoon as I thought they were a bit too salty but otherwise they turned out DELICIOUS and I will definitely make them again.

The recipe came out great. Love the flavor of the carnitas. Best ever!! Decided to freeze the leftover juice and use it next time instead of buying 4 cans of chicken broth. Hope it works. Just saw the added comment about the garlic bulb not clove. Think I will try wine or dark beer next time. Looking forward to trying the summer variation.

This recipe is amazing. I do the first stage of cooking in a slow cooker the day ahead and reheat in oven with reserved stock and avocado oil. I serve with warm corn tortillas, fresh guacamole and homemade tomatillo salsa. This brings a lot of smiles to a lot of faces.

This is an excellent recipe.  Normally I make and review recipes exactly as written but I did change a couple of spices based on other reviews.  I omitted the cinnamon and Chinese 5 spice, and added 2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp oregano as per Chef John's suggestion.  I also added 1 yellow onion chunked just because we love onion.  It was flavored perfectly and had the richness we've been searching for that has been missing in other recipes.  I did a chunky shred before broiling and it was easy to make the tacos.  Served with pico de gallo, lime and sour cream, this is a fabulous recipe and will be my go-to from now on.  Bravo Chef John!

It is good, I just always have issues with it coming out dry.  As the author suggests, shoulder or butt is better than loin, which is what I used.  It is very delicious, and versatile.

Muy deliciouso!!!  I cooked mine in a crockpot like some other reviewers then finished it off under the broiler.  I sautéed some onion, green pepper and yellow squash and used it and the pork to make burritos verde de puerco.  Our local Mexican joint may have lost a customer!

I cut the meat up in 1" pieces and sauteed in a large skillet with the rest of ingredients except the broth, until meat was browned, then added the broth, put the lid on it and simmered for 2 hours. I read a lot of the reviews and only seasoned with 1/2 tsp. of Kosher salt. We are watching our salt intake so I have to watch that. We just add at the table if needed. excellent recipe and served with refried beans, flour tortillas, salsa, sour  cream, fresh diced tomatoes and it was wonderful!

This taste soooooo good!  After I follow the recipe, I put a layer of the shredded pork on a very HOT skillet.  Let it crisp up like how the restaurants serve it down here in Texas. ..  so don't mix/stir until it gets crispy (8-10min).  Only let it crisp on one side so you'll get the yummy crispy meat & some tender meat.

Delicious as written.  I quick fry corn tortillas (20 seconds each side) then drain on paper towels.  I make Cole slaw and layer the pork and Cole slaw on top of the tortillas. Delicious!

Loved it!  Omitted onion due to dietary restrictions; used 1 tsp of onion power instead.  Added pork to salad with red pepper, cilantro and cheese and made chipotle-ranch dressing.  Delicious!!  Thanks Nette

Our whole family loves this meal. All I change is I salt and pepper grind the meat before browning. Low sodium chicken broth and juice of three limes.  I don’t add any extra salt until the broiling method and usually add 10 to 20 minutes to the broiling time. This is also great sprinkled on some eggs with sriracha.

Made this not changing any ingredients, but cooking it in a crock pot for about 9 hours and it came out really good.

Delicious recipe.  I used a boneless pork butt.  I read the reviews  put in less salt than the recipe called for.  That was a mistake as I had to add salt to the the finished product.  Next time I will add the stated amount.  The 30 minutes in the oven did not seem to crisp up the carnitas the way I wanted, so I put the pan of carnitas under  the broiler for a couple of minutes to crisp up.  Delicious.  Will definitely make this  again.

I have to say, this is the first recipe for carnitas that I have tried and it will be the one I make forever!  It is so flavorful ??. I stuck to the recipe guidelines except I cut the pork butt down to under 3 pounds. It’s only me and I didn’t want 5-6 pounds of left over pork. The flavor infused well. I recommend this recipe with a healthy portion of pico de Gallo and guacamole with warm flour tortillas.

This was superb, however I substituted some orange juice for half of the liquid and  no salt homemade chicken stock. Also swapped out apple cider vinegar for the lime juice. Came out supremely flavorful, tasted wonderful on some corn tortillas with salsa, sour cream and lettuce!

Very easy to make and very flavorful! Adding serrano chilies would make this a 5 star recipe in my opinion.  Definitely keeping this recipe within easy reach.

Turned out really well. We had enough to turn them into 2 meals. One soft -tacos with cabbage instead of lettuce and the other half into a mexican style rice and beans meal. Thank you for a great recipe. My husband really liked them and has asked that I make them again on a regular rotation.

This was awesome! Husband and children approved. I did only use 2T salt instead of three and that was perfect for us. I know she says you can use a bulb of garlic but I thought the 1 clove was great. We will definitely be making this again.

Great! The only changes I made were using a much larger pork shoulder cut into pieces, homemade broth, 2 cans of beer (extra we didn't particularly like),  a little liquid smoke and salt to taste. Served it with a lime & cilantro slaw in corn tortillas. Yum! All the adults and kids liked it, even my one who says she doesn't like pork. Very flavorful. Yum!!

Delicious! I used country style ribs instead of pork shoulder and it was delicious. I used 2 tablespoons salt instead of 3 and turned the spices into a dry rub. I browned it with the spices, added the garlic, onion, and lime juice, then I simmered it in the chicken broth. It was delicious!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic. The best carnitas I have ever made! I used an 8 lbs pork loin so I doubled all the ingredients except for the chicken broth. I put everything in a crockpot, I didn’t brown the meat and I used one quart of chicken broth because that’s all I could fit in a crockpot. I cooked it low for 8 hours, then put it in the oven for 20 minutes. It was sooooo good, everyone loved it. The only thing that perplex me now is what I should do with the leftover liquid. The flavor is so good, I don’t want to throw it away, maybe I will use it to make soup or cook some beans. Thank you very much for such an easy and delicious recipe. I will be making this again and again.

I make this all the time and change  little flavors like orange vs lime juice or adding Bay Leaves vs chipotle. I usually use about 1 1/2 lbs of pork butt instead of the whole roast. This works great and makes enough carnitas for  at least two meals for my family of three.

This is very good.  Made it twice so far.  The second time I only used enough salt to season the pork before browning, deleted the chili powder and added 1/4 cup mole to the stock before braising.   Even better.  Thanks for an easy and tasty meal.

prepared these carnitas twice now....the first time I cooked'em just like the original recipe. Everyone who tried them loved them but had a few suggestions.The second time I prepared them I used a pork loin and bacon drippings to brown the meat then added bell peppers , fresh jalapenos (two) a bottle of Shiner Bock beer and a bit more lime to the pot. These where the "BOMB". Nothing but love.

I've made this at least a dozen times. Here's my suggestions. 1. Skip the oven step. Instead, put whatever you plan to eat in a skillet and crisp it up. Faster and better. 2. If you are from the Southwest, especially Texas, double the meat and triple the spices, except salt. It still won't be enough, this stuff is seriously delicious. Cut the stock in half, and add a can of Coke. 2. If you aren't from the South, make it as directed, it will be a little less spicy, but still, do the skillet thing. Anyway, we make this in big batches to store in the fridge. Take what you want out and fry them up. That way, they get carmelized, but they don't dry out. Great with eggs.

We found pork carnival precut at the store. We halved halved the recipe for our family and still had plenty. Adjusted the seasonings for our taste. We will definitely have this in our regular meal rotation.

I made this exactly as the recipe called it. Delicious. Made tacos. Made Cubano sandwiches. I will definitely make this again.  Might go a little heavier on the spices, but honestly, as is, it's very tasty and we're able to make a lot of different dishes with it.

Yummy!  I've made this several times.
After browning and adding all the ingredients, I put my dutch oven in the oven at 300 for at least 3 hours instead of cooking on top of the stove.  When I'm ready to serve I remove the lid, shred it up a bit, and crank the heat up to 500 to get some browned edges.
Also, it is a bit salty, so I've started substituting beer and fresh orange juice for the chicken broth.  My mom used to use coca cola - but I've been told to use only the old type with cane sweetener and so far I haven't been able to find that.

This technique was great, the pork was so tender and shredded itself. I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of quantities of spices. I seasoned according to my tastes. Got thumbs up!

Absolutely delicious! Tho a tad bit salty for me so the next time (and you best believe there will be a next time) I make this I'll probably cut the salt in half, otherwise this is a fantastic recipe. Tho 1 clove of garlic is far from enough so I'll be sure to add far more in the next go around.

YUM YUM YUM!!! I make these about once a week and my boyfriend licks his plate clean every time!
My own adjustments:
-As others have said, use a whole bulb of garlic and cut down the salt
-I use some garlic salt in place of salt (We realllllllly like garlic)
-I leave it in the slow cooker over night (sometimes 10 hours) then turn to Keep Warm until I'm ready to crisp in the oven
-I use the leftover broth (watered down) to make a "French Onion Soup" with croutons and cheese
-I tried to cook it on high in the slow cooker recently and it didn't taste same. Definitely worth it to let it cook slowly and let all of the juices absorb

This is one of my favorites now. Nothing better than the soft tacos topped with avocado and fresh lime.
We don't like the bite of the chili so I did alter that. I only used 1 1/2 teaspoon of it & it was perfect. Enough to flavor without overpowering everything else.

Had some cuts of pork (bone in) that were all different sizes and shapes, so I just seared them in a pan then kind of hacked the bigger pieces up. I cut the salt way down and used half a head of garlic. I already had beans cooking (Allrecipes One Pot Pinto Beans) on the stove.  I was in a hurry, so tried to “hurry” the pork along. The carnitas were tasty, but the next night the left overs were fabulous! So, next time I will follow the directions and plan a little better for more time preparing this dish.

Tried the recipe as is to begin with and it was real good. I tried it the second time and used Coke instead of chicken broth, like the real Mexican recipes and added 6 cloves of garlic. I also put the meat under the broiler instead of the 400 degree oven. It turned out to be delish. Either way I would give it 5 stars.

Fantastic pork!  I doubled the recipe and simmered the meat in a slow cooker for several hours.  It was fall apart tender and smelled so wonderful we didn't even bother with the final baking step. The leftovers fill get the baking treatment tonight after soaking in the broth for a day. Moist, tender, flavorful, and easy!

I tweeted the spices slightly, as I had just over 2 pounds of meat. Not sure what I did wrong, because it all looked good, and I followed cooking instructions to a T. It was a little dry... served with pico de gallo, warm tortillas (I prefer corn, hubby likes flour), a side of Spanish rice (I add plain brown rice to the pre-seasoned package to cut the sodium and make it healthier), and some of Bush’s new Southwestern pinto beans (don’t recall the exact name, but they are yummy!). Hubby said I’m “allowed” to make it again. Haha! So, it’s a winner. Any ideas why mine was dry?

Absolutely fabulous!! easy to make!! Of course I altered the recipe.  I used a whole lime and there the whole thing  in the pot!  I guesstimated the measurements, I'm a little heavy on my spices!  Made it for a youth group dinner and it was a hit!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Do  realize that "Carnitas"means pork? There is no beef, chicken, or fish carnitas.  It should be just Carnitas instead of pork carnitas which is pork pork. Recipe turn out good.

The recipe is very easy and so delicious. You can add jalapeños to the boil if you want to add heat. Very very tasty. Don't waste your time with a crock pot! Make the time to reduce the wonderful flavor that you are creating! I made it once for Cinco de mayo. And now it's June 2nd and it's time for round two cause Matty wants some carnitas!

The juiciest most delicious carnitas I've ever made.  I'll never do my old crock pot recipe again.  I used less salt based on many reviews and it turned out perfect.  My husband loved this recipe so much I made it 2 nights in a row now!

This was absolutely amazing, i added 2 cloves instead of one. Other than that, I made zero changes. My 5 kids and husband couldn't stop moaning about how wonderful it was. I used some of the drippings in the rice that I made. Husband declared it was the best carnitas he's ever eaten. (and he's a HUGE carnitas fan)

This was really good! The only changes I made were 1.  I used pork steaks, 2. I added some candied jalapeños that I had on hand, and 3. Instead of baking at 400 degrees while whole, I shredded the meat then used Low broil to brown the meat. I still added the renderings every 10 minutes. This recipe was a hit! No leftovers, will definitely make again.

I am confused by this recipe. I assume you first cook it in the oven because the first instructions say to preheat the oven to 400,then turn down to medium low, which sounds like maybe cooking it on the stove top. I don't have a Dutch oven and need a bit of clarity on this. Thanks!

Forgot the lime juice and used some beer and some chicken broth. I only found a loin roast at the store. Browned it up and put it in a slow cooker for 3 hours. Stuff fell apart! I shredded it and place it on a cookie sheet and "browned" it under a light broiler setting for about 5-6 minutes instead of baking for 30 minutes. Smelled soooo good cooking!

This was great!  This was the second time I made this and I doubled the recipe and made a whole bunch.  It reheats  well for leftovers.  This time, I let the meat cook in the dutch oven for about 6 hours (on very low heat for the last few hours) and I skipped the oven baking/browning steps since my husband likes the meat really moist.  He likes big pieces of meat so I only shredded it a little.  Shredding was super easy because the meat was very tender.

We followed directions except for put it in the slow cooker.  Texture  was perfect but way to salty.  I would recommend cutting back the salt.

There’s a lot of ways to vary this. I cooked a porkshoulder picnic in smoker, finished it off in crock pot and shredded it down. Cooked everything up tomatillos and poblanos.  And instead of baking in oven, used cast iron skillet to dry everything out. I only used 2 cans broth and that was too much

End result was great though, served it up with black beans, plain yogurt, shredded cheese and hot sauce,  everyone loved it

I only modified one item because I am on a low carb diet. I substituted the onion with onion powder. Being on a strict diet I have been frantically searching to find meals that would fit the requirements. This not only did that but it was delicious to boot!

I looked for a pork recipe that my son might enjoy. He’s not a pork fan, but he loved it. We all did! Served with tortillas, avocado, diced tomatoes and cheese. I didn’t have chicken broth so I used beef broth and it was perfect!

Made this in the crock pot so I didn't get the crispiness but the flavor was on point!
I used the dry ingredients as a dry rub, seared the meat, and then set it on low for 15 hours. Seriously tender and flavorful.

Dry rub and wrap the pork shoulder and set in fridge overnight, the flavor is incredible and I add some juice from the crockpot to the roasting tray. Serve over Mexican rice seasoned black beans with cabbage slaw and feta on top. You can even add sour cream

Excellent! It is hard to get a compliment around here and I got several after fixing this for dinner tonight. Everyone loved it. I only made half a recipe and it was all eaten.  Next time I will make the full recipe and up the spices a little. I also didn't notice the amount of salt called for in the recipe, so didn't use nearly that much.

This was great!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't take several hours, and this was done in a little over 2 hours with very little work!  I used 2-3-inch pieces of pork, and after browning the meat, it cooked for about 1.5 hours and was ready to shred!  I put it in the oven for a total of 20 minutes, and it was ready to eat!  I'll definitely make it again.

I agree with Maria above. Very easy to over-season this otherwise excellent recipe.  I ditched the kosher salt altogether and merely dusted my pork pieces with Tony Chachere's as it was browning.  That ended up as PLENTY of seasoning enough, requiring NO adjustment onward.  Ended up with SUPERB Carnitas as braising and grill finishing.  Enjoy!

Make this recipe! I made it for a cinco de Mayo party at work and it was a hit. Several coworkers commented that it was the best pork that they have ever had. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less salt (1 tbl) and more garlic (1 whole head). Would not change anything else about this recipe and it's one of my new favorites.

This was my first attempt at making carnitas and they were excellent . Very flavorful. I made according to recipe however I only used about one tbsp salt. They were very adequately salted using the 1 tbsp. I do believe 3 tbsp would have ruined the dish. I used 4 large cloves of garlic which was adequate but could have used a little more. I was pleased with the flavor. The oven crisped the meat but the meat remained moist on the inside. Looking forward to making it again.

Made it for the Cuatro De Mayo Celebration at work!  Everyone loved it.  One of my friends said his mom used to make it in a copper pan and it departs an extra special flavor.   How can it possibly get better!?!?!?  Anyway, easy as pie.  I made it the night before and put it with the sauce in the fridge.  Next morning, I cranked up the oven and baked it.  At work we have a cute little oven and we hit it one more time just a for 10 minutes and BAM!

I doubled the spices except salt, reduced that to 1 tablespoon, added three bay leaves and cooked in the slow cooker for 10 hours, then cooked in the oven on a cookie sheet until crispy, simply fabulous.

Loved it!! The only thing I changed was way less salt,  32oz of low sodium chicken stock, and 4 big cloves of garlic.  This was so easy and delicious. Will be a recipe that I will keep making.

Super tasty and moist, yet crispy. Pretty sure this will be my go to recipe for pork carnitas. It is definitely the best recipe I have found so far. I used only one tablespoon of kosher salt instead of three. I used one (4 cup) carton of chicken broth. And I put my oven on convection.

Love this! I had about 2.5 lbs. of pork tenderloin so adjusted ingredients. Browned in Dutch oven really well and added the juice of one orange which we loved. Made sure to not overcook and the meat was tender and flavorful. Crisped it up under the broiler and the family said "You better write this one down!"  Served only with warm corn tortillas and the flavor was outstanding.

We made this for Christmas Dinner! So yummy. Very moist and flavorful. Kid and adult approved. Used pork butt and shoulder and some chunks of pork stayed tuff so I only shredded the soft pork chunks. Pretty sure it was chefs error. Left overs tomorrow!!

This was great.  I made it just as written except after browning in dutch oven, I put in a crock pot on low for 8 hours, then browned in the oven as written. So good! I served it on corn tortillas with chopped avocado, tomato, red onions, a squirt of lime juice and some garlic salt.  Next time I think I'll double the spices.

Absolutely wonderful.   Simple and delicious.  I added an extra tsp of cumin and oregano for a total of 1.5 tsp each, and 3 extra cloves of garlic for a total of 4.  Roasting it in the oven to finish made it perfectly crispy without drying it out.  Will definitely make again and again.

Oh my goodness!  The juice from this was so darned good that I had to make a gravy out of it! (I had about 1 quart of juice).  I ended up eating just a bowl of pork with gravy on it for supper, then had it for a snack later, then had it again for lunch the next day. This is seriously GOOD!

Amazing!! I don't have a Dutch oven so I used a regular pot and only cooked it for an hour on the stove. Everything else exactly the same. Served with homemade pico de gallo and warm tortilla. Family absolutely loved it!!!

I have made carnitas so many times in my lifetime but i followed directions almost to a tee- i subbed 2 red onions and 5 cloves garlic- used beef broth to amp it up more and 2 diced jalapenos-( clean & ribbed )and i went to farmers market today so added a whole bunch of fresh cilantro right before serving - delicious! Thanks!
But I am curious why you have to preheat oven fist to 400* isnt it on for 3 hours while on stove? Just curious

I made this last night, and it came out wonderfully. I didn't change much; I had no cumin, so I omitted it. I had no oregano, so I used Italian seasoning. I did not measure anything-I just put what I thought looked right, and I used 2 boxes of chicken broth. Also, I can only use one hand due to stroke, so I used the minced garlic from a jar. The roast I had was 9 lbs, so once I had it cut up (not easy), my largest Dutch oven was too small, so I had my two largest Dutch ovens simmering away on the stove. The baking sheet was super-heavy once all the meat was ready for the oven, but that's what Mr. Wonderful is there for. We'll be enjoying this all weekend. Will definitely make again!

This is tender, moist & delicious.  I have made it several times, and my husband loves it!  The only change I made was only using half the broth. The meat is very versatile - great on its own and works well in soft tacos or sandwiches.

I used boneless country ribs and prepared this on the stove top. The boneless ribs cooked till they fell apart! This is a great recipe! I also cut the salt to 1Tbsp. instead of 3. I felt that it was just right.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and absolutely love it.  The only difference is that I increase the cumin and oregano to 1 full teaspoon instead of just a half for extta flavor and add 1/2 cup of coca cola to the braising liquid.  They are as good as anything I've had in restaurants :)

Used a three pound pork tenderloin cut into about 9 small pieces. I couldn't get the meat to brown the first time on the stove, but did in the oven. I used 2 cups of beer and 2 cups of chicken broth to simmer the pork in. Also doubled up on the oregano and cumin. Simmered for 2 hours instead of 2 1/2.  It made a lot.

Great template.  I always go heavy with the spices--I probably use 6 or 7 times the listed amount of every spice, and I use 6 freshly chopped cloves of garlic.  Another tip--Shred the pork before putting it in the oven at the end, and sprinkle brown sugar instead of salt all over it.  The sugar will caramelize into a delicious brown layer over the pork as it bakes.  This is the way to make it extra delicious.

This will be a new favorite at our house.  Can't believe how easy it is to make something so good.  I have a feeling I better make time in the weekly schedule just to shred meat, LOL

We followed the recipe but did add a pinch or two of cayenne as someone suggested it was perfect

I used the ingredients for this recipe but used my slow cooker, on low for 10 hours, flipping it half way through. Oh my goodness tender juicy meat with minimal effort. I also let the meat set overnight with all the spices on it (used garlic and onion powders too, no salt)  and cut the broth to 1 cup. Had extra cilantro stems that I placed on the bottom of the cooker. Saved some juices to freeze the meat in.

I made changes! I put all the ingredients  and let them cook in the oil for a bit 10 minutes or so...I slowly poured the broth and let boil for a bit then turned it down...smells amazing! 
So, I added the pork and let it cook for a few hours but I made sure I poked the meat so that all the juices get inside! Once it was done I transferred  the pork onto baking sheet and I skimmed  the oil from the brothy  liquid as it floated on top of the meat. So, once again set oven to 400 degrees brazen the meat with some oil left over with some juice and just kept doing this for about  every 15minutes. At the end of baking the pork I broiled it for about 4 minutes on all sides  and still I'm brazing it with the oil juice mix....Ahhhhh-Mazing!

I made the recipe as directed with the exception of drastically reducing the salt. It was better than the carnitas we get from our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Love this and will only make them this way from now on!

This is so packed with flavor eventhough it doesn't have a ton of spices, I will definitely make again! I accompanied this with white rice and drizzled some of the juice left behind and it was to die for! Thanks for the recipe

I made it the first time exactly as the recipe was written. It was very good but way to salty for my taste.  2nd time I decreased the  slat to one tablespoon and my family loved them!  I've also experimented using coke and beer!  Both were very good.

This recipe was wonderful! I made a couple of changes after reading other reviews. I used a 12 oz bottle of dark beer and about 10 oz of chicken broth as the braising liquid.  I only used 1 tablespoon of coarse salt rubbed into the roast before browning. My roast was about 2.5 lbs. boneless loin. I kept everything else exactly as written. Served with homemade tortilla shells, salsa and crema.  Will definitely make again.

These were very good. I skipped the last step in the oven purely for convenience and time and it still tuned out moist and delicious. My family of five all liked them very much and requested I make them again. My only change was to double the lime juice. I served these with warmed corn tortillas, cilantro, queso fresco and an extra squeeze of lime. Also served with red rice and a side of slow cooked pinto beans. Will definitely make again. Thanks!!

Will totally make this again! So yummy! However, I didn't have limes so I used lemon juice. And for the broth I used 3 cups of chicken bullion and 2 12 ounce cans of beer. My family loved it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It smelled wonderful while cooking and got even better when I put it in the oven to brown off:-)!  I was skeptical about the 3 TABLESPOONS(!) of salt and the instructions to add more salt before placing in the oven and rightly so!!  It was perfect, but a lot heavy on salt for our family!  I would reduce the salt to 2 TABLESPOONS, then taste it before placing in the oven!!!  Other than that, I will absolutely make this yummy recipe again:-)!!

This is a great recipe.  My pork was tender and moist with great flavor, I did cut back on salt.  The seasoning really enhanced the pork and because I have a lot of pork in the freezer I'm going to do a larger batch and prepare the cooked pork in a variety of ways.  If you want it to pack a punch for your Mexican food you will want to up the seasoning.

Loved! Made first time following the directions exactly, second time I took everyone's comments and made my own spin.  Halved the salt and tripled the other spices.  Added some tasso to the cooking liquid.  Used Meyer lemon juice, 2 bottles of Christmas Ale and 3 cups chicken stock.  Didn't use all the liquid so I used it as a base for soup.  Just added tomatoes, corn and beans, then the leftover carnitas just before serving.  It was great!

These were exquisite!  I used homemade lard instead of vegetable oil, salted to taste rather than the 3T (which is a LOT), added lots more garlic, just used one whole lime's worth of juice (which was perfect but maybe could've used two even), and used 6 C. of broth.  Followed the directions and they were sooo yummy!  I bet I could've doubled the spices and been fine still.  Made enough for two meals for 5 people (two adults, three young kids).

So good! I made these for a Mexican themed potluck, I have friends still talking about them. I ended up browning my pork in my electric pressure cooker and left it on a low crock pot setting over night. The meat was gone in a flash,  my husband was sad that there wasn't any leftovers for a change.

Very moist. Very flavorful.  I was a little nervous because I used a  2 lb. pork loin .   I shredded it with ONE fork it was so tender, just falling  part.  Because my roast was small I added  one 32 ounce carton of  vegetable broth that I had on hand, and cut the salt back to a little less than a tablespoon.  The result were 5 stars!

Great recipe.  I followed instructions and this was fantastic meal for my family.  I am not a fan of pork but they are, so I was very surprised how much I like it.  Today I made green chile stew with the left overs.

I made this tonight and it exceeded my expectations!!! I am a lover of legit, traditional Mexican food and this tasted as good as what I would find on the west coast. I used Pork Butt and it was perfect. I topped it with a Pineapple Habenero Salsa and it was heavenly!!! 
After the original 30 minute browning, you only need to separate it once, add a little more liquid and cook 10 min - that's plenty. This recipe is 100% a keeper!!!!!!!!!!

This was very good! I do agree with some of the reviews that it was a bit salty. I thought the amount I put on the meat seemed right, but forgot about the chicken broth being salty. Next time I'll use low-sodium broth or less salt, and I think it'd be perfect. But the taste was still amazing, and will  definitely make it again!

The only change I made was using a pork sirloin (which was all I had) cut into chunks. It was delicious! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious, tasty, and tender! I closely followed the recipe, and it turned out perfectly. Even my boyfriend, a trained cook, was impressed by the flavor and texture. I will prepare this again and recommend this recipe to others.

We can't go two weeks without making these!  Delicious!  I do add some hot peppers, but I add those to pretty much everything.  Also I use less than half of the salt this calls for.  That amount is just ridiculous and renders the dish inedible

Amazing - used a whole garlic bulb, 2.5lbs-3lbs pork but shoulder, rubbed the salt (cut it in half) and cumin (doubled it) into the meat, Browned the meat, then removed from the pan, sweated the onions, added back in the meat and followed the recipe.  When in the convection oven, stirred and added liquid on top every 10 minutes. End result is succulent yet crispy delicious carnita meat. Served on mini corn tortillas, with pico, and verde sauce. Seriously awesome!

Seriously, some of the best carnitas I've had! Great flavor and extremely moist with only the fat that comes from the pork. I don't like onions in my carnitas, but used a whole onion and cut in half for the flavor and then removed before putting in the oven.

Delicious!  Lived in Texas for 14 year and now live in the northeast.  Making this reminds me of the delicious tex-mex we used to take for granted.  Served on tortillas with fresh salsa, cilantro, and the usual toppings - family favorite.

I adore carnitas, which I can only get in my favorite restaurant close by on the weekends.  So I decided to try this recipe. I love my slow cookers (3 and counting).  I doubled the sauce as suggested,  and used Pork shoulder 'ribs' .  My honey and I adored the results.  Definitely a great go to, especially when pork goes on sale.

Made it for the first time a few weeks ago and wow!  The meat was a little crisp on the outside but nice and tender on the inside. The flavor was just right. I lived in the southwest for many years and honestly have had only few better Carnitas at restaurants. I added a jalapeno and a bit more garlic but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.

Terrific easy recipe that tastes like top taco truck carnitas. Suggest double the chicken broth and 2/3 the oven time to avoid drying out. Also simmer slightly longer than the 2.5hrs on a low heat

I couldn't believe the flavor of this-just like what you get when eating out.  I practically ate half of it while shredding it.  I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on the meat before browning and only used a tablespoon of salt in the cooking liquid and I think it came out perfect.

I prepared the recipe exactly as Nette suggested but added a cup of sugar. This balanced out the salty taste nicely. It was FABULOUS! Very flavorful and soooo tender. Thanks for the recipe, Nette. :)

I have the meat cut up in cubes & I brown it in bacon fat. I simmer it in the oven at 300 degrees, instead of  the stovetop- I add a cup of Coke, a jalapeño,  and a clove of crushed garlic to all the other ingredients. After 2 hours, check for tenderness; adjust seasonings, and separate the cubes a bit. Bake another hour. Meat will be crispy on the outside, and very juicy and tender. Makes great tacos or burritos with chopped tomatoes, onions, jalapeño sauce, and cilantro. Guests will devour these carnitas!

Cut the salt! The broth is plenty salty, just do it to taste. I only had 1/2 the pork, so I cut the broth and oil in half, but left all the seasonings the same. Delicious.

Loved this.  Had a pork tenderloin (no shoulder) on hand, and no tortillas, but otherwise followed the recipe except for stirring some sour cream into the remaining liquid to serve over rice and black beans.  But I can imagine it would be great in tortillas, too.  Will make this again.

Comes out perfect every time.  Super easy to make and my kids love it.  We have it with tortillas and guacamole.  I do use a little more garlic, 3-4 cloves.
