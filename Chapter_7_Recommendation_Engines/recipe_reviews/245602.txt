Made this exact to the recipe. .Not sure how to describe these. I thought they would be a nice change from the family's traditional pizzelles but I wound up tossing the batter out after making just a couple. The batter actually tasted ok even if it was pretty bland. That was suprising considering the amount of spices in this recipe. They had a very odd taste, even with 10x suger sprinkled on them. The main issue is the texture. Weird, rubbery and limp. Maybe I should have tried making regular cookies with the batter. I've been making pizzelles for 30 years, Different flavors and add-ins, but I won't be making these again. Would have given this 1/2 star if I could have.

These didn't really have any pumpkin taste. The spices were rather mild. Probably won't make these again

After reading the reviews I decided to try this anyway.  But I used 6 eggs instead of 3, 3/4 c pumpkin, 2 1/2 c flour, 1 c shortening instead of butter. I followed the recipe for spices.  Didn't have much flavor  if I try it again I'll double the spices, leave out the pumpkin since I can't taste it anyway and instead, make a whipped pumpkin butter to dab on top. I cut back on the pumpkin in recipe thinking it was the cause of the rubbery texture I read about in the reviews.  Thanks for sharing.  It's good idea w potential to experiment with.  Shortening caused some to burn but I used smaller amounts of batter and cooked it 35 seconds on the iron. This cooked them well.
