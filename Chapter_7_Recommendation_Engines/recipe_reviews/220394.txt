This recipe is like a blank canvas...a good jumping off point to customize the dressing to your taste.  I was looking for a caesar dressing to use for a salad and this one needed a "face", so I gave it a whirl.  As written, it's very mayo-y and kind of bland, but it would be easy to doctor to suit your tastes.  I used it with "Carrot Pepperoni Caesar Salad" from this site and the blandness worked well there, but I would not have enjoyed it, as is, on a regular salad.  THANKS for the recipe, shmu!

It's a good base for a very low fat dressing if you're careful with your ingredient choice. That said, when I was finished making it, it tasted more like a ranch dressing than it did a caesar. I'm definitely going to experiment more with this!

This is not Caesar dressing. It was ok but I would not make it again.  There was way too much Apple cider vinegar. I even added some garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil and still all I could taste was apple cider vinegar.

Very good and easy. Needs more without the anchovy paste.

After reading the reviews I decided to add anchovy to paste. Worked perfectly-adding a little zing.

This was a nice start!  My daughter is allergic to milk and gluten, so this was perfect to start with!  I added 5 canned anchovies and some cracked pepper for some zing before blending.  I also sprinkled parmesan on everyone's salad (except my daughter's), and they really liked it!
