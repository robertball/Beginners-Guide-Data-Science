I made this recipe as part of the Uncle Ben's Rice campaign. First off, cooking with Uncle Ben's products is a sure home run, this recipe, however, barely makes it to first base, IMHO. Three stars is a compromise of 4 stars from hubby, 2 stars from me. As written, this recipe is seriously flawed. One to one ratio, coconut milk to water, would make the rice far less sticky and dense. So many of the steps could/should be condensed. Eight ounces, or 1/2 pound chicken, is hardly enough protein for four servings. The chicken filling is dry and unappetizing, even when loaded with optional toppings of tomatoes and sour cream. After reading the drawn-out instructions on how to roast the jalapenos, the author of this recipe forgets to add them to the chicken-corn mixture. It was obvious to me, but a novice cook might be a bit confused. In fact, a novice cook might become frustrated with the recipe instructions all round. This is just my opinion. I'm always happy and willing to try anything once, but this recipe won't happen a second time.

Pretty good recipe and easy to make which is always good in my book. There was something missing from the chicken mixture, though. Next time I will omit the chili powder and cumin and use a packet of taco seasoning. I also think it could be good to garnish with cilantro. As another reviewer suggested, I used a one to one ratio of coconut milk and water to cook the rice. Glad I did because the coconut milk was much thicker than expected and extremely high in calories. Never used coconut milk before so I was surprised to figure this out. Will try this again with a few adjustments. Thanks for the recipe.

I actually haven't tried this yet, so I give my stars based on the ingredients.  I think this sounds quite promising!  I love coconut rice and have had it many times on trips to Jamaica.   I was eager to read the one and only review posted so far, but was annoyed to see that the reviews' only focus was on the way the recipe was written and said absolutely nothing about how it tasted.   I look forward to giving this a try and will do some tweaking here and there as I see fit for taste & personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe and I'll be sure to add a review about how it tasted!  :-)
