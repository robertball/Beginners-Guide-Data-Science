It seemed more like stiff dough than batter and was too thick to pour and made lumps rather than coating the bottom of the pan. It was very hard to make layers of batter and cranberry sauce. I would use more sauce...but the batter really needs to be thinner to work out right. It was tasty, but I think I will have to keep looking because it was pretty hard to work with. Great taste though! Doubling the recipe did not work :( Took forever to cook!

This cake was good and as others have said it was moist and the almond flavor was just right (I didn't add the blanched almonds).  However, it didn't come out as I had imagined it...my problem was too little batter.  Although next time I'll try using a bundt pan instead of a tube (being that the bundt has less width to cover with batter).

Maybe I did something wrong, but this did not turn out as I had hoped.  The almond extract was a little too much I thought.  My girls really liked it though.

My whole family loves this recipe.  In fact the last time I made it 
my kids were eating before I iced it.  I dusted it with confection's 
sugar and they loved it.  We love cranberries, I may add a little more
next time.

This coffee cake is marvelous.  I've made it four times, twice for office Birthdays.  Also, made it this Easter for my visiting family and they all wanted the recipe.  Such a pretty cake...ummmmm good!

I found this cake to be very dry.  I am also not fond of the almond extract in it.

I thought this was pretty good. I used the specified ingredients, the only change I made was using a Bundt pan. I did not think the dough was too stiff, I just divided it evenly around the bottom of the Bundt pan and the same on the top layer. I didn't have a problem at all making layers. The cranberry sauce will fill in, I just divided it in half and put it evenly around each layer.  I thought the taste was good and just the right amount of almond flavor. I will make it again.
