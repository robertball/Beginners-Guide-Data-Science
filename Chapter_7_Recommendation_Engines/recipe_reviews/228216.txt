Very yummy!  Great way to use up cucumbers.  We only used 1/2 the amount of oil and the rest applesauce.  It did take some time to peel and shred, but is worth it!  We used walnuts since we didn't have any pecans.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe to use the cucumbers in your garden that got away from you.  You know the big giants.  Or even the smaller ones that you have 24 of them hanging around.  DO NOT skip the step of salting the cucumbers and letting them rest.  Mine sat for about 3 hours before I used them and I was amazed at how much water the salt pulled from them.  The taste and texture is a lot like zucchini bread.  I baked mine in 5 - 3 1/2" x 6" pans, 2 without pecans and 3 with pecans.  They were done in 38 minutes.  I have 2 more cukes on my counter that I'm baking 10 mini loaves to freeze.  My DS loved this and wants to take a few back to school with him.  Our favorite way to eat this bread is toasted with a thin layer of butter (the guys) dry (for me) for breakfast.  Thanks Marcella for posting this recipe - it is a keeper!

This was great- moist and flavorful. The cucumber taste was good and not overwhelming. The only things I did differently was I drained my cucumbers for at least an hour and I used walnuts instead of pecans. I will make again and pass this recipe on to others. Thanks Marcella!

another perfect way to use up too many cucumbers. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil to make it a bit healthier. No one tasted the cucumber! Thank you!

This bread is delicious! Super moist, it tastes alot like zucchini or pumpkin bread. I made my batch a little bigger (3 large loaves), added some shredded zucchini and ground flaxseed and put in a little less sugar than the recipe stated. A little healthier for you and it still tasted great. This is a great way to use all the extra cukes in your garden that you can't get around to eat or pickling.

This was definitely different. I was surprised by the amount of cucumber it called for. Other "veggie" breads such as squash & zucchini bread only call for 1 cup. Or maybe since I blended my cukes in my Ninja, I ended up with more per cup? Anyway, the little ones liked it and I found that, toasted with butter, I could eat it. The cucumber flavor is very strong and hangs around. Since I have a lot of cukes from a friend's garden, I will try this again, but reduce the amount of cucumber and see how that works.

If you are making cucumber bread, you are going to expect it to taste a little bit like cucumber. We thought it tasted like pumpkin bread, and we didn't notice the cucumber taste very much except as an after taste. I did not peel and seed all my cucumbers as they were directly out of my garden and did not have tough skins or large seeds. I too substituted applesauce for the oil. It baked well and sliced easily. I am adding raisins to the bread today.

This is absolutely wonderful!It's moist and flavorful- whole family loved it. I even had my mother and mother-in-law asking for the recipe! I also used only 1/2 the oil and substituted applesauce for the other 1/2. Thanks for posting!!!

This is  a great way to use up all the extra cucumbers from your garden.  I doubled the amount of spices and used walnuts and pecans.  The dough seemed a little thick when I was done (maybe I drained the cucumbers too much?) so I added a 1/4 cup of coffee.  This turned out delicious.

I didn’t know what to expect after reading through some of the reviews.  Most give favorable ratings, but others say the cucumber taste is overwhelming.  Honestly, I couldn’t taste the cucumbers at all.  This is just a standard quick bread that is very similar to zucchini bread.  It was very moist with a flaky crusted top.  As I was mixing the batter, I was concerned about the amount of baking powder.  A quarter teaspoon didn’t seem like enough for this large of a recipe.  I went with my better judgement and used 1 tsp.  The bread had a very tender, cake like texture which was exactly what I was hoping for.  I used the suggested amount for the spices and only the cinnamon was slightly detectable. The rest got lost.  If I were to make this again, I would significantly increase the amounts.  As a personal preference, I used walnuts instead of pecans. Overall, a delicious bread and a good way to use up extra cucumbers.

What a fantastic-tasting bread! I'm really happy with how this turned out; definitely making again. I feel like this uses an unnecessary amount of oil, which is unfortunate. I will experiment next time with some other ingredient as a substitute for a bit of the oil. I did not add cloves as we did not have any, but it still turned out well regardless.

I should have noted this while making it, but this makes 2 loaves of bread. I did not have an extra loaf pan, so I made some muffins with it and they turned out perfectly. If you do not want to have the oven on for that long (i.e. for conservation of electricity or it's hot), I would recommend making muffins out of it since they cook so much more quickly.

Lovely and delicious.  Made muffins and a loaf.  Baked at a higher 375 because I had to use a toaster oven.  Threw in a few dried cranberries too.

I will try this tomorrow, but rather than wait for the cucumbers to drain, just use a ricer to squeeze out the water.

Great recipe!  I have too many cucumbers and was looking for something different.  This was very moist and had a great flavor.  I did not find the cucumber over powering at all.  This is a keeper!

we loved this.. bf said he was pleasantly surprised by the recipe bc he was like cucumbers?? .. only difference was i did half and half with the oil and applesauce.. i used allspice in place of the nutmeg and cloves.. for the nuts i used a blend of walnuts and pecans.. i only made enough for one loaf and i used my conventional oven.. i nearly burnt the thing to a crisp so beware if you're using anything other than a regular oven.. ty for the recipe.. bf says it reminds him of xmas :)

Great! Replaced 3/4 of the oil with apple sauce otherwise kept it as written. I had so many cucumbers this year in my garden that this was an absolutely perfect way to utilize them all. Made 6 loaves and froze 5. Very yummy! Great recipe! Thank you!!

I have made 16 loaves so far with many cucumbers from our garden.  I cut the sugar and oil in half, added ground flaxseed.  Used whole wheat flour.  So far all loaves have come out perfect and yummy.

It's a good use of our bumper crop of cukes. Will be making another batch. Thanks Marcella.

Loved it! Great taste. I too used walnuts and thought it was wonderful. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I think the 50 min was too long for muffins. Just need to bring the time down between 30-40 min.

I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. I dislike the taste of cucumber usually, but can't taste it at all in this bread. I have an abundance of cucumbers from the garden, and very few ways to prepare them that I enjoy. This, I will make again though. I may have added a splash extra of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe. It took 4 fairly large cucumbers to get 2 cups, and I had to cook it for 1 hour 10 mins, but it turned out fluffy with a delicious, light brown, crispy crust. Can't add a photo because my family ate it all already.

This is delicious bread. Very nice texture. Like many others I had more cukes than we could eat. Was anxious to try the recipe and am glad I did. I did use all applesauce in place of the oil and raisins in place of nuts. Hubby loved it! I will make this again very soon. Thank you for this recipe.

Delicious!  The whole family loved this.  I had to substitute almonds for pecans and it was still great.  I've also made this using  mini loaf pans/muffin tin instead of loaf tins and just cooked for 35 minutes and they were delicious.

We made it following the recipe as written. I was pretty skeptical that it would have a strong cucumber flavor, but with cucumbers taking over the house I was willing to give it a try. It tastes very similar to the zucchini bread we made (do you see a theme here?) I will be making it again.

More like cake than bread, this was a very tasty way to use  those extra large cucumbers from the garden. I salted the shredded cucumbers to aid in water removal. After letting them sit about 30 minutes, I rinsed then squeezed out the extra water. I added 2tsp cocoa powder to the mix. Baked for an hour in a bundt pan, then topped it off with a simple powdered sugar glaze. I found it tasted better the next day.

Great taste, especially with all the spices.   Added a bit more onto the spices. Only thing I did differently was to squeeze out all of the water from the cucumbers with an old kitchen towel.....truly free of water.

My first time eating (or making) cucumber bread. It was easy to make and fantastic tasting. I would like to bring out the taste of the cucumber a bit more though. It's a definite keeper.

Excellent!  I did modify though.  Used alternatives for eggs to make vegan (1T ground flax seed, 5T water replacing 1 egg & 1/2c applesauce replacing the other 2).  I used 1c whole wheat flour and the other 2c all purpose unbleached.  And I used 1c date sugar and 1/2c Truvia, no white sugar.

Yum. Can't keep up with the cukes in my garden as bumper crop this year and needed to make something else besides pickles. Found this recipe and it's absolutely delish. I am not a cucumber fan, this was delicious and you would never know there is cucumber in it. I used all the oil as the recipe called for, may try the applesauce next time for a healthier option. I had no pecans in house so I substituted slivered almonds and added about 1/8tsp pure almond extract to boost the almond flavor. Think would be decadent with crumb topping of oats, butter, sugar, etc.

Surprisingly great bread! I made four batches from our abundant garden harvest--1 gluten/egg/nut free and three more "regular." The adapted recipe worked very well. I substituted half coconut oil/half applesauce, flax "eggs," 1 c. cane sugar plus 1/2 c. honey, 1/2 c. nuts in three batches (all I had). Both GF and regular were excellent even with the healthily oil and less sweetening. Even my husband liked it and said he couldn't tell it was cucumber. Will definitely make this again when overrun with cukes. Might be fun to try additions like grated zucchini, carrots or apples. Dried fruit might work too.

This bread is awesome! I've made it several times, the last time I made them into muffins instead. You don't have to make any changes to the recipe, just bake for 10 - 15 mins instead. I like using chocolate chips + walnuts instead of pecans when I want to make a less healthy version.

Delicious! Tastes just like zucchini bread but smells like cucumbers. I made a half batch (in mini pans) with unsweetened applesauce to cut down the oil. Great way to use up cucumbers.

This was a total surprise and I definitely will make it again.  I had left-over minced cucumbers from  pickle relish so I used peelings and seeds.  Turned out wonderful and liked it even better the next day.   I will definitely share this recipe with family and friends.  Thank you.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I did modify it by decreasing the sugar by 1/4 cup and  using applesauce for half the oil.  My  sister and her "picky" husband raved about it.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It was delicious! The only thing I did differently from the original recipe was omit the nuts due to personal preference. This is a great bread that I plan to make again.

This is my first time making this.  I am not a huge fan of cucumbers, but I really enjoyed this.  It does remind me of zucchini bread.  My dad gave them a 8.5/10. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of having half pecans and half walnuts just because I did not have enough pecans.  I made one loaf of bread and 12 muffins.  I let the peeled and shredded cucumbers drain for over an hour.

Next time I make this bread, I would like to substitute some of the oil with applesauce (thanks to the other reviews).  I would also like to use 1 1/2 cups of cucumbers instead of 2 cups and 1 1/2 cup of pecans/walnuts instead of 1 cup.  I would also like to add in 1/2 cup or so of raisins.  

Delicious recipe, I look forward to having it for a healthy snack this week.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I made it just as it called for, it is ok. We didn't think it was quite as good as zucchini bread. We'll see as it sits a little longer. At this point, probably wouldn't make again without adding lots more cinnamon.

Delicious! However, I changed a few things - I used avacado oil instead of the vegetable oil, 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of allspice (I didn't have ground gloves) . I also added 2 Tbsp of chia seeds. Everyone loved it!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it's not overly sweet and was easy to make. It reminds me of Zucchini bread. It was a hit with family and coworkers, and I used up most of my cucumbers from the garden.

My sons loved this bread. I used black walnuts instead of pecans because I have a lot of them from our trees. It tastes a lot like zucchini bread. I think a little ginger might be good in it, too.

The texture of this loaf was lovely.  I actually drained my cucumbers for over 24 hours and it was I think this made a difference.  The taste was good except for the overwhelming flavour of the cucumbers!  I like cucumbers, but I am not sure the flavour lends itself to this kind of loaf.  But if that is what you are looking for, than this recipe will fit the bill!
