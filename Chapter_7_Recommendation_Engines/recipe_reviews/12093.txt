I'm sooo glad I found this recipe.  It tastes like Apple pie ALA Mode.  I'm also glad i read the reviews first.  I divided the ingredients among two 9 inch pies shells.  I didn't have any problems with overflow or the cream "setting".

I made this for Christmas this year, it was my first pie.  I cannot tell you how well it went over with my family!  I added a brown sugar and oatmeal topping on it and it tasted perfect.

I scooped the apples out of the liquid and threw away the (butter-soaked on top and mush on the bottom) crust.  It wasn't a total disaster.  At least we had baked apple slices for dessert.

I just put my pie in the oven and I already have a mess! I used a single 9 inch pie crust like the recipe calls for, however, I had sugar mixture leftover and I had about one cup of cream/butter mixture (mush) that would not fit in the pie pan. My pie was running over before I got it to the oven. Sadly, I will not attempt this recipe  again.

I'm an experienced cook and this recipe looked great!!  But, there was entirely too much liquid--it never "set".  I wondered if something was left out of the recipe.  Smelled great and would have been great had it firmed up.

I really should have listened to the ratings BUT I am a sucker for creamy fatening things like half & half. Over all the pie was ok I was a little dissapointed in the soup and water and the mess!!! Something was definately left out of the recipe!! But it made the crust taste WONDERFUL!

Could only use half of the cream.  Too soupy, spilled over in oven.

If there were zero stars available, that is what I would give this recipe. Apple cream soup is what it was. I used up the apples that the kids weren't eating, only to waste a perfectly good pie shell and make a huge mess in my kitchen and inside my oven.  Yuckie Poo!

Yummy!  A new twist to apple pie.  Very easy & the family thinks you spent hours in the kitchen.

I did not like this recipe at all.  It smelled wonderful while it was baking but did not taste as good as it smelled.  It was too watery and did not slice well.  The "cream" was lumpy and watery and was not at all what I expected.  This one has been deleted from my recipe box.

My husband said this is the best pie I ever made, and I make a lot of pies.  I used Granny Smith apples and increased the sugar slightly, as they were very tart.  The very rich butter crust (Martha Stewart recipe)  didn't hurt either.

After reading the reviews I figured I would try this recipe. I put the filling into 2 pie shells. Had to bake the pies for an extra 15 minutes so that they would set. When I finally tried a piece.. I was VERY disappointed. I found that the pie had very little flavour. I will definitely stick to a more traditional pie. This was not worth using 2 cups of half and half cream which can be very costly where I live.

The flavor is great, but it needs major tweaks. There is way too much liquid - so add something to the cream to help it thicken and maybe precook the crust. We also think it'd be good with a little vanilla added. ALSO, put foil or something on the bottom of the oven. Our attempt flowed out of the pan a lot.

I adjusted the half-and-half to 1 cup and did not mix the butter with it, instead just used cold butter and added the dollops to the apples. Added a simple crumb topping....excellent!

Recipe was missing something...pie did not set-was apple soup in a shell.
It also made enough filling for 10" deep dish, not 9" regular as specified.
I added 1/4c Minute tapioca pearls sprinkled over top of cooked pie, then baked for 15 more min in order to save pie. In future, I would use less cream, less sugar, and keep the tapioca-adding it to cream mixture before pouring over apples.

Never really set up, didnt even put all the cream into it. Pie pan size it calls for is too small, took alot longer than 35 mintues. Smelled great and apples were yummy but as a pie it was a BUST!

I made this pie this year for a change from my standard sour cream apple pie recipe. I took the advice of halving the liquid and I always add more apples. It turned out great!

I was looking for a recipe for Apfel Schnitz Kuchen like my grandmother used to make and this definitely wasn't it--too liquidy and not enough flavour.  There must have been eggs in it.  I sure wish somebody had asked gramma to write down her recipe.

Really good! Very delicious but a tad too sweet for me so I think next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar. Great with some vanilla ice cream :)

I was intrigued by this recipe so I decided to try it for Pi Day 2018 as my husband loves apple pie.
I used honey crisp apples, looking online it says 1 lb of apples is 3 cups, therefore 4 cups is 1.3 lbs or 21.3 oz, I had just over 2 lbs so I made 1.5 times the recipe and used 2 store bought "deep dish" pie crusts.
I put all the dry ingrdients into a bowl then added the apples and mixed throughly, it would be impossible to do it properly in the pie plate.
I divided the apples between the 2 crusts.
I halved the butter and cream.
My pies had to bake for 60 minutes for the liquid to start to set.
I let them cool then put them in the fridge to finish setting.
The appearance of the pie is very off putting as the cream looks curdled but tasted fine.
My son loved the pie, he couldn't stop eating it, my husband said it was good too. I am not an apple pie fan, it was too sweet for me, I would probably recommend halving the sugar, the spices were good though.

This would more accurately be named Apple Cream Soup. I wish I would have read the reviews before trying this. The creme mixture was more watery coming out of the oven than it was going in. I am only giving one star because I can't give fewer.  I can't even figure out how to throw it out.

This was a very tasty pie!  My first concern was when I started pouring the half and half on top of the apples.  It was apparent it wouldn't all fit.  I put the pie on a large pan before going into the oven to prevent spilling.  After 35 minutes, it was still very soupy and I was guessing it was not going to set up.  So I used my turkey baster to remove as much liquid as I could and baked the pie for another 15 minutes.  I used the half and half I removed from the pie to make Creme Anglaise II (posted on allrecipes.com) to pour over the pie slices before serving.  I would not recommend this pie recipe as written as it caused some headaches.
