I have been baking pecan pie for years and I have a couple suggestions.1 please add vanilla to your base. It is nessesary.2 I think you will fall in love with pecan pie all over again if you use a teaspoon of cinnamon in the filling. 3 Try using a shortcake cookie crust instead of the traditional. Keep this crust moist as it will cook for 40-45 min when you bake the pie. You may also put a cookie sheet under the pie to reduce the chance of an over cooked crust.4 the last tip. If you find that your pecan pie is a bit sticky instead of having a slightly firm body add one Table spoon of all purpose flour to your base or filling mixture. I hope that these tips are helpful!! Try them you will be in for a real Treat!!!!!!!!

First of all, the crust was awful, and the filling lacked something: VANILLA!  I made it again using my own pie crust recipe and added 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.  I also omitted the finely chopped pecans, because it just seemed unnecessary.  The result was FABULOUS!  Not too sweet and lots of nuts, just right.  I gave it 5 stars.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I've never made a pecan pie before, and it was wonderfully easy.  After one test trial, I decided to follow a few of the reviewers hints - I added a tablespoon of flour, two teaspoons of vanilla extract, and a sprinkling of cinnamin to the filling for a wonderful flavor, and to stop the pie from getting too gooey.  It will be a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving table!!

For brown sugar lovers, the original recipe is great, but I tried it with white sugar, doubled the recipe,added three extra tbsp melted butter,one egg yolk, and only put pecans on the top. OH MY GOODNESS IT WAS FABULOUS!  I'm so excited to have this recipe among my collection!  My whole family went crazy.  Oh, I also covered top with tinfoil after 30 minutes of baking so the top wouldn't scorch.  I, unfortunatelly am forced to use an electric oven that has a heat coil.  This coil has murdered many a meal at my house.  So, for any of you who have the same kind of evil electric oven, tinfoil can save you too :)

Wonderful pie! I had to make 2 pecan pies so after reading the many reviews, I decided to try one pie according to the recipe and one with the flour, vanilla and cinnamon additions. Both pies tasted very good. I did prefer the pie with flour added because I personally don't like a pecan pie to drip with syrup as the one without flour did.  The vanilla was a great touch.  I didn't find the cinnamon to be necessary though.  I sure did like all the extra pecans this recipe calls for!

Don't forget to put your pan on the lower level of your oven or the pecans will burn, or cover the pie halfway through baking. It was very good and the pecans were enough on top to make a nice circular design. I tried without the crushed pecans and it was too liquid, while with all the pecans it was perfect. I did add 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 T flour. Thanks!

This is such a perfect pecan pie recipe!  I have found the recipe to stick with.  I'll just tweak it a bit with chocolate chips or dried fruit if I ever feel like a slightly different taste.  I made it because I liked how the other reviewers pointed out how nutty it came out.  I don't like too much pale colored, sloppy "goo".  I used dark corn syrup because I like the filling a little richer.  Instead of placing the plain pecan halves on top, I mixed them in a sauce pan with honey, butter and brown sugar.  I put the honey crunch mixture on top during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I highly recommend doing that.  Everyone died for it--so amazing!  Thanks Ingrid!

The pecan pie our family likes the best is always made with light Karo, not dark syrup. It is not as strong and brings requests for the recipe and another slice of pie. Also, I use 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract for each pie. A bought Pillsbury refrigerated 
crust is just as good as homemade.......so.....why go to the trouble, if time is not on your side?
Our Pecan Pie Recipe:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
1 Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust, rolled out, placed in 
a deep dish pie plate, and edges crimped- set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together the following:
3 lightly beaten eggs
1/2 c. Sugar
1 cup light Karo syrup
1/4 teas. salt
1/2 stick melted butter (Use real butter!)
2 teas. Pure vanilla extract
1 1/2- 2 cups large pecan pieces
Pour this mixture into unbaked crust and bake at 350 degrees for 45 min.- 1 hr. (Middle should not jiggle.)
It is also a good idea to cover the edges of the pie crust with foil after about 30 min. So they do not get too brown.
You can serve this pie hot or cold.

This was so delicious.  The crust is a sturdy, flavorful one that melds perfectly w/the filling - just as pecan pie should.  I've never had a pecan pie that was so nutty!  Wonderful! Its all about the pecans. My family used to make one w/bourbon, so I added a splash of bourbon to the filling along w/ a pinch of FRESHLY grated nutmeg.  This just heightened the flavors and gave some complexity.  I also used my food processor to make the dough and it still came out PERFECTLY.  Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe!

This is the best pecan pie I have ever had, let alone made myself.  Because I'm horrible at making pie crust, I used a frozen pillsbury crust and put this filling in.  I can only imagine a homemade crust would make it even better!

This is exactly like the many pecan pies I've tasted from Southern home cooks! I've always loved those pecan pies. A wonderful Southern woman, who was a lifelong cook to her large family & the many field workers on her farm (which included pecan trees) would lightly toast her pecans first, & so I did that with this recipe. The only other change I'd make is to replace the quartered nuts with more chopped nuts, because the quartered pieces made it difficult to slice the pie neatly. Note to any non-Americans: This is a genuinely Southern pecan pie that you'd find all over the South. There is no substitute for the corn syrup in this pie. Make sure your pie crust is a great, flaky American-style crust ~ made with only flour, cold butter or shortening, a bit of salt, & ice-cold water - it should not have egg in the crust!

This pie is sinfully good...I got rave reviews from everyone especially my husband. I wanted to make this for Thanksgiving so I did a test run days before and everyone said the recipe was a keeper! I did take some of the suggestions from others and added 2 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon. The pie is gooey, which I like, but if you dont like it gooey, it would be recommended that you add 1Tbsp. Flour. Will definitely make this pie again.

I have been searching for "THE PECAN PIE" for 30 yrs and EUREKA!
  This recipe, in my opinion does need vanilla added to it, just add to your own taste, for you beginners that is the only way to cook or bake.  But remember, this "IS" a science, so simply stick with playing with flavors at first, then with experience you will learn to change textures etc.
  This pie is a keeper, it serves 12 for a reason...it is very rich.  This recipe is now a family tradition!
  THANK YOU INGRID H. FOR SHARING!!!!!

I'm not rating the crust because I have my own recipe, but with the two tiny changes I made, the the filling is AMAZING! Everyone that has a slice, says it's the best pecan pie they have ever had.  I've even had a few come back for seconds (that's saying something when you think about the massive calorie count in a recipe like this, lol).  The only changes I made were adding 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and just using 2 cups of chopped pecans.  Wonderful recipe!!

LOVE this pecan pie recipe!  It's about as close as my mom's that I've been unable to find.    I've made this several times, and after doing it a couple times, I don't use any crushed or quartered pecans.  I just use 2 cups of whole pecans, and I mix that into the syrup mixture, because all the pecans, crushed or not, rise to the top when baking anyway, so all that work and arranging is rather pointless.  Also, for the people who have had problems with the pecans on top burning, it's because they have no protection - if you do like the recipe does, then save a few tablespoons of the mixture to drizzle over the top - this will prevent them from burning.  (The first time I made it, I didn't do that, and they burned, too.)    Or just mix them all in like I do - it's SO much easier, super quick to make, and every year around the holidays, people love it.

The pie filling is terrific! However, the pie crust was really hard and crunchy, not flaky. I would have liked my regular pie crust better. But I will definitely be making this pie filling again. I hate it when pecan pies are nothing more than a sprinkling of nuts on top of a gelatinous goo, but this was delicious with nuts throughout a smooth buttery brown sugary filling.

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!  I've been struggling for the last 8 years to get a pecan pie that had a firm middle but lightly toasted pecan top.  I've tried everything from covering pie with foil, to lowering the temperature of the oven to cook the pie more slowly.  

This recipe calls for crushed pecans to be stirred into the filling - and I was completely shocked that my filling was PERFECT.  Nice, firm, not over done, not over cooked - and you don't notice from a texture perspective that the pecans are in the filling.  I'm glad to finally know the secret!

I give this 5 stars for the same reason others gave it less - it has much more nuts than most pecan pie recipes.   If you like the traditional pecan pie, this might be too nutty for you.  If, however, you want more nuts than "goo" then this recipe is the one you want.  The texture is great and the flavor is wonderful.  I will use this recipe from now on.

Great Pie!  Although it browned a little to fast, but that is all part of having an electric oven the heating coil are horriable so next time i will just cover the pie with foil when it start to brown to fast!

I just made this pie for Thanksgiving.  I'm from the "South" and I've eaten a lot of pecan pie during my life...this is undoubtedly the best pecan pie I've ever had, bar none.  If you're looking for a fabulous pecan pie recipe, your search is over.

This was my very first time baking a pecan pie and it was perfect. This recipe is not over-overpoweringly sweet which is why I liked it so well. I did make a mistake by including too many pecans in the pie. I placed pecans on the bottom, sides, and the top so the filling was over powered by the pecans. When I bake it again, and I will, I will follow the recipe exactly.

First of all, thank you, Ingrid for this recipe.

i only made some minor changes: 
1) bought a flaky crust to save time (which, by the way, complimented very well) 
2)replaced dark corn syrup with maple/pancake syrup 
3)added 2 tsp of vanilla extract to the filling as others suggested 
4)coarsely crushed two 6oz. bags of pecans to mix in with the filling only and saved some pecan halves for the top.

I didn't change the measurements of anything because it came out to be really good and it wasn't too sweet. My friends jokingly said I can sell it. 

This is a good recipe and it is going in the recipe box because i know i will make it again. I will submit a picture of the pie i made.

this pie was amazing!!  the only thing i changed was use a frozen pie crust.  i used a regular pie crust, but i suggest using deep dish crust since the filling overflowed.  a delicious pie and a definite keeper!!

This was the most amazing, delicious pie!!!  I made it with the extra 1 T flour and 1-1/2 t vanilla.  Delicious.  It tasted like pecan pralines.  Best pecan pie I have ever eaten.

Wasn't really a fan, despite the addition of a bit of flour it was still too syrup-y for my liking.

Obviously, there are way too many pecans, but the amount written might just have been a mistake. Another problem was the butter. There was way too much butter. I would suggest using about two tablespoons less butter because mine was so "buttery" it drooled out of the crust and burnt the bottom of the oven. Aside from that, it had great flavor but it was the texture of pudding with a lot of pecans thrown in. I'm really sorry, I'm sure for some people this is really good but it just didn't work for me. Thanks anyway!

This was sooooo yummy and sweet.....I did read the reviews, and only used about a cup of chopped pecans, and they were perfect!!  Mine cooked for about 70 mins.  and the crust was a bit overdone, but who cares?!?!  It's pecan pie!!

This pie is a WOW! Easy to make, yummy crust, delicious filling... all that AND it's a pretty pie! I arranged the halves around the top in concentric circles. Everyone was impressed with the way the pie looked, then they tasted it and all agree that it is a fabulous tasting pie.

All I have to say is this recipe is perfect!  I had to use regular corn syrup instead of light because I couldn't find any light syrup at the Grocery stores here!  I think it made it even better!  I will definitely do this one again!

After a trial run to rave reviews, this pie made its proper début at our family Christmas dinner and was one of the smash hits of the evening (it made up for the disappointment of the crackers, which contained jokes that weren't funny and plastic Dragonball Z figurines - faugh! ugly things!). I found it was nicest with a dollop of whipped cream to balance the stickiness of the filling, and I think if I don't make this the next time cousin David visits he may cry. Finding corn syrup for the filling was extremely difficult, as this is not a common ingredient in New Zealand cookery. After consulting with the owner of a specialist cake shop I found I could substitute liquid glucose with excellent results.

Made this for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's family and it was divine!  Per other reviewers I added a tablespoon of flour to the corn syrup mixture and omitted the bottom layer of pecans, just to try things out.  It was great!  Will be making again and again.

I have to say I cheated on this recipe and used a store bought crust- but it still came out great!  Not a crumb was left over in the pie plate at the end of my Thanksgiving dinner.  A great way to finish off a holiday or everyday meal!

Easy to make and delicious as written. I've made two in the past two weeks. Definitely cover with foil halfway through baking. This first time, I forgot, and it looked like I burnt the pecans (though they still tasted fine). The pecan arrangement on top is absolutely stunning and has NOT caused any problems with ease of cutting.

The crust was outrageously delicious.  We make this pie crust for both pecan and pumpkin pie.  However, for pecan filling, we prefer the easy and best pecan filling I have tasted Pecan Pie V - the recipe that does not use corn syrup.  So, I use this crust and Pecan Pie V filling.

I took the advice from previous post and added a bit of cinnamon and a touch of flour to the filling.  I also decided to do a shortbread crust rather than the pastry.  We'll see Christmas day how everyone likes it :)  The tarts I made turned out fantastic.

The name says it all.  :)  How cool to not need the syrup?  There's extra junk in that stuff you don't need anyway.  

I made this for Thanksgiving and I had served my dear friend, a retired 40-year vetran chef who couldn't stop raving about it.  It was completely gone by the next day and my husband wanted to know where it had gone.  !!!!  Ten thumbs up!!!!  (Oh, by the way, I doubled the amount of pecans because who can have too many????)

Followed this recipe exactly as written, and now I am serving burnt pie for Thanksgiving!  Something I learned after it was too late - butter burns at 350 degrees, so either turn it down to 325, bake it less than the hour it says, or just find a different recipe (I suggest the latter).  I haven't tried it yet, but if it tastes anything like it looks it's a huge waste of expensive pecans.  P.S.:  You might want to cover the top...the pecans are just as burnt as the crust.

Made this pie first yesterday for Thanksgiving. After pulling it from the oven, I realized I had left out the melted butter in the filling by accident. I was very concerned about how it would make the pie turn out so I ended up tasting it last night. I'm so glad I did! This was very dense...too many nuts...and I only used the 1/2 cup of finely crushed and the 1 cup of chopped pecans. I don't know that the missing butter would make that big of a difference, but I was not happy with this one. Ended making another pie, using a different recipe and I was very happy with that one!!

Awesome base recipe! I added 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 Tbsp. flour and substituted cane syrup for the corn syrup. It came out wonderful! I guess the pecan pies they used to make in the good old days didn't have all the flavorings we have grown so accustomed to nowadays, so the recipe is correct, but it needs some tweaking according to everybody's taste and preference. Note: I didn't use the crust recipe noted here, so I have no idea how that comes out -- I have my own crust recipe and only use that when I make my pies.

Add at least a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt and it won't be so sweet. Salt brings out the caramel flavor.  I always taste the filling-bad, I know, since it has raw eggs, but I use fresh eggs and have never had a problem.  Also bake on a preheated cookie sheet and the crust will be crispier.

I make this pecan pie every year, and it gets rave reviews.  I'll never make a different recipe again!  This pie is FULL of pecans and not all that brown "goop" that most pecan pies are full of.  If you love pecans, you'll love this pie! My only changes are that I use 3 cups of pecans, half chopped, and half pecan halves, and I add a teaspoon of vanilla like the other reviews.  I also use store-bought refrigerated pie crust to save on time and labor.

I am a lover of traditional pecan pie that has a gooey middle and a golden pecan top.  This recipe calls for pecans in the next to the bottem crust, middle as well as the top making it a mouthful of pecans and a bit overwhelming.

This pie was so easy to make and had good consistency. Not too runny! I added 1 T. flour, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1.5 tsp. vanilla as suggested by other reviewers. Good pie. I will make it again.

This was SO EASY!!!  I hadn't ever made pecan pie before... they seemed like they would be too difficult.  But this one was very easy and delicious!  I followed the recommendations to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling.  Also, I used a different crust.  You can pretty much use whatever crust you want, and there is one on this site called Pie Crust IV that I use.  I am a huge sweet-tooth, and so I even like to sprinkle sugar over the pie crust to sweeten it up some.

I hesitated to make a pecan pie this year because...
1: I NEVER like pecan pie even when other people rave about how wonderful they are.
2: I NEVER like pecan pie even when I have made them myself.
3: I just NEVER like them... they're too sweet, too sticky, too syrupy, too yuck, yuck...YUCK!!

BUT let me tell you now -- ALL THAT HAS CHANGED!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I, myself, could not get enough of it!  I added about a teaspoon and 1/2 of vanilla, a good shake of cinnamon, and not quite a tablespoon of flour as was recommended.  Kept the same amount of nuts, baked it on the bottom rack, and covered it for the last 15 minutes or so.  I couldn't believe my mouth.  NOT too sweet, NOT too syrupy, NOT to sticky, and the pieces cut and served perfectly.  Incredible. Try this one. WOW.

I just finished making this pie for my third Thanksgiving in a row. It's great! I also add cinnamon (but I swear I though of that on my own! I guess it's a no brainer...) and I use the "Best Flaky Pie Crust" recipe with it.

I made this pie last weekend to do a trial run before turkey day...I loved all the nuts but I didn't think it had enough 'goo'. I think I might have used my deep dish pan instead of a regular pie pan. When I poured the filling in the pan, it only came up 3/4 of the way. I only gave it 4 stars because I like more goo. Will try again in my regular pie dish.

Im not familiar with pecan pies. I tried the honey crunch pecan pie before, liked the flavour, but not the texture and it was too sweet for me. But this one is very good. Had a piece when it was still warm, kinda heavy but would have been good with icecream. It's like a caramel pecan pie when its cold. Very, very good.

I used the recipe for the filling and instead used a ready-made pie crust. When filling my crust I did not first place quartered pecans at the bottom; I simply added them to the syrup mixture. I did, however, keep the best-looking pecan halves for the top and arranged them in a nice spiral-type pattern. I was going to add vanilla as others suggested but forgot; it's okay, because the pie didn't really need it. This was a wonderful and sweet pecan pie. Thanks for taking my memories home!

WOW!! This was my first time ever making a pecan pie, and it was incredible. I was nervous because I have never made a homemade pie crust, so that was my first time as well. And I served the pie for a family party, and EVERYONE JUST LOVED IT. They ALL said it was the BEST pecan pie they ever had. I even had one comment-"Now I am a southerner, with a southern family, and this was the BEST I have ever eaten"
Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe, it will stay in my collection forever!!!

This pie was amazing! Next time I will delete the pecans you place over the bottom of the pie crust. Also decrease the amount of pecans on top of the pie. Just too many pecans. But everyone loved the pie. Flavor was wonderful. Will make over and over again.

I made mini pecan pies using a muffin pan for a potluck and everyone LOVED them. The mini pies baked for approx. 30 minutes instead of an hour. Thank you for the simple, wonderful recipe.

This came out pretty good, although I think maybe it had a little too many pecans in it. Also, the top seemed to brown very quickly. I had to cover it with foil about halfway through cooking. But all in all, a tasty recipe. Thank you.

This recipe causes there to be no gooey middle part because there are soooooo many pecans. If that is what you like then it is a good recipe, but if you are like me and want that gooey sticky middle then this is not the recipe for you.

this is a VERY good pecan pie recipe.  my father in law says it is better than his mother's!  he ate half of it.  ive love baking pies and am always in search of the next best one.  this is it!  i would not skip on making the crust...it makes a big difference.  i now use this pie crust recipe for all my pies.  it is no fail!  pie filling not gooey but stays together and lookes amazing too if you take the time to arrange the pecan halves on the top. this is a keeper and perfect for the holidays.  try using left over crust scraps and cut them in holiday shapes (leaf, pumpkin, ect.) and put in the middle before throwing it in the oven.  nice detail!

Well, I didn't think this pie was that "irrestible". While mine DID set up unlike other posters, I agreed with some that there were too many pecans in it. Not only was it a lot of extra work compared to other pies I've made (grinding the nuts, cutting the nuts), I thought all those nuts kind of overpowered this pie. I also added vanilla to the mixture, but it still left something to be desired. This pie wasn't for me, but others have loved it, so it is only my personal opinion. I probably would not make this again, but thanks anyway!

I didn't care too much for this recipe.  There just wasn't any balance between the nuts and filling.  Way too sweet, if I made this again it would be as mini tarts.

This is the BEST pecan pie! I'm too lazy to make my own crust so I used a refrigerated one.  It is not too sweet...just perfect.  My guests loved it.  I'm even going to make this when it's not a holiday!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, because my boyfriend had requested "pecan pie."  I had never made pecan pie, so I needed a new recipe and found this one based on the reviews.  Allrecipes.com and its members didn't let me down!!  My boyfriend RAVED about this pie and ate the whole thing in 2 days!  I thought it was great, too (he let me have a small piece).  This wasn't overly sweet, like some pecan pies tend to be, and had a great texture.  This is a definited "keeper."

Wow...this is THE best pecan pie or, for that matter, pie recipe ever.  I had a craving for pecan pie and went searching here - I figured with all those rave reviews this must be some pie, and it is!  I have to hold back from eating the whole thing in one sitting!  I'm going to try doubling the filling next time and making a bigger one - I toasted the pecans before putting them in the pie and since I didn't have dark corn syrup, I used maple syrup!  Try it - it's divine!

Forget all other pecan pie recipes!  THIS is THE one -- the filling is ample and sets up nicely...hard to imagine anyone ever using another recipe after trying this one.

This pie had great flavor, no doubt.  Especially after adding a teaspoon of vanilla as reviewers suggested.  However, I'm removing one star as the finely crushed nuts in the filling were just too much.  I want to try this recipe again, omitting the finely crushed nuts in the filling.  I think it will then be a 5 star recipe.  Once I got past the over-abundance of nuts, I could tell the filling would have been incredible without them.

wow, this was the *BEST* pecan pie i've ever made!  i did add a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon, and also a tablespoon of flour to the pie mix and that was just the extra kick of flavor this needed! i also had no dark corn syrup so i used honey from our bee hives. since i cant make pie crust to save my life, i used store bought and cut the time in half.  i took this to "girls night" and got rave reviews, everyone wanted my recipe.  :)

This pie was delicious and I'm just starting to like pecans. As others suggested, I added 1.5 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp flour to the batter. I baked in a deep dish pie plate on the 2nd to lowest shelf, but had to cover with foil in the last 10-15 minutes to avoid burning the top. Next time, I plan to bake at 325 instead of 350. I baked a chocolate pecan pie at 325 the same night and it came out perfect without having to cover it.

The only problem w/ this pie was me. I burned the top a little and so it was "extra" done...my friend who's a true Southerner said it was good though.

Wonderful!  I followed others' advice and added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla & 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also added 1 tbs of flour to thicken the filling but next time I think I will add less...I prefer the filling to be in between gooey & solid.  I also used a Pillsbury pie crust to save time (don't forget to flour it!).  Loved the taste! Rave reviews from my family!

My pie was sitting in the over flowed butter.  It was spinning around in the pan like a wheel there was so much butter.  The crust was like a chip! And wasn't too much filling mostly nuts.

I just won a bake-off for our company picnic using this recipe as my base! I did tweak it by adding 1 tsp vanilla, a bit more butter, 1 shot of Jack Daniels and 1/2 shot of Kaluha , a sprinkling of cocoa powder and some corn starch for the extra liquid. My husband is a Southerner and loves my pie! As well as my boss, who's family owns a soul food restaurant. She had requested her own pie to take home!

First off, Way to nutty. I only used a total of 1 3/4 cups of pecans, and it was still to nutty for us. Other than that, it was alright. I changed the crust a little. I added a pinch of cinnamon and replaced the butter with shortening, and then for the filling I also added cinnamon and vanilla with less corn syrup and more brown sugar. My only complaints are the crust and amount of nuts. My crust was fine, but I have made crusts like that before and I couldn't stand them. They need a little flavor. I guess I also just like my pies to be really moist and not as nutty, so thats my personal preference.

Fantastic, but with changes!  Add vanilla 1 1/2 tsp and just a touch of cinnamon.  And I only did one 1 cup of quartered pecans mixed in the batter.  Will make again and again with these changes!

Too many pecans! I even took out the layer of quartered pecans on the bottom and it was still a bit much.  Taste wasn't bad just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

Awesome- but certainly not for the "I don't love sweets" types! My five stars are based on the following amendments taken from other reviewers: - I added a few hearty dashes of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of vanilla - I added 1 tablespoon of flour to the filling - I substituted the dark Karo for 1 tablespoon of molasses (only because I had no dark Karo). The result was fabulous.  I used a store-bought pie crust and I didn't bother to arrange the pecans in a dainty pattern.  I will surely make this again!

Awesome....Very yummy.  I LOVE, LOVE the texture.  It is not all goo, like most pies.  Very good, but added 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon, per other reviews and was "To die for!" - WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN.

OMG!  This is the most amazing pecan pie I have ever had.  I like pecan pie, but it isn't my dessert of choice, I made this special for my boyfriend (who also loved it) and now it has found it's way into my personal all time favorite desserts.  I did, however, make a few changes, I always do...  I didn't have dark caro syrup, so I added a drop of maple extract.  I added about 1/3 cup white sugar to the filling, along with vanilla and cinnamon and I used 4 tbsp of butter instead of 3.  The filling tasted like hot buttered rum!  For the top layer of nuts, I followed another reveiwer's advice and made a brown sugar/butter/honey mixture and heated the pecans in a skillet, then added them to the pie the last 15 minutes of baking.  I placed the pie on the bottom rack, didn't have any troubles with the top burning.  I did have a few drops of overflow, though, luckily, I had a cookie sheet underneath.  Also, I cheated and used a store bought pie crust due to being short on time...  I can't wait to make this again and next time try the recipe for the shell.  Thank you for sharing!

AMAZING PECAN PIE RECIPE!!! I've never bothered with the crust recipe.  I simply buy ready made pie crusts.  The filling is the yummiest!  My friends and family ask me to bake one for EVERY get together.  I've never tasted a pecan pie I liked until now.

I loved this. I'm only giving 4 stars, because I had to add some things to it to take it over the top, but I loved it. I made it with the butter flaky pie crust, also on this site, which is basically the same as the crust used in this recipe except it doesn't have sugar in it, and I made it with light margarine rather than butter. As for the pie, I used egg beaters instead of eggs, 3/4 cups plus another 2 tablespoons reduced calorie pancake syrup instead of corn syrup, and splenda instead of sugar. I added a tablespoon of molasses, a tsp of cinnamon, a tablespoon of flour to help thicken the filling, a tablespoon of vanilla, a dash of cloves and nutmeg, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I only used 1/2 cup crushed pecans which i mixed into the filling, and 1/2 cup pecan halves for the top. I baked it for an hour, and covered it with foil during the last half hour, baking on a stone to help bake the bottom of the crust. It was soooo good. If you add the spices though, you want to make this a day in advance to give the flavors a chance to blend. Otherwise, it may seem too spicy.

I found this recipe four years ago and since then I make it every year. It is so yummy you just have to try it for yourself to taste how good this pie really is. One thing I don't do is make the pie crust. I rather buy it at the store but that is just my preference.

This is THE BEST pecan pie!Don't waste your time looking for any other pecan pie recipe! My friends all think that I am a culinary genius, thanks to this recipe. As other reviewers have said, definitely add cinnamon and vanilla. I also add a sprinkle of clove.

We did a taste test this Thanksgiving.  I used this recipe and "Pecan Pie V" and a good local bakery.  This was by far the best.  Everyone loved this one.  It made the bakery one taste terrible.  This is a keeper!!!  This is a pecan pie that has lots of flavor.

I don't eat pecan pie but I made two of these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. I only used 1 cup of pecans and it was just enough. I also added vanilla and a bit of rum. Very very easy to make. I also did not make the pie crust from this recipe, I made my own which does not contain sugar.

Too many pecans.  There were so many that my pie didn't hold it's shape very well upon cutting.  I think it would've been better if the layer of nuts that goes on the bottom of the pie shell had been omitted.

I wanted to bring something to Grandma's traditional Thanksgiving dinner last year,(2003), so I opted to bring the Pecan Pie. I found this recipe and made it. Turned out perfect! Absolutely phenominal! In fact, Grandma asked for the recipe! The only thing I did different was buy the refrigerated pie crust to save time. Worked Great!

My husband loved this pie.  I don't eat pecan pie but I made it for Thanksgiving and used "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust" recipe.  I used only 1 1/2 c. of pecans per other reviews.

I made this pie as an extra for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it so much, it was the first pie to be completely eaten!  I used all light corn syrup, as well as brown sugar, and I arranged the pecan halves in a flower design on the top.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

With some changes, this is a five star recipe.  I added the flour and vanilla as suggested, and I omitted the pecans in the filling.  I used all light corn syrup and used dark brown sugar (it probably evened out).  My mom said it tasted just like my grandma's!!  Not traditional because it's not as sweet, but that's a bonus in my opinion.  Much better than the Honey Crunch Pecan Pie.

I don't like Pecan Pie, but my husband loves it.  He really enjoyed the pie along with others.  The only thing my husband didn't like was the amount of pecans.  Will not be putting so many on top and on the bottom of crust next time.

Over all a pretty good pie, but it was a little too nutty for our tastes.  If you scaled back the nuts, and just placed the chopped nuts in the middle the pie, it would be more to the liking of all.

Everyone wanted seconds. I added 2 tablespoons of cane syrup, generous teaspoon vanilla extract, used 2/4 cup light and 1/4 cup dark corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon cinimion. 
I will definitely make this pie again.

If you have a deeper crust, I like to add 1/3 more filling. Keep pecans the same.

Love this recipe and get rave reviews for it!  I found that I need to triple the filling ingredients to get 2 9" deep dish pies.  I also add slihtly more dark karo than called for (2-3 T), and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup dark brown sugar for a deeper, richer flavor.  Excellent!

This recipe turned out pretty good except I used a prepared pie crust.  I had to throw a piece of foil over the pie 1/2 way through the cook time to keep the crust and the top layer of pecans to keep from burning.

For some reason I never made a pecan pie before.  Somehow I had the impression it would be a lot of work.  This recipe was so simple and quick!  I bought a pre-made crust to save time.  The filling was so delicious!  It was not goopy and sticky (I added 1 Tbs of flour as many recommended) and it wasn't too sweet.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Everyone LOVED it.  This will be my holiday pie from now on!

Great recipe.  I did what others suggested and added flour, vanilla & cinnamon.  I also subbed the dark corn syrup with maple syrup.  Everyone loved this pie.  I made homemade whipped cream to go with (1 small heavy whipping cream, 3-4 T powered sugar & 2-3 T vanilla).  That was wonderful with this pie!  It turned out beautiful!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was asked to make it again.  The pecans were even given to me as a gift.  I did add vanilla and a tablespoon of floor.  I covered it the 2nd half hour.   It is delicious and not difficult at all.

I was wondering if you use raw pecans or toasted? I am curious because i dont want them to let out their natural oils. It sounds like an excellent recipe!!

I covered the pie, and put it on the lower rack and the top of my pie still looked burnt. I also added flour and vanilla per other reviewers instructions. The center turned out delicious, I just wish the top wasn't burnt.

Love this recipe. My only adjustments are:
1. I take the pie out of the oven a few minutes early because otherwise it tastes a bit overdone.
2. I use a pre-made, refrigerated crust to cut down on time.

I wanted to make a pie from scratch, for a very long time. My husbands favorite pie is pecan pie and we brought back fresh pecans from a road trip we took to South Carolina. I was not sure if it would have been enough fresh pecans so I also used store bought unshelled pecans (you can taste the difference). The recipe and video was very easy to follow and my crust didn't turn out too bad. The only thing I would say it didn't take an hour to cook. I actually had to take it out after 50 minutes and probably should have taken it out at around 40 minutes.

Perfect. I like my pie on the nutty side rather than too sweet/gooey, and this recipe gives a good balance.

My husband had been harrassing me about a pecan pie all year...he LOVED this one! I made a pretty pattern on them also. I used regular size pie crust and was able to make 2 pies...I used the flour like others had suggested, and they came out BEAUTIFULLY! I didn't have any dark corn syrup so I used some maple syrup. Please watch the video, it's super helpful!

Excellent pecan pie! I used a Pillsbury pie crust, so I can't comment on the crust, but the filling was amazing. Maybe it would be better with vanilla, but I had no complaints. I love all the pecans. This was the best pecan pie recipe I've used, and I've tried a few from this site. This pecan pie wasn't overly sweet, which is amazing for a pecan pie, even I liked it and I don't like pecan pie. I made this recipe as written. Very yummy!

This will be my 4th year making this Pecan Pie, my husband and his kids LOVE it! So easy to prepare. I make it with the Butter Flaky Crust also from this site. In the filling I do add a splash of vanilla and I have added a Tbsp of flour. Just serve it with a nice bold cup of coffee!

This is a keeper for us.  I didn't bother with the additional 2 tbsp of dark corn syrup - just used the light corn syrup in it's place.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  I used 100 g. pkg of chopped pecans in the filling, and almost another full 100 g. pkg of whole pecans to decorate the top.  I did add an additional egg to the filling this time, only because I was taking this to my parent's house and was worried that the filling might be too runny; next time, I'll leave the extra egg out.  However, the filling was super-yummy and this pie was a hit.  (I used a prepared crust, so I can't speak to what the crust was like).

I don't like pecan pie, therefore, I didn't have a tried-and-true recipe... until now.  I made this pie for Thanksgiving and followed the recipe to a T.  My mother and grandmother, both lifelong pie bakers, found it to be delicious.  Even I liked it... for a pecan pie.  Lots of compliments on this one.

It was a Thanksgiving hit!  I did as others suggested and added flour and vanilla to the filling.  I also only used one 2 cup bag of whole pecans and chopped up part of the bag for the "quartered" pecans and chopped some up even more for the "finely crushed".  I doubt I had more than 1/2 cup for the whole pecans on the top, but it was still great.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is my go to pecan pie recipe.  I did as other reviewers suggested...add egg yolk, add more butter and vanilla. Also- I don't add the whole pecans on top- just a few for decoration.  It gets great reviews everytime I make it.

This is a delicious pie.  I did not like pecan pie and never made it before but I thought I would surprise my husband because he loves it and I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. I sent most of the pie home with guests (they prefered the other pies) before tasting it.  That was a huge mistake.  It was a hit, many told me that pecan pie was not their favorite either but they loved this one.  The only changes I made was that I used a store bought shell and I didn't feel like quartering the pecans for the bottom of the shell so I put down 1/2 pecans.

I'm not a pecan pie lover like some, but I like good pecan pie around the holiday season.  This is a real pecan pie.  Not Jelly Goop with Pecan Topping pie, like every other pecan pie I've had.  I did do my pecans a little different - I chopped all pecans in my food processor save the halves I laid on the top.  I do think this would be amazing with a shortbread crust and will try that for our Christmas.

Well, I cheated and used a store bought crust but the filling was really good. I have never made pecan pie before and I thought the overall taste was great. Just a word of advice, if you like the gooey part of the pie better than the pecan part, you will probably want to look somewhere else or decrease the amount of pecans used. The filling also does need some vanilla, I added 1 teaspoon but 2 would have been even better. Being a pecan lover myself, I will keep this pie recipe in my box. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best recipe I've found for pecan pie. The description "irrestible" is definitely a true statement.

I made this for my family on thanksgiving last year and everyone loved it. I did add cinnamon and more flour to this recipe. I tried it with shortbread crust and it made it so much better. My family is begging me to make it again this year. A very good recipe for people who like their recipe with lots of nuts!

Sorry, I hate to be a bummer but this pie did not come out right for me.  I didn't like the way it looked or tasted.  You should only make this one if:  1.  You like your pecan pie way less sweet; 2.  You like tons of pecans - I even cut the amount of pecans by a 1/2 cup and it was still too much.  The crust was a bit tough and the pie was somewhat flat.  I couldn't give this one as a gift as I intended.  I should have stuck with the Karo Syrup recipe which always comes out just right.

BEST PECAN PIE BAR NONE!  There is a reason all of these reviews say the same thing, rest assured!  I made this for the first time last year, and didn't know to cover it halfway thru. The top ended up burning black and it was STILL SO GOOD, that we just peeled off the top pecans and ate the whole thing anyway!!!  I accidentally made a different one this year, for Thanksgiving, Pecan Pie V, on this site, good, with lots of reviews, but believe me, burnt, this still topped it!  BTW, I did make the small additions that everyone mentioned, and it was just AMAZING, making TWO of these this year for Christmas.

This is such a great recipe.  I have made this for the last three thanksgivings and always get great compliments.  I don't make my own pie crust because I am lazy so I use a frozen one, Marie Callenders is the best, no one ever complains about the frozen crust either.  I do add foil around the crust to keep it from burning and take it off towards the end to let the edges get golden brown.  I also add a splash of bourbon and a teaspoon of good quality vanilla extract.  This pie bakes perfect every time.  Thanks for the recipe, this is definitely a keeper.

Very good. Just make sure to watch it while it is cooking. My pie only cooked for 1/2 an hour and then the crust started burning so I covered with foil and cooked for 10 more min. Very good. Will make again.

Very good recipe.  I made one the day before Thanksgiving and sat it on the table to cool.  After it cooled my husband cut several slices.  He enjoyed it so much I had to make another for our Thanksgiving guest.  I did add vanilla extract.

I give it 5 stars for the crust. I used a different recipe to make the filling. I didnt want to go out and buy cornsyrup for this recipe so i used "pecan pie V" as the recipe for my filling. Thanks this crust was great and easy to make.

I really like this pie.  As another reviewer suggested, a bit of vanilla and cinnamon (just a bit!) adds that little something extra.  Also, I bake at a lower temperature to ensure the filling sets up nice and smooth.

Great recipe! I added a splash of vanilla, a pinch of pumpkin pie spice and extra cinnamon, and flour and it turned out wonderfully. I didn't make my own crust because I was pressed for time, so I used a frozen Pillsbury crust and that was fine. It didn't cut very well, but then again it was Thanksgiving and we were in a hurry to eat it..... =]

Thanks for the recipe!

I had to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. I was not disappointed. This pecan pie is excellent. To me, the best part was that it was not sickeningly sweet like so many other pecan pies. I did not have dark corn syrup so I used all light. I did not have enough light brown sugar, so I mixed it with dark brown sugar. I did put the crushed pecan in the filling which I thought was a nice touch. I used only about a half cup or less of quartered pecans on the bottom of the pie shell. Next time I will eliminate the ones on the bottom. I don't thing they are necessary. This is now my pecan pie recipe of choice.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving for the first time- and everyone adored it! Even a harsh critic in my family who kept raving about how a perfect pecan pie should taste loved it! Definatley making it for the next family get-together! I used a pre-made pie crust and added vanilla to the recipe. Thanks!

I prepared this pie using a ready made crust. I added the tablespoon of flour,  2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling. I still found the filling quite liquid. The pecans at the bottom ended up floating at the top. The filling overflowed while the pie was cooking. Good thing I cooked it on a baking sheet to avoid burning the bottom. Overall, it tasted good and everyone liked it.

I made this pie for the first time the night before Thanksgiving and it was amazing. The filling is firm, sweet and delicous. I used my own pre-baked pie crust recipe. I added 1 1/2 teas of vanilla, 1 teas cinnamon and 1 tbsp flour to the filling mixture and omitted the crushed and quartered pecans - only used the pecan halves on the top of the pie. I also did not have dark corn syrup, so I used pancake syrup. As a previous reviewer suggested, I baked the pie on the bottom rack of my oven. My picky eaters (husband and stepson) ate much of this, after claiming that they didn't like pecans - HA!

I personally thought decorating with the pecan was a bit much, so I took the whole 2 1/2 cups and crushed them and added them to the syrup mixture.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I got a lot of compliments on it, especially since it wasn't overly sweet like most are.  Plan on making it again!

This was my first try at pecan pie, and it was very easy.  I'm more confident to try it again.  However, I won't be making this recipe.  It came out crumbly instead of smooth.  Not sure what I did wrong, but I'd be happy to take any advice.

I have very limited skill in making pie crust, but thought I would follow the entire recipe given all of the positive ratings.  Instead of cutting the butter into the flour mixture manually, I put the mixture and butter into my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and used the flat beater to cut the butter in.  Used it also to form the dough into a ball while adding the water.  It worked like a gem!  (Not to mention saving some labor.)  And I heavily floured the dough on both sides as I rolled it to keep it from sticking.  To keep from over-browing the pecans or crust, I placed it on a lower rack in the oven and changed by oven to the Convection Bake setting for the last 30 minutes.  It came out perfect and the guests loved it!  What an amazing recipe, thank you for sharing!!

Great result with the suggestions made by another reviewer. For the 8 serving size, I added one tsp of vanilla, one tbsp of flour and one tsp of cinnamon. I also cooked it at 325 F instead of 350 for an hour. I don't know what shortcake cookie crust means, I hope someone can tell me, I just used the regular one. If you like nuts a lot then it's a good idea to put some on the bottom of the shell before adding the filling, but it will all rise up anyway, I think it was unnecessary, I didn't want it too nutty. 
My husband said it was the best pecan he ever tasted. I loved it warm with vanilla ice cream on top...simply IRRESISTIBLE!

With all the sugars in this pie, just looking at it could make you a diabetic! I am glad I only make these pies once a year! With that said, it was a very, very, very good pecan pie. One of the best I have had/made. 5 stars. PS Used my own crust, did not use crust recipe.

Irresistible is a perfect name for this pecan pie. Rich, and sweet with a lovely golden color. I used my own pie crust recipe. Be sure to have your eggs at room temperature and use the best ingredients. You'll be delighted with the results. Don't forget the ice cream or whipped cream!

Excellent! Very easy with a store bought crust. I get requests to make it all the time. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to cut down on the sweetness.

Fabulous, fabulous.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  I made this twice last year and twice this year - followed recipe exactly as written (once I omitted the quartered pecans and it was still fabulous!).  My non-pie eating husband begged me to make this again for Cmas.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

There's way too much butter in this crust. That makes it extra tasty, but the crust shrinks up while baking. The filling is great though, so with a different crust recipe, or a refrigerated crust, this is a really tasty pie!

My husband requested a pecan pie and so I made one for our anniversary dinner.  I made the mistake of thinking I had light syrup and in reality I only had dark. So, that's all I used and it turned out beautifully. My husband loved it. Thanks (oh yeah, and I loved the crust, wouldn't change a thing)

This review is for the filling only as I made a different crust.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I really liked the amount of pecans this had, but the flavor was pretty average.  The filling wasn’t too sweet, which was good, but it lacked that dark richness that makes pecan pie so delicious.  The filling set up perfectly and wasn’t runny, but the texture was a little off; kind of lumpy.  This pie presents well and is tasty, but just isn’t exceptional in my opinion.

YUM!!! This was the best pecan pie I've ever tasted, and I made it. YAY!! I used Marie Callender's frozen pie crusts, which come in a pair and cost just over a dollar (delicious, and no flour mess, or poorly made crust) so I doubled the pie recipe, but left out the crushed pecans and used 2 and a half cups halved pecans, and 1 cup chopped. Placing them in the bottom of the crust before adding the filling was silly, since they just rose to the top anyhow, so the 2nd one I just sprinkled over the top before placing the halved ones. One went immediately after a small family dinner, and the 2nd tasted even better the next day!!

This was absolutely fantastic!  Very easy recipe to follow and the end product was raved about by 13 people at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I did not add the pecans on the bottom of the pie crust and it was perfect.  This will become a definite staple pie for holidays and special occassions in our family, thank you for the great recipe!

This pie was absolutely amazing!  I have been making pecan pie for a few years, but I'd never come across a recipe that was exceptional.  Well, now I've found it.  I have a favorite pie crust recipe that I used instead of this one, but the filling was perfect.  Lots and lots of nuts and a sweet gooey filling make this pecan pie one you can impress with.  It was very easy to make too, so you don't have to be a great cook to fix up a great dessert!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I accidentally forgot to add the melted butter and added 1/4 a cup of extra corn syrup, but it turned out fine anyways.  At my family get-together two other people brought pecan pies, but mine was the only completely gone at the end of the meal!

This pecan pie was unbelievable. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to it...and vanilla.   I didn't add the whole 1 cup of pecans to the top, basically whatever fit into the pie pan. I make pecan pie every Thanksgiving and Christmas,,,this will be my recipe for now on :) Thank you!!

I have tried to make pecan pie for years now and even the easiest of recipes never came out right. I found this recipe and gave it a shot. My goodness was it ever easy and soooo good. Of all the deserts I made last Thanksgiving this was the first to go. Already got request to make 2 pecan pies this year! : 0 )

My husband loves pecan pie so I decided to search for a recipe to make him one for Father's Day.  I have never made a pecan pie before so I wanted to find the perfect recipe for him.  I used refridgerated pie crust and added the pecans to the top halfway through cooking as another user suggested and this pie turned out magnificent!  It was so good!  My husband and I both loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

My mom loves pecan pie and no one in our family has ever made a really good pecan pie for our holiday meals. This year she told me to try to find a good recipe for a pecan pie and this is the first recipe I came across. When she tried it, she said it was the best pecan pie she had ever tatsed! She now says that my job is to make the pecan pies for all of our family meals. I don't even like nuts very much and I tried this pie and really liked it. (I just take the big pecans off the top) If you're looking to make a pie that steals the show, this is that pie!

I had never made a pecan pie before, but this was the best pecan pie I have ever tasted.  I added some vanilla and used the "honey crunch" topping as mentioned in another recipe and as was recommended by another reviewer.

excellent pie, although I did like some other reviews stated, left out the pecan halves, and made a cup full of the honey crunch topping from another recipe.  The pie is to die for.

First, this should be made in a 9" pie plate.  I used a 10" (only one I had) and the filling was not enough.  I thought the crust was okay, but should use less sugar and salt.  If you use salted butter, eliminate the salt in the crust.  I found the filling a little too sweet. I might try to make this again with modifications.

I've made this twice now and it's excellent. The only pie to be devoured last Thanksgiving. Definitely worth the time to make the crust, it's not hard at all. And cover the crust after 20 minutes or so so it doesn't get too dark. Delicious!

WOW!!! This was SO easy to make perfect! I grew up on a pecan orchard and the flavor of this pie is at least as good as my mother's, but somehow it is easier to make it turn out just right.

I think that this is the 3rd year in a row I've made this now...  I've reviewed this recipe before and this time if I could give it 10000 stars, I would.
My father-in-law never had my pecan pie. Last night, after he took one bite, he got up and gave me a hug and a kiss, saying that this was the BEST pecan pie he's ever had.  Thanks again ingrid.

This is the first pecan pie I have ever made - It was soooo easy!!  I made two at one time for two different functions.  It was the only desert (out of 3 deserts that were brought) to be eaten at both!! I had to make about 20 copies of the recipe to give to my friends who demanded it!!

This pie was rather good, my boyfriend really liked it! I made 2 9' pies with the recipes instead of one, but next time I'll just make one so that the middle will be thicker.  I didn't feel like making a pie crust.

I had never tried pecan pie before and when I was asked to make one for 
Thanksgiving Day, I was pretty scared.  When I found this recipe I thought 
I could do that.  This recipe was fantastic.  I love pecan pie now!  
Well, at least this recipe!

I never made a pecan pie before I tried this recipe.  It was very easy and
very good!  For those at our Thanksgiving get together that like pecan pie
it was a hit.  The texture was very nice and taking the time to make a nice
circular design on top with pecan halves really makes a nice presentation.

It was scrumptious.  It wasn’t super sweet, so I think it was better than most.

This pie has been perfection for me since I found this recipe 3yrs ago. The only change I made was I used dark brown sugar and I toasted the pecans to draw more of their sweetness out before adding them to the rest of the ingredients.

Haven't cut into it yet, but the top looks golden, but dry. I hope deeper in is more liquidy. My mom pointed out that using a pan underneath is important not just for collecting overflow, but helping to evenly cook the bottom of the crust. I forgot to put in the vanilla, like many other cooks suggested! I hope the flavor is ok!

I have made this now twice and it is really good! I used pillsbury dough for crust but followed the recipe and suggested add ins a dash of cinnamon, 2 tsp vanilla, and a tbsp of flour. It doesn't last a full 24 hours in our house.

I saw a review that suggested adding vanilla, cinnamon and flour.  While this is the very first time my middle wasn't runny, it ended up being too thick.  I would back off the cinnamon, keep the vanilla, and not add the flour next go around.  Overall, I enjoyed it, but want to tweek it a bit more.

Made this for my son-in-law, he loved that there was so much pecan taste  and that it was not too sweet. I  used my favorite pie crust recipe but used the directions of the filling from the  original recipe.

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Taking the time to find the most perfect pecan halves for the top really made a difference in how delicious the pie looked. Unfortunately, because it looked so good, I only got a single piece!

This is by far the best Pecan Pie I have ever baked.  I liked the amount of pecans in the pie along with the chopping into two different sizes.  Topped off with pecan halves.  The filling balanced well with the 2 1/2 cups of pecans.  The filling often times can be way too sweet.  After a good sized meal over powering sweetness can distract from the dessert.  This will now be my go to Pecan Pie!  Up date, I just read a few of the reviews.  Vanilla was mentioned a lot.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to my pie because I felt like a little bit of vanilla never hurts anything!

My husband is a bit picky when it comes to Pecan Pie. He LOVED this one! I probably added a wee bit more vanilla than everyone suggested, but the vanilla makes it amazing!

This is a holiday favorite and requested by my family every year!  I add an extra 1/2 cup of crushed pecans to the filling.  Sometimes I will use substitute eggs instead of the real eggs, with no noticeable difference.

LOVE!!! (I am an AWFUL cook - so if I can make this pie well - any baker can!) I have made this recipe several times for my hubby who is infatuated with pecan pie. Next time I make it I will be taking other bakers recommendations and adding 1T of flour so its not deliciously mushy. I printed this recipe about 15 years ago and every time I make it - its a huge hit and gobbled up immediately.

I make the filling as is, but I just can't get pie crusts to come out well.  Then I substitute for Pilsbury's refrigerated pie crust.  Only thing I change and this pie is my go-to whenever I want to impress guests!

Very good.  Next time I will reduce pecans by 1/2 cup..just too many so it overpowers filling.  I did add 2 tablespoons flour & vanilla.  Definitely do that again.  Also, I think 50 minutes would have been a better bake time for my electric oven.  I hour made it a little dry.  I would absolutely make it again.  Like all recipes you can tweak it to fit your individual taste.

This is my go to recipe now. I don't personally enjoy it, but those in my family who do expect it at every holiday.  They won't eat any homemade pecan pie unless it's this recipe. Consistency is on point, flavor is delicious, you can't go wrong. However I cannot say that I've tried the crust. With all the other food to cook I have used a premade pie crust and it's worked well each time.

My husband generally does not like pecan pie, claiming it is too sweet.  But he raved about this one, noting that you could really taste the pecans.  Placing pecan halves on the top really makes for a  lovely presentation too.  I have already made it again!

Great recipe.  I thought I didn’t like pecan pie but have now changed my mind :)  I did add vanilla, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg as recommended by reviewers. Can’t wait to make this again.

Great Pie.
I've made this pie five times now. My family expects this pie at our holiday functions, and I'm glad to make them happy. I haven't changed a thing. 
Thank You

I made a pie following the recipe to a T and then I made one with cinnamon, tbl flour, and vanilla and I could not tell any difference whatsoever. I froze one of the pies and it reheated just as well as when it was fresh. I simply baked it at 350 for 20-30 mins until the center was warm. Great recipe, thanks! :)

Oh I forgot to mention I lied... I guess I did change the recipe. I did honey instead of dark corn syrup and I instead of light corn syrup I just dissolved sugar into hot water. I doubt it changed the taste, but I felt better about it!

I followed the recipe exactly but used non-dairy margarine and Ener-G kosher egg replacer. This pie is hands down the best pecan pie I’ve had yet.

I don't believe it's fair to make numerous changes to a recipe and then rate the results as if you had followed the recipe.  For this reason I ignored all suggested changes and tried the recipe as written.  Glad I did!  This pie is excellent--not too sweet as many pecan pies can be.   Will definitely try again.

It was my first attempt at pecan pie. This is a great recipe for a beginner. It’s simple and really no way you can mess it up. The pie tasted wonderful. Not overwhelming sweet like some pecan pies. This will be a new addition to my holiday baking. Thanks for the recipe!!

Perfection! I suggest either pushing the topped pecans down into the filling or mixing in with a little batter from the bowl before placing on top, otherwise the pecans will burn! I added 1/2 tsp vanilla since my old recipe called for it. (I had been adding crushed pecans to mine to get the perfect filling consistency, but forget every year at Thanksgiving just how much, so I thought to check AllRecipes for a new recipe. I'm so glad I did!) This is my new go-to pecan pie recipe. Thank you so much!

This pie turned out delicious!!   I only had enough pecans to decorate the top, but I had plenty of walnuts, so I tried those and they were just as good as pecans in the pie.  I used another person's suggestions to add 1 tbs flour and I added 2 tsp. vanilla.  I also used dark brown sugar because it's what I had on hand.  It was the best "pecan" pie I had even eaten.  So good!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Very, very good! I did take the suggestions and added a tablespoon of flour and a teaspoon and a half of vanilla. Did use the crust recipe. It didn't get soggy and tasted good. Loved all the pecans. Rave reviews at Thanksgiving.

I found it a little confusing that the pie crust ingredients weren't well separated from the pie ingredients, but the resulting pie was fabulous and the pecans arranged on the top made it look stunning!!

I've made this recipe at least 10 times. It's great. Just cover edges of crust with foil during baking and you won't burn the crust. It's too long to be uncovered.

This review is for the filling only; I used a different pie crust recipe.  I made two changes: as many people mentioned, I added 1 tsp vanilla & secondly I changed the amount of pecan nuts used- in the filling itself I used 1 cup of chopped pecans and then for the top, added just enough whole pecans to cover the surface. This recipe is definitely a keeper and I'll use it again!

It had a good flavor it was very nutty which I liked, and the vanilla added a great taste, but I think I baked it too long

I have tried a few other Pecan Pie recipes and this is by far my favorite.  I used my own crust recipe and added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 TBS of flour to the filling as suggested by others and it turned out perfectly the first time!  This is now my go-to Pecan Pie recipe!

I've done what the others have suggested. I added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract, a dash of cinnamon, and 1 Tbsp. of flour to the filling. I also skipped the step where you add 1 cup of quarter-pecans to the bottom of the crust and put only as many pecans on top as I wanted (which probably turned out to be a cup, anyway) so that I did not have too many pecans. Lastly, I pulled out the pie after 30 minutes and covered it with aluminum foil (if I hadn't, I think that it may have burned). I have not tried it as it is the pie is not for me, but my family keeps complimenting it and saying that it looks good. I think it looks good as well. This pie recipe may be good yet!!! :)

This was a huge hit! I made it for a friend who loves pecan pie, but it ended up being the favorite pie of the night, even amongst us that usually aren't pecan pie fans!

Substitutions:
• Instead of making this pie crust, I bought Keebler Ready Crust 9 Inch Shortbread Pie Crust and it balanced the pie nicely
• I added 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
• I didn't decorate the top with pecans. This was mostly out of time restraint but taste-wise, it already had plenty of pecans and was incredible, plus it wasn't ugly to need the top.

This is a pie for pecan lovers only. My husband was over the moon for this pie.  It has amazing flavor without being too sweet if you use all the pecans requested.  I will only use the recipe for pecan pie for now on.  Thank you for this.

This is an EXCELLENT pie recipe!!!! 
I used pilsberry pie crust prerolled in the buscuit section. So I can only review the filling and process. 
 I didn't leave it in for the whole hour the first time and it turned out PERFECT. It was about 50 minutes. The second time I left it in for the entire hour and it was way too done. Hard to serve and very tough. 
Just make sure to watch this pie closely for the remaining 15 minutes.

I didn't use this pie crust recipe - so can only rate the filling which was simple and amazing. I didn't put in as many of the pecan pieces as it called for but that's a personal preference.

Never made a pecan pie or any pie for that matter; I'm known best for my cakes and cheesecakes. I wanted to try something different, and the result was a big hit; my mother-in-law loves pecan pie, and said this was the best one she's ever had. I'm about to make it again for Christmas with the whole family. 

I followed the recipe almost exactly; because the only pie dish I had was a little large I had to increase the crust by half, otherwise I didn't change a thing.

The description is right, I can't stop eating it. The only changes I made was to use a refrigerated pie crust( I'll make a real one SOME day), and I did add a tsp. of vanilla. It was raved over on Thanksgiving but thankfully not a lot of pecan pie lovers, so oh darn I had to bring the rest home. Thank God! Best pecan pie I have made or eaten.

I made this for the first time last year. I read many reviews and followed most. I used 3 medium sized eggs, 1 tablespoon of flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and I split the Corn  syrup to 50-50dark and light. My brothers said it was fantastic.  This year I made 2 of them. Can't wait to see what they say this year. 

Thank you.

We don't know this kind of pie in Europe and had it on a trip to Canada. We would definitely make this pie back home, so we bought a bottle of corn syrup in Canada (hard to get in Europe). This recipe seemed the best and it was a great success at our family dinner.

I doubled everything to make 2 pies and it was fabulous! ( I did add just a splash of bourbon for fun :)  I had a bit of left over pie dough so I kept it sealed in a plastic bag in the fridge and used it a full week later for another pie and it was still great & flaky. Nice one!

I make this every Thanksgiving for my Uncle Phil's birthday.  One for the feast and one for him.  The stress is in making the pie crust, so I use Marie Callender's crusts, the best I have ever tasted. I pre-bake them so the bottom will not get soggy. I grind the pecans for the filling in our coffee grinder.  I like this recipe because the filling holds relatively firm.

I just made this filling recipe and it's not completely out of the oven but already I taste how amazing it is. I didn't make the crust and just used a store bought. I added some vanillas as suggested by others and used about a 1/4 of white sugar in place of the dark sugar so it wouldn't be so sweet tasting. I also chopped a bag of pecans so that there's more of pecan in each bite if the pie.  The filing precooked was good and spooned a little when it was cooking and it was really good. I can't wait to serve it with fresh homemade whip cream!!!!

The only thing I do is roast the pecans before using them on the crust and in the filling. Gives them a crispier taste. Otherwise I keep everything the same! I refuse to use another pecan pie recipe after making this one!

Tried this for Christmas as my Father is a Pecan Pie nut.  I found the recipe extremely easy, followed it exactly, and both he and I were extremely pleased with it.  Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe closely but added a few touches of my own:  1/2 maple syrup to replace the dark Karo syrup and some of the light syrup and added 1/2 tsp maple flavoring.  I wasn't sure when to add the flour so just guessed and ended up having to strain the filling to remove lumps.  When should you add the flour?

I read the other reviews and made a few adjustments to the original recipe:
I roasted the pecans, cut them into 1/4s and mixed these in with the wet ingredients - I added 11/2 tsp vanilla to the wet stuff.
I then laid another cup of roasted whole pecans on the top of the pie in a pretty pattern before baking.  I baked the pie on the bottom rack for 70 minutes, and there was no burning or drying out.
It was delicious!!
Roasting the nuts reduces the overly sweet, sugary taste that others complained about.
I used my own pie crust recipe, so I cannot comment on the crust.  A ready made pie crust would work just fine as the juices from the pie center are sweet and very flavorful.

Great recipe, but I did make a number of changes after doing a few test runs pre-Thanksgiving.  Like others have suggested, I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tbsp of flour.  I also cut the light corn syrup to 1/2 cup and substituted the remainder with dark corn syrup and added 1 tbsp of maple syrup and 1 tbsp of bourbon (I used Maker's Mark) which adds to depth of flavor.  I cut the amount of pecans and also saved a bit of the filling to pour over the top layer of pecans so they would have a glaze on them.  Delicious!  Highly recommend.

Of Course it is irresistible,what Pecan Pie isn't.
So,the Pastry,good enough. The Top layer of Nuts is enough,the bottom layer is overkill. I think the balance of light and dark syrup is incorrect,the fill is not sweet enough and it needs vanilla.The cooking time is too long,or at least,place pie on a lower shelf.

I first rated this 4 stars but since changed it to 3.  Flavor was good but there were too many nuts.  Also the pie became quite runny and nobody liked it the next day.  Will try something else next time.

I added 1 tsp of vanilla, roasted the pecans for 10min. I only added pecans to the top. Pie should sit for a day for the flavors to blend. Pie wasn't ooey gooey or sickeningly sweet like the usual pecan pie, loved it! Next time, will either add a 1Tbs of flour or cooking the filling on the stove to see if there's a difference in flavor/texture.

My husband loves pecan pie and is from the south... and is very rarely verbally complementary of the food he eats. That being said he loved this pie and that says alot. It was also ridiculously easy, and I decorated the top in a swiral just as the picture shows and mine turned out just as beautiful. Thanx for helping me treat my husband to something I thought I could never get right (:

I don't know why people are complaining about no vanilla. It tastes fine just as it is. I didn't have time to make a crust so just used a store bought one & didn't use the crushed pecans because I thought it would be too much pecan. I loved the way it turned out.

Be sure if you use a deep dish pan to cook for the required time and check to be sure it is done in the middle.  I did add the vanilla and it tasted good, but I didn't cook quite long enough.

This was a good recipe and my family enjoyed it but we all agreed that with all the pecans we added to the filling, it was a little dry to us. Perhaps we will use less pecans next time. Either way, thanks for sharing.

My pie turned out well, but make sure you check it before the hour is up, mine was a little over done when I baked it for the whole hour.

I made this on Thanksgiving and i have only made Pecan pies about 5 or 6 times.  this was indeed without a doubt the best pecan Pie i have ever tasted and i come from a family of 12. My mom was the best cook but i never tasted a pecan pie this good in my life. If you don't try it you're crazy. make sure you roast the pecans.  I used more than the recipe called for (personal preference) and it was fantastic...Try it, it's too easy and good to be true. oh and there was no messy syrup the entire time of it's survival( which wasn't long)...LOL   enjoy!

I didn't make the crust, but the filling was great. Next time I would not add vanilla as others suggested-it didn't seem right. However, I added a T of flour and a bit of cinnamon, and those tips were much appreciated. I'm not sure what the filling would have been like without the flour, but mine was nice and firm-the slices were beautiful!

This was a very good pie. I added a tablespoon of flour, as some readers recommended, and I'm glad I did. I like pecan pie to be firmer rather than runny.

I thought this pie was very good but like other suggested, it did need some vanilla in it. Just note that this is a very rich pie. I still have 1/2 of it at home because our family could only eat 1/2

This was excellent. I did not put the pecans in the pie but instead on top of the crust before I put in the filling and then on top again.

This pie is awesome! I've never made a pecan pie before but love them. Made it for Thanksgiving yesterday and the pecan pie lovers loved it. And asked for the recipe. I made it exactly but did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I can't make a crust to save my life so I use Pillsbury. But it baked up perfectly in one hour. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! I really like the fact that it calls for finely crushed, quatered and halved pecans. I used real maple syrup only instead of corn syrup, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

I have never had a pecan pie before, I saw it on TV and thought it looked good and it was awesome.  This recipe is so easy!  I did not use the pie crust in this recipe but the Pie Crust VI.  I also added the vanilla and flour that was suggested in the other reviews.

Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee recipe is by far superior to any other pie crust recipe I've tried. Other then that I followed the filling recipe to a T. Next time I'll add a little vanilla. It was good, but I think could be better with a bit of vanilla. It's not a particularly deep dish ooey gooey pie recipe. Just your standard pecan pie.

This was pretty good, but i've had better.  Having the crushed pecans in the filling didn't make too huge of a difference for us.

I have some anti-sweettooths in my house, and they really love this pie. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the crust mixture, and it turned out fantastic.  And i got to snack on pecan the entire way through.

Absolutely beautiful! I loved the sheer amount of pecans, more than double the standard recipe. It also meant that the whole pecans placed on top of the pie stayed where you put them and the result was a very professional looking pie. The name couldn't be more accurate and will be in my favorite recipes from here on out.

I made this pecan pie for Thanksgiving this year and for some reason my pecan pies have always come out runny so I baked this one and then turned the oven off and let cool in the oven like a cheesecake and it worked! It was also my first time making a crust and I need to practice on that!

Wow! This was so good. I only made the filling. Wasn't sure about the ground pecans mixed in, but it was really good. I had to use mostly dark corn syrup because I had less than 1/4 c light. Thanks!

This was the first pecan pie that I have ever made and I have to say that it is the best pecan pie that I have ever tasted. I made this last Thanksgiving and there was none left at the end of the evening.

This recipe was good but I changed some things about this recipe. I didn't make the crust instead I used a pre made graham cracker crust. Instead of the light corn syrup i used 2 tbsp. of molasses. I added vanilla and cinnamon from reading the other reviews. I also added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the eggs before adding them to the syrup mixture. I added pecans halves just to the top of the pie b/c i've never had a pie that had pecan bits in the filling.

I cheated and used Tenderflake, and the recipe made 2 almost overflowing pies.  I find it strange that I'm the only one with this observation?  When I covered it part way through the filling stuck to the tin foil -any suggestions?  Based on these troubles I was expecting to be disappointed, but just the opposite, this was wonderful!  I added vanilla and about 1 ts flour.

A great pie, but one problem for me was that the filling didn't fill up my pie pan. I used a standard pie dish and didn't increase the amount of filling and it seemed a little empty in the pie pastry. I will probably add more filling before baking next time. Overall a wonderful pecan pie.

I mde this for our New Year's Eve party and everyone raved about this pie! My husband who loves Pecan Pie and grew up with a Pecan tree in his yard said this is the best pecan pie he has ever had. Even better than his mom's. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the pie like the previous posters suggested. I did use a different pie crust still homemade though. Very delicious!

Made two pies for Thanksgiving. Last year my pie was a flop. This year was super. The pancake syrup adds something different so be sure to use it. I only used the crushed and whole pecans. I also added good quality vanilla and used a maple praline syrup. I used Ina Garten's piecrust recipe.

my husband called this the Pecan and Crust pie.  I like pecans but that is all you could taste in this pie.  As I was putting them in I thought it looked like a lot but it was my first time makine a pecan pie so I had no other frame of reference. I cooked it for 45min maybe it need less time with all those nuts in my oven? So many give this a high review so I am giving it at least 3 stars thinking it has to partly be me. My advice if it looks like a lot of nuts to you it probably is use less or add more syrup filling,

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family and I were all disappointed. The flavor of this pie was very nice as was the crust.  It was a bit too nutty for me though.  I prefer a chewier and sweeter filling.  Next year I am going back to the old recipe!

This is a great pie!  My husband is the only one who really likes pecan pie, but out of the three pies at Thanksgiving dinner this pie was devoured while the others were just picked at (to my husband's dismay).  I used extra pecans...you can't ever get enough nuts, and it was delicious!

My wife and I made this pie for Thanksgiving and we loved it! It was the nuttiest pecan pie we had ever eaten, and being from the South, we have eaten a lot of pecan pies! To save time, we used a refrigerated pie crust. We also added 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla to the filling. We will definitely make this pie again.

Made this for Thanksgiving, using a ready made crust. I added the tablespoon of flour, 2 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon to the filling. Next time, I'll have to watch this closely. Both of the pies came out too well done.

I made this for my dad on Thanksgiving because he LOVES pecan pie.  I used a Mrs. Smith's frozen pie crust and followed the filling recipe exactly as it stated.  The pie looked beautiful and it tasted oh so good!  This one is definitely a keeper. My husband and dad were competing for slices!  I can't wait to make it again!

Beautiful and yummy! I used (thawed) frozen pie crust to save time and sub. pancake syrup for the corn syrups. I had to tent the pie with foil for the last 15 minutes b/c my pecans on top were getting too brown. I also added 10 minutes to the cooking time, and then turned the oven off but left the pie in for another 5-10 mninutes b/c the pie had not set yet.

I have a pie crust recipe that I like, so I just made the filling. It turned out very good. Did what was suggested by other reviewers and added vanilla, cinnamon, and flour to the mixture. A friend of mine said it was the best pecan pie she'd ever eaten. My husband,  on the other hand would've preferred more goo in the middle. I guess it's just all in what ya like. :-}

This has to be the best Pecan Pie I have ever made in my life! It was also very visually pleasing and perfect looking!!! I have to say I cheated and used the premade pie crust, but everyone still loved the pie!!! IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE..plus it was super duper easy!

Loved this recipe, was easily the best pecan pie I've ever had!  My husband loved it as well, couldn't stop raving about it.  The only thing I did differently was add some vanilla as other users suggested.

So easy! I made it with a premade crust. Substituted light corn syrup for the dark syrup, but then used dark brown sugar. Was my first pecan pie, and turned out excellent!

Wonderful recipe! Added the Tbs of flour, 2 tsp of vanilla, and cinnamon. Also grated bittersweet chocolate on the bottom of the crust to cut some sweetness (chef's trick!) Pie was gorgeous, and got rave reviews. I don't even like pecan pie and I enjoyed it! Next time will leave out the pecan quarters, but that is just personal preference and a cost saver. Yummy!

Great recipe.  First time for a pecan pie--everybody loved it.  Filling was nice and thick. I used my own pie crust recipe so I don't know about this one.

This was a very good starting point for a recipe but I did add a few things. For this to taste like a real pecan pie should taste, I do think you need to add at least 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of ground cinnamon. With those two things added, this pie was fabulous!

I've made this pecan pie for the holidays for several years now and it is, by far, the best Pecan Pie I've ever had.  Lots of pecans, lots of flavor.  My family agrees.

Unfortunately, this did not turn out for me.  It was really hard, so maybe I baked it too long.  I followed the recipe exactly so I am still confused...  I made it for Xmas and had to throw it out.  I did taste it beforehand the inside tasted ok, but I was upset that it didn't turn out as planned.  :(

This was the first pecan pie I'd ever made, and it was incredibly delicious!  My boyfriend and I polished off the whole thing in just over 24 hours, I think.  I followed reviewers' comments and added vanilla and flour to the base, and coated the pecan halves on top with a the  honey/brown sugar/butter glaze.  I was nervous that it would be too pecan-y and not have any of the traditional pecan pie goo, so I started out with just 1/2 c. each of the crushed, quartered and halved pecans, but I ended up adding the remaining 1/2 c. of pecan halves back in to fully cover the top of the pie.  I was also concerned that the pie crust, being just a simple butter crust, would be too hard, but the texture was perfect for a pecan pie--crumbly, rich, and shortbready.

I realized, after making this pie and reading all of the reviews, that I actually DO like syrupy, sweet pecan pies. :)  This pie gets 3 stars just on personal taste; this isn't what I expect from pecan pies, and whether or not that's a good thing depends on the individual preference.
I put in half as many chopped and whole pecans as called for, and left out the crushed all together, and it was still an amazing amount of pecans.  I only added a teaspoon of flour and that was enough for me.  I used a Pillsbury crust, but considering this was my first time ever to make a pie, this was pretty easy and turned out nice.  
This is a great recipe if this is what you're looking for.  I think I'll try something different next time.

This was the first pecan pie I have made and I was very happy with the way it turned out.  I baked it for an hour, but near the end I had to cover the crust, it was getting too dark.  Anyway, this pie was the most popular one at thanksgiving dinner.

Full of flavor and nuts!  Awesome job, Ingrid.  Thanks for the enlightenment.  This was my FIRST attempt at making pecan pie, and I am so happy to have found and tried your recipe.  Super easy!  Only variations:  Saved a step by going with a prepared pie shell; added a tblsp of vanilla and dash of cinnamon; and instead of layering the bottom with quartered nuts, I opted to chop those and add them with the others.  Also added a tblsp of molasses, which I think lends a richness to the filling.  Could even reduce the nuts by half a cup and still have a packed and wonderful pie.  It was a HUGE hit and is going in the annuls of my recipe book.  Thanks so much!

I am English but decided to cook a Thanksgiving dinner this year and baked a Pecan Pie and a Sweet Potato Pie for the very first time.

This is the recipe I used for the Pecan Pie and it received 5 stars from everyone. 

(It only needed 40 mins in the oven though.)

I will defintely bake it again.

Thanks

This pie was gorgeous when it came out of the oven, but failed to taste as good as it looked.  My crust ended up being hard and not very tasty and the pecans on the top were toasted too much causing them to be a little overwhelming in flavor.  I may try this recipe again, but if I do I will use my old stand by pie crust recipe and omit the pecans laid on the top.

I am giving this one 4 stars because despite everything I thought it tasted good. I don't like anything goey and I found after making this pie that there was a lot of "jelly" at the bottom of the pie. Next time I will use less syrup and maybe more nuts cause I like mine very nutty.  Also I found that the pie almost scorched before setting so I switched the oven off and let it stand for a while. I read another review and next time I will cover it will foil. Otherwise it is a good tasting pie.

I have tried several pecan pie recipes and this one is a keeper!  Did not try crust, used roll out premade crust. I like the mixture of dark and light syrup.  Only change is cut back pecans to 1 1/2 cups.  Thanks for sharing, great pie!

Pretty good---but, I think the secret to a really good pecan pie is to use FRESH pecans.  The pecans I used I do not think where fresh.  The crust was very good & easy!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and took it to my in-law's and to my mom's.  It was well-received at both places.  I only rated 4 stars, because I think it calls for too many pecans.  I like it better with just the pecans on top.  It would probably be okay with a layer on the bottom as well, but I think crushing them and putting them in the filling is just going overboard.  To make it easier, I used a refrigerated pie crust.  Also, I messed up with the butter.  I wasn't paying attention and put the 1/2 c. of butter that was supposed to go in the pie crust into the filling instead of the 3 tbsp. of melted butter!  It was a little difficult to stir up, but it didn't hurt a thing (except maybe add some more fat grams).

I added a bunch of vanilla (oops--but so glad I did!), some cinnamon, and mixed the pecan halves in a honey and brown sugar mixture before topping and was told it was the best pecan pie my guests had ever eaten!

We made this pie for our church potluck.  It was the first dessert gone!

I used only the filling recipe because I had already made my crusts.  This pie was chock full of pecans and very delicious.  Very sweet, but not too sweet.  This pie recipe is now in the yearly Thanksgiving rotation.

I have been making pecan pies for a long time and this is by far THE BEST that I have ever tasted.  I really didn't want to stop eating!!  I used a store bought crust the first time, but I am making it again tonight with the homemade crust. YUM!!!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was very "nutty" and well received. I must admit I wasn't paying close attention to the recipe and caught myself putting in 3/4 light and dark corn syrups. I adjusted by adding a scant 1/2 C brown sugar and 2 T. flour. The recipe is pretty fool proof and still turned out well. It's not too sweet as some pecan pies tend to be. It's definitely a keeper!

Excellent pecan pie!!  This is one of the best I have ever had.  I just added a bit more (crushed)pecans on the top which really filled it up and we had less gooey in the middle and more pecans. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was totally gone within minutes. Everyone ranted and raved about it.  I will make it again for Christmas because it was so easy to make and it was absolutely delicious.  I used a store bought pie crust to save time and it came out perfect.

This pecan pie got great reviews at Thanksgiving dinner.  My kids obliged me to make another today because they didn't get enough!  I found it less gooey and sickeningly sweet than most other pecan pie recipes...maybe the ground nuts in the filling make the difference.  This is a keeper for the future.

Very good; not too sweet.  My mom loved the recipe but the others at the table weren't as impressed.  Next time, I may try the crunch topping others mentioned to see if I can nudge this to '5 stars' next time!

Finally a PECAN PIE.  This is not a goo pie with floating pecans.  I've always tossed in extra pecans to the basic recipe, but this one showed me the key.  Crushed pecans make every bite flavorful, quartered pecans fill the crust, and pecan halves on top create a very impressive presentation.  (I never could get those floating pecans pretty on the gooey recipes)   I have an easy homemade crust recipe, so I made my own, but thank you so much, Ingrid, for giving me the secret to making my pecan pie truly PECAN.  Yum!

This recipe was good, but it wasn't significantly different from any other (easier) pecan pie recipes I've tried.  I don't think it was worth the extra effort (the crushed, quartered, and halfed pecans).  I also used a different crust recipe.

One of my sisters-in-law turned me on to pecan pie.  I had such a taste for it at Thanksgiving, that I decided to make one myself.  This one was very easy and extremely delicious!  I will be making this one every year.  :+)

First time ever baking a pie ever. Friend who asked for it for Thanksgiving loved it and didn't believe me when I said it was my first time. Pretty fool proof. Substituted frozen pie crust (didn't want to press my luck) and it came out great. He ate the whole pie!

I made this into a 12 inch deep dish pie. I doubled ingredients except I didn't use the crushed or quarterd pecans. I used around 3cups pecan halfs for this size pie and used all light corn syrup. Also added vanilla extract. I used the Betty Crocker pie crust mix in a box. It got devoured at our Thanksgiving table and there was other desserts! I thought it was good but not the best, I think I would add 1 more of the filling without the nuts to make it more custardy to the amount of nuts I used. If you like more nuts than filling  use all the nuts but if you like it more custardy use less. Everyone enjoyed it. Thanks!

Delicious! The next time I make it, I'll try using only 1/2 cup nuts on the bottom and on top instead of a whole cup. Other than that, I wouldn't change the recipe at all.

Loved this recipe.  I don't like the "gloop" that others have mentioned and this took care of that.  I used the Basic Flaky pie crust.  The only thing was 2 tsp of vanilla (that was not in the recipe but was suggested by other reviewers) was too much.  1 tsp would have been better.  I did add the tablesppon of flour, which worked out well.  The extra cup of pecans layered on the top was definately not necessary, and actually, in my opinion, a bit excessive.  Otherwise, this was perfect for what I was looking for.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. The only problem that I had was my crust getting to dark. Next time I will cover the crust. I had to bake mine longer than an hour. It truly was worth the wait. All other recipes will be thrown away!

The pie was good, but had way too many pecans.

Excellent pie! The only change I made was using chopped pecans on the bottom instead of quartered (leaving the quartered ones out altogether), then arranging the halved pecans prettily on the top. This made for just the right amount of nuts. Superb! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

I made this pie for my husband's birthday. It is AWESOME!!!!!! My husband loved it (so did I). I did use the flour, vanilla and cinnamon that another reviewer suggested. I cheated and used pre-made. Just as good. I would recommend this recipe to all.

This is the first fool proof pecan pie recipe I've ever used.  The crust recipe is worth the extra effort over a pre-made cruust!  And I'm not too hot on adding all the nuts but so far I've hhad perfect results no matter how many or few I've put in.  If I put in less nuts I add a Tblsp of flour to make it a bit sturdier.  And its also been very forgiving as to the ratio of the different corn syrups.  This is my new standard Pecan Pie!!!

I just made this pie for Christmas dinner tommorow.  I agree with the other reviews in regards to the amount of pecans.  It was a little too much.  I taste tested the pie and it was not what i hoped it would be.

What an awsome pie!!!  Not too sweet.  I am told, it's not typical pecan pie.  I use a ready made frozen crust to save time.  I also used dark corn syrup only, because the store ran out of light.  It was just as good, I imagine :)

This was a dense heavy pie.  It was good.  However, it was not like a traditional pecan pie.

My entire Thankgiving meal was made with recipes downloaded from this site. Everything was delicious, except for this pie. It was terrible - practically inedible. Soggy, nothing particularly interesting about the flavor. Perhaps I did something wrong.

For a delicious twist, I added a cup of chocolate chips into the filling, which made it really a chocolate pecan pie. It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. Pecans and chocolate, what could be better?

We felt there were too many pecans in this recipe. It was alos a little dry. We think perhaps we must have done something wrong considering all the rave reviews, but for us this wasn't a very good pie. Maybe we will try it again.
