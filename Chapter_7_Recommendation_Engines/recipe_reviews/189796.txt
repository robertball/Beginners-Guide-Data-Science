Very good recipe. I didn't have any white wine (we're red wine drinkers in this house!), so I added 2 Tbs. of lemon juice instead. Worked out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times now and I know I'll be making it again in the future. I just used a cheap white wine that I had around for cooking and thought it was still delicious so don't feel like you need the sparkling wine. I was using fresh crab meat, which I always recommend. Canned meat just doesn't compare, though if you don't have enough fresh for a whole batch I found mixing a little bit of lump meat in helps spread it out but still tastes good.

FANTASTIC!!! This was so good. I am a fan of a heavier sauce, but my hubby loves light evoo sauces. This was perfect. he loved the flavors, and I did as well. Although I always add WAY more garlic then they say to.

This recipe is incredibly light and bland. I would have given it 1 star, but because it will be so easy to jazz up in the future (like, 10x the garlic, 3x the spices and champagne!) I will give it 3. It is a good base recipe or if you have picky eaters who only like butter noodles, this is a good one to get them started on. I used shrimp and scallops instead of crab.

I'm not a big fan of crab other than well made crab cakes.  I also try to keep my meal lower fat and though I love butter, I try to keep it to a minimum.  But I thought that the recipe looked good so I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I liked it very much and will definitely be making it again.

Thanks for sharing Jeff!

I used scallops instead of crab because I had everything on hand. Wonderful!!! My husband is just starting to explore the world of seafood. Him from Colorado and me from Florida. He asked for it again a week later. A very rich recipe.

Very good, suprised how light it was. We usually go for more of a thicker, creamier sauce, but this was suprising tasty!

Excellent!  Very tasty!  Easy to make with items I had on hand.  Does not take long to make, so this can be made when crunched for time.

Good dish, however the champagne really threw off the smell and taste of the sauce, for some reason it didn't mix well with the garlic. The crab in the pasta was good. however I ended up making my own sauce instead...maybe it was my champagne selection?

This was delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 2 cloves of minced garlic.  It was very quick and easy and tasted like something you would get at a restaurant.  I used crab but I think the recipe would be great with most seafood.  My fiance inhaled it!!

Great recipe, but I had to change a few things.  I made it as directed except I didn't have any wine, so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used lemon juice.  This was great!  But when it was all finished, I just felt like it was lacking something.  So I chopped up half an onion and sliced the corn off a cob and threw that in there as well.  Then it was a bit dry and rather than add a bunch of oil, I added the starchy water from the noodles.  It was fantastic this way, plus I didn't use a ton of fatty oil.  I will be making this again!

It turned out delicious! However, next time I make it I will be making more of the liquid part of the sauce. I like my pasta a little more soupy.

This was great and fairly easy to make.  I used a wok to make sure everything heated evenly since I've burned butter so many times.  Added some diced celery and then cooked some frozen organic peas in the microwave and added them separately and they were a nice enhancement.  This was fast, easy and definitely a keeper.

Used extra garlic, white wine and a handful of chopped green onion. Shaved parmesan cheese over finished pasta. It was ok, but still fairly bland.  I will probably not make it again.

Turned out great, exactly as written.  My husband even reheated in oven (got off work late) and was still very good.  Thanks for the recipe.
