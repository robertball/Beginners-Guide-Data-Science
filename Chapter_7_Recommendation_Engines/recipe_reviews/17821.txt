This is a great cake.  I've made it twice and the second time I added about 2 tbl pineapple juice to the icing.  Let the cake cool before pouring on icing and also, let the icing cool to "warm".
Thanks Jackie !

I followed this recipe exactly except I did not have the pecans for the topping so I just left them out. It came out fantastic. It was super moist and sweet. Highly recommend. Thank you for posting.

I think this recipe is really delicious and I was very impressed with it. The frosting is more a glaze then a full blown frosting but tastes delicious. It's absolutely better the next day so make it ahead of time. Great Recipe!

Delicious cake!  It is much better the second day so make it a day before you serve it for the best flavor.  The changes that I made to lower the fat and calorie contents were halving the sugar in both the cake and topping with Splenda and using 4 oz. pureed bananas (baby food) and 4 oz. canola oil for the fat. I toasted the chopped pecans at 350 for 6 mins. to develop their full flavor.  Thanks, Jackie, for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Yum!  This cake is very moist.  The frosting is wonderful & would also be good on a German chocolate cake.  The recipe is quick & easy, too.  A definite keeper.

OK - there is not a hint of chocolate anywhere NEAR this cake and i STILL love it...it's definitely best made at least 1 day ahead, as time goes by the flavors just get brighter and sharper and it's an insanely moist, yummy cake. Everyone who tried it at my husband's company potluck just adored it, it was very different than any other dessert on the table. I didn't change a thing and will make this - exactly as written - again and again!!!!

I have to say I didn't love the day I made it. But, it really was so much better the next day. I ended up really liking this cake! I will definately make it again and I wouldn't change anything!

I made this cake last night, my friends loved it. Wasn't too sweet. But next time I want to try and use fresh ripe pineapple for more of a pineapple flavor and toast the coconut in the oven before adding it to the carnation mixture.  Will keep you posted on how that will turn out.... again, 5 stars was great and very easy to make.  Thankyou for the recipe.

First time I made this cake was for a church function.  Evidently it was well liked because I was asked for the receipe immediately.  I love it.  Except I baked it in a sheet cake pan and it took only 25 minutes and I doubled the icing receipe. I prepared the cake the night before and iced it the next morning.  I'll absolutely make this again.  I love adapting cake receipes to sheets cakes because it feeds more people and I like the texture it gives the cake.

Delicious!! My husband who doesn't even like coconut ask for seconds. A very moist, rich cake with a decadent topping. The buttery praline flavor of the icing is superb with the pineapple flavor of the cake itself. Also, very easy to make. Definately a keeper for us!!

I have made this cake twice now and both times it came out superb. It is easy to make and does become moist and more delicious the next day. I had to raise oven temp. to 375 degrees and bake for 45 minutes to get the delicious looking golden look as I did not want the icing. My husband just couldn't stop praising.

This was pretty good and not hard to make.  I used ½ brown sugar (Maiscobedo) and ½ white sugar for both the cake and the topping to give it a bit more flavor.  I will make it again, but will use more pineapple to make it more moist.  You have to cook the topping for a good 5-10 min to get it to thicken, but it will.

The first and the best cake i have ever made and it was on my husband's birthday.I was crossing my fingers while baking it coz i never baked cake till that day(happened last week).I was surprised it came out so good my husband was like oh my god!i been through with some trouble though my first pan the cake fall apart, i guess i was too excited that i didn't wait even 10 min. before taking them out of the pan and the second pan i waited and i was glad it came out alright.i made 2 layers since my cake pan is not really the standard cake pan whatsoever since i dont bake.as long as it is round i thought that will work.I have to come up with some frosting to cover the disaster and it went all right and perfect with that vanilla chocolate frosting without the chocolate.a little decoration and BAM!!!i bake me a really really good bday cake for THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!!!!I highly reccommend it.

This cake was so easy to make. I wasn't overly sweet, but actually very refreshing. I left off the frosting, as my family doesn't like too much sweet stuff, and it was great on its own. It was moist and spongy. This is a new family favorite. I cooked it in a disposable aluminum bundt pan, and it was still not done after the recommended cooking time. So I turned the heat down to 200 and then I actually forgot it in the oven for about 45 minutes. It wasn't burned but it was nicely browned and still just absolutely perfect. It's almost like it's impossible to ruin this cake.

I made this recipe as it was written and it turned out beautifully!  It is better the second day as stated.  I gave 4 stars because the pineapple taste was not very prominent. But overall fantastic.  I will be making this again.

I thought this was great!!! Not too sweet. I followed pretty much to a T. Minor adjustments on some of the sweet stuff (sugar, coconut). I also toasted the coconut first. It came out great!!! Will make again.

Excellent!  Moist and flavorful.  I made it in two round pans rather than a 9x13 and doubled the pecan topping, using half for each layer.  It was still warm when I put it together, as I was in a rush, so I turned the layers out into a similarly sized springform pan.  It broke up a bit, but I managed to reassemble it and pour topping over each layer.  I refrigerated it until ready to be eaten (the next day).  It held together perfectly and everyone loved it.  Thank you.

Light, moist cake.  The topping did not thicken as I expected, but tasted okay.

the frosting was not at all interesting and the cake was a bit gooey ...i think it would be better if the  crushed pineapple was made into a paste.
