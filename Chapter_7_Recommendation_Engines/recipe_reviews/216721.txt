I've been having a hard time rating this recipe. The frosting/filling is a definite 5 stars—wow! What a lovely chocolate mousse! The sponge cake, though…that was tough. And I mean that literally. I soaked it with the entire amount of simple syrup, but even a day later, the cake was very chewy. I think, if I tried again, I'd split the cake into three layers, rather than two; the cake is easy to slice and handles well, so it wouldn't be a problem to cut it into thinner layers. However, I think I'll probably just use a different sponge cake recipe. I love the frosting part, though, and will definitely make it again. Oh, and it goes without saying (but I'll say it): high-quality ingredients really matter in this cake.

Not stoked on this recipe. I made this recipe into cake pops. While the balls popped out of the iron easy as a dream and LOOKING fabulous, they were dry and a bit bitter tasting. I am not a fan of simple syrup glaze so that could be part of my problem. Butter, vanilla and a bit more sugar should do the trick to keep this moist and a bit sweeter. I will try again.

The cake bakes small and dry, adding the simple syrup helps but makes it too sweet. The frosting tastes good, but does not set up as firm as the picture leads you to believe. In addition, you could find a less labor intensive recipe for a similar frosting. This cake is not worth the effort. By the way 7/8 of a cup is 14 tablespoons.
