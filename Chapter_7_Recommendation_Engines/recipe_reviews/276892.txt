Excellent recipe and use of persimmons! Very tasty, and definitely worth making.  Instead of adding nutmeg (which I don't like the taste of), I substituted another 1/4 tsp. of ginger. The recipe turned out really well. It was moist and an exceptional treat.

Moist and delicious. I only cooked it an hour but next time would cook a little longer.
