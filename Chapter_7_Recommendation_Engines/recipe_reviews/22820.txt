A quick and easy breakfast...I just added some cinnamon and sugar to taste to it but it is good plain also.

This is a take on Yorkshire pudding. As another reviewer pointed out the batter needs a bit of salt. I made it in a 9 x 9 pan and it was really thin. We enjoyed it with soup and it was great for that. It took 20 minutes to bake. I can't imagine how thin this would be in a larger pan.

It's okay. The pan is way too big for that small amount of batter. It needs salt. Also this is kinda like german pancakes method.

I did exactly what the recipe calls for, all to find out I did not have a 9x13 pan so I improvised. Instead I used a glass loaf pan and cooked it about 8 minutes longer than suggested. Now I have what tastes like french toast and cut it into sticks for fun finger food!

It was okay. I used a smaller pan but it was really weird because the eggs like fried inside of the cake even though I had beaten it. It was too eggy to me. I don't think I'll make it again...sorry.

I made this recipe but I used too small a pan. it was still delicious. I love the versatility of it. I will be making it again.
