I did try this recipe. It was easy and quick! I did tweek it a bit by adding in some coriander, dry mustard, cayenne and liquid smoke. I refrigerated the meat for 30 minutes before shaping the patties.  Last but not least, I baked them on parchment for 15 - 20 minutes, flipping them after 10.  Be careful not to overcook them. Turkey dries out fast.  They were awesome. Thank you for a great recipe.

Amazing! This is exactly what I was looking for to convert turkey patties mistakenly bought into turkey sausages. I was skeptical, but the patties came out tasting exactly like sausage, even though I didn't quite have all the ingredients (ground sage instead of crushed, coriander instead of nutmeg). I will probably never buy turkey sausage again, because this is so fresh and delicious -- and easy.

My family loves this a little too much salt for me so Iâ€™ll put less next time other than the salt it was better than store bought

This  turned out wonderful. Had some Italian sausage and used this recipe to change it up. Looking forward to make it with ground turkey or chicken.

This recipe turned out very well. It was better after the seasonings were able to incorporate with time.

Too mild for my wife & me. I broke my own rule by not making and tasting one patty first to see if the recipe needed adjusting. Had I done that I would have added more of everything.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! We love these. I use pork and add the water mentioned in the notes. I use a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. This is much better than the premade store bought breakfast sausage.

I just used pork and upped the sage for a "Sage sausage" for stuffing for Thanksgiving.  But this is a fine base recipe for homemade sausage.

I made evaporated milk gravy with it! I used refined coconut oil mixed in the ground turkey with the spice. so I would have some yummy fat to add to the gravy!
