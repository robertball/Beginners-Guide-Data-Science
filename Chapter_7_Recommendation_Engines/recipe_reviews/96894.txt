I really liked this recipe, but I changed a few things.  First, I doubled the amount of artichokes and put more chickpeas compared to the amount of water.   Also I didnt have chili flakes so I used hot chili powder, and I didn't put sage.  And b/c I wanted to thicken up the stew a bit, i tossed in a 1/4-1/2 cup of lentils. And I added more lemon juice.  And I used a vegetable boullion cube.  It came out really tasty!  the taste of artichokes with the lemon and tomatoes and chickpeas and chili, really good.

More of a soup than a stew, but a good combo, and an easy easy meal to make. It's all going to come down to the quality of your stock, so if you truly use low-sodium chicken broth, be prepared to enhance it a bit.  I substituted rosemary to make it greek-ish, like chicken rosamarina.  I agree with Katherine's instincts to add some pasta, orzo, barley or something to thicken it a bit.  If you are not vegetarian, this would be awesome with some chicken thighs thrown in.  Next time I will add a few sultanas - I think this is a good basic that could benefit from some added zing other than red peppers.  I'll definitely make this again, as I always seem to buy too many chick peas.

This was very good. I added more lemon juice than called for (1-2 Tbs) and added about a cup and a half of cooked cheese tortellini at the very end. I will be making it again.

This has a wonderful flavor. I doubled the lemon juice as suggested. I also left out the red pepper flakes. I didn't have sage so I substituted it with rosemary.  This is not thick, like a stew but is still hearty. It reminded me of a Thanksgiving dish.

We loved this.  I would describe it as a soup, not a stew.  Broth was thickened just right from the starch in the chickpeas.  Made very few changes:  2 tsp, not Tbsp of oil to reduce fat/calories; 1/2 tsp dried sage rather than fresh; 14.5 oz canned, diced tomatoes (drained) rather than fresh.  Using fat-free, less sodium chicken broth, it didn't need any additional salt or pepper.  Thanks for a great new recipe.

This is incredibly delicious! Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a large can of whole tomatoes, and made the broth using the juice drained from the can and chicken oxo. Perfect!

I love artichokes and just knew I had to try this when I read it. I used a 398ml can of diced tomatoes (liquid and all) instead of the specified tomatoes as I didn't think they'd taste as good this time of year. My can of chickpeas was a little large, but oh well. :) It turned out super good and I gave some to my sister who loved it and passed the recipe onto my mom who made it and also loved it.  I added some quartered white mushrooms to the last bowl when I heated it up and they were super good, so I may add them next time. I also cut back on the chicken stock as suggested by other reviewers. I found it didn't make a lot, so next time I will double the recipe.

Unbelievably easy and SO delish!!! I used marinated (in the small 6 0z jars) artichokes, and I think it gave a great flavor.  Fantastic mix of fresh ingredients.  This will become a weekly meal at our house.  GREAT for those watching their cholesterol - all wonderful ingredients with little or no cholesterol.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks to the other reviews, I didn't use a quart of liquid and instead used a can of vegetable broth.  Was delicious.  Other little modifications - added some rice, omitted sage and instead used some poultry seasoning.  Will make again.

This is my favorite stew on the planet...seriously.  I generally double the artichokes and the garbanzo beans and use two cans of diced tomatoes.  The combination of sage, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes is the key!!!  I have made this with and without carrots and both are equally delicious.  I have also made the stew and then used it to make risotto by draining the liquid a little at a time into the arborio rice and then adding the veggies when the rice is about 2/3 of the way done cooking.  This is one of my favorite recipes of all time.  THANKS!

I've made this recipe twice now. It's one of those great recipes that's based on items you probably already have in your pantry, most of which are inexpensive, so it's a great 2-days-till-payday type of recipe.I've altered this a little bit each time.

The first time I made it, I added a bit of quinoa and used canned diced tomatoes. I added fresh sage, but also some dried time. I doubled the artichokes, chick peas, lemon juice, and chili flakes. It was good, but my husband wanted it with more spice. 

Today, my husband is sick and he wanted something to clear out his sinuses so I made it very spicy by putting in 1 teaspoon of chili flakes and 1 teaspoon of mashed, roasted Thai red chili paste (homemade). I used about 1/2-3/4 teaspoon Italian herbs and about 1 teaspoon dried parsley because I didn't have fresh sage (or dried). I also used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added some leftover rotisserie chicken meat. 

I find it to be very thick--very much a chunky stew--even with adding a full quart of broth, but perhaps that is due to the extra ingredients that I add.

Flavorful, but definitely more of a soup.  The carrots added a nice firm chunky texture that was needed.  The colors were pretty.  The artichoke overwhelmed the flavors in the soup though.

Really good recipe.  I followed other suggestions and left out the sage, added 1/4 c lentils, 2 T lemon juice and used only 1 can chicken broth.  Didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  Will definitely make this one again!

I had one artichoke hanging out in my fridge and I didn't know what to do with it! I also had some leftover canned chickpeas and corn from two dinners back. This soup was delicious and it's easily modified. I didn't have any carrots so I used the corn. WOW. Really hearty and it had a great texture. Extremely satisfying:) One change I made was to add about 2 tbs. green onions, 1 tbsp FRESH cilantro, and 1 tsp dried parsley. We also sprinkled dill and parmesean cheese on top before we ate it. I would give it five if it wasn't kind of bland without the modifications. With some subtle flavor changes- five stars. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. Doubled it and added about a cup of barley to soak up some of the liquid, as per some of the other reviewers' suggestions. Very easy to make.

This was delicious! I used 2 tomatoes and a can of peeled tomatoes because that's what I had. I also used about 2 tablespoons lemon juice and only 1 1/3 cup broth. It came out with a stew consistency, and I served it over brown rice. It was so quick and easy to make, and my husband and I both found it very tasty. Into the rotation this goes!

Wow, this is so good! I have to make a few changes due to personal preference, mainly: omit the sage (really dislike it) and use fresh thyme and oregano instead; also leave out the red pepper flakes to make it toddler-friendly. Don't usually have lemon pepper, so just up the amount of fresh juice to half of a large lemon. Finally, I use canned tomatoes (but look forward to making it with fresh once my garden starts producing!) I serve it over quinoa or rice to soak up the delicious broth. I think it would be good with chicken breasts too (whole or sliced.) Great Summer recipe for when you don't want to turn on the oven, but also very hearty and comforting when the weather is cooler. Thanks, Stellar Jay!

I didn't really care for this much.  It wasn't that it was bland, exactly, but the flavors didn't mesh well together for me.  I pretty much followed the recipe, with the exception that I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh (maybe that was the difference?) because that is what I happened to have.  I dutifully ate it anyway, because I hate wasting food, but I didn't really enjoy it. Not terrible, but I don't think I will make it again.

This was wonderfully flavorful! Who would have known artichokes would be so good in stew. I did make a few minor adjustments. I used frozen artichoke hearts (thawed and chopped) and 4 rounded teaspoons of instant boullian with 2 cups of water instead of the chicken broth. I also used fresh garden tomatoes and added some fresh chopped cilantro. It was a wonderful way to pick up my wet rainy day! Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely make again.

Very flavorful, I agree with the others it is more of a soup than a stew.  I will definately make again.  It was so easy.  I couldn't find fresh sage at the store so used basil instead.  I took the hint of others and added some orzo but not too much cause I didn't want the orzo so that it wouldn't be too overpowering.  I also had some mushrooms that I had to use up so I threw them in the soup as well.

I found that this soup was lacking in flavor. It might be something that is good on the side of a bigger course but... alone it causes a headache

I'm sorry, but we just didn't care for this.  I was determined to eat it anyway and I just couldn't.  I followed the recipe exactly and there was nothing wrong with it, the flavors just didn't taste good together for us.  Thanks anyway.

I was looking for a way to use leftover artichoke and found this recipe. I used canned tomato, chicken oxo and water. I also added about 2 cups of spinach and extra garlic. I'm a big slat lover so I used a more oxo at the end to get the flavour I wanted. I wasn't all that impressed with it the night I made it, but the next day it was really yummy.

Really delicious soup.  And wonderful to have something different.  I added a pound of crumbled ground chicken (ground lamb would also be a nice addition, if you like lamb), a 4oz can of sliced black olives, and then served with feta on top.  Really dynamic flavors here.  This will become a staple in out house. :)

Easy to make and good flavor.  Definitely more of a soup than a stew - next time I think I would use less broth to make it thicker.

excellent! i used six strawberry tomatoes instead of the roma tomatoes, and vegetable broth instead of chicken. i also added some couscous to make it a bit heartier. turned out very well.

This is so good.   I never thought that I would like Chicapees.   I'm going to make this again today!

 Instead of Roma tomatoes, I use Rotel for a nice spicy kick!

Man was this good! And so easy. I just changed it by adding a little dollop of prepared pesto instead of the sage and a little parmesan on top. Comfort food! And it was more like six servings.

I love this soup! The lemon juice adds an extra element that just makes the flavors pop! Plus, I love anything with artichokes, so this is an instant favorite. Easy to make into a vegetarian soup, too.

Great recipe that is as easy as it's author says it is.  I altered it to please my picky kids. Left out the red pepper flakes because they hate heat (mommy loves it though) also omitted the sage and used Italian seasoning instead.  My can of artichokes already had lemon added so I didn't add more. Pasta definitely makes it a more complete meal, I added 1 and 1/2 cups. Veggie broth was an easy swap for chicken since we are vegan. Everyone had seconds and enjoyed it even the cranky teen who proclaimed it her new favorite soup.

This was tasty! Went for several suggestions: extra lemon juice (3 tbsp) b/c I love lemon, canned tomatoes, diced chicken, and did about 3 cups chicken broth. Also did extra red pepper b/c I like spice, added mushrooms, and added some lemon pepper. Was yummy and tangy! My husband even liked it even tho he's not crazy about chickpeas. Will def make again!

I made this pretty much how it was written and it came out great.  All I did different was double the lemon juice like the other reviewers mentioned.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Im not giving stars since I used butter beans instead of chickpeas. I would give it a 4 based on how I made it which was without oil, and with dried sage, and canned diced tomatoes. Mine turned out like a thick stew because by the time the carrots soften most of the liquid has evaporated. All in all it was a hearty vegetarian dish, but was a little boring.

I liked this recipe for its originality and that it's healthy. It wasn't my favorite, but my husband thought it was very good and asked me to make again. I served it with Greek spanokopita triangles (purchased frozen)

This was quick and easy and VERY yummy.  I served it with sandwiches of scallion cream cheese for a quick "tea type" lunch thrown together at the last minute.  The lemon really makes the dish!

This is such an easy and delish recipe!!  Truly one of my favorites.  When rushed or lazy, I use Hunt's diced tomatoes and it's just as flavorful. I've even added diced chicken for a twist.

A nice little basic recipe. I added extra lemon juice, and cherry tomatoes instead of normal tomatoes. Lovely!

More of a soup than a stew - but the taste is fabulous!  I doubled the lemon for personal taste... very tangy.
