This is a great recipe!However, DO NOT cover the potatoes when you refrigerate them ~ they dry out better when not covered. This makes it easier to roll and you won't need as much flour (no chance of getting tough lefse). I also rice the potatoes before they go into the 'frig.

I had a lot of fun attempting to make lefse.  I admit it was my first time and struggled to make them thin round patties.  I ended up dropping the a spoon full on the griddle, used spoons and flour to flatten right there.  I need to give it another try but I admit, loved the final product. Very tasty.  It actually kind of reminded me of elephant ears at fairs :)

Taste from my childhood! Growing up in North Dakota, my family was surrounded by Scandinavians. Even though we were Irish and German, my great-grandmother made this dish every Christmas. Such a treat! This was just as good as hers.

I decided to try a new lefse recipe. I found this one to be really sticky. I had to use more flour than usual so it would not stick. I was frustrated

My fiancé is Norwegian and we are moving there to Ski (outside of Oslo and pronounced Shee) in April so I've been trying to perfect some recipes to use when I get there! They frequently use these to wrap around their version of hot dogs like a bun too! Thanks for an easy recipe! Skål!!

Great lefse.  I only made one log at a time and left the potatoes, cream, salt, butter mixture in the 'fridge to stay cold.  I mixed 3 c. potatoes with 1 c. flour and made a log for rolling out.  Pastry board and a lefse turner truly help with a thin roll-out.  As the lefse stack-up, I made sure to turn them over so that they continue to steam evenly and stay soft.
