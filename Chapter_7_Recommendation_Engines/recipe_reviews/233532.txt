First time eating tabbouleh and it was great!  Did not add mint but I did add 1 clove of crushed garlic to the dressing.  Only added 1 cup of parsley and the whole thing was delicious!!  Will make again!!

I added grated carrots and small red, yellow and orange bell peppers instead of the green.

MMMMMMMmmMMmMMmmmmMm! So Fresh and tastey! The perfect vegetarian main or side dish! It had lovely fresh flavors and the green pepper gave it the ideal about of crunch. I also threw in some chopped cucumber that I had in the fridge. I didnt measure anything out, just cooked 2dl of bulgur up and chopped a ton of the suggested veggies. Only used half the dressing as it was already evenly coated by that point. Next time I will add chopped fresh chili peppers for a kick. :) Thanks so much for sharing!!!

AMAZING! The little bit of mint really brings out the flavour of this dish. Iâ€™m a big fan of tabbouleh, and this is how I will be making it from now on.

Added the garlic clove.  Mint is hit and miss at my store so no mint, but ordered some freeze dried for next time. I didn't follow the proportions but eyeballed it close.  You can't really mess this up.  I love it.

I have three boys so I'm always looking for healthy, easy, inexpensive recipes.  This one hit all three of those criteria.  I know it's a keeper when the whole family loves it!  My 16 year old even asked if I'd make this again the next day.  Only thing I changed was to mix a few extra fresh herbs from my herb garden in.  Great way to use up the tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and herbs from the garden.

This was pretty good but missing something in my opinion. It is a good basic recipe that you can easily change up by adding more veggies if desired which I would do next time. It tasted better after it sat in the refrigerator. You must use a good quality olive oil as the taste of olive oil comes through strong. I think next time I will reduce the olive oil. I will make it again but will change it up to suit my tastes. Very happy to have a recipe like this.

I left out several ingredients due to personal preference and what I had on hand (chili pepper, seasoned salt, bell peppers, cukes, green onions) and it was still good.  Next time I'll include the green onions at least.

Just finished making this dish. Very good! The only thing I did not have was the fresh mint. It didn't matter. Refreshingly tasty!
