I made this for my step-daughters grad party and total strangers asked me for the recipe. I have to admit I didnt taste any at the party, but the next day I ate some leftovers and it was fantastic.  I made a few alterations; rotini instead of sea shell, yellow or red pepper in place of green, 3oz. can of olives, 3 green onions, and instead of the dressing provided in the recipe- I used Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinegrette.  It was a huge hit.  The key was to mix everything together but the balsamic dressing and let it sit for a while.  In my case, 24 hours before I poured the Newman's Own on it.  Really yummy!  One reviewer suggested Pepperchini's, which I think would be a great addition.  I didnt think this cost much to make, and I dont understand why people think there is so much chopping.  That is a part of cooking!  This is an excellent recipe and one woman at our party said it was going to be her pasta salad recipe from now on. Excellent! (Edited 5/9/2010)

EXCELLENT!!  I would suggest not substituting the asiago cheese, it has such a distinct flavor and it adds so much to the flavor of the salad. I did use a three cheese vinigrette that contained the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, seasonings, and parmesan cheese. It made it so much easier,  and saves the cost of having to buy individual ingredients that you may not already have on hand. I did add additional salt and pepper, and a shake of red pepper for zest.  TIP: If you gently squeeze the tomatoe after slicing off top before chopping, it will remove the excess juice and seeds so that the salad doesn't get watered down as it sits.  This is one of the best pasta salads that I have ever made. I am so happy to be adding it to my collection.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Really good.  There was not a bite left after the cookout.  I used fussili pasta, I used halved grape tomatoes. I added chopped artichokes, I omitted the pepperoni and doubled the salami, I used a combination of brine cured olives, I added finely sliced red onion, I roasted the red peppers, omitted the oregano and used fresh parsley.  Per the suggestion of a couple other reviewers, I used a little less oil, but I think I will use all of it next time.  I liked the asiago cheese, but I think next time I will try real mozzarella instead.    I will certainly make this again.

I've probably made this now at least 10x!!  it's a HUGE hit (in fact, friends request me to bring it to parties).  so figured it should comment!

i've leared a few hints from making it so many times..i've now "perfected it". 1)***THIS IS BEST MADE THE NIGHT BEFORE!!***this truly is the secret!  the flavors need time to develop and incorporate!  2) i use 1lb. multi-colored rotini.  3) i use 1 box cherry tomatoes halfed.  4) 1/2c. oil was too much for me!! - i cut down to 1/4 C - and like 3Tbl of zesty italian dressing.  5) i add a handfull of chopped banana peppers. 6) i add 3 green onions finely sliced. 7)  POUR 1/2 the dressing on the night before - and allow to "marinate" overnight in fridge.  then add the remaining dressing right before serving!

Great recipe, however the flavor can get lost easily.  If you add all of the ingredients except the balsamic before refridgerating, the flavor of the Italian dressing comes out a lot better.  Then just add the balsamic just before serving.

This was a wonderful dish and easy to prepare.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and made both the salad & dressing the night before.  I mixed them together two hours prior to serving.  
I also scaled the recipe down to six servings. For four people (two of them big men) it was still way too much.  The antipasto does hold up well for left overs.  
This dish is perfect to bring to parties & picnics, but be prepared to drop some cash.  The ingredients are not cheap, but the compliments from your guests/friends make it well worth it.

Yo, if you don't like pasta salads, then you'll love this one!!  If you love pasta salads, then you'll lose your mind behind this one!!!!  This one was so flavorful.  If you like bland foods, then don't try this one at all.  The Asiago cheese added a different, but very pleasing taste to it.  It definitely tastes better the second day.  Allow dressing to be absorbed overnight.  I also added two italian dressing packets.  Next time I make it, I'll add some more meat to it......but that's strictly my preference cause I love meat.  Definitely will make again.

This is a great recipe. I sometimes add artichokes and/or garbanzo beans. Substituting shredded mozzarella for the asiago is also quick and delicious. I also like to use grape tomatoes or cherry tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes.It is a meal all by itself, especially on warm summer nights.

Absolutely easy and delicious. It makes a ton so is handy for an anytime snack over a long weekend. :)
Taking suggestions from other reviewers.. i changed the following:
1. Used less olive oil.
2. Used Kraft Italian dressing.
3. Roasted some red peppers, de-skinned, julienned and added those.
4. Added cherry tomatoes.
5. Added feta cheese instead of asiago.
6.  Added red onions and some garlic cloves (whole).

Definitely will make again! Thanks!

This is my family's favorite pasta salad!  The dressing is so easy and tastes so good!  I usually omit the green pepper and replace with green onions, use 4 diced Roma tomatoes or substitute grape tomatoes, and even more sliced black olives.  If you can't find Asiago, diced Provolone also works wonderfully!  Also, I tend to cut back just a bit on the oregano- 1 1/2 tablespoons is more to my taste.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Dayna!

This Antipasto Salad was lip smacking delicious. Naturally, I made my usual changes to the recipe to suit our personal tastes. I didn't use pepperoni, since we just don't like it. We used 1/4 lb. each salami and provalone, thinly diced. Added a 6 oz. container finely shredded asiago, romano and parmesan cheeses. Used 3 small peppers; red, green and orange, added 3 bunches sliced scallions and used 2 pckg. cherry tomatoes cut in half (will use 3 next time.) Cut the oregano by half, added a tsp. granulated garlic and used fresh flat leaf parsley. I mixed everything together and let it sit in the fridge till we were ready to eat... about 4 hours. Added a good splash more balsamic vinegar before serving. I loved the way using the shredded cheese, as opposed to chunks, resulted in a burst of cheese flavor in every pasta shell. This was soooooo good, I even ate the olives... a first for me. Thank you so very much, Dayna!

This is a great recipe as it is written and easily adjustable to your family's preferences. I make this frequently for dinner at home and for social gatherings. The most important is to not overcook the pasta, or it will get very mushy and fall apart when you toss the salad. I always use bottled salad dressing unless I have some all ready made I need to use... there are so many good bottled dressings and in my opinion homemade dressings need to sit at least a full day before they have full flavor. I prepare the add in ingredients and marinate them in dressing while I prepare the pasta. I keep the pasta separate and don't mix into the salad until an hour before I serve, so that it doesn't bloat up in all the dressing. Add in any veggies you like, artichoke, onion, zucchini, squash... very versatile!

This is a delicious antipasto salad.  Probably one of the best ones I have made or eaten.  Very flavorful.  Again, I think this is one of those recipes that it pays to use good quality ingredients.  The dressing is fabulous and I used a very good syrupy balsamic vinegar for it.  Thanks for sharing.  Took this to a volleyball tournament and it was gobbled up quick.  For anyone who is wondering asiago cheese is a cross between parm and moz.  Not as soft as moz, but nutty in taste like parm.

UPDATE: I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS A SECOND GO, ALMOST 5 YEARS AFTER I INTIALLY IT. :) IT WAS MUCH BETTER THIS TIME AROUND. HERE'S WHAT I DID: A) USED CHEESE-FILLED TORTELLINI (I THINK I'LL GO BACK TO USING ROTINI THO...), B) OMMITTED THE FRESH PEPPERS FOR CHOPPED ROASTED RED PEPPERS, C) ADDED HALF OF A THINLY SLICED RED ONION, D) USED ASIAGO THIS TIME AND E) SUBBED A MARINATED GREEN OLIVE & ARTICHOKE DELI SALAD FOR THE BLACK OLIVES CALLED FOR. ALTHOUGH MORE EXPENSIVE, IT WAS DIVINE!!! This was "OK." Although my friend liked this more than I did, she wasn't all that impressed either. NOTE: This makes a LOT (I halved everything and still ended up with a TON!) and unfortunately, doesn't lend itself well to leftovers (my salad dried up quickly - despite covering my bowl, I needed to add additional vinaigrette the next day). This is also very expensive to prepare (the meat and cheese are pricey), but for a special splurge, I think the $'s spent are well worth it. To speed pre, I subbed small grape tomatoes for whole ones. I also omitted the red bell pepper and subbed tri-colored rotini pasta for shells (both personal preferences). Because Asiago cheese was so pricey, I opted for a less expensive (fresh) mozzarella instead. I found that using a GOOD quality olive oil and balsamic for the vinaigrette REALLY makes all the difference, so PLEASE don't skimp on those. All in all, this was decent, but I will need to make several changes if I were to make it again. Thanks anyways, Dayna! :-)

This was a really good pasta salad and a nice change from the usual. Asiago cheese has a very different flavour, so I would suggest tasting it before putting it in. If it's too strong for your taste, you can reduce the amount. I made this for my mom's 50th birthday and it was a hit!

This is the best pasta salad I have ever made. I have brought it to three parties and I always end up writing down the recipe for everyone. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I added was a can of sliced artichoke hearts. I had trouble finding asiago cheese at my grocery store and then I found that they sell it in the deli. I ask them to slice two half inch thick slices for me equal to half a pound and then all I have to do is dice it. I wouldn't want to use any other cheese, the flavor of the asiago really adds to this recipe. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was excellent!  I cannot say enough for the dressing - an earlier reviewer said "its not what you put in your salad, its what you put on it".  That was absolutely correct - the dressing really makes the salad.  I added artichoke hearts, used more cheese, used roasted red peppers and changed to grape tomatoes as was suggested.  I also used fresh italian parsley.  I made the dressing a couple of days early and made the salad the day before.  As was suggested I mixed part of the dressing with the salad the day before serving and let the flavors blend.  Definitely take this out of the frig a few hours before serving and let the salad warm to room temp.  This salad was gobbled down and requests were made to take home any leftovers above anything on the table.  Leftovers - Ha!

This is time consuming with a long list of ingredients - and worth every second of preparation and every item in your grocery cart. The dressing is so good - I use white balsamic vinegar so the dressing doesn't turn the pasta brown, but that's about the only thing I recommend changing. And sometimes I use sharp Provolone instead of Asiago cheese but that's just a personal preference.

WARNING! This pasta is addictive! I made it for my Icelandic in-laws a few days ago and really liked it. I just made it again today. I was not that excited about the ingredients first, thought nothing special but when mixed together, they worked really well and the taste is amazing. 
I followed Mrs K recommendation, I added Balsamic vinaigrette instead of the dressing and I added green onions, used fusili pasta. I could not find Asiago cheese in Iceland so I substituted with some kind of Icelandic mild cheese that tastes a bit like Mozzarella cheese. Do not omit any of the ingredients. This is such a good and easy salad to make. I will make that very often. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Delicious! I tripled the recipe for a party and I only used 1 c. oil and 1/2 c. balsamic and it was PLENTY. I can't imagine how soggy it would have been if I had tripled the dressing, too. I also I used provolone and mozzarella because I thought they would be more appealing to the crowd than asiago. I think I'm going to stick with a spicy salami than genoa next time. The pepperoni stood out better than the salami.

Followed the recipe exactly (tho with tricolor rotini) but made it the day before and added a bit of olive oil and balsamic right before serving to moisten it back up a bit.  Went over really well at the birthday party it was for and I was asked for the recipe a few times.  It's a keeper.  And don't switch to a wimpier cheese - the asiago works really well.

I have made this a couple of times now, and it has always disappeared fast. The first time I stuck to the recipe and it was great - but even better the second day (the few leftovers I had). I would recommend making it a day ahead of time and letting the flavors meld in the fridge overnight. The second time I didn't have asiago cheese so I used feta, and I liked it even more.

This was the first pasta salad I have ever made. I was really pleased! I took the advice of som others and used salad dressing to save time, and wasn't thrilled by the dressing...I think next time I'll try it just how the recipe said to make it. Also, the dressing taste got milder after a day in the fridge and was great.

Don't be silly, try this salad!! It's so amazing! The dressing is to die for. Here's what I added to make it more like my Italian family's famous antipasto platters: diced artichoke hearts, sliced pepperoncini peppers, sliced red onion, sliced ham, and sliced provolone. You can add anything you'd like to this recipe, it is always good!

This is SO SO SO tasty!!  I made a few changes:

Instead of seashell pasta I used Campanelle.  Instead of plain, canned black olives I used the jarred gourmet mixed olives (except I accidentally bought them with the pits...cutting all those olives off the pits too a while!).  I cubed the salami instead of chopping it.  I used pre-sliced pepperoni and used Sargento brand Bistro Blends shredded cheese in the Mozzarella and Asiago with roasted garlic variety.  I also sliced grape tomatoes instead of the large ones..to me they're just sweeter and tastier.

For the dressing, I followed the directions exactly but I added all the ingredients to one of those salad dressing shakers (for homemade dressing) and shook it all up.  I then refrigerated it for an hour while the salad itself was being refrigerated.  Then, after an hour, I poured the dressing over the salad and mixed it all up.  I covered it and served it the next day at a church function.  I was so yummy!!  It's best to make a head of time so the flavors develop.

I'm going to make this again for my daughter's birthday party in a couple of weeks!!!!!

Wow, this was great! I am not a big fan of your standard mayo-y or Italian dressing pasta salads. The balsamic vinegar gave it a great taste. As a nice Italian girl, I loved it. And my all-American boyfriend did too! Can't wait to tell my mom about it!

Very delicious Pasta Salad. I made some slight changes. I used the Seashell Pasta, I also sliced some Pepperoncini Peppers, and chopped some marinated Artichoke Hearts in it. I used Red Wine Vinegar instead of Balsamic in the recipe and "Upped" the amount of the dressing. My lady and I attended a State Park Potluck Luncheon since we are volunteers and the Pasta Salad was a HUGE hit. I added the dressing 15 minutes before it was served and it was nice and moist and the Fresh Olive Oil and Red Wine Vinegar made it perfect. A keeper for sure..Thanks!

This salad is addictive! After making it, I really didn't like it very much. I tasted another bite a few hours later and it was better. A few hours after that... wow! The flavors really needed time to come together. I used a blend of shredded Italian cheeses, since I had it on hand. I also sliced up a few pepperoncinis and added those. Turned out really well. Took it to a potluck tonight and it was a hit! Thank you, will make this again.

I love Antipasto Salad.  We have it at least a couple times a month.  I will add whatever I have in my fridge and will frequently throw in some left over chicken if I have it.  I have learned what you put in your salad is not nearly as important as what you put on your salad.  Make sure you use a good quality dressing or better yet, make your own.

Fabulous!! Took a little time to chop everything... I used cherry tomatoes, added 1 jar of marinated artichoke hearts(drained and chopped), and I will add roasted red peppers next time.  My family inhaled this salad....delicious!!

This is a great tasting pasta salad.  Very filling, great dish to take to a bbq or get together.  Fabulous!  I added about three cloves of pressed garlic, which really did the trick.

This is a wonderful salad.  I throw in what I like and use summer sausage, fresh mozzarella, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts and the red and green peppers.  I used bow tie pasta, or basically whatever I have.. never fails a hit every time!  This is a staple in my refrigerator now!

A lot of chopping since I doubled the recipe.  I never had asiago cheese before, wasn't very fond of the flavor.  But I will make this again with less cheese.

This recipe is great, I made it for my son't first birthday party - it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe and had way too much for about 30 people (but it is good leftover).  I decreased the oregano a little, it just seemed like too much.  I got lots of compliments and have made it again since.

Nice change from the mayo based pasta salads. I use Barilla PLUS pasta (to make healthier) I omitted the olives & green pepper, due to personal preference. Used quartered cherry tomatoes and low-fat pepperoni. 
I dont use genoa either, I think it overpowers the other flavors & makes greasy. I add pepperoni and the cheese right before serving, but after pasta has chilled a couple hours. I have made this several times and use different cheeses. Gorgonzola crumbles are a great change, or bleu cheese or even cubed romano! The Asiago is calls for is very yummy too. Jarred roasted red peppers and/or sun-dried tomatoes are fabulous in this too. (I Have done both) Will make again!

MMM!  really good, I made this recipe yesterday and served it today, because many others share that it's a lot better the next day (I completely agree).  I just replace some ingredients for convinience: Instead of the olive oil and the dry italian seasoning, I used Kraft zesty Italian Dressing..., the whole small bottle, and mozzarella cheese instead of the assiago. Letting the salad marinade for a day rally brings out the flavor.  I also used 3 tablespoons of parmesano chees, not only one, and I did put some salt and pepper, that really help.  A complete succes, even with the guys and in-laws.  An advice, let the pasta cool completely before mix the other ingredient.

I made this recipe my own by making some variations or adding some items.  Depending on what I had in the kitchen or what my guests preferred.  
I used tri-color pasta wheels and/or rotini.  I added fresh mozzarella, provolone and proscuttio.  When I can, it's nice to use yellow and orange bell peppers in addition to the red and green.  It was more beautiful to leave the olives whole and I tried to use a variety of greek or italian olives. This also made it easier for people in my family who don't like olives to pick them out.  When possible, I used fresh herbs rather than dried.  
With my additions I always doubled dry packages of dressing and the balsamic dressing I added to taste.
I left vegetables, cheeses and meats chunkier or whole so it was more like Antipasto.  The tri-colored pasta, additional types of vegetables made the salad more colorful and appealing to the eye.
I have made this salad the day before and it made a more flavorful salad.  The balsamic dressing is always added just before serving.
This modified recipe has been a major hit at parties or picnics.  Have fun with it and experiment!
So many people want the recipe for this one after they've tried it!

I made this salad for a afternoon cruise on our boat.  My guests were very complimentary.  It was very attractive and quite delicious. Next time I will use 'chunked' salami, pastrami and cheeses.  I added artichokes.

I make this at the beginning of the week and we eat it all week for lunch.  I have made it both with and without the meat.  I personally prefer it without, but when made with meat I use all Genoa salami. I use a pint of grape tomatoes sliced in half and put them through a salad spinner to get all the seeds and ooze out. I took the other recommendations and pour all the dressing except for the balsamic on the night before. For some reason, when I make this without meat I need to cut the oregano and parsley in half or it becomes too overwhelming. The ingredients can be prepped in the time it takes for the pasta to boil and makes for a weeks worth of yummy inexpensive lunches.

Everyone loved this. I took the advice and made the night before. Mixed everything together except the dressing. Instead of making the dressing I used Newmans Own Light Balsamic. Turned out excellent.

Everybody loved it!  Believe it or not, I couldn't find asiago (well, I found it in the hugest ever chunk and wasn't wanting to buy THAT much) - so I used mozerella, and italian blend (which contained asiago).  I made it all the night before, including the olive oil mixture, but I didnt mix them together until an hour before.  Although, I did drizzle in some olive oil with the salad the night before, just to keep things from getting sticky.  It was deeelish, in fact, I think I'll have some more now.

Great Antipasto. I suggest substituting the dried herbs for fresh ones for more authentic taste

I followed everything as instructed for this recipe except that I used garden style corkscrew pasta.  I was a BIG hit with my church group.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

VERY tasty pasta salad. I didn't add the black olives (hubby hates them) and I added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts... very good! Definitely tastes even better the next day!

FABULOUS!  I made a few changes.  I used only 1 Tbsp of oregano.  Also used only 1/2 cup of olive oil and then a 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar to cut down on the fat.  In my opinion, you should NOT use white vinegar instead of balsamic!  There's a huge taste difference between the two!!!  In fact, I recommend using a well aged balsamic for optimum flavor.  This pasta salad got rave reviews at the two parties I brought it to this weekend!  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it for myself and a friend I work with.  After bringing it for lunch one day, several people asked about it, and I gave out some recipes.  It has been a hit with everyone who has made it.  I will make it again and again and again!  I substituted mozzarella for the asiago, and added cilantro.  This salad is the bomb!

Okay, so I'm in Germany and I didn't have access to all of the ingredients but it turned out awesome..I sliced up some salami and used feta cheese instead of the asiago..I also did what other people suggested which is to add a little dressing to get the tastes flowing the night before.  Awesome!

I never leave reviews, but I just signed up for an account specifically to review this recipe.  I've been making this pasta salad for several years now and I always get rave reviews.  I DO NOT CHANGE A THING.  Nothing.  I make it exactly as written.  Seasoned chefs, grandmas with decades of cooking experience, an older gentleman who had hated pasta salad his whole life until trying this, even my kids...everyone LOVES it.  I have given this recipe out more than any other recipe I've ever made. It's also great as leftovers.  It does make a large quantity, so it's great for a party or potluck, and also helps offset the cost. (I've never personally found it expensive to make, but I have read that comment in other reviews.  Asiago cheese is a little pricier than others, but it makes the recipe special).  I normally use plum tomatoes, but have made it with grape and others and it's just as good.  Anytime I make this for an occasion I always set some aside for later.  It's awesome.  Thank you for a recipe that makes me look good.  ;-)

Great recipe.  This is the second recipe from this site that I have taken to an office contest and won first prize.  Everyone loved it.  The only things I did slightly different was to make the pasta and dressing and let them sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I combined them the next morning and it was about five hours before it was eaten. I tasted it right after I combined them and disliked the strong taste of olive oil.  It was all a perfect mix after it sat for a while. I highly recommend this recipe.  Experiment with it until you get something outstanding.

This is my "go to" pasta salad.  I made it last for my son's birthday BBQ.  It made a lot, yet there was hardly any left...a truly good sign it was a hit!  (And my Mother-In-Law stole the leftovers.)  When I make it, I let it marinate overnight so that the flavors can meld.

Too oily I thought. Was a nice change of pace, but if I did it over I would have used about 2/3 of the oil.

LOVE this recipe!! Made for a BBQ at my house and it was  a huge hit. I prepared the night before including the dressing which I think makes a huge difference. I let the pasta sit with the Italian dressing mix overnight. Next day 2 hours before serving I poured half of the dressing and placed back in the fridge. Did not really have to use all of the dressing. I thought it might be a little too oily so just watch as you pour before serving. Thank you so much for sharing. This is a keeper.

WE USE THIS FOR OUR TAIL-GATE. A EASY FIX FOR ANYONE. ADD OR OMIT ANY INGREDIENT YOU LIKE OR DISLIKE. USE ANY PASTA YOU LIKE. WE' VE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS. I DRESS THIS SALAD, AN HOUR BEFORE W/ 1/3 OF DRESSING. THEN REDRESS JUST BEFORE SERVING. I SERVE THIS IN LETTUCE CUPS.

This is an excellent pasta salad.  I agree with other reviewers that this is best served the next day.  The asiago cheese with the balsamic vinegar, salami, and olives make an excellent flavor combination.  Don't skip the asiago!  That unique bold flavor really makes this recipe stand out.  I followed the recipe using the shell pasta and cherry tomatoes along with roasted red bell peppers and kept everything else as written, except for using extra parmesan.  Next time I think I would add extra asiago cheese.

I am not crazy about the dressing. I really disliked the dried oregano and parsley in it. I thought it was just too much. 
I would make the salad again but not with the dressing that was given here.

This was very good, I omitted the olives and added skiced pepperoccinis (personal preference). I did not make the dressing, instead I used Kraft Parmesean Basil Vinagerette, it was very easy and tasted great!

Family was TOTALLY impressed with this antipasto salad.  It is delicious!   I come from a 100% Italian family, and no one in my family ever makes this for whatever reason.  It was a HUGE hit, saying it was better than any antipasto they have ever had, including those restaraunts in the North End in Boston.  Thats a pretty big compliment!

Wow!  What a fabulous spin on the "traditional" pasta salad.  This will be a sure fire hit for any summer get-together!  I made it according to the recipe, but when I was at the deli, I asked my butcher to cut the salami and pepperoni into 1/2 inch slices, and the Asiago cheese into 1/3 inch slices.  Then, when I went home to chop it, I made sure to have bite size pieces.  That way my guests would get delicious chunks of meat and vegetables making it a hearty pasta salad, and boosted the presentation points through the roof!  I will definitely be making this at all of my summer picnics!  5 Stars

Very yummy! Great hit at a potluck. I made a few changes based on what I had and personal taste--tri-color pasta; romano cheese (instead of asiago); sliced (not chopped black olives); grape tomatoes (halved); marinated artichokes (undrained). Also, I didn't have italian dressing mix so I used the artichoke marinade, garlic powder and italian seasoning and omitted the vinegar, parsley, oregano and oil.

I loved this recipe! Even better the next day. I added some Italian cheese crumbles (mozzarella and provolone-I think) from the supermarket along with shredded asiago cheese. I omitted the salami and just doubled the pepperoni (turkey pepperoni) instead. I also added some canned artichoke hearts and red onion. The dressing was delicious. Thank you!

I made this recipe - increasing the quantities to 50 for a church dinner.  It makes much more than that.  I wasn't sure how big the servings were but we had plenty left over.  I changed to pasta to rotini which I think is better because if you make it a day ahead the seashell pasta would have gotten too mushy - rotini al dente holds up better.
I also substituted mozzarella cheese for the Asiago. Everyone seemed to like it and I am passing the website on to the ladies in my church.  I like the way you can change the quantites/ingredients to adjust for more servings.

This was wonderful!  Everyone at our gathering raved.  I couldn't easily get salami, so I used summer sausage.  Couldn't find Asiago, so I used Mozzerella.  Used grape tomatoes, halved, and a little less oregano than called for.  I doubled the dressing, but didn't end up using it all anyway.  I poured some of the dressing on, refrigerated for a couple of hours (to soak up the flavor) pulled it out, added a little more dressing, and served.  I had run out of parsley, but this was still wonderful.  Next time I might add some red onion.  Great hearty Italian taste - thanks!

I made this recipe several times for a group of Army men and the key to success is using a tasty, high quality balsamic vinegar.  I prefer to make it the night before and allow it to cool in the refrigerator overnight so it is cold, not warm.  I also adjust the dressing the next day to ensure a moist, tasty salad.  Each time I make this salad someone mentions how much they like the cheese which I buy in bulk at Sam's club.  Enjoy!

I made a "test" 6-serving batch before making it for a picnic.  I found dressing the salad before serving made it seem a bit "oily", but the next day it was knockout!  I did take care not to overcook the pasta, and added some vidalia onion.

I bring this to every pot luck we attend.  Meat eaters love it!  I have a hard time finding the meat in anything but sandwich slices.  Just chop it up and add it in, it works great.

I made this pasta salad as a potluck dish for a wedding reception with a diverse crowd, and everyone loved it.It was the first to dissappear.
I substituted artichoke hearts for the Asiago cheese. What a Great Dish!

I made this for 2 partys, and it got raves galore!  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe though.  Instead of seashell pasta, I used a multi-colored rotini. This added a lot of color to the salad!  I also used shredded mozzarella instead of Asiago, and used bottled Wish Bone Zesty Italian dressing instead of making my own.

This receipe is excellent.  Everyone loved it!! I will admit that I took a shortcut.  I purchased already made antipasta from the grocery store, added pasta, sprinkled on the dressing, refrigerated it and made the dressing.  That made it even quicker.  Thank you!!

This not only looked good, it tasted great. Everyone loved it. I'll definitely make it again for potlucks, family gatherings. We had about 15 people eating it and there's still plenty left over.

Good flavors. I loved the cheese. It went pretty well. I will omit the olives next time as a lot of our guests didn't care for them(but they chowed down on the olive tray!). Otherwise, it was fast to make and very flavorful thanks to the Italian seasoning and the dressing. Which I was worried would not be enough as I usually use a whole bottle of Italian dressing and maybe a bit more if it dries out. But the amount this recipe made was perfect!

Excellent recipe---I halved it, used salami and ham, and fresh mozzerela cheese instead of asiago--couldn't find that.  We ate it for dinner and a couple of lunches, and it stayed yummy or yummier as time went by:)

My first time making antipasto and it turned out great! My husband doesn't like raw bell peppers so he was hesitant to try this but when he did he said it was a win! Very flavorful & hearty!  This makes a ton of salad! Will be making again!

Excellent!! I just made this one hour ago for a Christmas open house at my work tomorrow. I made it with some garlic, tri color rotini, artichoke hearts and added some fresh mozzerella..omitted peppers because I am not crazy about them. Also used white balsamic vinegar so it wouldnt be brownish colored. Even if I hadnt changed anything at all, its THE BEST pasta salad I have ever had!!!!! My picky 3 yo even likes it! Asaigo cheese in this is wonderful!!! I thought it would be too strong but its a MUST!!! Thank you!!

Taste the Asiago Cheese before you add it because it is a strong cheese and it will overpower the salad.  I made this for my wedding but I substituted Ken's zesty italian dressing because we love that dressing and it saved on time.  It turned out good but we feel the cheese ruined it. I think I will stick with my own favorites.  I think the secret in perfect pasta salad is letting it sit overnight to marry up the flavors and for the pasta to absorb the dressing.

This is the best thing i've made from this site! i dont put any meat in it because im a vegetarian and i add artichoke hearts and it taste's even better!

**i highly suggest using 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup of olive oil because if you don't its way to much olive oil and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. with this little tweak the recipe is perfect and my favorite thing to make!

Like other reviewers, I cut the dressing in half.  I also cut the pasta by less than a half to have a higher vegetable ratio.  Added some banana pepper, too.

This is a very bold and rather unique tasting   salad.  Although I personally love the taste, I haven't heard the raves that others speak of.    Maybe I need different relatives and friends that will appreciate this recipe.  Better yet, I'll keep what I have because that way I'll have more leftovers.

Very tasty!  I added green onions and cherry tomatoes per other suggestions, used yellow and orange bell peppers, and used aged provolone as I couldn't find asiago.  I liked the addition of the dry seasoning mix.  I sometimes find pasta salads to be bland, but that was not the case with this one.  Also, the colors are beautiful!

Made this the night before hosting a baby shower.  I omitted the asiago cheese, layered ham, salami, pepperoni, and mozzerella cheese and cut into small strips.  The dressing is wonderful.  I did only do 1 Tablespoon of the oregano, but left everything else as directed.  I also made two batches, using 4 boxes of pasta total.  I did add my dressing the night before, and it seemed to be absorbed by the noodles so I needed to add a little more in the morning.  I would suggest adding half the night before, and the rest just before serving.  I received so many compliments on this pasta...it was so well received the mom-to-be made sure she got to take ALL the leftovers home with her because she loved it so much.

MAKE THE DRESSING!! The 1st time I subbed with a bottled Kraft dressing and there was no comparison. Perfect for large gathering or potluck, but depending on the quality of meats used, it can be a costly dish. I ask the deli counter to give me thicker slices of the meat/cheese and chop it up small I find this enhances the meat/cheese flavors.

Perfect!  The only change I made was to shave the asiago as it is strong and big bites of it are a bit much for some.  Otherwise..yummy.

I love cold pasta salads, and this dish really hit it home for me!! Dumped an entire bottle of Kraft salad dressing in there instead of using oil and vinegar, and I believe it may have captured the Italian flavours even more. Ended up being a huge hit, even though I did use macaroni instead of seashells too, but everything was just as good. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe makes a lot of pasta salad, but I have to say that the leftovers are even tastier!  I didn't have all the ingredients, but the recipe is very flexible, and I found it to be a great guide as I didn't want to make a special trip to the store.  I used rigatoni pasta, canned black olives, pepperoni cubed, parrano cheese cubed, fresh tomato, green onion (for color), and jarred roasted red peppers.  I think the dried herbs in the recipe really added a lot of flavor.  Also, I used a bottled balsamic vinegrette.  I assembled the salad with half the dressing the day before I was planning to serve it in order to let the flavors meld.  Then, right before serving, I added the rest of the dressing to moisten the pasta.  It got good reviews, and the leftovers were great to bring for lunch.  I didn't find the salad to be too dry, even after storing a couple days.

I thought this recipe was great, but I took some recommendations from other reviewers and I think it turned out much better.  I used at least double the amount of genoa salami and left out the pepperoni - I just forgot to buy it, but I'm sure it's a nice addition.  Also, I used rotini pasta instead of shells.  I used a jar of marinated artichoke hearts, drained of course, and loosely chopped.  I think I could've used 2 cans, but then, I love artichoke hearts.  I also used about 8 golden pepperoncini, chopped.  That added a really nice kick to it.  I left out the bell peppers.  Instead of asiago cheese, I used a small container of fresh mozzarella, drained and cubed AND about 1 rounded cup of smoked mozzarella, cubed.  You could even use more of the smoked.  The smoked mozz is kind of expensive, but so delicious and so worth it.  I used a pint of grape tomatoes, quartered.  Leave the olives in, they're delicious.  Instead of the dry Italian-style salad dressing mix, I used about half a bottle of the Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette and pretty much left out the rest of the ingredients, except for a few healthy shakes of oregano and some fresh ground pepper.  I made this last Saturday for a graduation party, and so many people commented on it, how good it was.  And this never happens, my sister in law asked for the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe, with these changes!  You will love it.

Wow, this was great.  This salad has an wonderful intense flavor.  I added more cheeses like fresh mozzarella and provolone, I also added marinated artichoke hearts, green olives and used bowtie pasta.  This is not your everyday pasta salad.

I'm sorry but I thought this recipes was terrible. It was a fortune to make and took forever to prepare. The herbs were overpowering. I took it to a party and not a single person liked it.

I have used this dish at 2 parties and both times it was a hit!  No changes needed, excellent recipe, tons of flavor. Addendum:  I have been using this recipe for 2 years now and it's still the best!  People beg me  to make it for parties. Best recipe ever!

I was very disappointed, I made this dish for my house-warming/engagement party and to say it bombed is an understatement.  I followed the recipe verbatim, the only differenece is I made enough for 25 people, needless to say it was a complete waste of time and money,  few tried the salad and those who did felt it was too spicey from the salami and pepperoni?   I will not make this recipe again.

Fantastic! Finally a pasta salad that makes everyone ask for the recipe! I made several changes based on what I had on hand: 1. cavatappi rather than shells, 2. cubed mozzarella rather than asiago, 3. used one fresh red bell pepper, but no green pepper, 4. used one jar of roasted red peppers (yum), 5. used the parmesan italian flavored dressing mix & omitted the parm from the dressing, 6. added a handful of shredded fresh parm cheese, 7. omitted salami, 8., added a couple of handfuls of finely chopped fresh spinach (for color, more than anything else).  I would have actually preferred some of the original ingredients, but didn't have them handy (like asiago - mmmmm). This still turned out incredibly good and I'll be making it again frequently - this is the kind of salad that I will never make the same way twice but will always be delicious! Thanks!

This salad is a hit with my friends and family.  One caution is that the prep time is more like 30 minutes but well worth the effort.  The beauty of this recipe is that it allows for flexability...at times I have added garbanzo beans, broccoli, or artichoke hearts.

This is excellent. The only things I did different was using 2 packages of salad dressing and substituted mozzarella cheese for the asiago cheese.

One of my favorite recipes.  Absolutely fabulous.  It's amazing how such an incredible nasty smelling cheese (asiago) can taste so heavenly with the proper mix.  This recipe has everything down perfect.  Definitely worth making, will provide leftovers that lasts for a long time.  Highly recommended.

I made this for memorial day week-end and my family really liked it. It was a neat addition to our pic-nic menu. I liked it because I could make it ahead of time and it was available for snacking also. I caught my husband in the fridge more than once! My teens liked it also and my daughter has asked me to make it again when her friends come over. Guess you could say it was a hit!!

I would give this 10 stars if I could, it is that good!  Subbed: 1)  turkey pepperoni  for regular 2) lean ham for salami 3) chopped artichoke hearts for green pepper 4) grape tomatoes instead of diced to keep pasta from swelling up with liquid 5) Romano for Asiago 6) bow tie pasta for shells.  This is hands-down the best pasta salad I have ever tasted or made...thank you Dayna for this jewel of a recipe...this will be passed on to my kids for sure!

This recipe is awesome!! I am more than a little perturbed at everyone who rated this recipe, but said they just used bottled dressing. Seriously!? I'm pretty sure that what makes or breaks a pasta  salad is the dressing, and what makes this recipe great is the dressing you make yourself. But I digress. I made this recipe exactly as written and it was awesome. To me, pasta salad with a bottle of dressing dumped on it is pretty terrible and not worth the calories. This recipe is not that. The flavors are great! I was worried the Asiago cheese would be too strong but it was fine. Honestly, once it was in the salad I could barely taste it so next time I might swap it for something cheaper like cheddar/mozz. I would recommend not putting the tomatoes in the fridge - not a good idea in general. I added mine at the end. I don't really like green peppers or black olives but I really enjoyed them in this salad. 5 stars for this one... it's a keeper!

This makes a ton but it is so good!  It gets even better the next day.  The dressing is awesome.   You can do so much with the ingredients to suit your own tastes.  I like using San Georgio Trio Italiano pasta.  I get requests for this all the time.  Great recipe!

Wonderful stuff!  I used more like a 1/3 lb. on the meats but otherwise stuck to the recipe, so pretty served in my trifle bowl and a simple parsley garnish on top.  Make this easy dish, people will think you fussed!  Thanks for the great recipe, Dayna!

I made this wonderful salad for my Christmas party and my guests loved it. I did make the salad and dressing the night before and put it together 2 hours before serving which helped bring out the flavours even more. This one is definitely a keeper.

One of the best pasta salads I've come across. I made for a dinner party and had many compliments. I followed the recipe exactly, minus the meat to make it vegetarian and used rainbow rotini noodles. The asiago cheese is a must and makes the salad delicious! As is, this recipe makes A LOT!! serves far more than 12, but keeps well in the fridge.

This makes a HUGE amount so I would recommend cutting it in 1/2 the first time just to make sure you like the flavor.  I made the whole batch and took to a potluck.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it but there was way too much left over.  I'm not sure about the asiago cheese, I think I'd use something milder (if I ever make it again) like mozzerella or gouda.  Also, the color is pretty dark because of the vinegar.  All in all, I probably won't make it again.

I really liked this. I adjusted the veggies a bit to suit our particular tastes (2 yellow bells, 1 red onion, sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh) but otherwise followed the recipe, and really liked it. I think the addition of garlic and pepperoncinis would also be good! Thanks for the recipe :) 2019: use 8-12 oz pasta, 2 bells, blanch broccoli cauliflower in last 2 mins of pasta

I love this salad!! I followed the recipe very closely, I did use whole wheat pasta but everything else the same, but I ended up adding more balsamic vinegar - I know many said it was too much but apparently we like a lot of balsamic vinegar because both DH & I felt it needed more. We'll have this again.

Delicious flavor!  Upscale and a little expensive - was worth every penny!  Used only half the Asiago (diced it small as it is strong) & added sharp white cheddar.  Used medium shells.  Don't omit the olives - they add so much to the flavor blend (kids can pick them out!).  Agree w/other reviewers that the amount of dressing was too much.  Next time I'll use 1/2 to 3/4 of it, & save the rest for another salad.  Also, I prepared this all at one time, then refridgerated for 3 hours.  Giving this recipe 5 stars!

I think this was just okay.  I definitely think the oil is overpowering.  I think I would use less if I make this again.

Awesome recipe!!!  I made this for my son's first bday party and I can't tell you how many people complimented me on this dish.  Such a great flavor and a perfect cold pasta.  I read some of the previous reviews and added some onions, I also used cherry tomatoes.  I eliminated green & red peppers as I am not a fan and it still turned out wonderful!  Great recipe!  I will this all the time now!

I made this as stated in the recipe and the most dominant taste is the olive oil. Not very pleasant. My husband described the overall taste as alittle bitter. I loved the flavor combo of the veggies, meat, cheese etc. and I think this would be excellent with another type of dressing but as it is it's not very tasty. I couldn't taste the Ranch at all. Upon reading some reviews sounds like hardly anyone that gave this 5 stars made it as stated exactly in the recipe. I may try this again using oily Italian dressing from the bottle and see how that works, but that olive oil flavor is just way too much!

I followed the recipe exactly and did not mix until I arrived at the party - and the dish was to be served a few hours later - it didn't absorb enough flavor.  Next time I will mix it sooner and not worry about soggy pasta.

This was fine, but we all decided the basic Italian dressing out of a bottle is much tastier, much simpler and much more affordable than assembling this dressing.

Wow this was good!  Only change I made was used swiss instead of Asiago because I forgot to pick it up at the store. I'm sure it'd be excellant with the Asiago too.  Makes a ton but goes together really easily!

My husband said This was the BEST Pasta Salad EVER!  I could not find the Asiago cheese, so I used Mozzarella.  I added 3 chopped scallions, and used fresh basil, oregano and parsley.  Makes a ton...enjoy.

This recipe is the best pasta salad I have ever tasted.  I used rotini pasta and shredded Asiago, it was just perfect.  Its also even better the next day.  It takes time and expense to prepare, but it is well worth it.

Subbed sun-dried tomatoes (not oil packed) for olives, flavored feta (tomato, basil) as the cheese, only 1 pack mini pepperoni for meats, used cherry tomatoes.  Cut all veggies in small pieces and added a little roasted broccoli & cauliflower seasoned with rosemary, garlic, onion.  Ended up reducing the pasta amount due to small quantity of meat & cheese I had on hand.  I wanted the amount of pasta to be about the same as the veggies, meat & cheese.  Great color w. red & green.  Rave reviews.  Probably add green onion next time.

I changed this around a bit...I omitted the red pepper and just did the green.  I added a few slices of banana peppers.  Subbed grape tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes.  Subbed the Asiago for Provolone and I made the dressing with the EVOO, balsamic and a dressing packages mix and poured it over the pasta and veggies and let it sit for an hour....this is fantastic!

My family loved it!  The asiago was a little too strong, so we may try a different cheese next time.  I may add kalamata and artichoke hearts, too.

Very good for pasta salad. Even though it says to add dressing right before you serve, I would suggest letting it rest. It was fine when I first served it but so much better the next day.

I made this almost exactly according to the recipe, with the exception that I did not add the pepperoni sausage.... this is absolutely THE BEST!!  PERFECT combination of all ingredients.  The dressing is not to robust and gives just the right amount of flavor.  I have no complaints about the chopping.  A+++++

This salad is most definitely delicious. I have made (doubled) this recipe twice in less than a week and have been asked by several people for the recipe.  When I added the dressing, I was a bit overwhelmed by the parsley & oregano, but I dropped it off @ my sisters anyway for a gathering she was having and she said everyone loved it and had commented that it was the best pasta salad they had ever eaten. With that being said, I had to make another batch for myself.  This salad is actually very good (which honey prefers) without any dressing at all; just sitting overnight w/ the dry Italian dressing mix gives it such a satisfying flavor (& saves a bunch of calories too!)   My only changes were sliced pepperocini, spiral pasta, grape tomatoes and the small Hormel salad pepperoni.  My first time trying Asiago cheese and its a perfect fit w/ this salad, not too strong or mild.   I did put  less oregano & parsley the second time I made the dressing regardless of the rave reviews from my sisters house. Very, very, very good.  Thanks for sharing Dayna because I'll be using this one over and over for many years to come.

As others suggested, this recipe is 10x better after the flavors have a chance to marinate overnight.  For this reason I use rotini pasta instead of seashell since it seems to hold up better.  I omit the olives and substitute mozzarella for asiago.  Last, I buy the mini turkey pepperonis which save on both calories and more chopping!  This recipe does take some time to prepare but it's worth it!

I made this 3x in one week to test it for my daughter's bday party.  Each time, it got a lot of compliments.  Last time was the best and I doubled the pasta, but not the dressing, used fresh mozzarella and fresh parsley instead of asiago and dried herbs.  Also found that making it the day before was key.

This recipe is fabulous!  I have made many different versions of an Italian pasta salad and this is my favorite so far.  I used rotini pasta and decided not to add pepperoni so used 1/2 lb salami instead (asked the deli counter to cut it on no.12, then chopped).  I added in a yellow pepper for extra color.  I suggest you really MUST use the Asiago cheese, as other reviewers have said.  I found some Asiago with rosemary and garlic already infused - YUM!  This recipe received fabulous reviews at my Bunko last night and several asked for the recipe.  A real winner.  Thank you!

LOVE this recipe:  I've used it so many times and always get asked for the recipe.  Changes I've made: I follow the recommendations of using Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinaigrette, and mix everything but dressing the night before and adding the dressing about an hour before it's served.   I use grape tomatoes (whole or halved)  and multi color spiral rotini (spiral pasta)  I use summer sausage instead of salami.  And I always use the sticks of meat to cut chucks, not the slices (everyone really seems to enjoy that so much better).  And I use a lot more meat.  One full stick of each.  Probably close to 1 lb of each meat and cheese.

This was just so delicious.  Just as good as any pasta dish brought from Whole Foods.  I did make a few changes just mostly from personal choice.  Substituted chopped ham for the Salami, used Feta cheese in place of Asiago and left out the olives.  I made both the salad and dressing Separately the night before and chilled in the fridge.  I added the dressing to the salad 2 hours before it was required and then left on the kitchen counter until needed.  Went down so well at my dinner party last night, even tasted delicious today as left overs! I know I will be making this again and again...

This is a 5 for sure!  I used rotini and chunk salami (8 oz) and pepperoni (10 oz), and instead of green pepper I used a combo of orange, red, and yellow peppers.  At first I was hesitant to use all 2 tablespoons of oregano, but the dressing as written is absolutely perfect!  It does make a lot, but what a great dish to share with others!

People aren't kidding.  This is really that good.  A few tiny changes...used a yellow pepper instead of green, halved grape tomatoes instead of chopping whole.  I did make everything the night before and put the dressing on 3 hrs before serving.  Next time I would add a little bit more salami.  TRY THIS RECIPE!

There is nothing in this recipe that I don't love, but when I made this for a cook out yesterday, it wasn't as delicious as I thought it would be. There was too much oregano and too much of the two meats--as a ratio to the veggies and pasta. Next time I make this, I will halve the oregano, halve the meat, and see if that fits my tastes better.

This is so good, only made a few changes. I used havarti cheese, added some diced artichokes and I used grape tomatoes. Took it on a picnic in the mountains and everyone loved it. The dressing really makes the salad.

I didn't add tomato (allergy sensitive) or cheese (allergy sensitive) I let it sit overnight and it turned out very dry.  Throught the day I ended up adding tons of extra balsamic (in total, about 12 oz) I also added a little more oregano since the balsamic became more pronounced but I liked the sweetness it provide.  I would have given it 3 stars based on my liking of the flavor - but with the compliments I received, I gave it 4. I just didn't see what the rave reviews were for this time around.  I'll try it again soon to be sure all was done properly on my end.

I have been making this type of salad for many years, and it is always good! I always omit the salami and pepperoni though b/c of a few vegetarians. The other thing is i add all the dressing ingredients to warm pasta and then let it cool, the pasta soaks up all the flavors of the dressing and i prefer the salad that way. I never add oregano b/c i just hate it- omitting it does not take anything from the salad. Actually you can change things around a lot and still make it tasty, the only thing i find really important is the Asiago, it makes a huge difference in contrast to other cheeses. I have done this salad with more or less peppers, peppers of other colors, and no tomatoes- if tomatoes are not in season they are not tasty so i just do more peppers and a couple canned tomatoes. If you go the canned tomato route use just a few b/c they are very wet.

I've made this at least 4 times, and it has become a favorite.  
To save time, I make it with Kens steak house northern italian dressing, instead of the last 7 ingredients. 
It can be made the night before needed, adding the asiago cheese(cubed/diced) the day it is needed. It actually tastes better if allowed to sit overnight in the fridge in the dressing
I also add small mozzarella chunks or "balls".

I have made this pasta numerous times and I get double thumbs up from little kids to adults.  This is not your average pasta salad.  If you make this accordingly, many people who eat this and come back for seconds and thirds.  It is time consuming, but what I have done is while the water is boiling and the pasta is cooking, is pretty much how long it will take to chop and dice the other ingredients.  Recommend not putting the dressing on, until you need to serve it.  It keeps the pasta from becoming soggy.  For the tomatoes, recommend the grape. Additionally, the when it says to chop and when to dice, do so accordingly.  It helps with the overall presentation and the consistency of the salad.

I had to make this salad for 50 & I didn't want to chop ingredients all night, so I used shredded cheese and pre-sliced meat (don't try this at home, follow the directions). Nonetheless I ran out and people wanted the recipe.  This was awesome!!!

This recipe was excellent!  It was perfect for my Memorial Weekend Party!!  The guests could not stop talking about it.  I used Mozzarella cheese instead of asiago (I chopped it up and let everyone put what they wanted on their own portion).  I also used bottled Italian dressing instead of making it (it was quicker), but it turned out great!!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow night and made it the day before so that it would be cold and well marinated for tomorrow. I almost doubled the recipe because I didn't think it could be enough but as others have said, it could feed a crowd! We tried a bit tonight and it is wonderful! My husband had only good to say about this. He had suggested a pasta salad for a pre-dinner item and so I picked this out. I am very glad. Try it, you won't be disappointed. I didn't use any exchanges except that I accidentally bought shredded asiago cheese instead of block kind. I went ahead and used it anyway and it's still delicious! Definitely 5 stars!

This recipe lived up to the hype! WOW! We made a few subtitutions/changes. First of all, my husband and I are vegetarian, so we omitted the meat, and instead added 1 can of garbonzo beans and 1 jar of chopped marinated artichoke hearts. We also followed the advice and used white balsalmic vinegar. We let the salad sit overnight with the dressing before serving! It is outstanding! I have been munching on the leftovers all day! You must make this recipe!

I really liked this simple recipe. I made a few changes, I left out the meat (My sister is vegetarian), and I used yellow pepper instead of green. This was very tasty and simple to make. I also used an already made low fat balsamic dressing. Everyone loved it!

What a great recipe! I omitted the peppers (burp!) and added some chopped Vidalia onion and sliced green olives to compensate. The balsamic vinegar is not quite strong enough, so I used red wine vinegar the second time I made it. Perfect!

Perfect!  I have made over 50 recipes (at least) from this site and this may be my favorite.....  I have made it over and over again.  I omit the olives and have used various pasta shapes.  It is important to wait to pour the dressing on JUST before serving - I've learned that from experience!

I brought this pasta salad to Father's Day dinner, and my family went CRAZY over it.  I knew it was going to be good based on all the reviews, but I had no idea how absolutely delicious it was going to be.  Add the balsamic/olive oil dressing to taste.  I did not use the whole thing, and it was perfect.  Also, you can mix the pasta, meats, cheese, and veggies the night before.

This has to be the best pasta salad recipe I have ever eaten. My husband who usually will not get within 10 feet of a pasta salad has been begging me to make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe.

This salad makes a nice change from the usual pasta salad.  The only changes I made, were to use tri-color rotini, grape tomatoes, and a bottled balsamic dressing.  It does involve a lot of chopping, and makes a lot of salad, but it is definitely worth it.

This was very well received at a super bowl party.  I used only 1/2 a red pepper and 1/2 a green pepper and skipped the dried parsley in the dressing (I always think it has a funky taste).  I must admit that I did splurge on very good oil and balsamic vinegar.

This is a GREAT recipe! I never even knew what antipasto was before! I don't put in pepperoni or salami, seeing as how they're annoying to cut and the bits of chicken make up for their absence.  I used to always omit the oregano because I didn't have it on hand, but my sister went shopping and got it so I put it in and it kind of ruined it... it just made it smell too herb-y and tasted bitter. I'll definitely make it again, just never again with the oregano!

I made this recipe with Feta cheese.  It was hard not to keep tasting.  Everyone who tried it before the party had a hard time not tasting again.  I doubled the recipe but still had no leftovers.  It does make a ton!  This is the best antipasto recipe I have ever tasted!!  Highly reccomended!!

You may have to substitute some of the ingredients depending on availability, and this recipe may be a little expensive - but it is most definitely worth it.  Flavorful; a party favorite.

This does take a little time to prepare, but it is delicious.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I used mozarella cheese (cubed) instead of asiago and I have been told that cheddar cheese (cubed) works well.

I have made this pasta salad many times (picnics, graduation parties, office parties, etc).  Everyone always loves it and wants the recipe.  Make it as the recipe states, no modifications needed.

This is a recipe I already use, but wanted to add a helpful hint-  the meat/cheese can be expensive-  so  go to the deli counter and ask for "ends"- tell them what you would like, ham, salami, peporoni, types of cheeses-  they will give you the  end portions that can be easily chopped/cubed for this recipe  at about 1/4 of the price! A friend taught me that,  and I thought I would share (also great if you are making chefs salad! )

I 2X this & took it to a playoff tennis match today.  Two ladies from the opposing team asked for the recipe.  Lite, healthy-ish and a real crowd pleaser.  Will def do this again.

I love this recipe and I have already made it several times. Like some other reviewers, I also recommend Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinaigrette. I really preferred it over the homemade dressing (the texture was a little gritty, I think because of the oregano)

Best. Pasta. Salad. Ever. 

I use tri-color garden rotini pasta instead, just because I prefer it, and I leave out the olives--which I can't stand--and add some finely chopped sweet onion for a little extra zip instead, but the basic recipe is unbeatable and obviously also easily adaptable according to individual tastes.  Two people in my house have this huge bowl of pasta salad polished off in less than 24 hours, without fail.

Loved this pasta salad.  Excluded the meat to make it vegetarian friendly.  You definitely don't need the meat to make it delicious! I had a hard time finding the Asiago cheese.  My local Stater Bros & Fresh & Easy didn't carry it (found it at Sprouts).  I'm sure glad I didn't settle with another cheese.  I think the Asiago is the star of this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this with my family and it was great! We made a few changes though. We followed the recipe as given only we used 1/4 pound shredded asiago cheese, 2 chopped tomatoes, 1 tablespoon dried oregano. Also we didn't use the green bell pepper, the dry Italian dressing, the olive oil, vinegar, salt or pepper, and instead we just added a cup of liquid Italian dressing. It was yummy!

I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it. At the beginning I was not too sure because I thought the balsamic vinegar was going to be too overpowering but it actually made it taste great. I saved some for my father who asked me to make it again.

I didn't have salami, and left out the olives but made the rest as written.  I had never bought Asiago cheese before, it was expensive but definitely a very distinct (and yummy) flavor that added to the salad.  I think next time I will make it with my favorite pre-made Italian dressing (Kraft roasted red pepper Italian) since that's basically what this tasted like all mixed up.  It was good, I will definitely be making it again.

This was good, but I didn't love it. It did make alot of Salad, however, I poured the dressing on, and the next day it seemd to be a bit dry.

I really love this but it wasn't the right flavor that I'm looking for. All i did was add artichokes, green onions and omitted the green bell peppers. I wished I had some pepperoncini..I bet tht would be a great addition.

My sister made this while visiting for fourth of July and it was out of this world good!  The changes we made were using only half a red pepper and subsitituting jarred banana peppers for the green pepper.  I thought the banana peppers made the dish. Added a sweet, yet sour flavor that mixed well with all the other ingredients.  We also used cubed mozzarella and extra sharp cheddar instead of the asiago to bring down the cost some.  Excellent.  This is a keeper for sure.

Followed recipe exactly and it was delicious!   Expensive for a pasta salad...could probably substitute to make it cheaper, but delicious the way it was and everyone that ate it at the party raved about it.  Makes a ton!  Fed 8 adults and then lasted 5 more days with me and my husband eating some each day.

This was really good. LOVED the Asiago! Made the night before. Added dressing next day. My only complaint was that the dressing turned my pasta kind of dark from the balsamic. But that's okay b'cos I absolutely loathe pasta salad with bottled dressing. Yuck! Next time I will use grape tomatoes and I did add some garlic powder because I love the flavor. Easy and fun.

We have a tomato allergy in our home, so I had to take these out.  In their place, I used artichokes.  It was delicious!  My entire family enjoyed it - including the picky husband!

This makes a lot and is delicious.  I added pepperoncini's and that is the only change I made.  I suggest using really high quality ingredients for this one.  The little extra money is worth it.

With all the goodies in this salad, it has to taste great!  I think without them, the salad would be lacking in flavor.  I was looking for a recipe that would still taste good w/o relying all the meats, cheeses and veg for all the flavor.  I thought the packet of dry dressing mix might do the trick, but it fell a little short.  I just can't seem to find a recipe that tastes like the one from the grocery store.  I'll keep looking.

Excellent pasta salad! I didn't have any of the meats on hand, but I cubed mozzarella cheese and tossed it in there. After 2 days in the fridge, my sister was still raving about it. Next time I will definitely add the meats! I didn't use all the dressing and ended up using the leftover dressing to marinate chicken breasts and threw them on the grill. They were delicious!

This was the best pasta salad I've ever had!  My only change for personal taste is to decrease the oregano because it can be overpowering.  I used white wine vinegar for the balsamic because it's all I had.  I mixed it together at night and it wasn't dry the next day.  It definitely tasted better the next day.  This will be a dish I will make again.

Made this recipes for a baby shower this past weekend and it was great.  I've made similiar recipes, but I think the balsamic vinegar was definately the "kick it up a notch" ingredient.  Very easy to make too.  I made it even simplier by using already diced red/green peppers, mini pepperoni and already crumbled cheese.  The only thing I cut up was the salami and tomatoes, which I really just cut in half because I used cherry tomatoes. (only one tub needed)  :)  I will make this recipe again.

I have made this several times, but have never posted a comment.  Whenever I make this it's a big hit.  Just made a few minor changes (not a fan of certain ingredients).  Substituted the asiago cheese for mozarella.  Also elimanted the black olives and added a small jar of canned artichokes in oil.  Also used cherry tomatoes.  Yummy!!!!

This turned out great!  I decided to make it for our friends coming over for game night, but after my husband, kids and I "sampled" this (liberally), I can tell I'm going to have to make more, if all our guests are to have some.  I couldn't find asiago at our local grocery, but they did have sharp provolone, which I'd never seen before, but figured it could be passable in a pinch.  After tasting it, I can't imagine asiago could taste any better.  Also, I added jalapenos-- the kind in the jar so they're already sliced, I just roughly chopped them.  Tastes WONDERFUL!

This was great, i only gave 4 stars because i did change it a bit.  I used Salami, Pepperoni, and Capicola for the meats, added chopped pepperoncini, bottled robust italian dressing, and provolone instead of the asiago.  This was a perfect base recipe.

I've made this twice now and both times, it was wonderful.  The first time, I made it exactly as written.  The second time, I used Newman's Own Balsamic Vinigarette and  honestly, I liked it better with the bottled dressing -- just seemed less oily and tasted better for leftovers.  Either way, it's a delicious salad and will be my go-to pasta salad recipe from now on.  Thank you!!!

I'm behind on reviewing dishes I make on the site but I had to write about this one right away.  It was FABULOUS and everyone at the party loved it.  Even my husband who doesn't like pasta salad loved it.  My only change was to sub roasted red peppers for the red pepper (highly recommend!) and instead of making the dressing I used Newman's Own Balsalmic Vinagrette.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this for a potluck, and it won rave reviews - at least one person called it the best pasta salad he'd ever tried!  I have to agree, it was fairly easy to assemble, and the result was deliciously worth the effort!  I used tri-colored pasta but otherwise, didn't change a thing.  The asiago was pleasantly assertive and presented a nice contrast to the pasta, and the addition of salami and pepperoni made this dish unique.

I made this "meatless" and it was still a winner. I just added a 1/4 cup celery and onions.

Living in St. Louis we have access to several Italian markets and I took advantage of that.  It did cost a little more but the flavor was there.  I used piccolini, or small rigatoni noodles, which tend to absorb the dressing and it holds really well.  Also, instead of canned black olives I used marinated olives, both black and green, that I picked up at the deli.  I substituted the tomatoes for cherry or grape tomatoes and cut them in half.  Lastly, I used Wish Bone House Italian dressing, made with olive oil.  I also used all the same ingredients but substituted the pasta for Romaine lettuce.....that was REALLY delicious!  Happy cooking!

I had a BBQ this weekend and made this salad.  People loved it!  It was gone within 5 minutes.  Although I did use my own dressing recipe and I didn't use as much tomato since my friends don't like them too much.  Definitely going to make this one again.

I made this a few weeks ago and forgot to review it.  It was very tasty!  The only changes I made were  using turkey pepperoni, shredding the asiago and I left out the olives.  I think next time I will double the powdered dressing and leave out the dried herbs.  I bet this would be fantastic at a picnic!  Thanks Dayna!

Used marinaded mushrooms, artichokes, and a high quilt cheese Italian salad dressing. Also add 1/2 a thin sliced onion. Very good.

Excellent! My husband loved this! The asiago cheese is a wonderful addition because of it's nutty contrast to the tangy zip of the dressing! I am sure I will make this again and again and again...THANKS!!!!!!!!!

I did not like this recipe.  The Genoa salami overpowered the whole salad and there was too much Asiago.  The dressing was bland.  I would either cut the salami altogether or use regular instead of Genoa.  The pepperoni was good, but just disappeared behind the stinky, greasy salami flavor.  I will not make again.

Wonderful the first day- to die for the second!  I was tempted at first to substitute a less-expensive cheese for the Asiago- but was glad in the end that I did not- the cheese is key.

Delicious pasta salad.  Hearty and makes quite a bit.  Good the next day, too.  We used grape tomatoes instead of chopping up tomatoes and  orange bell pepper instead of green bell pepper.  We recommend that the dressing is added at least an hour before you serve it.

I can't say enough about this pasta salad!  I made it for a 4th of July cookout and everyone loved it (even my boyfriend who doesn't care for pasta salad).  After reading the reviews, here are the changes I made:  I doubled the salami, added chopped marinated artichoke hearts (1 jar), used one pint of grape tomatoes (quartered) in place of whole chppped tomatoes, which I squeezed slightly to remove most of the juice. I also added some chopped banana peppers because I love them. Rather than spending extra time making the dressing, I decided to use Newman's Own Three Cheese Balsalmic Vingrette which worked out really well.  I made it the night before, to let everything absorb the flavors and garnished with some chopped feta and pepperochini's prior to serving.  The only downside to this recipe was all the chopping, but if you don't mind that, I highly recommend this!!

This is SO good.  I was hesitant due to the number of reviews I read where people didn't like it...but I think you have to actually like this kind of stuff to enjoy it.  I used tri color rotini noodles and added peppercinis and baby artichokes.  I only used 1 T of oregano and picked up a package of cheese crumbles with mozza, parmesan, and asiago cheese mixed.

This is the best pasta salad EVER!  I have made it MANY times and I always get requests for the recipe.  My Italian friend, Vessinator, suggested using Italian dry sausage (Sopressata) in place of the salami and it is even better with this substitution.....give it a try, you won't be sorry!

Oh my goodness... this pasta salad is excellent.  It's not one of those salads that is a lot of pasta and just a little bit of other stuff.  This is chock full of everything... vegetables, meats, cheese and pasta in perfect balance.  The dressing is excellent as is.  Your salad will be coated but it won't be swimming in it at the bottom.  The only thing I did was add a chopped red onion, a small jar of artichoke hearts and some chopped up pepperocinis.  Excellent.

Skipped the Asiago cheese (but I love it, just didn't have it) and also the olives (because I don't like them) but added 2 jars of marinated artichoke hearts that were drained and chopped. AMAZING...I loved this stuff, and so did my husband. Will definitely make again and put the asiago cheese in!

We had a family (Aussie)barbie for Father's Day yesterday and this recipe was brilliant.  I adore the way you convert to metric and the adjustable serves.  I do not know Asiago cheese so used cherry bocconcini very successfully.  Cheers

Good, but I'm not sure if it's as good as all the reviews.  I cut the recipe in half but we'll still have leftovers for many days.  I used the whole package of dressing mix.  I had to change a few things based on what I had in the house.  Good flavor; I might make it again.

This was fabulous...I took it to a family gathering and it got rave reviews even from my husband, who usually hates any type of "salad".  I used whole olives and grape tomatoes instead of chopped, and colby jack cheese instead of Asiago.  The presentation was beautiful.  I was a little scared of the balasmic vinegar, but it wasn't at all over-powering and really complimented the other flavors in the salad.

I served this recipe at a Christmas party and the colors were beautiful.  Realized at the last minute I had no olives so left them out and salad was still delicious, especially the leftovers. Thank you, Dayna.

Only changes I made were to use veggie rotini instead of shells and jarred roasted red peppers instead of fresh.  This is an excellent pasta salad.  I disagree with other reviews that you can use a bottled italian dressing though (tried that and it was nowhere near as good).  Only caution on this is that it is 12 LARGE servings - not a small side serving.  I used a very large bowl and still had to leave out a bit of stuff to fit it in.  I ate this for a week and still had alot left over, but not because I didn't like it.

My husband and I thought this recipe sounded great and we made this together a couple of weeks ago.  It was okay, but we thought the dressing was too oily when you factor in the greasiness of the salami and pepperoni.  I think that I'll make this again, but look for leaner meats and substitute a good quality bottled Italian dressing or Balsamic viniagrette.  I think that I'll also use roasted peppers, as others have suggested, and perhaps add artichoke hearts.  Definitely a good base recipe to tailor to your personal tastes.  :)

This was an excellent pasta salad.  I did make a few changes as some members suggested.  I used the colorful rotini pasta instead of shells.  I also used half of the Asiago cheese and used provolone for the other half.  I also used whole olives (so olive haters could pick them out) as was suggested by another member.  I mixed it up with the olives too - I used half black and half green! I didn't see this suggested, but I didn't want to chop tomatoes, so I just bought a can of pre-diced and seasoned tomatoes.  And last I did follow a suggestion and cut back on the oregano, even though I love oregano.  All in all it was great, and I'll definetely use it again!  Thanks so much Dayna - I've been looking for a great pasta salad for awhile!

My family loved this pasta recipe.  I doubled the recipe for a large party, tossed it with half of the dressing the evening before, then tossed it with the rest of the dressing about an hour before we ate.  I did not use much oregano, instead used chives and granulated garlic.  I also used sundried tomatoes and sundried red peppers.  I found them very affordable in the produce section at our local market.  I was really good!

Made exactly as recipe stated.  This was superb!!  Took some on the plane when we traveled cross country, and it traveled very well.  We were stuck on the runway for over an hour at lunchtime in Dallas, so when everyone's tummies were rumbling, we just tucked into this and ENJOYED!  Fabulous, Dayna, simply fabulous!

I personally would have given this 4 stars but based on everyone's reaction who ate it i decided to give it a 5. Its ALOT of work and pretty pricey. I did double it though and it cost about $40 to make. I also did have tri-colored pasta and 1 package of totellini, i would leave out the totellini next time and just stick to the pasta. Other than that i stuck to the recipe exactly.....oh ya i did use only about 1/3 of the oregano, which i would do again. Over-all it seemed to be a big hit at the cook-out!!

I used provolone cheese instead of asiago.  A bit pricey, but not a bad recipe.  Great for a picnic or party.

I can barely express how much I love this salad.  I made it for the first time for my roommates and I as part of a "barbeque in the winter" theme night, and I ended up with way too much.  However, I ate it with lunch and dinner ( and yes, even breakfast!) until it was gone, and never got tired of it!  The only changes I made were to cut out the olives (no one was really crazy about olives at my apartment) cut out the pepperoni (salami was enough for me) and used mozzarella instead of asiago cheese.  So good!  Thank you so much Dayna for sharing!

This recipe was VERY tasty - everyone at the BBQ loved it. I did change a few things... i cut down on the amount of noodles the recipe called for and added a package of motzarella and garlic tortelinni. I also threw in some cucumber slices (because I love them!) and i used grape tomatoes instead of regular. Overall - it was very good!

It was a big hit at one of my parties. As requested, I also had to bring it the following week to a party. I've also been asked for the recipe a few times. I've substituted the asiago cheese with provolone once, but think asiago makes a different taste all together. Better with the asiago.

Great recipe! I made this for a BBQ last weekend and everyone loved. It made a ton, but everyone wanted to take some home!  I omitted the olives since I don't like them (cook's perogative!).  I mixed everything except the dressing the night before and added the dressing before serving. I will make again in a couple of weeks for another BBQ.

This was a big hit.  I read the reviews first and saw that someone wrote about the dressing being absorbed by the pasta and they are so right.  Don't overcook the pasta or you'll have mush.

This is an awesome pasta salad.  Everywhere I've taken it, I'm asked the recipe.  For a change, I substituted blue cheese for the Asiago and it turned out great.

I thought the dressing turned out a little oily with not enough flavor...the other combinations are pretty typical of an antipasto salad.  This is a GOOD recipe, not a fantastic or great one.

This recipe was pretty good.  The ingredients were expensive.  The pepperoni made it a bit too salty for my taste.  I have to admit, there is one pasta salad recipe I got many years ago off a package of pasta that puts all others to shame.  I've been searching for another "really good" pasta salad, and haven't found it yet.  I served this as a meal, and its probably better as a side dish.

Absolutely awesome.  It takes just slightly longer and is just slightly  more expensive to make than would be preferred by a lazy, poor college student like myself.  But the taste is definitely worth it.

This salad is wonderful.  I made only one change to the recipe (I omitted the pepperoni and add a little extra sausage).  It was a hit at the party I served it at, and several people asked me for the recipe.  It also looks very colorful, so it presents really well.

Delicious.  Even my toddlers loved this recipe.  Will make again!  It's more like an
Italian pasta salad than what I was expecting, but it was delicious!  The Genoa
salami really adds a delicious flavour.

WOW! Absolutely wonderful! Takes a little extra time to prep all the ingredients, but it is definately worth it. I mixed it together, tasted it and kept coming back for more "tastes". I did add a little red wine vinegar in the dressing and some garlic salt. Really worth the purchase of the ingredients and time it takes to make it. Better than the salads at our local deli - and I thought they were really good!

Wonderful recipe.  I made the salad (minus dressing) the night before, added the dressing several hours before serving and watched everyone gobble it up.  I've already been asked to make it for another upcoming party.  Thanks for a great recipe, Dayna.

Good recipe - 
Tasted better when chilled overnight.  I cut back on the amount of oregano also.

Made this a day ahead and added the dressing just before serving. A terrific change from ho-hum pasta salads....like having a pizza in a salad! The men in my lfe particularly loved this dish.

This was delicious!!1 My Italian husband was more than a little skeptical and told me it wasn't "authentic', but once he began eating it, he couldn't stop!  I took it to a BBQ as an appetizer (minus the pasta) and it was a hit.  The only thing I did different was to add green and black Greek olives, cubes of mozzarella, artichoke hearts, pepperoncini and halved fresh mushrooms.  THIS IS A KEEPER!

Very tasty, definitely DO NOT substitute the Asiago Cheese, I was originally planning to just throw any old cheese in there, but I found the Asiago on sale and decided to give it a shot and I wasn't disappointed!!!!

I served this over the weekend and it wasn't a big deal.  I thought it would be something special since I spent the money and bought the specialty cheeses and meats but not worth the expense. If I were to do this again I would use green olives, less pasta and add some marinated artichokes and or sundried tomatoes for some extra flavor.

Loved this recipe! I never made this before, and I don't need to try any other recipe. Only a few modification based on what I had or could get (not because anything needed changed) and everything worked great: used tri-color rotini (made it pretty), used an asiago/Romano/Parmesan cheese blend (because that's what the store had), added the italian dressing packet to the dressing to soften it up, used less olives (because I only had a few) and added green onion (because I had it in the garden). I bought two thick slices each of the cheese, genoa and pepperoni from the deli and cubed them so things mixed nicely. It does make a lot! We had it as a main entree for dinner, and we'll be eating it as a side for the rest of the week. Easy enough to half if you want. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I get asked to make this pasta salad ALL the time.  Everyone who has tried it, loves it!  I leave out the peppers (I don't care for them raw) and use grape tomatoes.  Sometimes I will also substitute mozzarella cheese for a milder flavor.

Fantastic! I made this for my sister-in-law's bridal shower, and just about every guest wanted the recipe. I've made my fair share of pasta salads, it's kind of my thing, and this is by far the best. Everyone asks me to make it now.

Great recipe!  I made it with whole wheat pasta shells and a little extra salami.  I only had cherry tomatoes / grape tomatoes (1 pint) that I sliced in half.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now, it is a huge hit at the family gatherings and the most requested dish to bring.
One of the changes that I have made is I use Pepper Jack cheese, I also have been using Italian salad dressing, but am eager to try the evoo and balsamic vinegar, has to be healthier than commercial dressing...
I am thinking maybe throw in some Pine nuts next time.

I followed the directions except for the dressing.  I didnt have the ingredients, so I just bought a bottle of Newman's Own Family Italian and it still got rave reviews.  People kept telling me to try it at the Easter dinner and I was like, I made it!  Everyone absolutely loved it!  Oh, and I just used a block of sharp cheese and cherry tomatoes cut in half.  This was awesome and easy with my changes, but Im sure it would be even better with the real dressing and asiago.

Completely delicious...I "made it my own" with some additions that were suggested by other reviewers and will use this recipe in the future again and again. It was a huge hit, the asiago cheese is perfect (I also used mozzarella cheese and that really made it awesome).

This is the best antipasto salad I have ever had.  I made it for a bbq this summer, and I doubled the recipe.  By the end of the night it was all gone.  Incredibly tasty and rich with the cheese and salami.  I used tortellini instead of plain pasta shells.  Fabulous.

This is the best, I absolutely love the taste. I only use this recipe when I make pasta salad now. I leave out the asiago cheese, taste better with out it to me.

I made this pasta salad for my cousin's graduation party and there wasn't a shell left by the end of it!  I always follow a recipe exactly as written the first time and then will tweak it the next time if need be.  This salad is perfect as is.  I especially liked the dressing.  I thought the dry italian salad dressing mix was a really great idea.  It definitely gives the salad a fuller taste.  Of course you could add different meats, cheeses, roasted peppers, artichokes, pepperoncini, red onion, etc., which would all be tastey additions as long as you make the dressing and add the dry italian salad dressing mix as the directions state.

I made this salad for my daughters graduation party. It was by far the best pasta salad ever. Everyone that had it wanted to know the secrets. I told them it was letting it stand over night. The last thing I wanted to do was to spend the morning of making a salad. I took tips from everyone one and it should have 10 stars! Tried and true! Will be the #1 salad going forward. I’m going to make it for my boyfriends family reunion. There will be 35 totally different taste buds there and I’m sure this will be the star of the meal for his food day! Thanks a million for sharing!

I've made this pasta salad for several cookouts and get togethers and its always a big hit.  I toss half of the oil mixture in with the Italian dressing mix before refrigerating, then add the rest of the oil mixture about 30 minutes before serving.  No need to make this the night before like most pasta salads, I typically make it the morning of and it tastes the same.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Everyone loved this one!  I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, added basil instead of parsley and ricotta insalata instead of asiago - all changes to make it more suitable for my family's tastes.  While I'm generally not a fan of these types of cold cuts, for a special occasion pasta salad this was perfect.  I received lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  While very good as stated, there's also plenty of room to add your own touches, like pepperoncini, artichokes, etc.  This one's definitely a keeper!

I could feel my arteries hardening after the first bite, but the mister totally dug this salad.  I don't know if I'll make it again, but thanks for providing a side dish idea that he raved over, Dayna!

I used feta rather than asiago.  I might try it next time with asiago cheese.  Also remember if you use brown basalmic it will give the pasta a brownish color.  If I make again with basalmic, I will use white but I think next time I will skip the homemade dressing and make it with a good quality bottled Italian Dressing.

I made this to bring to my fiance's parents house for mother's day. There were no leftovers. I made it again for a party last night and decided that I had to review it because this time, I doubled it and there were still no leftovers. I've been a big fan of potlucks for a long time and I have NEVER received so many compliments on a recipe before. All the guys had their wives asking for the recipe!This is a total keeper and my fiance has requested that I make it once a week! Thank you for posting!

Wow, this was a huge hit with my teens and Husband! I changed it up a little according to our tastes. Less tomatoes, added in chunks of a cube and used feta cheese instead. Going to be a summer favorite!

Pleasantly surprised! This was very, very good! I couldn't find asiago cheese at my grocery store so I used provolone, and I was doing a lot of other cooking that day so I used Newman's Balsamic dressing and it was very good! Got lots of compliments!

The best Pasta Salad recipe!!! I can't say enough how great this is, everyone LOVES it! I have been looking for this recipe for a couple of years after I made in back in 2001 for a work picnic. No other recipe I have found has compared to this! I just recently made it for a potluck to rave reviews! I added stoplight peppers and artichoke hearts. I agree that the Asiago is a very good addition. I also added halved grape tomatoes instead of regular ones.

I made this with the "Summer Tomato Salad" and "Rotisserie Chicken" for a summer dinner party and it was a hit!  One of my guests was diabetic, so all three dishes fit the bill.  The only changes I made were to use whole wheat pasta instead of white and bottled Italian dressing (my grocery store had no dry mix).  I used about 3/4 cup of dressing and omitted the oil.  I still added the balsamic cause I love it!  This made a LOT of salad...so I'm glad it was so good!

Made it for a salad potluck, everyone loved it. My husband is not a pasta salad fan, but he raved over it and ate it for lunch & dinner the following day. I added a little more vinegar than stated, but that is just a personal preference.

I made this for my son's birthday party. It was a total hit!!! I made it only with salami, not need for pepperoni too. Added cauliflower for a little crunch and also added a can of chopped artichokes. I also added large chunks of mozzeralla cheese, instead of Asiago, along with some grated parmeson to coat everything. I also added sliced black and green olives. Soo good! I would maybe use white balsamic vinegar next time. Really loved it!!!!

I really liked this and so did my family.  The only change I made was to use fresh parsley and oregano.  I like the idea of adding chick peas.  This will definitely be my standard pasta salad recipe from now on.  Thank you.

This is awesome.  I used tri-color rotini, halved cherry tomatoes, and used Mozzarella instead of Asiago.  Also,I added marinated artichokes and red onion and used fresh parsley instead of dried.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can add/substitute veggies/meats as you like.  The dressing is what holds it together, it really does taste to much better than bottled. This is going into my permanent rotation!

This was pretty good and keep in mind that it makes a ton!  I nixed the black olives and used a light balsamic vinaigrette dressing instead of the packet + vinegar + oil.  I wasn't a huge fan of the cubed Asiago cheese, I think next time I'll finely shred it.  The flavor was just a little too strong in cube form!

I made this dish for a family gathering held earlier today and this was a hit. At the gathering, I noticed a small crowd gathered around my dish...of course the family wanted the recipe. The only change I made was that I used yellow bellpepper instead of red. I did this because that was all I had. I recommend this recipe and will be serving it again in the future.

Love pasta salad and made this one because it was more substantial with the meats and cheeses.  I prefer Bernstein's Cheese Fantastico instead of the oils and vinegars.  I also omitted the herbs (the CF is enough flavor) and peppers (didn't want the crunch) and added marinated artichoke hearts.  SO GOOD.

We loved it.  Doubled the salami instead of using pepperoni  and also added green onions instead of the red bell pepper.  Had left overs and added a little wishbone italian dressing.  It was wonderful!

I am on a diet and this was the best meal I could have chosen for dinner. I tried to keep it healthy by using less than half the olive oil required, using whole wheat noodles and spicing it up with dirty jalapeno black olive relish. Hey I am from Texas everything needs jalapenos.  I love this salad; it was a hearty meal for a Monday night

This was good.  I was skeptical about the meats in it but went ahead and added them.  I did use really good specialty shop pepperoni and salami and weighed it to make sure I didn't overdo it.  Used red and yellow pepppers as I didn't have any green.  The dressing was good but maybe could use a little more.  I made this the night before so that might be why the dressing didn't shine through very much.  That might be just me though, I'm a dressing and sauce lover.  Everyone loved it though.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.

This was delicious.  I changed a few things . . . used provolone cheese instead of Asiago, used cheese tortellini instead of shells, used cream balsamic vs red.  Turned out quite yummy!

the pasta salad ingredients were excellent, however the dressing had a little too much oregano and I don't think I cared for the balsamic taste... what I did was mix the dressing in an empty water bottle so as me and my bf ate a bowl at a time, we could put on as much or as little dressing to our individual tastes. That was great bc you could shake it up easily, and it poured easily.

The recipe as written was good but the dressing needed just a little more zest. I usually make antipasto pasta salad with a ready made dressing, usually Ken's Italian with Romano Cheese has a great balance.

Crowd pleaser for all ages. I left out the peppers (personal preference), added halved cherry tomatoes, 2 small jars of marinated artichoke hearts (drained) and used about 3/4 a bag of Kraft Italian cheese (which included Asiago, as well as others).  I followed another suggestion and omitted making my own dressing and used Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing (about half the bottle)... I still used the packet of Italian dressing seasoning.  This makes A LOT but it's great the next day (and the next day :D).  Enjoy!

I made this for work for our pot luck lunch.  It was a hit!  The only thing that I changed on the recipe was I didn't add red and green peppers, and tomatoes. I added sweet roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts.  I drained the artichoke hearts and rinse them off.  Then I pat dried the artichoke hearts so they weren't too moist.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this salad. Its one of those things that you can add or subtract things too. I tend to use larger cuts of cheese and more balsamic. It makes a ton, so make sure you are cooking for a crowd! The only downfall is that the pasta turns brown after a day because of the balsamic..but its even better!

I made this for a party, I was hesitant because I normally don't like pasta salads, they are usually too heavy on the dressing for me.  I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the salad and it was easy to make.  It was not dripping in dressing, which was a plus for us and it held its texture well for a couple of hours.

I added more olives and less asiago cheese to the salad.  It got rave reviews by everyone, and I am sure that I will make it again.

I made this recipe as written.  I had the salami and cheese sliced at the deli counter (on thickness "level 4" - quite thick).  I julienned the salami, cheese, pepperoni, and peppers thinly, all the same size.  The salad was very pretty - and my coworkers devoured it.  I will make this one again.  NOTE: It did take a bit longer than 30 minutes to slice and assemble - I would allow 45-60 minutes next time.

The balsamic vinegar overpowered this recipe and I didn't like the color it turned the pasta. I would only make this again if I used a really good Italian dressing from a bottle.

Very good.  Used tri-color rotini instead of shells.  Added marinated mushrooms too.  A great main or side dish.  Would be an easy potluck dish!

I just made this last night and it was very tasty!!!!  I didn't use salami just the peperoni and as another rater stated they used mozzarella instead of the cheese that is requested.  It came out great! I can't wait to make this again for my family.

Everyone at my party definitely loved this dish.  I used mozzarella instead of asiago.  I mixed all the ingredients together the night before then added the dressing the next day.  the meat does stick together so definitely get thicker slices to make it easier.

My sister gave me this recipe and we had it at a christening...got fabulous reviews, AND we made it exactly like the recipe stated...it was not too oily...and also, if you plan on having this outside, it needs to be a bit 'wet'...all in all, it's good and i'm making it next week for a party i'll be having for the fourth of july!...thanks!

I don't get this recipe.  I made it precisely as directed and it went over like a dead weight.  I made the mistake and didn't do a trial run.  I took it to a family outing and brought back almost the whole bowl.  This is the first bad rating I have given anything.  I just couldn't let it go.  So sorry

I've made this several times. First, it's too "oily" as directed. The ingredients stick to each other and they are too sour for my taste.  Not sure about anyone else..but maybe I got the meat thing wrong?  MAKE SURE if you order from the deli you get it sliced thick! really thick! DO NOT add dressing until 1-2 hours before you serve it.  And add that and salt and pepper to taste.

I also use cubed mozzarella instead of asiago..personal taste.

the only reason i keep making it is because everyone likes it.

and beware...this a TON of pasta salad.

This was pretty good, and it was a great dish to take to a potluck. I ended up using a bottle of Annie's Tuscan Italian dressing rather than the packet. I left out the olive oil and vinegar. Oh, and I used tri-color rotini and left out the tomatoes (DH won't eat raw tomatoes). And I used pitted kalamatas instead of sliced black olives. I would make this again. A toddler at the party kept asking everyone for more "noo-noos," if that isn't a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is!

This is a great pasta salad! I used Cotto salami, because the Genoa salami was rather expensive, and Asadero cheese since I couldn't find Asiago. (I know, I know, it isn't the same). Otherwise, I did not change a thing. Thank you!

This is the pasta salad recipe I've been looking for!!
I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, with some small exceptions.  I used colored spiral pasta instead of the shells simply for looks.  I omitted the red bell pepper only because the local (small) grocery store did not have any more, and I just substituted regular distilled vinegar for the balsamic vinegar, because the store was out of that, too.  Also, I used little grape tomatoes instead of big ones and changed the type of cheese used.  In the end, it turned out exactly how I was hoping it would!!  Thanks so much for a delicious, versatile pasta salad recipe!

I love balsamic vinegar but I think next time I'll make this with red wine vinegar instead or use regular Italian dressing. It had an odd look to it. Thanks :o)

Fantastic!  Another hit tonight!  This turned out great.  I left out the dried parsley. I used 1 extra packet of Italian dressing seasoning. A little extra parmesan cheese.  Everything else I kept the same.

Great pasta salad!  I did a few substitutions:  a red, yellow, and orange pepper,pepperoni (no genoa), mozzarella cheese, and rainbow rotini.  I made the salad the day before and tossed with the dressing packet.  Also made the balsamic dressing the day before, but did not mix them together until about 3 hours before serving.  The salad both looked great and tasted great too!

I made just a few slight changes. I used string cheese, cut into chunks in place of the asiago cheese. i used 1/2 a yellow pepper and 1/2 a green pepper, omitting the red, and all genoa salami instead of pepperoni. I made this recipe the night before a party and I could barely keep away from it all night. It was calling me from the refrigerator! It was the number 1 dish at the party!! Definitely is better to make it the day before to let the flavors blend.

This was a perfect light summertime meal served with some garlic bread.  I left out the peppers, and substituted cubed ham for the salami.  I also used cheddar in place of the asiago.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the dried seasonings added to the dressing.  I think the next time I would leave them out and double the dry italian mix, or just use a bottled dressing. There will definately be a next time for this recipe though, so thanks!

This was pretty tasty especially with all of the yummy things in it.  I did make a couple changes though.  I only used 2 tomatoes, used mozzarella cheese, and doubled the dressing because I don't like dry pasta.  The dressing is good but I think next time I will just use a regular Italian dressing.

It was a hit at the Memorial Day campout. I used cheese tortellini instead of the shell pasta - HUGE HIT!!
The only other thing I added was orange and yellow peppers with the red and omitted the green. I also used fresh mozzarella cheese instead of Asiago cheese. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Very good! Only made a few changes: used tri-color rotini pasta, added chopped cucumber, only 1 tomato, and only used 1 tbsp of the dried oregano. Also, I couldn't find asiago cheese at the store so I just used a shredded Italian blend. I served this for dinner with garlic breadsticks. Husband said it was very tasty! Adding to my collection. Thanks!

Great recipe.  I was in a rush and decided to just use "off the shelf" Italian Dressing and some pre-packaged cheese crumbles, canned roasted red peppers and I added some diced ham.  It turned out really well.

I made this for my daughter's college graduation & I'm glad that I tasted the dressing before adding it to the salad because it was  awful. It had such a strong oregano taste that it was really bitter. So, I dumped half of it out & added italian dressing & it came out better. I also used fresh mozzarella instead of asiago. It turned out good in the end! I also found that recipe serves much more than stated so be careful...it fed 30+ people with leftovers. Overall it was a good salad & I would make it again with those few changes...Thanks!!

This is a bomb pasta salad!  I guess the secret is the Italian dressing.  My fiance works outdoors so he's not able to microwave lunches so he requested pasta salad.  This one appealed to me because it's more hearty than a side dish and also because of all the positive reviews, now I know why.

Very good, glad that I decided to make it. My husband really liked it. Great summertime food with a loaf of Italian bread. I did add some red onion because my husband likes onions in his salad. This is definietly a keeper and I will share this one with family and friends.

I loved this dish and my husband loves it even MORE. He requests this dish from me all the time. It's also been a big hit with all my friends.

I use whole wheat rotini noodles just because I haven't found whole wheat seashell pasta otherwise I'd use it. I use all salami, no pepperoni and I also use red and yellow bell peppers, no green.

Lovely dish! :)

Very tasty!  My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  I reduced the amount of Oregano to 1 Tablespoon, but it was still too much.  I would reduce it next time to a teaspoon. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I made this for a neighborhood block party, and it was quite a hit. Substituted diced mozzarella for the Asiogo, since we can only find Asiogo shredded here. Also  used Emeril's Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing instead of straight balsamic vinegar in the dressing, though I made the dressing mostly the same (half the oregano, though). Added 1/3 cup of diced pepperoncini peppers and a 15-oz can of artichoke hearts, chopped. Also used halved grape tomatoes instead of chopped regular tomatoes. Still, with all the changes, I think it remained true to the spirit of the original recipe. And like I said, it was a big hit. My husband said it tasted like pizza--a big compliment from him!

A HIT! This was my 1st try at this recipe but it was easy and great as is, although, I did add a few scallions in, otherwise I found no need to add/delete anything to start. I was nervous adding in all that oregano fearing it would be overpowering but it's DELICIOUS! Next time, I would keep it the same but add in red onions and chop my veggies in bigger pieces (I diced them the 1st time), maybe I'll add in fresh minced garlic too. Good good stuff - better the next day. Hope you're hungry - it makes a lot.

This was the recipe of the summer last year! I made it about 10 times. I leave out the olives, and use monteray jack cheese without the hot peppers in it instead of asiago. Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely enjoyed this pasta salad.  It was a hit with my family as well.  I will make this again.  I used the bow tie pasta instead of the seashell and I added chopped red onion for added flavor.  It was delicious.

This really was an excellent recipe. I left out the olives and it was wonderful. Don't substitute any of the cheeses. The only hard part was chopping the salami and sausage other than that I will make this again.

There are a lot of ingredients but it was very easy to make.  I substituted the pasta shells with miniature ravioli found at my local Italian deli which added a nice taste.  I will make it over and over again.

The biggest lesson I learned from this recipe is always read how many servings it makes, this could feed 20 people!  I couldn't find dry italian dressing so I used house italian in place of the oil in the dressing the flavour was really nice.  When all is said and done, I am glad I tried it but I won't make again.

The salad recipe itself is superb, however the dressing that it called for was rather nasty.  I followed the recipe verbatim, however after tasting the dressing, I scrapped it and used a store-bought zesty Italian dressing, as others had suggested.  Some reviewers suggested substituting other cheeses for the asiago, do not do this.  Asiago cheese is a culinary masterpiece, aside from the smell, this cheese creates a flavor explosion in your mouth.  I will definately make this salad again

This is a winner! My husband ate three bowls! Beautiful color and presentation. Followed the recipe to the letter. Loved the Asiago cheese. Cannot wait to make again. Only slight downside was it did take me longer to prepare because of all the chopping.

A great alternative pasta salad recipe for those of us who don't like mayo!  My friend Jenny made this for the 4th of July and it was DELICIOUS. I think she cut the oregano in 1/2, used yellow bell peppers instead of green, and added artichoke hearts.  I'll definitely be making this recipe for myself soon!

Wonderful! I made this tonight for dinner, and we ate it out on the patio. It was a hot summer night, I didn't want to eat anything hot. It was cool, refreshing, and DELICIOUS! My husband RAVED about it. I served with with Italian bread. The only change I made was I used Red Wine vinegar in stead of Balsamic.

Very good recipe.  Even my husband liked it and he normally passes on pasta salad.  Next time I will use a white balsamic vinegar because the visual appeal is lost when you add the regular balsamic.

This is a very yummy addition to a summer cookout.  I added some broccoli and extra parm cheese, which made it perfect.  It says 12 servings, but made a HUGE bowl and can easily feed a crowd.

This get an almost 5 star!  Very good and easy to prepare!!!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to make a little more of the dressing, or maybe even use a bottle of italian dressing.  Overall a delish recipe that will be made again, especially now that it's almost summer!

FANTASTI!! I made this to bring to a potluck lunch and EVERYONE took a copy of this recipe home with them and i mean everyone! Absolutely wonderful!  I did as others suggested used only 1 tablespoon of oregano and cherry tomatoes cut in half. I did put the dry dressing on the mixture in the fridge for 1 hour then added the dressing after the hour but it was mixed over night instead of just 1 hour before serving. I would definately do everything just as i did for the next time i make this scrumcious pasta salad.  Oh, i also add a few whole peperoncini peppers to the sald. They added color and extra flavor if anyone wanted to use them to enhance their forkfull. Thanks You so much Dayna for the BEST salad recipe i've ever made!

Totally AWESOME.  I left out the pasta (for all the low carbers)  and I added artichokes, green olives, and peppercinis.  The artichokes were marineated in olive oil, so I didn't add any extra, the recipe call for a lot of olive oil and I think it would have been too oily.  It was SO good without it.  I used a whole pkg of italian dressing mix and a few gemerous splashes of balsamic vinager salt and pepper and shredded parm cheese.  It was kind of expensive to make, the salami and chesse was $$, but it was totally worth it.

Fabulous! The first time I forgot to cool the chicken before putting it in the bowl so the cheese melted, but otherwise it was awesome, the dressing is an especially nice treat, make sure to use high quality balsamic.

Used tri-colored rotini pasta, skipped the olives, added chopped onions and substituted provolone for the asiago.  Easy to make, got great reviews by my Italian family.

This recipe was excellent. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. It was full of flavor and a beautiful presentation. Instead of the shell pasta I used tri colored rotini. Everyone said it was so good, they thought I bought it from somewhere. I would definately recommend this dish.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe, maybe a bit overrated.  The dressing was rather oily, and also the balsamic vinegar ruined the vibrant color of the salad.

Made this exactly as recipe states. I found the oregano much too overpowering.  Will try again with a least half the amount.

I took this to a tennis match and everyone loved it.  Everyone requested copies of the recipe.  I was thinking about changing the cheese from Asiago to something else.  I thought it might be too strong.  I decided to stick to the recipe, and I'm so glad that I did.  The Asiago was perfect in it.  If you want raves . . . make this salad.

I had high expectations and after all the rave reviews.  Honestly after making this I felt it was very average for pasta salad.  The dressing itself was great (a bit too much basil...got stuck in everyones teeth) but the dressing got lost in this salad.  So, good recipe... but nothing special.

This is the BEST pasta salad I have ever made.  It is almost an entire meal in itself.  The only change I made was to use a blended shredded cheese, Asiago/Parmesan/Romano in the salad,instead of just Asiago.  Still turned out great. Made it for a barbecue and it got rave reviews from every single person who ate it. Thanks Dayna!

Have tried other pasta salads but never found one I really liked or wanted to make again.  This is it!  I served it as a side but am making it this week to serve as a main dish with some good bread.  It is pretty hearty.  Easy to assemble ahead of time with the exception of the dressing.

I made this for a party at a friends house.  It went really fast, I never even got any!  But everyone else said it was good.  I added artichoke hearts and used tri colored rotini, grape tomatoes, fetta, & turkey peperoni.  It is definitely a beautiful presentation.  I can't wait to make it again.  Maybe this time I'll actually get some!

I thought this was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly. I did mix the dressing and salad the day before (separately) and did combine the two until right before the meal started. It makes a bunch, but I was serving it for a potluck and it was completely finished. It's hard to explain - but it does taste exactly like an antipasta platter. YUM!

This is an awesome pasta salad, I loved it! It makes a huge amount, but my family had no problem eating all of it in less than a week. I omited the peppers and added artichoke hearts. Also, I halved the asagio cheese and added feta to make up the difference. It was delicious! This is definatly one of my favorite recipes now.

This was horrible, I went on one person's review who stated that if you do not like Antipasto salad you will like this, and I have to tell you that I like antipasto salad, and this was horrible.  I made it for a baby shower and was so ashamed that I left it in the fridge.  It is fairly costly to make for a less than desirable result.  Sorry but I would not suggest it.

I didn't like this salad at all.  The dressing was too greasy, the flavor was okay.  I couldn't eat anymore after two bites.  My husband loved it though, so go figure.

I served this salad at a family gathering and it was scarfed up!  I highly recommend this recipe, although I made my salad with tube pasta, rather than the sea shells.  Also, I found that the cheese was powerful enough that you really didn't need a whole pound, 3/4 lb. is just great, or even less if you like.  You can feel proud to serve this salad.

I thought this was very good, but it seemed to be missing something...more cheese or maybe halved olives instead of chopped.  Also, the tomatoes didn't do much for the recipe...would leave them out.  Small mushrooms would be good in it.  Definitely more cheese.

This recipe is wonderful! I stumbled upon it when I was looking for something to bring to one of my sororities picnics. It was all the rage. Now they insist that I bring it for every occasion. It is a little time consuming, but I'd do it for my sisters anytime.

My husband enjoyed this recipe more than I did.  He likes the different meats used in this recipe, which is the reason I didn't like this recipe.  I tried it at two different parties and got many opposing reviews, so you either like it or don't.

Awesome recipie!  definitely will make again.  I brought it to a party and it was a hit and was all gone by the end of the night.  Used 1/3 cup of oil (saved on the fat), still very good.  Also used Rotini instead of seashells. two thumbs up!

I couldn't wait to make this salad - it sounded great, especially w/balsamic vinegar.  It turned out o.k. - nothing special in our opinion.  I made it for a picnic this weekend and there wasn't much missing from the bowl.  The kids wouldn't even try it because of the brown color.  I will not make this again. :o(

You really should use Shell pasta with this recipe (it holds the asiago and/or feta cheese).  I mix the oil, vinegar, and Ital. dressing, with seasoning in a small bowl and pour over entire salad!  The pics submitted do not due this recipe justice!  Next time I make, I will submit!  I've actually been accused of "buying" delhi pasta salad when I make this recipe!  They love it!!

This was wonderful!  I made it for a potluck at work and several people requested the recipe before the day was out.  The only thing that I would change about the recipe was the size.  There was enough to feed a small army (darn lucky army - it was *quite* tasty!)  Taste-wise, this was very, very good.

AWESOME! The one word to explain this salad.  It is a complete meal-in-one.  I fixed this when my parents came over for lunch and my mom took my recipe - she loves pasta salads.  I KNOW what I'm bringing for our next family gathering!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing.  Oh, and I found the leftovers to be just as tasty as the first time we ate it.

I made this recipe for my sister-in-law's baby shower and everyone raved about it!  Although it was a bit time-consuming to make, it was definitely worth it.  I even had several people ask me for the recipe, even my own mother--what a compliment!

I sent this salad with my hasband when he participated in an all day sailing event.  He brought this and a loaf of focaccia and was told he would be begged to be on anyone's boat if the word got out.  Not all sailors drink beer and eat pretzels. I always refer all requests for the recipe to allrecipes.com.  Thanks, Sue

Very easy recipe for a beginner, and the BEST pasta salad I've ever had! It was a hit at our Memorial Day party. I made a couple changes that don't change the overall flavor. I used tri-color spiral pasta, and sliced pepperoni & salami. The colored pasta made the salad more colorful & the pre-sliced meats made it a bit quicker to prepare.

This is a very good recipe ! I left out the pasta and served it with mixed lettuce.  Got rave reviews.  I served it when I made American Lasagna recipe on this site.  Wonderful combination.  My Italian friends loved it.  Thanks Dayna

I was unable to taste it myself, as it was for a surprise baby shower and I had previous plans, so just dropped it off. I did NOT mix the dressing in until I dropped the salad off as I did not wish for the pasta to soak it up and get too mushy. The next day I got RAVE reviews! Everyone LOVED it! I did add a can of chopped up artichoke hearts and left out both Italian dressings (dry mix and mixed) and used Newman's Light Balsamic dressing as one reviewer had suggested and had received rave reviews. I did add a tad bit more of both salami and used turkey pepperoni. Great recipe!!!

WONDERFUL Recipe!!!!    
Been making this recipe for years since I found it, but I made a few little changes.  I found that the pasta shells stick together, when you stick your fork in you get 6 shells instead of 1, so Instead I use Bow Tie Pasta. Doesn't stick together like the shells do. Plus, I leave out the Parmesan cheese from the dressing and only add 1 tablespoon of Oregano instead of 2, then add salt and pepper. Personally, i don't care for Parmesan cheese and I’m not huge on the taste of oregano. BUT......and there is a BUT, I am a huge fan of the meats and cheese. I get a pound of each and use Provolone instead of Asiago.   I ask the deli to cut 1-inch chunks of each to equal a pound (-/+) and then I break out my ruler and cut it all into 1" squares (that’s my O.C.D LOL) I Add that all to a big bowl.  I Then "Blanche" the bow tie pasta. Boil it, throw it in the strainer, then dump the pasta into ice cold water.  Pour the pasta on top the meat & cheese, then add the veggies, black olives and tomatoes (Cherry or grape cut in half).  I add 1 and 1/2 to 2 packets of dry Italian salad dressing mix. Mix it up by hand and let it chill in the fridge for at least an hour like the recipe says.  Then I pour on the dressing, mix it up and then throw it back in the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight.  O..M…G! Tastes amazing!!!! Every time we have Pot Luck at work I have to bring this, plus some extra containers for coworkers to bring home.

We really liked this a lot. I didn't use all the asiago cheese the recipe called for, only because it's a little pricey, but the asiago really does make the salad. Will def make again.

Made this for a BBQ party and a Family Reunion.  Let me tell you it was a HIT!!  Being as there was no mayonnaise in it, it was the perfect salad for an outdoor summer occasion.  The only changes I made were substitutions.  Instead of Asiago cheese I used mozzarella and instead of chopped tomatoes, I used grape tomatoes.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This was a very flavorful pasta salad. It makes quite a bit, too. You could easily bring this to a party and plenty of people could feast on it. I will definitely make this dish again.

I was looking for a different pasta salad and this definitely fit the bill. Used some suggestions from other recipe users to tweak to my taste buds.  Roasted red peppers (no green), Kalmata olives, grape tomatoes halved, doubled the Genoa, added pepperoncini's & 1-1/2 pkg. dry Italian (but did not add any extra salt).  Made day before using half the dressing.  The day I served I added the cheese and rest of dressing in - tossed and it was delicious! Thank you for the recipe Dayna.

I love this salad and crave it every spring once the weather gets warmer. The only problem I have is that there is too much oil; I think for 1 pound of pasta, you need only 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup balsamic. That is the only modification I make and it's delicious.

I have developed an addiction to this salad!!!  It's great for lunches.  I use 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, artichoke hearts and purple onion.  Do not substitute the cheese!  I added more balsamic vinegar later.

Fun twist on a traditional pasta salad. The asiago gives it a distinct cheesy flavor, while the pepperoni adds a spicy kick. You could eat this on its own for lunch if you were so inclined, but I served it as a side dish at a family cookout. It's a great complement to burgers and hot dogs.

I have made this for almost every potluck I've attended since finding this and I never have leftovers. I have experimented with the recipe using proscuitto, adding green olives, and artichoke hearts at times. The shells are great but any shaped pasta that will hold the dressing can be substituted if shells aren't handy. A vegetarian friend of mine even asked for the recipe and adjusted it without meat and said it was really good as well. Love it! Love it! Love it!

This was very good. The only change I made was I used tri colored rotini  instead of shells. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again. It only took about 20 minutes from start to finish. As the pasta was cooking, I cut up the other ingredients , mixed them up and added the pasta once it was ready. Easy and good. Just what I needed at the time. 
Thanks for sharing

So good with or without meat. I just added extra parmesan and used mozzarella this second time.  Everybody loves it. I like it and I don't like most balsamic vinegar and or italian pasta salads.

It was great. When I was at the deli buying the items I needed. I was asked what I was making and I told them. They said it sounded delicious. I said if it was as good as it sounded I would share some with them. It was a HIT. I've got friends for life.

This was awesome!  I tried to follow the directions but goofed. I put the packet of salad dressing in the liquid dressing mix. Then I added another packet to the pasta mix (along with some chopped marinated artichoke hearts. Refrigerated for several hours and brought it to a concert in the park. We couldn't stop eating it.   Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!!

Wonderful! I made this today and cut the recipe in half. Changes I made: I left out the olives and tomato (Hubby and I don't like them) and I also used red, yellow, and orange peppers for color. Finally, I used rotini noodles instead of seashells. For the dressing: I didn't make the dressing but used Newmans Own Balsamic Vinaigrette like others had suggested. I put a little bit on the pasta salad and then put it in the fridge to let the flavors soak together. I was going to leave it overnight as others suggested but it's been two hours and I just went in to have a little taste-Yummy! The asiago cheese definitely gives it a kick however, I could've cut the cheese smaller.. I'll remember that for next time.  Will definitely be making this again!

This pasta salad is fantastic. It's a little pricey, but definitely worth it. I omit the olives and bell pepper because I don't like them, but my mother makes this with no changes and everyone loves it. Even without the olives and bell pepper this recipe is great and doesn't "seem to be lacking something." 5 stars all the way!

This salad was beyond great!! It was so good!! I'm not a big pepperoni or salami fan but this was so excellent!! I had a friend for dinner and he went straight to my tupperware. He couldn't wait for me to scoop it up for him to take it home!! Next time I wanna throw some artichoke hearts in it, too. I think that'd be delicious!! Would it still be antipasto, though? I don't think I care!!! LOL

I had all the ingredients except asiago, so made to recipe substituting sliced up mozzarella (ok it was string cheese) and a little extra Parmesan.  This is a forgiving recipe because it was awesome.  Husband really liked it.   Will try again with the asiago.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This salad is magnificent, I made this with chicken and chicken sausage since I did not have the other meat on hand and it was so good.  I hope to make this salad again very soon with the other meats.

I will admit right off that I am not a big salami and pepperoni eater. I made this recipe exactly as written the first time. I thought it was okay. My guests seemed to like it. I think with this many ingredients someone is bound to not be a fan of something in it so ultimately you should tweak it according to your preferences. The dressing is just okay, but I feel it tastes much better when made from the good season packets with balsamic and olive oil. The best part of this recipe is the use of Asiago cheese. I think this truly is the most important and tasty thing here. I love the distinct and strong flavor it gives. Now when I make a pasta salad, I always make it with asiago rather than feta or mozzarella. If you use tomatoes, I highly recommend using grape tomatoes halved.  By the way, this recipe serves a lot! Don't make the mistake I did and double it! I had a ridiculous amount of it!

I made this EXACTLY, NO changes. :( . I was very very disappointed. Very Bland. I even let it set overnight as I wanted it to be extra good and let the flavors run through it. (I didn't add the tomatoes until 1 hour before or the dressing as stated on that). Waste of money. I took it my event anyways after I doctored it up to even make it more eatable. VERY disappointed after I read all these reviews. I will NEVER make this again or recommend to anyone.. Blah...

Delicious! I made it for a potluck and had many people rave about it and a few asked for the recipe. The only changes I made: used chopped up sliced Genoa salami (rather than just chopped), a smaller can of already chopped olives (I'm not a big olive fan), a .6 oz package of Italian dressing mix, about 1/2 c EVOO, and ground oregano since that's what I had on hand. Next time, I will definitely use chopped Genoa salami (I remember reading someone's review about asking the deli person to cut it 1/2-inch thick and then chopping it yourself - good idea!), a can of olives NOT already chopped because the pieces were way too tiny, and dried instead of ground oregano (the ground oregano was too fine and made the texture of the dressing a little sludgy). Basically I should've just followed the recipe :) However, despite all of these changes I'll make for next time, the recipe as I made it was still amazing! The asiago, salami, and pepperoni go so well together.

This recipe was yummy.  It does make a ton! I made very few changes based on my own personal taste.  I used mozzarella cheese. I have no idea what pepperoni sausage is, so I just used pepperoni and I did not add olives because I don't like them.  I followed the recipe for the dressing using other reviewers' suggestions of mixing everything the night before with the exception of the Balsamic vinegar, which I added shortly before serving.

Yummy!!! Yummy!!! Yummy!!! I made this for a BBQ tonight it was so good! However I was visiting my sister in Pinedale Wyoming and their only market did not have any asiago cheese!! So I substituted miniature mozzarella balls...mild but it let all of the other flavors come through!!

Excellent. It involves a bit of chopping but is well worth it. I did add halved grape tomatoes and green olives. I used tri colored pasta and smoked provolone cheese. Delicious. Thanks for sharing.

This is a new favorite summer salad. Altered it some by decreasing the evoo to 1/2 cup and upping the balsamic to a 1/2 cup. I didn't serve it right away. I let it sit overnight as I do with all my pasta salads so that the pasta can absorb the dressing completely. Can you say WINNER!!! I kept going in the fridge myself sneaking forkfuls. I also didn't add the parmesan as they stated to the dressing. I added it after the dressing and mixed it altogether. What flavor! And the asiago - I love asiago. If you take it out of the recipe, you're missing something wonderful. Asiago adds a certain kind of flavor one just can't describe, that's why you have taste buds.

This was good. I liked that it wasn't a mayo based pasta salad. We also like a lot of the ingredients, salami, olives (my husband's favorite), etc. My only change I'll make to the future is the Asiago cheese. It's a very strong cheese for this type of salad and I found myself eating around it, even though I like that cheese in general.

My husband loved the recipe. I really didn't care for it. I think the balsamic vinegar was a bit too much for me. I think next time I will cut down on the vinegar and only use 1 T of the oregano. Other than that it wasn't a bad recipe.

I made the recipe with a few adjustments (provolone only and 1 T of oregano).  The balsamic vinegar had too much of a strong taste for me on the first day.  The flavor improved greatly as the days went on.  If you don't have the time to let the pasta salad rest for a day and don't particularly want an overwhelming balsamic vinegar flavor then please use your favorite Italian dressing instead.

I found this to be just so-so, nothing to brag about. The asiago cheese is too dry and provolone might have been better. The recipe also makes a huge amount so you might want to cut down a bit.

Perfect! Just what I was looking for, thank you! You can sub other white cheeses in this also, like muenster, swiss, provolone etc.. and it's great. :)

This tasted good but the chopped salami stuck together in big clumps (I used sliced salami and cut the slices into small pieces). This was my fault but the recipe wasn't really clear.

I've making this salad for quite sometime now.  It is a fantastic side for any BBQ or picnic.  It can act as a stand alone meal too.  One reviewer wrote that the flavors can get lost and this is true.  Make extra dressing as you may need to add some just before serving.  ENJOY!

So good and easy!  It doesn't take long to throw everything together.  I made it pretty much exactly according to the directions, but added artichokes and banana peppers and used bow-tie pasta.  It's so easy to customize with what you have in your fridge.   I let it sit for 24 hours and it was an amazing and quick Friday night dinner.    Thank you!

A good non-traditional pasta salad. It was a pain to chop the salami and pepperoni only because they are hard to cut but overall an easy recipe.

Everyone loved this, even the picky kids at our Memorial Day picnic!  I made a few additions - I used olive oil marinated dried tomatoes instead of fresh and also added some artichoke hearts.  I also used roasted red & orange peppers instead of the fresh.  According to my family this is now my "must bring" recipe to our family gatherings.  To make roasted peppers, just buy the mini-peppers that come in a bag.  Drizzle some olive oil in a skillet and throw in a handful or so of kosher salt.  Roast the peppers on medium high, turning often until they are browned in spots and cooked through but still firm.  Chop them up seeds and all for the salad.

I thought this was great. The only thing I didn't like was there was too much oregano in the dressing, I will probably reduce both the oregano and parsley by half next time.  Also, we omitted the meats.  We did wait until right before serving to mix the dressing.  This recipe easily feeds 10 adults or more.

Easy, tasty and my husband liked it too.  I added 1 tablespoon of dried basil, 1/4 lb of ham, three slices of swiss and 1 tablespoon of parmesan to the recipe.  Parm & basil to the dressing and ham & swiss in with the pasta.  Served with toasted baguette it made a delicious, cool meal on another 100+ degree day.

Very good - used bottled italian salad dressing and mayo (will use miricle whip next time). My son ate it for dinner but of course picked out the red pepper and onion. I will use cherry tomatoes once ready from my garden.

I've made this twice and enjoyed it twice. Once for memorial day and once for a b-day party and although I liked it neither time was it a big hit. Not real sure why. I gave it 5 stars based on my opinion of it! The asiago cheese added a really nice flavor to it. No reason to change anything with this pasta salad.

I made this recipe, using the suggestion to try Newman's Own Light Balsamic Dressing, mozzerella & parmesan and it was delicious!  I served it at my husband's surprise 40th birthday & it got rave reviews.  I have made it several times since :))  Thank you!

This is excellent! Made it for my daughters lunch for school. She made sure I packed it everyday. Stuck to the recipe except; instead of dry salad dressing mix and balsamic vinegar I used Newmans Light Balsamic Vinegrette. I also used fresh herbs. The Asagio cheese makes the whole dish come together in my opinion. Already on the menu for next week! Thanks!

This recipe is soooo wonderful. The best I have ever had. When I made it I was out of black olives and asiago cheese. I used calamada olives and mozzarella instead. Everyone I make it for just LOVES it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Simply delicious!  I put this together the night before and then added the dressing about 3 hours before we ate.  Used cucumber instead of peppers because I forgot to buy them.  I also used about 12oz of pasta rather than a full pound.  Otherwise made as written and it's just great!  It makes a massive amount - plan for a group or to share.

Excellent!  I added diced zucchini and cucumber and exchanged the red pepper for an orange one to add another color.  I think that the dressing was delicious--way better than bottled.  This will now be my standard pasta salad!

made this for an Italian family reunion today and while I think it turned out just fine, I wasn't a huge fan.  I added artichoke quarters and kept everything else the same.  Looks like many people enjoyed it but for me i think there is just a tad too much of the salami and pepperoni flavors going thru it.  the dressing is very tasty though!  oh yea, i did change the peppers, used 1 red and 1 orange for color!

This is one of the best and most tasty pasta salads I have ever had!  I did take some of the reviewers suggestion of halving the oregano, and I added green onion.

Very tasty and my husband loved it!  I excluded the bell peppers (cuz I hate 'em), used sun dried tomatoes which really gave it a nice flavor and only 1 tablespoon of the oregano (2 tablespoons just looked like too much).  Found me a nice new recipe for work potlucks! Woo!

This was very good. I used the colored rotini, provolone cheese and a yellow pepper in place of the green, otherwise followed recipe. We did not care for the dressing so next time I will probably try the Three Cheese Vinegarette as suggested. This makes a huge bowl, great for picnics.

I was looking for a different cold pasta salad to serve instead of my standard and this was really good and easy to put together.  I used the tri-colored rotini as some other people did instead of the seashell pasta.  I also used Paul Newman's Family Style Italian dressing because I had an extra bottle in the cabinet I wanted to use up.  Next time I will definitely use the dressing as stated in the recipe and I am sure it will be even better.  I served this with Italian Style Pork Chops and Steamed Broccoli.  I will definitely be making again.

A good pasta salad, it tastes like most of what I get off of restaurant salad bars.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, used 4 roma tomatos, added a diced, seeded and peeled cucumber.  Cut the oil way down to about 1/3 of a cup.  I think the idea of clear balsamic is good, but I already had the regular stuff around, and it's expensive.  Like everyone else has said, better the second day.  I'll make it again.

this was really, really popular, and it maintained for days afterwards. I would go light on the spices in the dressing if you don't like a lot of that kind of thing.  But very easy to make and everyone likes to eat it.

Very, very good. I could eat this every day as a main meal and be perfectly satisfied. I find it tastes best when all the ingredients (veges, meats) are minced up somewhat finely instead of larger chunks.

Always turns out tasting and looking great.  I use clear balsamic vinegar instead of dark to keep the veggies and pasta from discoloring.

This recipe is delicious.  I just found the recipe this week and had to make it 2 different times because my 18 yr. old son could not stop eating it.  I added some summer sausage and proscuitto that I had in the frig. Very tasty. I know I will be making it again soon.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for!  It's like a meal in itself - so filling.  My local deli counter didn't have pepperoni or asiago cheese so I substituted ham and mozzarella and it was delicious!  Thansk for a great recipe - YUM!

This was amazing!  I made it for a barbeque a day ahead of time and kept in the fridge overnight.  About an hour before we ate I took it out and left on the counter so all of the oil and juices would loosen up a bit.  I used rotini pasta instead of seashells.  The asiago is key!  Everyone was asking what kind of cheese I used and everyone was standing in line to take home some leftovers!

This pasta salad has an amazing flavor to it and it's so versatile! I didn't have the cheeses that it called for on hand, so I grated my block of parmeggiano reggiano, and it came out great! I also had scallions on hand and chopped those up too for a nice onion kick, and I would feel comfortable adding any other fun things to this recipe: diced cooked potato's or carrots just for fun. Also, my friend makes this with tortellini pasta and it is a great filling salad! I think what gave this recipe the flavor that I liked was the package of dry italian dressing - what an amazing idea!

The best pasta salad I have ever had. I used a orange and yellow bell pepper. I did not make the dressing but used a balasmic dressing I had. I used Italian pesto pasta and it all turned out great.

Very good. Sorry but I changed it up based on personal preferences. I halved the recipe. Used 1/3 lb Genoa salami, 2 oz mozzarella, 1/4 C chopped red onion, 1 whole red bell pepper, no tomatoes & kept the seasonings & such the same. We eat this all the time. Thanks.

I loved this pasta salad, stuck to the recipe apart from the cheese, I used Mozzarella and Feta.  It was even better the next day and I had some which I heated in the microwave. This one is a keeper.

This is the best pasta salad recipe I've found.  I've made 10 times the recipe for 2 separate large gatherings, and every loves it.  I usually make half with meat and half without.  This keeps well for outdoor get togethers, as it is not mayo based.  I use grape tomatoes instead of regular; otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  Love it.

This is a great pasta salad, I only gave it 4 stars b/c I tweaked it a litte - I left out the peppers, added cucumber, and used cheddar instead of asiago. It is fabulous.

Very similar to a recipe that I have been making for years.  I use shredded mozerella cheese, I also add diced red onions.  I mix up the peppers, red, green, yellow, or orange.  I rough chop pepperoncinis.  I prefer hard salami the best and have the deli slice about 4 1/4 inch slices and dice them.  Going to make this for an upcoming party.

Very good pasta saled. Next time I would use less olive oil. The next day, I added some mayo to the pasta salad and it tasted wonderful.

This was unexpectedly one of the best recipes I have yet tried.   It was fantastic.  I had some trouble paring the recipe measurements down for a two person meal, but even with three days of left overs, neither my wife nor I  got tired of the meals.  I did substitute a hard salami for genoa because I prefer the flavoring.

Good.  Made a day in advance.  Made the dressing in the recipe and felt it was so easy and good that there isn't a need to use bottled.  Also, used turkey pepperoni to cut down on calories, but what's the point, I suppose?

I don’t want to completely trash this recipe because it is a great combination, but 2 tablespoons (maybe it should have been 2 teaspoons) of oregano was thick.  It overpowered the other great ingredients, and I love bold spices, but too much of any one can take you to a bad place.

A great pasta salad!  I made this for a birthday party and it got rave reviews. Only changes I made were using grape tomatoes, cut in half, rather than the chopped tomatoes, and rather than making the dressing as called for, I made the Good Seasons dressing with canola oil and red wine vinegar and used that. I only did that because when I went to make the dressing, I found I didn't have enough EVOO!  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Update - I made this again, following the recipe exactly and I really liked it much better with the Good Seasons dressing made rather than the way the recipe calls for.  Much too balsamic-y for me the way it's written.  Not even a contest!

This is a great recipe, a hit at my party, everyone loved it and were asking for the recipe. A couple changed that worked out for me were: rotini tri-color pasta; instead of olives, artichoke hearts; no tomatoes (give it a longer table life w/out refrigeration); let it marinate in fridge for about 12 hours. Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous recipe! My husband is a meat lover so next time I make it I will be adding a bit more, but other then that it was such a great dish. I served this on Christmas Eve along with some other first time recipes and this truly flew out of the bowl!:)Thank you for sharing this. We really enjoyed this!!!!!

I get excited when I know I have a lot of guests coming because I can make this recipe.  It is hard to make it in small portions since some of the ingredients are packaged.  Even though the recipe suggest serving the dressing on the side, I just mix it in anyway.  If there are leftovers it tastes awesome the next day too.

I have made this on several occasions (babyshower, potluck kids party)and there is NEVER any left overs. I use the tri-color pasta for added color, but it is good either way. TRY IT, you won't regret it!

I have made this pasta salad many times for different events; picnics, work potlucks, & football parties.  I never have leftovers.  This is the best pasta salad recipe I have found so far and tastes good for several days (be sure to mix up well and add more oil/vinegar if necessary).  I usually don't add pepperoni since I'm not a fan.

DELICIOUS!  This pasta salad is unique and wonderful.  Everyone raves about it and now requests it for potlucks.  I used a pint of grape tomatoes instead of slicing whole tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

I give it 5 starts for it versatility. You can't go wrong changing anything. I find it useful; to let it sit avernight. Put 1/2 dressing on before you refrigerate and add 1/2 before serving. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used a yellow pepper and an orange pepper instead of the red and green, it made it a little sweeter to balance it.  I also used mozzarella cheese... it was great and a huge hit!

This was good, but not worth the money.  From now on, I think I'll stick with using Kraft Zesty Italian dressing, and pepper jack cheese.  The recipe has a wonderful taste as is, and I would reccomend it!

This is my staple dish for cook outs and pot lucks...  I use Barilla pasta and it holds up great.  Many times I omit the "sauce" and leave it as a dry pasta salad and it is delicious!

Made this dish for an italian potluck and got rave reviews. Very tasty dish. Couldn't find Asiago cheese so used an italian blend of four cheeses and turned out fine.

THIS SALAD WAS A HIT. Not only did it look appetizing it was also delicious.
The only changes were, I used 3/4c. of the dressing and half the oregeno it called for. I would definetly make this again.

This pasta salad was delicious.  It was different from what I'm used too.  I liked the Asiago cheese. I didn't have any parsley at all.  But It still was good,

This salad is absolutely delicious!  I did however make two substitutions, since I didn't have them.  I used canola oil, instead of olive oil, and parmesean instead of asiago cheese.  It was perfect.  I will try it with olive oil and asiago next time though, just to get the full effect.

Delicious, everyone loved it at a picnic. Instead of making the dressing, I bought Newmann's olive oil/vinegar dressing and mixed in parmesean.

Made this for a friends 50th birthday party.  There was lots of pasta salads & this one was the first to  go & people were raving over it.  I used a combination of Parmesan, Asiago, & Romano cheeses.  I also add a jar of marinated artichoke hearts chopped up.  This is a keeper for outdoor potlucks since there is no mayo in it.

This turned out really nicely.  A good blend of flavors and textures.  My husband even ate the tomatoes, and he hates tomatoes!  The flavor was definitely better after allowing it to meld somewhat; ignore the instructions and marinate if you've got time.

Very tasty overall. I omitted the red and green peppers, and used red wine vinegar in place of the balsamic. I also used a shredded italian cheese blend (asiago, parmesan, and mozzerella). Big hit at the party- even better the next day after the flavors have marinated even more!  This does make a LOT of salad, though, so make sure you either scale it down if feeding less than a crowd.

Loved this salad! I wanted a new salad for dinner (too hot for a heavy meal) and this really satisified me and my husband. I lightened it up a lot by cooking 1C whole wheat pasta and using a whole bag of tri-colored cole slaw. Since there were only two of us, I used 1.5 oz salami, 2 slices of bacon, 1 italian sausage, skin removed and cooked/crumbled. Didn't have asiago cheese so used 1oz blue.With all this meat, didn't use any oil.

This is the best tasting pasta salad! I didn't put any meat or olives. The Asiago (or some other kind of cheese) is a must! I've used feta in it's place before. The dressing that is poured over is perfect. Great recipe! :)

Very good.  I added the dressing a couple hrs before serving to get all the flavors together.  I also used half the amount of asiago.

Instead of putting together the last 6 ingredients, I just bought a bottle of Italian dressing.
I used turkey pepperoni, Rontini pasta and added a chopped red onion.
Croutons are always good.

This salad was really good.  I made it for a dinner with our neighbors and left out the salami and added red onion.  The reviews were great from them - the neighbor guy who said he didn't usually care for pasta salads liked it enough to have a second helping!

I have been making this salad for a few years. I make it every 4th of July and it is requested over and over! The only changes I made is the olives-I use marinated black and green olives from the olive bar-no jars. I can not find asiago so I use parmesean. I put the salad together the day before, including the dressing, but I do not put it on the salad until ready to serve. I do like the suggestion to add some peppercinis (sp?). Overall, a great salad!!!

Sorry this was not good.  I thought it had to much of an oregano taste.  It might have been good if i used a bottled italian dressing. It was a waste of food.  I could not eat it.

This is one of a few recipes I have found here that I would not change.  It makes a large portion, so if you are making it for yourself one day, you'll have tons to each later in the week.  Thanks for submitting this.  This has become one of my favorites.

This was fantastic!  I made a few changes, used rotini instead of seashell pasta, omitted green pepper and asagio cheese, added articoke hearts, fresh mozzarella (in water) and smoke mozzarella.  Took this to a cook out with my Bolivian neighbors and they loved it!  Thank you so much...this will become a regular this summer!

To answer to the previous reviewer: Anti in Italian does not mean "against or "no" but "before". So, Antipasti/o is something you have before the pasta dish. However if you use typical antipasti in a pasta salad, it does become an antipasti pasta salad (not antipasto because it's the singular form...).

I, and everyone i've ever made it for has LOVED this salad.  I made it with no meat and substituted the asiago cheese with feta.  this makes it possible for vegetarians to eat without picking out the meat.  Also I think the feta goes better with the black olives than the asiago.

I made this and brought it to a birthday party and it was delicious. I made the dressing at home and took it in a container and then added it there right before I serve it, worked out great. Everyone loved it. GREAT!!!

This was great!  Where we live, you can't get pepperoni or Asiago cheese, so I used all salami and mozzarella cheese.  It made a TON, but I was glad because that meant more to eat for us!  I'll be making this again tomorrow.  YUMMY!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for a big family dinner, it was a hit. My husband LOVED this too! The asiago is yummy (my preference), but for those who are not keen on a cheese that tastes that strong, opt for mozzarella instead or just an even mix of the two. It makes a LOT, so scale down if you are making it for less than 6 people. We had some leftover and enjoyed eating for dinner the following day...along with a salad and some breadsticks. Thanks Dayna, this is going in my lil recipe box!

This was actually really good. You don't even need the seperate dressing, but it is good with that as well. I could only eat one small bowl though, because it was very filling. Leftovers were even better because the flavors got to sit and mingle overnight.

This was a big hit at dinner the other night. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the amount of oil. I tend to not really like too much oil anyway, so next time, I will up the balsamic vinegar and lower the oil amounts. I did a few substitutions this time around. I omitted the green and red peppers. Instead, I used roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, and pepperchinos. I used tri colored pasta for some color. Big hit. In fact, I have been asked to make it for this weekends party.

Easy, simple and tasty!  I made it for my work's potluck luncheon, having never tasted it before.  I was sure it'd be good, but it was better than I thought.  I left out the cheese, I'm lactose intolerant, and used soy Paremesan cheese.  I left out the tomatoes too, only because I didn't have any at the time.  I will make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I took the advice of another reviewer and bought white balsamic vinegar instead of the dark.  I omited the tomatoes since I didn't think they'd hold up for a long holiday weekend camping.  Everyone went crazy for the recipe, and said nothing needed to be changed.  If I had to change anything, I'd add more pasta next time, just because I like more pasta over hunks of cheese and meats in my pasta salad.  Enjoy!  ;)

This salad is amazing!  Made it for a party a couple of weeks back, and it was a hit!  I made some changes to it:  halved the recipe, used colored rotoni, used a yellow pepper instead of a green pepper, used cherry tomatos halved, used less EVOO then what was stated, used more balsamic and halved the oregano.  FABULOUS!  Will make again and again!  :)

WONDERFUL! I made this for our neighbor Memorial Day block party. Everyone loved it. Even my husband, who hates pasta salad, tried it. I'm pregnant right now and he knew how proud I was of it so I think out of sympathy for me and being scared of pregnant hormones, he tried it. He went back for seconds and thirds of it. I do use colored pasta for some fun. It was so good! I can't wait for another get together to make it again! Everyone was asking for the recipe but I wasn't into sharing that day. It was so easy to make and a lot of fun (I love cooking!) so I want to be able to bring this to everything!

I made this recipie, and gave half to a neighbor, who absolutly loved it.  The half we kept, I used for my husbands lunch and he loved it as well.  It kept well in the fridge.  I used Provolone instead and Procuttio(sp?) instead of the pepperoni.  My husband just isn't a pepperoni fan.  All in all a HUGE hit and will certainly be making this again!!

Excellent salad and super easy to make. I doubled the dressing (as per other reviewers.) I used extra sharp cheddar cheese(instead of asiago) because that is what I had on hand. This is the perfect summer salad.  Thanks Dayna!

Good recipe. I used provalone cheese instead of asiago and cherry tomatoes cut in half. I also found white basalmic vinegar so it didn't turn brown. Next time I would use a little less oregano but that's just my taste. My company really liked it and it did make a lot. They all took doggie bags.

This recipe was amazing. I made it for my family and they absolutely loved it! The ingredients combine beautifully and taste great! The salad dressing mix really makes a great addition. The next time I make it, I might add prosciotto instead of peperoni. I might also use some charp provolone to kick it up. Thank you so much !

I brought this salad to work for a luncheon and everyone loved it.  I didn't have any olives on hand so I added canned artichoke hearts instead.  I too cut down on the EVOO just a little bit.  Thanks, Dayna!

Maybe it's an "aquired taste" but I'd need a lot of time to aquire it.  I just didn't care for this dressing at all.  Way too much oregano and somewhat strong.  I made this for a carry-in at work and before I added the dressing to the huge salad (it's huge!) I decided to strain it to get rid of some of the oregano.  I added some garlic to try giving it more of an "Italian" taste and it wasn't bad.  I also added red onions and a yellow pepper.

I love the salad, but I probably would use my own dressing next time.  It's just not my taste.

This is my honey's favorite recipe!  It does make enough for a couple of lunches for him. Its a great make-ahead lunch..so in the morning he can grab it and go. I make it at least once a week.  I omit the bell peppers. Its an excellent recipe and you can add or delete what you like.  I use rotini pasta instead of seashell and chedder cheese instead of asiago.

I thought this salad was good, but on the advice of others I halved the oregano and still thought it was too strong.  Definitely needs less, probably more like 1/2 tbsp.  I also added provolone cheese, used roasted red peppers instead of fresh and reconstitued sundried tomatoes instead of fresh.  All in all it was very good.

Because of all the rave reviews for this recipe; I choose to make it for our neighborhood block party.  It definitely takes longer to prepare than the time specified.  It was tasty, however, I was a bit disappointed IMO it didn't live up to its reviews.  I followed recipe as written, the only changes I made, I added some artichoke hearts.  I think there are other pasta salads that require less prep. and/or less costly ingredients, that are just as tasty.

This was excellent, exactly as I hoped it would be. I agree that the balsamic vinegar adds an unfortunate brown color to everything, but it's worth it for the flavor. Asiago cheese has a very strong taste, so I used less of that and balanced it out with mozzarella and provolone, and also substituted roasted red peppers (from a jar) for the bell peppers. Finally, to try and speed up the chopping, I ordered the meat from the deli counter, having it sliced extra thick. That saved me a little time at the cutting board.

Very good pasta salad recipe. Similar to the one I usually make with the exception of the pepperoni and asiago cheese. I usually use only salami and cheddar cheese but I must say, the addition of the pepperoni and asiago was a nice change.

I made the full recipe thinking it was going to be too much; however, it was all gone in 2 days with people begging me for more.  My boyfriend took it to work and all the guys there called me and made me promise to make more for them the next day. This recipe was phenomenal.  No one believed I really made it.  Impressed my boyfriend,co-workers,family,etc.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.

This makes a lot (enough for 10+ adults), I used multi colored rotini (shells didnt come multi colored). I didnt have access to asiago cheese so I used provolone. I went to the deli and had a couple of 1/2 inch slabs of the meats and cheese cut. Very easy to put together once the special purchases are made. I've made this twice and requests for the recipe each time.

Excellent! I made this salad for a party and it lasted maybe ten minutes!!  It's a hearty salad that's full bodied enough to stand on it's own or as a great compliment to a meal. I found that a hint of balsamic vinigrette adds a great flavor.

A very good pasta salad - a little on the bland side.  So we switched the black olives to kalamata olives, added feta cheese and 1/4 cup more of balsamic vinegar.  Came out great!

There is not enough good things I can say about this recipe.  I made this for my party last night and everyone loved it.  I am a vegetarian so I had to pick out the meat which was fine.  I think this would also be a great recipe to add other vegetables like cucumbers, onions, etc.  I also cut back a bit on the olive oil.  I prepared it the night before and added the dressing about an hour before serving.  It was sooooooo good!!

OOOOHHHH MYYY GOODNESS! What a wonderful change for the usual salad! I left out the black olives, and used calabrese meat, and hot salami, and the asiago cheese, ohh myy.. I also left the dressing on overnight and the salad was just as good, if not better the next day! Hot and spicy, but worth the tums!
Thanks!

Easy recipe that tastes great.  Cutting the oil and vinegar to 1/3 cup does not change the taste and decreases the calories

I had really high expectations of this recipe based on the reviews, but I did not find it all that exciting or tasty. Maybe it's because I used grated asiago cheese. Also, it is EXTREMELY high fat.

I will no loger be using my antipasto recipe because my family loved this one. My daughter even requested to take left overs with her to camp the next day. I used spiral pasta instead of seashell and it worked very well. The meaning of "anti" pasta is that you don't use pasta at all, but I always do use it, gives it more substance. It takes a while to prepare, but well worth it!

I had something similar to this at my sister-in-law's home and really enjoyed it.  Although I found her recipe a bit better as she used larger chunks of deli meats and different types of cheeses, I think this one comes to a close second.  Congratulations on publicating this wonderful salad.

This is delicious!  It was truly a crowd pleaser for the adults.  None of the kids liked it, but that was just fine because it left more for us.  I think this will be a big hit at parties this summer.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellant, the taste was out of this world.  It's the balsmic vinegar.  I actually ran out of salad, which was a first for me.

Lots of good comments about this pasta salad when I served it recently. I stayed pretty true to the recipe, except used grape tomatoes and cut them in half, added artichoke hearts and  olives..yummy!!! Makes a beatiful colored presentation too.

We call this 'Anything I have in the house' pasta salad. This does not need to be nor should be a rigorous follow the rules recipe.

Stars for being good, fewer for being unimaginative

This is delicious as written!  It's also great because once you get the flavors, you can adapt it to whatever your tastes are.  I now add garbanzo beans, provolone cheese, artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers.  I also use bottled balsamic dressing.  It's delicious as written, or you can mix and match to suit your tastes!

Omitted the meat for a vegetarian pasta salad, and it was delicious! Crowd favorite and I will definitely make again. Made everything else as written. This makes A LOT of salad, but was great the next day, too.

I made this for an office pot luck, and everyone loved it. The only change I made was to add less pasta (12oz) and used bowtie instead of seashell. Also, I made the full amount of dressing, but didn't add all of it. I poured it in until it appeared to have enough. Very good! I would make this again.

I love lots of flavors so I added:
Banana peppers,
Artichokes,
Green onions,
Garbanzo beans,
Minced garlic. 
Then I subbed pesto for the dressing mix and mozzerella and feta for the cheeses. Amazing! I also just used Brianna's brand balsamic dressing.

I made this for my son’s graduation and it’s quite delicious. In the future,  I will opt for a different kind of cheese other than asiago. I’m not a fan of the asiago as it’s very strong and has a slight bitter taste. I agree with some other reviewer‘s who recommend adding the dressing  right before serving. However, I think the best method is to use half of the dressing & let it soak overnight and then use the other half about a half an hour before serving.

This was great as is. I took it to a potluck, and everyone loved it. The only change I made was to use white balsamic in place of regular balsamic, as someone else suggested. It was delicious! It seems very versatile and would hold up well with any substitutions/additions of meat, cheese, and veggies.

This pasta salad is pretty tasty! As recommended by other reviewers, I used cherry tomatoes and substituted with bowtie pasta. I also added jarred artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers. I also added thinly sliced red onion. 
I was going to grade the Asiago cheese since it is pretty strong tasting and I did not want it to dominant the whole dish. Although, when I tasted the asiago with the spicy pepperoni I realized how well they pare together! So I diced the cheese in small cubes and the flavors in the pasta salad were very well balanced.

Good, but very expensive and not really anything special.  Not worth the price for me.  It does make a lot and is good for a large gathering, but it really was not popular when I served it.

This was a TRUE hit with my entire family.....wonderful, I used bottled Italian dressing, just a cheap one instead of dry mix.

This tasted pretty good, I ended up doubling the vinegar and using only 1/2 cup of oil. I also added 2 tsp of thyme.

After spending far too much on deli antipasto salad, I decided to make my own. This recipe was the perfect substitute! Our girls don't like salami or pepperoni so I omit the meat, use tri-colored rotini pasta and add marinated artichoke hearts. It's always a hit and gets better after a day in the fridge.

Doubled the recipe for a party. Worked beautifully and was very well received. Two notes: I always use Kalamata olives if a recipe says black olives because I think they add way more flavor and I let the pasta salad sit overnight then added the liquid dressing just before the dinner. This recipe is a keeper!

I followed advice and used Paul Newman’s dressing, added pepperoncini, green onions, cherry tomatoes. Still added half Packet of dry Italian dressing. I made one batch for my ladies meeting at church using the colored tortellini. And I used the shells for a get together at work for second batch. I would use the mini shells and not the regular shells next time. Adding all the extra vegetables made the batches bigger. I had to send home food with people and still had leftovers. So the 12 servings are very large servings. Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.

I changed it quite a bit so don’t know if it would be 5 as is.  Used it as a base recipe....  Family loved it  I left out Salami, Asiago, red pepper, italian seasoning packet & olive oil.   Subbed fresh mozzerella for cheese (had in house) used about a 1/3 c. Mayo with balsamic and parsley and oregano seasoning.  For italian seasoning used a about 1/2 t of salt, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, tad of thyme.   I added celery but won’t next time.  Would like red pepper but didn’t have in-house would probably add one more tomato too.

I have made this several times. Once, I used Good Seasons Zesty Italian dry mix. Not as good as the original. Also, make sure you use a quality balsamic and a quality olive oil. Yesterday, I made it again and cut the olive oil by 1/4 cup. Other than that, I follow the recipe to a tee! We love this for a summer dinner or lunch.

I made this pasta salad for our 4th of July barbecue/picnic on our patio.   There were 12 of us and there were no complaints but lots of kudos.  The salad was prepared according to recipe with no changes.  Everything was made the day before and refrigerated.  The dressing and chopped tomatoes were added at the last minute.

I made some changes based on our preferences and what we had on hand but this is an extremely good recipe!  We substituted mozzarella instead of Asiago and didn’t put in olives due to kids.  Used tricolor spiral rotini for same reason.  We had some red onion and cucumber on hand and decided to add those too.  We used a container of cherry tomatoes instead of regular and used shredded Parmesan instead of grated.  We also just added 1 red pepper (no green on hand).  We added a little more vinegar to the dressing.  *important note re dressing* the Italian dressing packet is missing from the directions.  I was wondering how this was rated so highly when the dressing tasted so bad.  I knew I bought the dressing mix for a reason... scrolled up and there it was!  Much better after adding that.

I will be making this again...didn't have the same pasta the recipe called for but I think any bite-sized pasta will always work. Also, as somewhat of a traditionalist, I used Mediterranean olives (Greek, Kalamata, and Spanish Green) instead of canned black olives, marinated artichoke hearts,  grilled red peppers, 1/2 cup quartered cucumber, and about 1/4 cup of red onion chopped. I also used shaved and grated parmesan cheese as I had that on hand but will make it in the future with delicious Asiago! HINT: If you save jars to pour used oil into, use one of them to make the dressing ... way neater and easier to blend!

It was amazing! I made it the day before and put half the dressing in then and the other half I put in the next morning. Definitely make it at least a day in advance! I did everything as the recipe dictated except I added banana peppers and I was fairly liberal with the grated parmesean-I threw extra in the following morning when I put in the other half of the dressing

I have made this several times for BBQs as aside dish. It's was very highly complimented. I did make a few additions and changes by using whole wheat pasta instead of regular pasta and by adding a cup of cooked Farro and a cup of cooked Quinoa to the mix.  Everyone raved about it and liked the more healthful additions of whole and ancient grains.

Delicious!!!! I added just a tad bit more meat and also used mini red, its age, and yellow peppers since that's all I had. Didn't find asiago cheese so we used a type of provolone.

This is delicious! Really loved it! It would have been great as written but we like some additional kick. I added pepperoncini, artichoke hearts and used a balsamic dressing I had in the house with an added packet of zesty Italian dr swing. Will make again!

Delicious pasta salad! I will tweak the ingredients based on what I have available in the fridge. My family prefers fresh mozzarella instead of asiago and I prefer to leave the salami out and just use pepperoni. I also add more veggies to the salad including cucumbers and small broccoli florets. I've passed on this recipe several times after getting so many requests and compliments!

The salad was perfect for a church pot luck luncheon.  I made a few minor changes:  added small mozzarella balls quartered, reduced the oil since the meats are fatty, and made it the night before and dressed it before serving.  If you do that, add a little oil to the pasta so it doesn't stick overnight.  The dried Italian salad dressing really makes it tasty.  This salad is so versatile you can add just about anything - roasted red peppers, artichokes, etc. Have fun experimenting.

Visually from this website- it looked very appealing and because this was the 1st time I made it, stuck true to the recipe with these exceptions: made the salad and refrigerated over night without the dressing. I also added chopped artichoke hearts ( in water/not oil). My recommendations for next time is to use a milder cheese (Jack?) The Asiago cheese was, for my taste, too dry and strong. It overpowered the recipe. I would also cut into niblets not chunks. Overall the spices were balanced and felt this was more an adult pasta salad than kid friendly.

I love this recipe! I made it as is for years, but since turning vegetarian I've cut out the meat and it's still good! I also use a little less oil, often replace the asiago with mozzarella, and don't usually bother with the parmesan.

I think this would be the perfect picnic salad for a large crowd.  It's heavy, so it was a bit much to just have with any ordinary dinner at home (also expensive! ). Flavor was amazing though, and will take for the next potluck.

Phenomenal!  Made this for a BBQ. Added about half the dressing and let sit in fridge overnight.  Stirred in half of what was left and let sit for another day.  Stirred in the rest of the dressing before serving. Absolutely perfect. Everybody raved about it.  The few days let all the flavors mix, marinade and soak in. Al dente pasta is key

This is a wonderful pasta salad. Only modification I made was to omit the green pepper. I substituted yellow and orange peppers. Absolutely delicious! I will make this again next time I need a pasta salad.

This was a great recipe but not without some changes. I didn't have Asiago cheese so instead I just put in extra parmesan. I also added about 2/3s of a red onion (finely chopped) which I think is a MUST with pasta salads. Some reviewers suggested adding more balsamic just before serving and I think that sounds like a great  idea because the pasta did dry up most of the dressing overnight. I also think granulated garlic would be a great addition, next time.

I used bow tie pasta instead of shell, and  I had some Pampered Chef basil seasoning (sort of a mix of dried basil, salt, pepper and another spice or two) and used that instead of the packaged dry Italian seasoning.  We loved this salad!

I really liked this recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I didn't have the ingredients to make the dressing so I just used a bottle of Italian that had Parmesan in it   I also used cheddar cheese along with the asiago, and omitted the olives since I don't like them.  It still turned out great though, and everyone loved it.

I accidentally left out olives and Parmesan but it was still great and a nice departure from plain pasta salad and all the mayo!! I also used the 3 cheese shaved Italian cheese to save time on shredding my own. Definitely great for a party or grilling out.

Made this as written for a graduation party and I thought it was very good. There wasn't a whole lot left, and got a few positive comments on it. It was a nice change from my "go-to" pasta salad that I always make.

Awesome salad.   I have made this many times and everybody loves it.  This last time I used Olive Garden bottled dressing.  Made it the day before and mixed with half the dressing.. Just before serving added the rest of the dressing.

I read the reviews on this prior to making and it seemed like a winner.  I made this yesterday and I can't rave enough about it. Everybody wanted the leftovers.  The only change I made, because I read it in reviews, was reduced the amount of oil to 1/2 cup and reduced the oregano to 1 tablespoon.  I highly recommend making this, especially for parties.  It feeds many people.

I used a pack of cherry tomatoes and cut them in half, and I grated the cheese. I bought the pepperoni with the salt brine on the outside. The deli people call it "margarita".  ??. It's chilling in the fridge now. I have this in my recipe box.   And many thanks to everyone who has ever contributed recipes, otherwise my dining would be boring.

Love this recipe! But I did make some changes: I used a Zesty Italian seasoning packet over all the chopped ingredients ( I used a red pepper, a green pepper, half a pound of square cut Colby jack cheese, an 8 oz package of mozzarella pearls, a small Roma tomato, a quarter pound of salami and pepperoni), then in a separate bowl I mixed 3/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 1/2 tablespoons oregano, and 3/4 tablespoon minced garlic. I combined it all and sprinkled Parmesan all over it. Super delicious, will definitely be a commonly made meal in our house!

Have made this a few times and it makes a great  appetizer, or side. I usually 1/2 the amount of pasta and the recipe and eyeball the amount of meat and cheese opting for the more is better approach. The use of white balsamic suggested by another reviewer is a great tip. Also, coating the salad with a very generous amount of  the dressing before allows it to soak into the pasta giving this an even better flavor. This salad can be personalize with just about anything you like. I do like to add a good amount of  good Pecorino Romano grated cheese on top when serving.

Yummy recipe. It makes a huge bowl so beware if you don't have a lot of people to feed. I couldn't find Asiago cheese so I used 1 lbs of Mozzarella cheese and it was fine. I left out the pepperoni and added more salami which was fine. I left out the green bell pepper, but used one red pepper. I bought a good quality bottle of olive oil Italian dressing with loads of herbs and ignored buying the mix and doing all of that myself. I left out the  oregano, and parsley just because I thought it didn't really need it since my dressing had tons of herbs. I accidentally left out the balsamic vinegar at the end, but would add the next time since I love it. It was a very good recipe so you have to make it how you would personally like it. Just be sure to let sit in the frig overnight to be sure all of the flavors mix well. Since it made so much I literally ate this pasta salad for a week. I would recommend trying it out.

Great recipe! I omitted the olives, substituted bowtie pasta, used finely chopped red bell peppers, and dressed it with Newman's Own Lite Balsamic Vinaigrette instead of making the dressing from a packet. This pasta salad is hearty enough for the meat eaters yet light enough to make a great standalone meal.  It's great the next day as the flavors intensify the longer it sits so you could easily make it a day ahead. I will definitely make it again!

I made it for my lunch group at work and everyone liked it.  I used Rotini noodles instead of shells and I used Mozzarella cheese instead of Asiago and left everything else the same.  I mixed everything the night before, but I did not add the dressing until the morning.  I think that helped the dressing flavors blend together  and the noodles did not soak it all up overnight.

Fantastic and might be the best I've had. I added bottled Italian dressing to the leftovers the next day and it was even better as it sat! I like to make filling cold pasta salads for the kids when I work, so that they always have something available when I'm not home. My daughters loved it..my son was like ehhhh. But he's the pickiest eater in the world and I will still make this every few weeks.

I made exactly as written and it was great!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to let the dressing sit for a while before adding it in, because the dried herbs need a little time to get un-crunchy and let the flavors meld.  I would also reduce the amount of oil, but that's a personal preference.  Even yummier on day 2.

Best pasta salad I have ever made/had. My biggest issue with pasta salad is I feel they get dry or have no taste. This one had both and was amazing. Took it to a party and everyone wanted the recipe and no leftovers. I followed the directions except I just used a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette, put half on the night before and then the other half just before serving. For color reasons I did an orange and yellow pepper and green onions. This dish is not only yummy but beautiful to serve. Yes a little bit of work with the cutting of ingredients but totally worth it!

The recipe and reviews prompted me to buy a few ingredients so I could make this.  Great basic recipe.  Also added some chopped marinated artichoke hearts,  banana peppers and chopped smoked sundried tomato, while omitting one fresh tomato.  The dressing seemed a heavy EVOO to vinegar mix, but I didn't see that in other reviews so I followed it.  After tasting, I decided to add another 1/4 cup of vinegar.  Guess we like more zip.  Following other reader suggestions I did put some on the salad before chilling.  Didn't use all the dressing when serving but used the remainder on another salad the next day.   Sent some the Antipasto to my neighbor who said it's what she calls pasta salad.  Later she called to apologize and ask for the recipe as it definitely was not JUST pasta salad!  I served with crusty bread but my husband who loves warm crusty bread skipped it,  focusing entirely on the salad.  Will definitely be making again.

I made this for a large gathering and lots of people asked for the recipe - most asking about the dressing.  This makes a ton, so if you're just making it for the family, you need to half it and plan on having leftovers!  Personally, I found the pepperoni a little over-powering, so I might leave out the next time.  I used three packages of halved grape tomatoes.

Made this for a game day with the ladies. Had raves all around and everyone wanted the recipe. My salad came out a little darker than the picture after I used Balsamic vinegar but it was still delicious. I wanted to bring some home for my evening supper and there was nothing left and this makes a lot of salad. I felt this was a compliment and will make it again!!

Great Italian recipe that you can adjust to fit your preferences. I added sweet onions, extra olives and used my own Italian dressing. Had Monterey Jack on hand so I used that instead of the Asiago, imagine any mild cheese will do though I have a feeling that Provolone would be amazing as well. This travels very well too btw. Brought it to the beach for a lovely al fresco dinner with the family:)

I made this for a pitch-in for school. I didn't have any salami so I grilled some kielbasa that I had cubed it and threw it in. I also had some pickled red onions that I tossed in. I should have doubled the batch, it was completely gone! Simple, easy and delicious - thanks!

This is my favorite pasta salad recipe. For a low-carb version, I like to use zucchini and summer squash in place of the pasta.   I cut the zucchini in the shape of noodles using my spiralizer.  It always gets rave reviews!

Excellent!  Made 1/2 box of pasta, used cheddar cheese, and used the entire amount of dressing.  I did use regular olive oil not extra virgin and only used 1 tablespoon of oregano (I felt that was enough).  A week later I tried it with red wine vinegar and did NOT like it that time and neither did my husband.  The next day it is very dry, but has good flavor!  Thank you for the recipe!

Just made this and it's so good. Made the mistake and combined the dry Italian dressing to the liquid mixture. It didn't seem to matter still great tasting.

I used packets of Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix.  I don't know if it was that mix or if it was the pepperoni, but it was so salty I could not eat this until I rinsed off half of the pasta.

Love this recipe! I make it exactly as written (except I use a pkg. cherry tomatoes) as it is always a crowd pleaser. Great for parties, tailgates, potlucks, or just to keep in your fridge to eat throughout the week.

I made this for my stepsons baseball picnic. I didn't use tomatoes as I have a tomatoe allergy. I used Paul Newmans Balsimic Vinegerette. This turned out great and my picky eater stepkids tore it up. Everyone that had it at the picnic went back for seconds and thirds. This will be made again. With using the Balsimic Vinegerette I don't think you need the olive oil. If it is not moist enough for you just add more of the salad dressing...

I didn't care for the dressing, it was kinda bland. I made it exactly as directed and found it very oily. I may make this again using a store bought dressing. Other than that The mix of ingredients was great and had lots of variety.

This has become my "Go To" recipe for summer get togethers. 
I make it up a day in advance and slightly under cook the pasta.

If you are bold and like Ceaser salad you can get the Greek style dried salad mix and use that with some anchovy blended into the oil and vinegar.   

I have also used poblano peppers instead of bell peppers, just a bit hotter and lots more crunch.

I did make several changes to this recipe, but they were really substitutions rather than changes. Anyway, I just used pepperoni (left out the salami) and cheddar rather than asiago, added some chopped red onion, and used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic. Also I didn't bother with adding the tablespoon of parmesan since frankly, I don't see how much of an impact it could make in this huge bowl of pasta salad. Loved using the Good Seasons salad dressing in this... It's so much better than bottled dressing. This went over very well at a Memorial Day barbecue yesterday - everyone seemed to love it!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated except we don't like olives so I left them out.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt to the dressing and was afraid it would be too salty but it was perfect!  The best pasta salad recipe I have ever eaten~

I'm giving 4 stars only because of too much oregano.  I cut the oregano to 1 Tbls. and it was much better.  Also, cut the oil to 1/2 cup and increased LIGHT balsamic vinegar by 2 Tbls.  It's better when it sits in the fridge with the dressing on. I love it with olive oil, but the oil coagulates (something I did not now). You can't eat it right from the fridge.  It must set out for the EVOO to de-coagulate. This may be why it seems dry at first. I will be making it with veg. oil in the future only so I don't have that problem.  Other than that, it's great.  It definitely is better when it sits longer in the fridge. The Asiago is a must.  Used whole grape tomatoes (cut tomatoes get "funky" after a while).  These ingredients make it "antipasto."

Great recipe! A couple changes that we really enjoyed....rotini instead of shells, and feta instead of asiago. The last change I made was regarding the dressing. I made it according to the packet instructions and then whisked in a little ranch ( packet+ sour cream) into the dressing. Not a lot, just a little to make it a bit creamy. Will make again!

Made this according to directions and did not care for it. Everyone agreed that the overwhelming taste was the olive oil and that it was very bland. Even tried to liven up the taste with parmesan and italian dressing to no avail.
 Wont' make this again.

I made this for a church staff meeting.  It was expensive to make with the Genoa salami and Asiago cheese and turned out just ehhh.  I really wanted it to be awesome b/c the Genoa salami and Asiago cheese were so good together....but it just didn't hit the spot....with anyone.

Best antipasto salad ever!! I made it as recipe said except for I too just went with Newman's balsamic vin. and it was perfect! Heads up-this make a TON! Could have made 1/2 & had plenty. I think next time I will skip the pepperoni & double up on salami. PS-the asiago BELONGS in this salad! Thank you Dayna!

Made some changes :
I used Kraft "Anything" dressing, balsamic with asiago  cheese flavored. Used Tri-Color Rotini just to add character. Added diced pepperoni instead of other meats, flavored feta cheese & omitted the peppers.
I really enjoyed my twist to this salad.

A great salad! Very flavorful and filling... wonderful comfort food...Used two parts Italian salad dressing and one part balsamic vinegrette for the dressing but then added the other spices. Also did not use the pepperoni but it was great anyway... lots of flavor happening.. Thanks Dayna!

I scaled this down to make six servings; left out the olives and added some sweet onions.   Next time, I will use a little less balsamic vinegar; it was a bit too much for my taste.  All enjoyed this; I have some leftover for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing

I just needed a simple pasta salad dressing. i like creamy pasta but with an italian flavor...so I mixed this recipe with Allison's Pasta Salad. Both recipes were very good on their own but excellent together..I tossed with cheese tortellini and broccoli.

Very nice, flavorful salad...I used wagon wheel pasta.  Especially loved the diced Asiago cheese because it has such a nice sharp flavor to complete the chopped meats.

OK - got myself a new favorite pasta salad!!  And others have said, I was asked by many to share the recipe!  This is a great start for the antipasto pasta salad.  I omitted the olives, used different colored peppers, and added pepperocinis.  I also used the Kraft Asiago Cheese Balsimic Vinegar low fat dressing.  Thanks for sharing!

Expensive to make but a really good salad. I scaled down to 4 servings and used the 'Italian Dressing Mix' from this site in place of the packaged mix.  I also used both red wine vinegar and balsamic and it was wonderful.

DO NOT leave out the Asagio!  It makes this pasta salad so terrific!  The fresh veggies and the meats were great.  This was an easy to make dish and so very delicious!  Thank you!

Followed advice of other readers, added the pepperoncini, artichokes, omitted the green pepper and added green onions. Decreased the olive oil it turned out great!

This pasta salad was WONDERFUL! I didn't use any salami, I used grape tomatoes cut in 1/3rds (they were a little large for grape tomatoes...) and added some cucumber. I made the dressing the night before and put everything together the morning of. It worked out well.

Well, I'm obviously in the minority on this one.  I thought this was just so-so.  I think it would have been much better with a robust Italian dressing, rather than the balsamic dressing in the recipe.  I liked the idea of this salad with the salami and pepperoni so I may try this again with Italian and see if it's more to my liking.

So delightful!  My husband subbed in feta for the asiago but other than that, we followed the recipe exactly.  So good!  Hoping the leftovers tomorrow are even better.  Thanks!!

A good basic pasta salad.  I used fusilli.  I was (personally...) not crazy about the dressing, or all the asiago cheese.  I'd make the same salad again with a different dressing and maybe change the cheese, maybe to mozzerella diced and parmesan in slivers.

Nice recipe, I used tricolored corkscrew pasta, and little extra balsamic vinegar, used fresh mozzarella and not Asiago.   Very tasty and easy to make. I did find that if you eat it as leftovers you need to add more of the balsamic vinegar

I wasn't impressed with this salad.  It was very expensive and not worth the money. I felt it was a bit bland.  My fiance however, thought it was delicious and can't get enough.  That is why I gave it three stars.

only giving this one a 3 because my inlaws loved it. i wanted to make a pasta salad that was different from the norm this fit the bill. i tasted it b/f the dressing and it wasn't bad, really dry but not bad. put dr. on when served. my mom,husband and self really could not eat it. thank goodness the inlaws liked. they were happy to take leftovers home. and that was good because it was some what exspensive to make.thanks anyway for some good ingrediant ideas with a really different dressing i might try it again.

This recipe was yummy...but was missing something:  Garlic!  On my second batch I whisked in 2 cloves of minced garlic and it made all the difference.  I also used provolone instead of asiago to save $$.

this is our favorite pasta salad! I use a bottle of the newmans own balsamic (light) dressing instead of the oil/vinegar mixture. Make one day ahead of time so that the flavor has time to "blend" in the fridge for 24 hours.

This is absolutely the best pasta salad. I have made it a few times now, always to rave reviews. I knew it was a winner when I made it to sell at our swim team's concession stand -where they sell pasta salad every week- and it was the first one sold out and numerous people asked me for the recipe. That is unheard of because usually pasta salad is so standard.

Excellent recipe!  I only made a couple of changes based on what I had in the kitchen, and it turned out delicious!  Instead of including salami and pepperoni, I just used pepperoni and doubled the amount.  Also, I didn't have any balsamic vinegar on hand so I used red wine vinegar.  And finally, I used mozzarella cheese, which added a great flavor.

This is a great pasta salad, and it is easy to customize towards your own tastes! I dont really like raw peppers or balsamic vinegar so instead I replaced the peppers with a jar of roasted red pimento peppers that I had and used zesty italian dressing in place of the oil, balsamic vinegar and dressing mix So yummy! for extra freshness this recipe is also good with a couple tbsp fresh basil mmmmmmm

Great pasta salad.  I mixed all of the meats, cheeses and veggies while waiting for my pasta to boil, and I think I liked this better than when I added the pasta.  I used jarred red peppers instead of fresh.  Next time, I may add artichoke hearts as well.

Very unique and tasty. It is NOT an INEXPENSIVE salad to make, however. I changed a few things according to my tastes:  first, instead of typical pasta, I used (precooked) tortellini, substituted feta cheese for the asagio, used halved cherry tomatoes so it wasn't so "messy looking" and for the dressing replaced 1/4 cup of the oil with 1/4 cup Italian salad dressing. I also use the Good Seasons "Zesty Italian" dry dressing packet.  It is much better when made the day/night before.

Very good, people always ask me for the recipe. I use spiral pasta instead of seashell. I use a 7 oz. package of pepperoni slices instead of hte deli salami and pepperoni sausage...I cut the slices in half. I also used cubed mozzarella or colby jack, also chopped in half. Instaed of the bell pepper, I use a 10 oz. jar of artichokes, also chopped. I use whole cherry tomatoes and 2 packages of the dressing mix, reserving half of one for the actually dressing. Yum!

This recipe was really good. Made only a few slight changes, first I used Salad pasta and mozzarella cheese (personal preference), also I used double the dry dressing packets and extra EVOO and Balsamic Vinegar as I found it to be a bit dry. A crowd pleaser for sure. It is now requested at any party I attend.

I omitted the salami and asiago cheese since I did not have it. Used mozzarella instead.  Great dressing, did cut back on the oil.

I had to use a 3-cheese blend instead of only asiago.  More expensive than my usual pasta salad recipe, but tasty. Don't skip the red pepper.

This recipe was just ok - but to be fair I did make some changes that may have altered the taste.  I did not use Asiago, as I didn't have it on hand.  I asked for genoa salami at the deli, but they gave me hard and it was just too greasy and I didn't care for the taste (much prefer genoa).

I made this for a birthday party. HUGE hit. I changed it just a little bit. I added sun-dried tomatoes, and instead of using oregano and parsley, I just used italian seasoning, and I used hard salami instead of genoa, and I omitted the olives-personal choice. Everything else was the same and it was wonderful. I took this to my office the next day-because it does make a lot-and I had left overs for a day. It was good every time I ate it. Not oily, not dry. Just right! I think I might add some peppers this time for July 4th and see how that goes. Great choice when feeding a large group.

Great Basic recipe, you can add whatever you like! Made this for a family thing and everyone loved it. I just used bottled italian dressing rather than what the recipe called for, still turned out good!

Very good salad. Kept for several days. I added additional Kraft Italian dressing I made up from the packet as well as marinated artichoke hearts and onions. I also could not find the specified cheese and used non-smoked Provolone and grated Parmesan cheese.

I made it with NO MEAT!  This is YUMMY and cheap recipe!  Although I made a few alterations:  1 lb. med shell pasta, 3 sm. cans sliced black olives, 1 green 1 red bell pepper, 2 c finely shredded mozzarella & parmesan blend cheese, 2 tomatoes, 1 envelope (.7oz)dry italian dressing mix.  Then made the dressing as is.  YUMMY!!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  It didn't need the salad dressing mix and I didn't have any so I omitted that.  I also did not use the meat, olives, or peppers.  Instead I substituted corn, celery, and some other veggies.

This recipe was awesome! I made it for a luncheon of 40 people and the people were asking me if they could the leftovers home. The only thing I would modify is maybe not put as much of the dressing on it.

I have been making this pasta salad for a couple of years now and have given the recipe out so many times.  It a big hit every time I make it.  The only change I make is using rotini pasta and sharp cheddar cheese.  It really is the best pasta salad I ever tasted.

I used ditalini pasta and diced everything to be the same size as the pasta.  Added onion and garlic and used grape tomatoes but kept everything else the same.  It does make a lot!  We really enjoyed this!

I used this recipe as a base and have gotten an amazing result.  I only had mini seashell pasta, so I used that.  I substituted mozzarella cheese for the asiago and also threw in some leftover provolone.  I only put in one green fresh pepper, however, I also added 3 marinated red peppers (not roasted).  I then substituted green olives with pimentos for the black olives.  Finally, I made my own dressing with 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tbsp parsley, 1/3 cup olive oil, 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 2 tbsp white vinegar, and 1/2 tsp dijon mustard to make sure the dressing emulsified.  Everything else I kept the same.  YUMMMO - it is like one big giardiniera - even the pasta tastes mildly pickled.  But I guess that is because i poured the dressing over everything and let it sit and get absorbed.  Alright - I can't talk about the salad anymore - I have to go eat it now.   UPDATE:  I found that this recipe does not keep very well.  I made it on Saturday and on Monday it was getting a little too vinegary and sour (but that may be because of my marinated peppers).  Either way, make sure you make it for a party, not just for yourself or your family, because there is just too much to eat within 2 days.  But the recipe sure is DELICIOUS.

This is awesome!! Been making it for a couple years now. Husband gets very excited when he knows I am making this. I make it for summer get togthers or weekend suppers where I don't want to cook. We'll just eat it for 2 or 3 days in a row. Some crusty bread and a green salad or raw veggies and good to go!

Love this recipe!! ! It's a fun salad to put in whatever sounds good to you that day. I've tried all different kinds of meats, pasta, cheese, peppers, ect. I love putting artichoke hearts and olives in it. It kinda turns out a little different every time I make it!!

Amaizing dish.... My husband and I loved it and it was pretty simple to make. I plan on making it again. I also altered it just a bit. Instead of the asiago cheese i added mozzarella and also i added 1/2 a lb of genoa salami. It was awesome!

This was extremely good.  I've made this about 4 times now and I can't get enough of it.  The only thing that I would change about this is the portion of the meat.  I think there's a bit too much meat in this recipe, I would probably half it.  Anyway, It's even better the next day.

Very good, nice change of pace.  I will, however, change from Genoa Salami to Hard Salami in this recipe just based on personal taste.  Big hit all around.

This was a very good pasta salad.  Asiago cheese and the salami can make it expensive, but ever so worth it.

This is fantastic.  I made it for our neighborhood picnic and it was all gone.  I used provolone instead of asiago cheese (personal preference).  I let the salad chill overnight before adding the dressing and serving.  This is a very hearty salad, so it serves a lot of people.  I will make this again!

This wasn't too bad.  It made A LOT, so next time I would definately 1/2 the recipe.  Also, I added marble cheese instead of the Asiago as well I didn't add any olives.  I found this recipe tasted a little too bitter, there were too many spices and too much vinegar.  I would make this again, I would just add a little less spices and a little less vinegar and maybe add more olive oil.

this salad is fantastic -- a meal in itself.  i cut way back on the balsamic oil dressing, i thought it was way overpowering.  added ham & a few green onions, omitted olives.  thanks for sharing!  it was a hit.

Great base recipe.  You can definitely make it your own.  What I really loved about this recipe is the dressing, which I tweaked just a bit.  Here's my version: I used bowtie pasta, added chopped roma tomatos, some salami (the good stuff), rough chopped garlic (4-5 cloves), parboiled broccoli, fresh spinach, sliced greek and black olives, some bell pepper, lots of fresh parmesan (no chunks of any cheese), a lot of oregano, and definitely no onions. Then I used the same portions of olive oil and vinegar, but made my own Italian seasoning easily by following the ingredients list on the back of an out-dated packet I had...sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder (or minced), and little Italian seasoning. Absolutely wonderful. I ate my fill right away at room temp - Delicious.

No peppers as I don't like them, and I didn't even know what Asiago cheese was so I used mozarella as others had.  (And then just the other night I found Asiago!)  With a billion types of vinegar already around I've always been reluctant to add balsamic to the collection, but finally bought some recently and this recipe was its debut. :-)  I really liked this, but there didn't seem to be enough dressing.  It was fine when eaten *immediately* but it didn't take long to start soaking in and by the next day the leftovers were dry.  (I think I added some bottled Italian.)  Some things I don't expect the leftovers to be good, but for this type of pasta salad, I do expect good leftovers that I can eat at least into the next day & sometimes it's even better.  Not this.  I actually thought it was a 5, but downgraded it one since it was only good *right after* mixing and not later.  Now that I've found Asiago cheese, I'd like to try it again with more dressing.  EDIT 2011:  So 4 yrs later & I finally make this again. I got around to getting asiago after all this time & it took me a while to find the recipe I'd once subbed mozzarella - and here it is!  I also used to sub some low-fat margarine for oil as I spent yrs on an "afraid of fat" kick.  (Now I'm afraid of trans fat.)  So I used all olive oil and real asiago - it definitely needs those and makes a difference!! :-)

Although this got rave reviews from the people at the party I'd made made this for, I found it to be a little heavy on the bell pepper taste (and I really like bells), and not quite tangy enough.  Recipe itself was alright, just not my style.

I got really good reviews about this salad.  I thought maybe it was too oily but others said it was delicious.  They liked the flavors.  I added cubed mozzarella and shredded asiago because that's what was available.  I also left out the olives because I don't really like them.  I will make again -- but it definitely is a pricey dish -- especially since I made double the amount.

There were three pasta salads at the family reunion, and this was not only the largest, and the most colourful, but also the first to go! I used farfalle (bow tie) pasta, and added minced red onion (as suggested by other reviewers). You'll definitely want to dress this salad and leave it to marinate in the fridge overnight.

I think this recipe is great.  The only change I make is by using cheese tortellini instead of plain pasta.  It has a ton of flavor, and while I agree it's a little on the pricey side to make, its far better than your typical bottled dressing pasta salad. 
Thanks for submitting

This was a good salad.  I used mozerrella cubes, and no olives, only 1 tbsp of oregano and not quites as much pepperoni.  Had a strong vinegar taste, a little too tangy, might not use as much next time, but a nice change from my usual.  Will definetly make again!

Disjointed taste. There was a strong taste of salami, but there was not enough other flavors to balance it. I will not be making this again.

Not bad. I didn't use olives, had to use sliced pepperoni and shredded cheese and ommit the salami because of the stock at my store. Next time I'll use rotini pasta, two packets of the italian mix, 1/2 the balsamic dressing mix while keeping the same amount of oil(it was a bit on the bitter side for me), and add diced yellow bell pepper. Sliced pepperoni kind of ruined the look of the dish so I'll be sure to get the logs next time. The seashells were a little too small and looked lost amoungst the other ingredients.

This salad was good; however, we found the balsamic a bit overwhelming. I'd replace part of it with another milder vinegar (and I'm a big balsamic vinegar fan). Also, too much meat! I would cut the salami and pepperoni amounts in half. I'm still on the lookout for the perfect pasta salad...

Wow!  The only thing I changed was to use shredded asiago and fusili (since it holds up better).  Make sure to squeeze your tomatoes before to you cut rid of any excess liquid.  Made it the day before and it was a hit!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Looks pretty and colorful, tastes delicious with the homemade dressing (smells great too), rich meats and cheese, and fresh vegetables.  Everyone liked it and had seconds and thirds...  Will definitely save as a party recipe.

I made a lot of changes and actually, the recipe might have gotten 5 stars if I hadn't.  I made this with cheese tortellini, which was a mistake...I wouldn't recommend it.  I also made a different dressing (the kind in a package).  Those are the 2 changes I will not make again.  What I did change that I liked was...added cubes of fresh mozzarella (the kind in water) and used pepperoncinis instead of bell pepper.  Will try again with the original dressing and regular pasta.

I made this for a housewarming party and it was a hit with our guests.  I used red, yellow, orange, and green peppers to add to the color and threw in some extra salami and pepperoni.  I even enjoyed this and I really do not care for pasta salad.

I took this recipe to a picnic, and it was a huge hit, especially w/ the guys b/c it has lots of meats and cheese in it.  Plus the peppers give it lots of color. Very good.

This salad is soooo flavorful and yummy! My friend just served this at a dinner party, and it was wonderful! So, of course, I had to log on immediately and get the recipe myself.  I can't wait to make it!

This recipe is really good. However it really takes longer than the time it says. Just make sure you don't get salami with jalepeno peppers in it unless you like spicy things. I give it a 4 forks out of five because the timing was inaccurate.

The dressing should definitely be "on the side," because not everyone likes Balsamic that much.

Awesome, and made enough for an army!  I decreased the oregano to 1 Tbl., as others suggested - will do again!  I think next time I will increase the green bell pepper to 2 because there is a lot of red color in the dish due to the tomatoes and red bell pepper.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Excellant.  Used dices meats instead of cutting up slice.  Works better.  I used mozzarella cheese cubed instead of asiago.

This pasta salad is fantastic!  Every time I have made this it is a big hit.  Make sure that you let it soak up the Italian dressing so it is not gritty.

Very good!  The asiago cheese and salami were very nice additions.  I left out the pepperoni since I had a bit extra salami.  I mixed the dressing and added it the night before serving the salad for lunch.

I made this for my now sister-in-laws bridal shower.  What a hit!  Because of the reviews from this site I doubled the recipe.  Good thing.  At least 3 people that I can think asked for this recipe.  The ingredients are a little on the expensive side and it's a little time consuming but it's worth it.

My only comment is when you fix it, you have to eat it right away.  Doesn't keep well in the fridge, so don't make too much.  Otherwise, taste is awesome!

I made this for a group of 40.  Received many compliments.  I was able to make it the day before which is always good for me.  I will use this recipe again!

The best I have tasted! The meat and cheese add great flavor.  Everyone raved about it and I will definitely make again and again.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I put together everthing the day before a picnic, mixed the dressing that morning and added just before serving.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make this again!!

I am almost at the point where I hate this recipe. Why?  EVERYBODY loves this recipe.  I made for a family BBQ abouy 2 years ago and now everytime we have a family party this is what I get told to make. And there are never any leftovers.  I now know the recipe by heart.
