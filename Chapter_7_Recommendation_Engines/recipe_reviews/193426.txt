I cut this down to one serving for lunch using one cucumber.  Fresh dill would be ideal for this, but I only had dried.  It still turned out very good.  I always have light Miracle whip on hand and was surprised at how good this tasted.  I usually stick to cucumber salads with just sour cream!

Delicious!! I used 1 large English cucumber and left the skin on. Followed the dressing exactley and loved the dill flavor. This salad was very creamy and fresh tasting. Fresh dill is the key, dont use dry. Will make again, thanks!

Yum! Even my fiance, who says he doesn't like sour cream, really liked this. I used half low-fat sour cream, half fat-free plain yogurt. Very good. Thank you!

Followed the recipe exactly but ended up needing to add a little salt (personal preference). Other than that, the combo of dill and cucumbers is a classic!

This recipe was just okay. I let the cucumbers sit in a colander for about an hour hoping most of the water would drain off, but the dressing was still a little watery. You  must you use fresh dill, and also be sure to eat the day you make it because the cucumbers will loose their crunch. Probably won't make again, but thanks!

This was delightful.  I used 1 large seedless cucumber.  I can see this becoming a staple in our house!

This is delicious, but it could benefit from some salt.

The trick for less water out of the cucumber...buy seedless or core out the seeds. That is where the majority of water is held.
I have made something similar for years. But without adding the lemon juice. The addition of it gave it a nice zip.  If I want to change up the flavour a bit, I add a little grated Parmesan.
