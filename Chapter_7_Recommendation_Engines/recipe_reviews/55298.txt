I melted the chips first.  These crescents were quite good.

I admit it, I made a different variation of this recipe.  Instead of using the peanut butter and milk chocolate chips, I used chocolate chips and coconut. This recipe was incredibly easy.  Now you see them, now you don't!

I made this one night when the girls were coming over. I wrapped broken reese's cups in the crescents before baking, then sprinkled with powered sugar once they were cool. They were the first thing gone!
