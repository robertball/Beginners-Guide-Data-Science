I just used the marinade for the sirloin steaks I was BBQing and it was great.  A real difference from my usual Teriyaki-Ginger or Red Wine Marinades.  The steaks were tender and juicy, with a mild mustardy-garlic flavor with a bit of a kick.  We really liked this marinade and I will be using it often.
