My kids love taquitos so I thought I would give this a try. Glad I doubled the recipe because my kids loved them. Easy to make.

They were good! 400 was too high so did second batch on 385. I used rotisserie chicken and doubled the recipe and glad I did because I was able to make 12 which was enough to feed family of 4. Next time I will add more chiles, it was a little bland for my liking. But super easy to prepare- I’ll definitely be making again!

So easy and delicious! I just shredded leftover chicken then mixed it with taco seasoning, black beans, salsa, and cheese.

I cooked chicken breast in crockpot with the rest of the ingredients and it came out wonderful. Pepperjack cheese  added a little more spice.  They were easy to make and awesome to eat!  Will definitely make them again

I enjoyed using my air fryer for these taquitos. My family liked the filling. We had some leftover so we used it as a dip.

Family loved them. I did substitute with turkey meat though, still came out delish. We use the air fryer often so it was a good addition. Id make them again.

Due to the quarantine,  I had to substitute a few ingredients,  but it was still good!  A little practice with my ninja foodi and I would serve it to friends!

Only air fried them from 4 minutes rather than the recommended time. Other than that they were great!

The filling is outstanding. The taquitos were nicely browned and crisp.

I made it. Substituted cheeses and salsa that I had around. Loved it! Easy and delicious. Just a little trouble with some of the tortillas breaking  open. But still great!

We will definitely make these again!  The filling was nice and spicy with the addition of hot crushed cherry peppers.  Easy dinner paired with a salad.

This was the maiden voyage of the air fryer I was given for my birthday—-and what a great first use!  The second batch had to be done at 350 degrees since the 400 was a little too high for mine, and I cut the cooking time by a minute or two.  These didn’t taste like any taquitos I have ever made or eaten before, but they certainly were tasty!

My grandkids thought these were delicious!
Just enough crunch to give a nice texture to the tortillas.

These were a welcomed change and now new addition to our dinner menu. My air fryer was much faster than the time listed in the recipe - only took 4 minutes on 390. The extra filling was wonderful over rice. Quick and delicious!

These turned out great. I left out the cream cheese, but they were still delicious and the timing was perfect in the air fryer. Will definitely make these again.

Very easy to make... loved the fact that no greasy mess. The first batch cooked much too crispy so I cut the time in half on the next batch and they were perfect.

My boys were surprised at how much they liked these! They couldn't stop saying how good they were. I had to sub canned tomatoes with green chilies for the green chillies and mexican tomato sauce because that is what I had, and I added 1/2 tsp of cummin to the filling. I will definitely make again! I think I could use this filling recipe for enchiladas or burritos. 
FYI: this recipe is good for flour tortillas too

These are the reason people need to look up recipes and practice cooking from scratch.

My Significant Other and I have both, separately, taken a bite and gone "Oh my God" to each other as we've prepped batches in the air fryer.

Fantastic idea. Super easy. Used 4 boiled chicken thighs to approximate the chicken asked for.
