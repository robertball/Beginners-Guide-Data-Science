Good basic recipe. Of course I tweaked mine a bit. Browned the dry rice a bit in some olive oil and butter, set that aside then sauted the garlic and onion and I added some green bell pepper as well. mixed the rice in w/ the veggies then added 2 c chicken broth. 1 small can of tomato sauce and a can of rotel diced tomates w/ green chilis. for a bit of extra flavor i added about 2 tsp of chili powder, .5 tsp of cumin, and salt & pepper to taste. let that simmer and Yummo!! using it as a side to my fabulous  Chicken Enchiladas with Pepper Jack Cheese Sauce.

Thie rice did not taste like spanish rice at all.  It was so bland that I had to add cilantro and hot sauce!  I would not recommend this recipe.

Good, just not as much flavor as I expected.  Would be excellent with a spicy main dish.

There was not as much flavor as I expected and it was kind of bland. I think it would be great with some extra spices added.

This is a base to be built on. I added two buillion cubes and fresh pimento for some more flavor. I will make this again with the small changes

It was very mild flavored, or as some in my family said--bland.  I even doubled the garlic.  It was nice as a change of pace, but I really didn't notice a major "wow" as opposed to using plain white rice.  I would quadruple the garlic--the pimentos added color but no flavor.  I would also wager adding some cilantro would definitely help develop the flavors some...adding some chicken/veggie stock wouldn't hurt either.  It just wasn't our thing.
