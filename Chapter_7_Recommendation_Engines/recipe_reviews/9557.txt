This recipe is addicting.  I used 1/3 cup raspberry preserves (heated and strained the seeds out) instead of the raspberry liqueur. It was a great hit at our Christmas party.

This recipe turns out great!  Everyone that tried it loved it. Even thought Chambord is not exactly cheap, it is worth every penny in this recipe.  My first time of following the recipe, the top layer came out softer than the bottom layer and I had a hard time cutting the fudge due to this.  The second time around, rather than layering, I mixed in all ingredients together, which resulted in even raspberry taste all over the fudge (rather than just on top), and even consistency which made it easier to cut.

Everybody is screaming more raspberry flavor so I used 2-8oz. pkgs. of Hersheys Dark Choc. pieces with raspberry cream filling in place of the 2 cups of semisweet chips, it turned out mouth watering!  This is a winner, Thanks!

WOW!  I have tried making fudge a few times before, but the consistency was never right.  I am shocked that a fudge that was this easy to make, tastes so incredible.  I substituted equal parts of seedless raspberry preserves for the liqueur, and I was happy with the amount of raspberry flavor.  I didn't have wax paper, so I made it in a silicone pan lightly sprayed with cooking spray, and the cooled fudge popped right out, and easily cut into squares.  This recipe is a dream!

This fudge is easy and delicious.  I would recommend making it a few days in advance because the flavor improves immensely as it ages.

Couldn't find raspberry liquor where I live so I used cherry brandy instead. Also substituted white chocolate for top layer and cut cream to 2 tbsp, and added some chopped almonds and a few drops of red food coloring. Looks, tastes, and cuts wonderfully...very creamy!

Very Easy to make. Don't need to buy a whole bottle of Chambord for this.  I used one of those small nibs and it was exactly a 1/4 cup. The consistency of this was just as you would expect fudge to be and although I am not one for fruit mixed in with my chocolate, their is only just a hint of raspberry and the rest all chocolate that makes this soo delicious!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  First time making fudge and it could not have been easier. It came out so creamy and the wax paper was genius, used it for other fudge recipes, made them easier to pull out to cut more evenly.  I used DeKuypers Razzmatazz for the liqueur and it worked like a dream (cheaper to buy, too).  I wanted a stronger rasp flavor, but it does improve with time.  Excellent, hightly recommend:)

YUMMY!!!!  You can taste the raspberry but it isn't to overpowering, just perfect!!!  When I made as Christmas gifts I made it in small candy cups instead of the pan. Which made for a nice presentation and easier portability.  It was a little more involved that way though.

This recipe was ok, but just didn't do a whole lot for me.  There is nothing wrong with the recipe itself, it just didn't "wow" me.  I did buy Chambord at a liquor store (couldn't find it at the grocery store) and got the small "airplane" bottles, rather than a huge $20+ bottle that I wouldn't have used!

My only tweaks to this recipe was I went with using 1/3 C Raspberry Jam, sence I didn't have a 8 by 8 I used what I think was a 9 by 13, I used about 1/2 C more W. C. and a spoonfull more jam ( sience I used a larger pan I was scared the Origional Recipe wouldn't be enough of a top layer to my liking) and I used W. C. morsels in stead of chips.. Also I used wax paper to line the pan, no non stick spray, I turned pan from side to side in stead of "spreading it", and it came out perfect and wax paper pulled right off the Fudge..!! I gave it 4 stars because I like dark Chocolate and I felt it was too sweet so I ended up eating 1in long by 1cm wide pieces.. But I will say I don't like White Chocolate and I felt in this you couldn't really taste it? Maby because I put in a stronger Raspberry Flavor?? I also had no problems cuting through the layers, but the Raspberry layer stuck to the knife a little.. All in all I WILL be making this again!

This turned out great!  I used 1.5 tsp of the raspberry liquor and 1/4 cup of seedless raspberry preserves.  I also added one cup of chopped walnuts to the melted chocolate mixture in the bottom layer.  I brought it to a party and it was a big hit and it sold out at our bake sale!

Oh, MAN!  Made it like the recipe said - oh, MAN!  Definitely a keeper.  Easiest thing in the world to make, too.  One thing, I didn't make my piece of wax paper big enough so I had to sort of "dig" around the edges to get it out of the pan.  Darn.  Had to eat all the ugly pieces!  :)

WONDERFUL fudge!  I'm making double batches of this for Valentine's Day too, but it's rich so a little goes a long way.  Great with coffee after dinner instead of a heavy dessert.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used seedless preserves instead of liqueur.  Success!  Smooth and creamy, without a candy thermometer!

It was great!  Easy, and you can use Raspberry Torani syrup in place of the liqueor. I just added some until I could taste it in the chocolate.  I had no trouble with the consistency of either layer.

I loved this recipe!  It was very easy to make, and the truffle layer on top is divine.  I did not cook it in the microwave, I cooked it on the stove over medium heat.  It was very smooth.

This recipe made me look amazing this holiday season. I made it for every single holiday function I attended and everyone raved about this fudge. The best part is that they had no idea how easy it is to make! Thanks so much for sharing!

I followed this recipe pretty closely and it was some of the best fudge I've ever had. I used the good stuff - Ghirardelli chocolate and Chambord, so that probably made a difference. You won't get fudge that looks like the picture with separate layers and pink color unless you substitute white chocolate and raspberry preserves as other reviewers said, but I think it's better as written. It looks like regular fudge but has the subtle, sophisticated raspberry taste and is very rich!

The pan of fudge is in my kitchen and I'm trying not to eat it! The person who posted the photo with the pretty pink layer used white chocolate morsels and seedless raspberry jam in the top layer. I did the same. The bottom layer is the same recipe my mom used for hot fudge sauce. It was always so yummy! My pink layer is still very soft and gooey. I'm hoping it will set up by the morning. Even if it doesn't, the flavor is fantastic. I think using chocolate in both layers would drown out the raspberry flavor.

For the last 3 years I've been making this for Christmas, the family gets upset if it's not on the baking agenda. The top is a little soft, so make sure you keep it refrigerated. It's extremely rich, but how else is fudge supposed to be.

Three attempts at this recipe and one success.  Attempt #1: I tried it as listed (substituting raspberry preserves) and I only like the bottom layer and the layers came apart.  Attempt #2: I followed the advice of another review and mixed it all together, but it was too soft.  Attempt #3 and the winner: I made just the top layer and it was wonderful! I gave it three stars because of the trial and error, but everyone loved the product of the third attempt!

This has become my signature fudge recipe - I've been using it for about five years now.  It's so easy and always generates compliments.  My tips: 1 - the longer you stir the fudge while warm before spreading into the pan, the smoother the fudge will be (easier if you are using a double-boiler to melt the chocolate, just keep working it over for a while), 2 - try substituting other flavors for the top layer (e.g., orange zest, mint extract, etc.).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe and very quick and easy to make. I substituted Raspberry Flavoring syrup, the kind used to flavor coffee, for the liqueur and it worked perfectly.

Excellent recipe that gets rave reviews from everyone. It turns out better the higher quality chocolate you use.  I use semi sweet for the fudge bottom layer and a mix of dark and bittersweet for the raspberry second layer.

I used 1/3 cup seedless raspberry preserves and white chocolate for the top layer of this fudge, and milk chocolate chips for the bottom layer. VERY easy to make. I didn't have enough milk chocolate chips so I just chopped up some Hershey's Kisses and threw them in, and it was fine. It took about 3 hours of chilling before my fudge was ready to cut, though. All in all, a very good recipe for the amount of time it takes.

I loved this recipe.  I used Razmatazz which I believe has a much stronger raspberry flavor than Chambord. I agree with others that the fudge is much better after the second day. I followed the recipe and found it easy and delicious.  It is a great hostess or holiday gift.

This was my first attempt at making fudge, and I did exactly as the recipe said, with the exception of the raspberry liquor...I used pure seedless raspberry preserves instead and it came out delicious. I brought about half of it to work and have got nothing but compliments. Thanks for the great recipe, I'll definetly be using this one again!

This fudge is really good. The raspberry flavor isn't as strong as I expected, though. Still would recommend it.

I followed some of the others suggestion of mixing the layers together.  It came out beautiful!  I entered it my county fair and it won 1st place!  I have let some friends try it and they now want me to make them more of it.  Really big hit!

Changed up the recipe a little, but was still pretty sweet... a little of this goes a long way. I used milk chocolate chips in the bottom layer and almond extract instead of vanilla - perfect!  Then for the top layer, I used white chocolate chips, heavy cream and 1/3 cup raspberry preserves.  The top looked a little blah, so I warmed a few teaspoons of the preserves and swirled it through the top.  Think I might try just doing the top layer next time with milk chocolate chips.

The raspberry flavor is subtle (we used Razzmatazz) - but it's there, and this might be the best fudge I've ever had.

OK, I can't blame the recipe, since I followed everyone else's advice!  I used white chocolate on the top layer mixed with 2T of cream and 1/3c. raspberry preserves.  Way too liquid.  It never hardened up, but stayed the consistency of icing.  Tasted yummy, but not exactly fudge.  On the otherhand, I found that the dark chocolate bottom layer was too hard.  It cut well, but was more the consistency of chocolate rather than fudge.  I think I'd add a little more sweetened condensed milk.  A good recipe, but I still need to tweak it a little.

Fantastic recipe.Loved by everyone.Mixed everything together and it was still wonderful.Maybe the paste was a bit to soft but that is easy to change with adding a bit less cream or milk

The raspberry layer was good but the bottom is nothing more than a big block of dark chocolate, nothing to it. I did use preserves instead of the liquor and it worked fine. If i ever make it again i will only make the top layer.

This is wonderful, easy, and well worth the price of the liqueur.  I made it last year and gave it to most of my friend. All of them wanted the recipe.  It is a recipe that I will add to my collection of holiday recipes.

This recipe is now a staple in our household for school related activities, bake sales and Christmas tins and such.  EVERYONE loves it.  My daughter who is 15 loves to make it and share it at school.  I did buy the Chambord because the first time I made it was for Christmas gifts.  It is expensive, but the flavor is amazing and only gets better after a few days.  Its very subtle at first, but then it just infuses the fudge and gives it a very nice raspberry flavor that I'm not sure you'd get with the preserves.  You'll also find yourself making several batches and using up the bottle of Chambord that keeps quite well.  

We use the white chocolate chips for the top layer.  Add in your Chambord and just a few drops of red food coloring to get desired shade of pink you want.    While I'm sure it tastes just as great all mixed together, it really is the double layer that distinguishes this fudge from others and makes it stand out.  If you're going for presentation - use white chips for the top layer.  

Tip:  try some tossing some sliced almonds int he bottom layer for those who like a little nutty flavor in their fudge :)

This was a great recipe and easy to make. Only complaints are that i'd like i bit more of a raspberry taste and i really want to know how to get that pretty pink top layer shown in the picture. Mine just comes out a chocolate brown like the bottom layer. Good texture, very chocolatey, very yummy

This was extremely bitter!!!  Also, there is no way to get the look in the picture using semi-sweet chocolate chips in the top layer!  Very misleading picture... I did make a second batch using a different choc fudge recipe & using white choc in the tip layer, MUCH better the second time!!!

This was my first time making fudge and it was delicious! I used seedless raspberry jam and for the chips I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 semi-sweet. This was very easy to make and so yummy. It has just the right amount of raspberry flavor. The 2 layers together are perfect!

I made this recipe as part of my annual Christmas basket and it was wonderful, especially for being so incredibly easy.  I substituted 1/3 C seedless raspberry preserves and the raspberry to chocolate taste was perfect.  It even sliced well and looked pretty after being left in the refridgerator for a few days.

So good. We had a dessert potluck at work today, and amongst all of the cakes, pies, and other treats, this fudge is the thing that no one could stop talking about.  Everyone agreed that it was absolutely delicious.

Recipe was so so ... not "fudgy" enough - the result was harder than we like.  Also, the raspberry flavor wasn't strong enough - tasted like plain old chocolate.

Good taste...mine didn't come out as creamy as I thought it should.  Very easy to make and pretty tasty.  Stays pretty firm if stored in refridgerator.

This was very good, a keeper.  Much easier then most fudges and didn't require stirring and perfect temps.  I think a cherry flavored liquer would be good also.......fool proof!

Very good!  As others mentioned, I didn't get the pink color, even used white chips, and the top didn't set as I thought it would.   But the crew LOVED the fudge and it was almost gone in a day.  Fudge rules!

I was worried they didn't have any gelatin to hold them together, so I did add about 8-10 marshmallows to the mixture. And I did it on the stove instead of the microwave. I also used real raspberry puree and a 1/4 cup of mint schnapps. They turned out pretty good, but I had to freeze them overnight so I could cut them as they were too soft/gooey. Very rich and decadent. Tastes lovely!

This was awesome!   I did however use white chips in the raspberry layer with 1 tbsp of raspberry extract with 2 drops of red food color.  Tasted just as good!  It was a big hit! =)

This was pretty good.  The only thing was, my top layer didn't come out pink like the picture.  Should I have used white chips instead of chocolate?  Also, even using the raspberry liqueur, I didn't think it was that raspberry tasting.  It tasted more like dark chocolate.  Sorry this sounds negative.  I did like this . It just wasn't what I was looking for.  I'll have to read more reviews for suggestions.

This was very easy and fast to make but didn't taste like traditional fudge to me. It seemed like I was eating just a chunk of melted chocolate. The rasberry flavor was there but not bold.

I have made this fudge several times and I love it!  It is quick and easy and always a hit with family and friends.  This year I had some left over chocolate chips from my holiday baking and decided to make some fudge.  I didn't have any raspberry liqueur but did have some Kahlua, so I used that instead.  It was delicious.  I took it to a Bowl party and everyone loved it.  Thanks Leeza!

Used the suggestion of 1/3 cup of rasberry jam instead of the liqueur and mixed it all instead of doing the layers.  Turned out perfectly!!

Let me start by saying I have never been a huge choclate fan, but this fudge is phenomenal and extremely addictive. I made it a a Mother's Day gift and everyone who has tasted it raves about it. I agree with other reviews, much better after a day or more to let the flavors meld.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  Easy and quick, yes, but it turned out just okay.  The use of chocolate chips gave it a "waxy" flavor and texture that just isn't very tasty for fudge.  I should note that my family liked it although they noted that it wasn't a typical fudge texture.

This is a great combination. I made a few changes by using the Aunt Teen's Creamy Chocolate Fudge recipe from this site for the bottom layer. The top layer I used Black Raspberry jam, 1/3 cup. It was awesome. One pan will not be enough.

We thought this was just so-so.  With such a high content of chocolate chips, it was very much like a big hunk of chocolate.  I did use chambord liqueur, which did not provide as much raspberry flavor as I was expecting. I would agree with another reviewer - just make the top layer (and double the recipe).  Also, perhaps using raspberry jam instead of liqueur would have enhanced the raspberry flavor.

The chocolate in this was a little overwhelming, maybe just because I'm not a huge fan of dark chocolate.  It was so rich I could barely finish a whole peice.  If I make this again I will substitue Milk Chocolate chips for at least one part of the recipe.  I also made a batch substituting Ameretto for Raspberry Liquor and it came out just as well.

I've been making this fudge as holiday gifts for years and it's always a hit!  I've used cherry liqueur, crème de menthe and Baily's with equal success as the raspberry liqueur.  Most of my relatives freeze the fudge and eat it all year- apparently it thaws beautifully.  I was late getting my holiday packages out one year and I got phone calls asking when it was coming- definitely worth making!

Very good, but next time I would at least double the amount of liqueur, because the raspberry layer was very subtle. The raspberry layer (as expected) was dark brown, but didn't really affect the experience. Thumbs up.

I did try this recipe with a variation. I made it into a triple truffle fudge. Honey maple fudge bottom, raspberry fudge middle and a chocolate Vander Mint top. Its the perfect triple truffle fudge for adults.

We love this fudge and have used this recipe for several years now.  I do use seedless raspberry preserves, and I have to say that using the amount listed does not give it enough raspberry flavor for us--we like more!  Other than increasing that a bit, the recipe is delicious!

Yum! We used raspberry jam instead of raspberry alcohol. I didn't bother straining the seeds out--you can barely tell they're in there.

Next time, I think I would double the raspberry layer or half the chocolate under-layer, because I would have preferred a stronger fruit taste. I can't wait to try making this with other jam flavors, like orange and strawberry.

The consistency between the 2 layers was quite different and it did not set up properly. 
If I make this again, I will make both layers in the same recipe, just different flavors.
It did have a good taste, just too soft for my taste.

This recipe was very delicious! It was a very big hit, however I did not get the look of the pink color on top. I think the recipe should be changed to white chocolate chips for the the top layer to get the color. The picture was very misleading. But other than that it was very delicous!!

I don't think the fudge should be made in the microwave, because it takes away the otherwise smooth texture and you can't really monitor it if it's in the microwave. The next time I make this, i would probably heat the chocolate and cream on the stove (slowly, don't want the chocolate to burn), and stir constantly, as you would with other kinds of fudge.

I just mixed it all together as some reviewers suggested and it was very good and rich, just not enough raspberry flavor.  I will definitely follow the recommendations next time to use the raspberry preserves in addition to the liquor.

This was very good.  I didn't have chambord, so I took others' advice and used the raspberry preserves.  This was a big hit at a party I brought it to, however, it didn't have that "authentic" creaminess that one usually associates with fudge. However, I was able to make it in 10 minutes, and it still tasted great for being so easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious flavor but mine didn't set up well at all-it was way too soft and had to be refrigerated-I would love this recipe more if it was not so soft.

This was my first attempt at making fudge. It turned out well, but didn't have a lot of raspberry flavor. I cooked everything stove top instead of the microwave (have burned chocolate in the microwave before - yuk!)It's a very easy recipe, but I guess I was expecting more raspberry flavor.

Scrumptious!!!  Definitely use the raspberry liqueur; I have only made it once, but I can't imagine it being quite as good just using preserves.  Incredibly easy to make but tastes like something from a high-end chocolate shop.  True perfection!  One of my favorite recipes I've ever made!

perfect texture!  This recipe is so rich, but that's good, because it only makes you want to eat it slowly, and this is something you'll want to last!
