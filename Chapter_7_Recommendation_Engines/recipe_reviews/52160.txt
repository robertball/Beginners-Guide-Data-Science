My husband and kids absolutely love this dish. It can really bend to whatever kind of "pizza" you want, really. My family's favorite is a combination of turkey sausage, turkey pepperoni, olives, mushrooms and onions. When I make this, I usually will make my own "sauce" and use whole wheat pasta. I like to serve this with Copycat Olive Garden salad and breadsticks or garlic bread.

We used Italian sausage instead and it was good. However, next time I would mix the pizza ingredients into the spaghetti and use a jar sauce specializing in Italian seasonings.  That will get even more rave reviews from my family.

This was really good!  I left off the black olives because my daughter really doesn't like them and I probably could have added more cheese, but it was delish!  Thank you!

Easy and satisfying.  You can tweek it by adding more than the pizza topping mentioned here.  Yummy!

This was delicious. I think I'll use more sauce and more cheese next time, though. The cheese seemed to slip off the noodles when I served it, so a lot of the cheese would fall back into the pan. This was much better than normal spaghetti and more interesting than normal pizza. It was very easy to prepare and didn't take much effort to cook, either. I really recommend this for someone with children, as I could see it being fun AND delicious for the kids. The only thing that takes away the fifth star for this is that the noodles tasted just a little dry after baking - hence why I might use more sauce next time.

Idea was awesome. My boyfriend and I gave it a shot last night and it was delicious but there are a few things we would like to tweak next time we make it:
- Instead of long spaghetti noodles next time we want to use shells or rotini because it will make it easier to scoop up and serve.

-We'd like to experiment with more toppings of course :)

-Also, we think it would be good to mix some of the toppings into the pasta  as well as sitting on top of it.

My kids liked it but to me tastes like something from a school cafeteria
