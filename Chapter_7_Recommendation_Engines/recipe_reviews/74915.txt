Okay, I am absolutely addicted to this salad.  However, I have made some changes to it.  First, I prefer bow tie pasta.  I think it gives it a little more visual appeal.  I also dry the pasta on paper towels after I drain it.  This keeps the moisture level down and allows the dressing to coat the pasta better.  I use fat free Miracle Whip to keep the fat content down.  I use four eggs instead of three.  I find the sugar is an important ingredient however, I only use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup.  I also use apple cider vinegar.  I don't add the red pepper because my husband doesn't like them but they do give it a great color.  We all love celery so I add extra and I also chop the leaves from the celery stalks and add those.  I also like to add in a little garlic salt.  It always seems to  make a lot of dressing so I mix in just enough to coat the pasta and let it sit over night.  I cover and fridge the remaining dressing.  Then, if it looks a little dry in the morning, I add more of the dressing.  This keeps it from being too liquidy.  

I have also added in a can of well drained tuna which gives it a great flavor and makes it more of a meal.  

The dressing also works great as a base for potato salad.  

YUM!!!

I wish I had read other reviews before making this ( usually do and this will teach me a lesson). The 3/4 cup sugar just ruined what would have been a great recipe 1/8 to a 1/4 cup would have been fine. Also, use a whole box (16 oz.) of macaroni. Two cups isn't nearly enough for this recipe.

What a wonderful, delicious recipe! I reduced the sugar a bit but next time will add even less. I think 1/4 or 1/3 cup will suit my families tastes. I had a hard time putting this recipe together since I found myself out of some ingredients. I subbed one cup of Marzetti's slaw dressing and one cup of Mayo for the Miracle Whip. I also chopped one small dill pickle and added a little pickle juice for the relish. Didn't have celery seed so that was left out. With summer coming up I can see myself making this many times over! Thank you for the post. By the way, for the poster that mentioned the restaurant, Das Dutch Haus in Ohio: I used to live in Pittsburgh and a highlight for us moms was to drive over to shop and eat at Das Dutch Haus. Ah, the memories. I loved the food there! :-) *Update* Made this again and used the salad dressing. Used celery salt instead of salt and celery seed. This is just so yummy! Made again and sprinkled with paprika and black pepper. Outstanding! For those of you that think that this is a little soupy, place in the fridge overnight and the noodles soak up some of the liquid. It is perfect the day after preparing!

This is the recipe I use every time I make mac salad! I use real mayonnaise, Miracle Whip doesn't exist in my kitchen. Green pepper instead of red, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and no pickle relish. I add an extra hard boiled egg, shredded cheese, and I season the dressing with extra salt, pepper, garlic powder and a couple drops of Louisianna hot sauce for flavor. I cut the mustard to 1 Tbsp. Other good additions are diced ham or bacon. Amish macaroni salad is supposed to be sweet.

As per other reviewers' remarks I cut the amount of dressing.  But pasta absorbs all moisture very quickly, becoming dry. So, if not eating the salad right away, I suggest following the recipe as is (I agree with reducing sugar to 1/4 c.)- add enough dressing to salad to satisfy immediate eating requirements- keep the rest for later. You will need it.
Also, another reviewer suggested adding cubed cheese - I don't think cheese adds anything to this recipe it's quite simply excellent as is.
Edit: I have now made this recipe dozens of times.  Yesterday I bought mayonaise instead of Miracle Whip-type salad dressing - in my opinion using mayo requires more sugar - I used a half cup.  Other than that - I'm still making it as above and getting raves from my guests and family.

Perhaps I should preface my review by saying I hate macaroni salad....just not a big fan, can easily walk away and not eat it.  Yuck.  My dad requested mac salad for Father's Day and I searched for the "right" recipe and found this.  OMG.  I just ate a bowl and it's fantastic.  And the flavors haven't even had a chance to meld.  And I hate mac salad!  I did make some changes, here they are:  I doubled the recipe and used 4-5 C uncooked whole grain elbows.  I diced a md green pepper, a md red pepper, a sm-md red onion, 6 celery ribs, and 4 dill pickle spears (no dill relish, I realized).  I used 6 hard boiled eggs.  In the dressing, I used Kraft Light Mayo w/Olive Oil, yellow mustard, 2/3C sugar (and I would not use anymore, perhaps would use less, maybe down to 1/3C even next time) and I didn't measure the white vinegar, just added a couple of splashes.  I also added  a healthy amt of dill pickle juice (2 good "splashes" from the jar).  I added the following seasonings (I did not measure, I just sort of sprinkled across the top to cover, not coat, twice):  garlic salt (and did not use regular salt then), dill weed, and crushed red pepper (about 8 shakes).  I did not use celery seed simply because I hate celery (and I purposefully cut the celery large so I can pick it out :)).  I WILL be making this again.  Thanks for making me a mac salad eater (though, wait, I prob shouldn't be thanking you for adding yet another high calorie "like" to my list!)!

I really loved this............but beware, you HAVE to cut the amount of sugar. Thank goodness that I read the reviews before making this and did not add the full amount of sugar.   I used 1/3 cup of sugar and I still found it a little sweet; and I LIKE sweet.  Next time I will only use a 1/4 cup of sugar.  Overall a delicious macaroni salad, creamy with a little tangy zing.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This really is a fantastic macaroni salad. I did use several suggestions made by other reviewers... I added an extra hard-boiled egg (4 total), I reduced the sugar to 1/2C.(will reduce to 1/4C. next time and see how we like it) and I added only 1/2 the dressing (used Miracle Whip)to begin with. After refrigerating the salad all day I took it out, gave it a good stir, and added about 1/4 of the remaining dressing. This was perfect and didn't make it too "soupy". I will make this salad often...thanks so much for the great recipe!

Just what I was looking for!  I chopped a dill pickle, skipped the sugar altogether and added smally cubed sharp cheddar cheese.  I also sliced the egg on top of the salad sprinkled with a bit of paprika sorta like a garnish.  Oh and to take the edge off of the "miracle Whip" I subbed about a 1/4 cup of sour cream.  YUM!  Thank you Connie!

This is the best Macaroni Salad I have seen or made so far.  I agree about cutting down the sugar (maybe half for starters) and I have a big sweet tooth.  Thanks for sharing.

This is my recipe that I sent in and use when I make mac salad.  The only thing is someone changed the way to do the mac.  Don't boil it for 8-10 minutes.  Get water boiling, put in mac, bring back to a boil, stir, turn off heat.  Leave covered for 10 minutes then drain and make salad.  That is what the recipe calls to do.

My husband LOVES Amish Macaroni Salad which is typically very sweet and saturated with dressing.  I gave this a try and am so glad I did!  This most certainly is colorful and flavorful.  Like others, I cut back on the sugar (a little over 1/4 cup) which was a good idea.  I used a vidalia onion finely chopped and half light Miracle Whip and half Hellman's light mayo.  I also added an additional hard boiled egg.  This definitely needs to set overnight so the dressing can get soaked up a bit by the macaroni but otherwise excellent!

This serves way more than six people.  Following others' suggestions, I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup +2 tablespoons, and for my taste it was a little sweet but everyone else loved it that way.  I never have dill pickle relish and just finely chop whatever pickles I have on hand, usually bread and butter. I use Barilla plus pasta (whole grain with other healthy stuff) and noone knows the difference.

I'm so happy I stumbled upon this recipe. It truly is a great macaroni salad. Most of the ingredients, by themselves, I don't care for, but mixed into this salad, the flavors are so complimentary.  Per other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup sugar and that was plenty especially when using a dressing which I completely recommend over regular mayo, plus it's much healthier.  The salad smells like eggs although they don't overwhelm the recipe. Each ingredient has a subtle flavor that comes out in every bite. The dill pickle relish is a great addition and really boosted the flavor. I added half of the dressing mixture to the macaroni, let sit overnight then added about half of the remaining.  Essentially, you really only need about 3/4 of the dressing, but then again, to each his own. Thanks for the recipe! This is definitely a keeper!

Why didn't I read the reviews before I made this???  There is WAY to much sugar called for in this recipe.  CUT IT DOWN TO AT LEAST HALF!  I salvaged mine by added some sour pickle juice and a tad more vinegar.  Overall though it has an excellant flavor.  I will make it many times more I will just go very easy on the sugar!

Very good base recipe for any salad.  However, I would limit the amount of sugar up to 1/4 cup.  For my liking, 1/4 cup is the max limit that I can possibly add sugar (I can even do without sugar at all).  I would even limit to 1/8 cup next time.  The level of sweetness with 1/4 cup was similar to the KFC coleslaw.  So it was pretty sweet, but not too sweet.  You can add whatever the chopped veggies as you like; I used olives since I had no dill pickles relish.  Added chopped cucumbers and carrots for color.  Will make it again :)

Very good!  Following others' advice, I doubled the pasta, halved the dressing and used 4 hard-boiled eggs.  Didn't have celery on hand -  can't buy dill relish here so I substituted 1/4 homemade dill pickle and no Miracle Whip available either, so used Mayonesa con Limon. And since I halved the dressing, only used 1/8c sugar.   Tangy and sweet - will definitely be making it again!  Thank you!

This was excellent! I used one box of shell pasta because I dint have elbow, and I had read that some found this soupy. I drained my noodles for 5-10 minutes in the sink while I assembled the sauce. It came out perfect. I served 8 people and had a bit left over for lunch the next day. wonderful!

Nobody ever asks me to bring macaroni salad to the parties because, well, my macaroni salad left a lot to be desired.  I made this recipe for the 4th of July and everyone asked for the recipe!  Yippee!  It is really fantastic.  I made it the day before and let it "ripen" in the fridge and that made it extra good!  This will be my regular recipe from now on.  Thanks!

A great big THANK YOU to Connie0751 for submitting this one. It is pretty darn close to being PERFECT!!! I made a couple of very slight changes to suit our personal tastes... I used 4 eggs instead of 3; I only used about 1/2 cup of sugar and I added one extra Tbsp. of relish. With those few small changes, this was absolutely delicious! I brought it to a party and had a couple of people ask me for the recipe. One woman kept going back for more and told me it was the best macaroni salad she'd ever eaten. Now that's one heck of a compliment! This will be my "go to" mac salad recipe from now on.

I loved it but did a few things to lighten it up incl using 1/3 splenda instead of 3/4 sugar (it takes care of the sweetness problem others have mentioned and is less calories for weight watchers), used whole wheat pasta and light mayo. This is even better if you make it in advance and let it sit in the fridge to blend flavors. I added an extra egg and used a 5th egg to slice as decoration on the top with a bit of paprika.  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a very tasty mac salad!

Good recipe.  used 1lb macaroni as suggested by others. also cut way back on the sugar (less than 1/4 c)- any more would have been way too sweet! used chopped dill pickles instead of relish, and added a little of the juice for extra flavor.

Very Good Summer Salad. Pickle relish gives it nice pop. Wasn't sure about putting so much mustard & sugar into it; but so worth it after the flavors merry for a few hours. Definitely a keeper.

Made as listed, lessening sugar to 1/2 Cup and Dressing to 1 cup(2/3 Hellmans & 1/3 Miracle Whip),
Mustard(2 Tbls Yellow & 1Tbls Honey Dijon). Good to the last bite. Make exactly as recipe states and then tweak if necessary for your tastes.  SUPER SALAD !

This was pretty good, but WAY to sweet.  I even cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have dill relish, but I added some lemon juice to give it a bit of a kick.  I will make again, but without any sugar at all.  Really, I'm not sure why it's even in the recipe

A great salad! My family isn't big on bell peppers or dill pickles so I left that out. Followed everything else to the letter and I will be making this again...and again! :)

I'm giving this a rating of 5 stars, because I've never had a macaroni salad I liked, until now. So tasty , even better when it's sat over night. I didn't use all the sugar, more like half of what was called for, used less mustard also. Makes a lot of dressing so wait and pour it on as needed otherwise you'll have macaroni swimming in dressing. Thanks Connie for sharing.

I made a few changes to the recipe to suit my family's taste. We have diabetes. I used only 1 cup of miricle whip and 2 heaping tablespoons of sugar. I added a little more pickle. I was out of the celery seed and added more celery. The flavor was wonderful. I will use this recipe often. Thanks

This is an excellent macaroni salad!  Only changes I made to the recipe were to decrease the dressing by half except the sugar which I only added 1/4 cup.  We don't like our macaroni salad "soupy" and this did it for us.  Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make again.

My fiance loved this recipe, and while I had to make some changes I think it worked very well. Being British, I've never used sugar in a savoury dish before (this is something more commonly found in US recipes) so I was wary of the 3/4 cup given for the ingredients. I ended up just using around 1/4 of a cup of sugar as per suggestions from other reviewers, which worked in a good balance with the white vinegar. Since I wasn't able to get hold of American mustard (and believe me, you do not want 3 T of British or French mustard in this dish, it's far too strong!) I used 1 cup of mustard mayonnaise and 1 cup of 3% fat mayonnaise, which worked really well together. I couldn't find any dill pickle relish so I chopped up a couple of pickled gherkins and added 1 T of the juice from their jar, which stopped the sauce from being too thick. I also used a red onion rather than a normal one to give the dish some more colour, and added some spring onion and cubes of cheddar cheese. The celery seeds (a new discovery for me) worked really well in the sauce and I'll definitely be using them again in other dishes. I'm looking forward to experimenting with this recipe and seeing what other variants I can create. This a good basis for a standard macaroni salad and is one of those recipes you can change around depending on availability of ingredients and personal preferences and it still turns out well.

I grew up eating macaroni salad every Sunday and grew to hate it. I have made this a handful of times for my husband's work and everyone always loved it. I tried it and they are right this is good stuff. I did read other reviews and decreased the amount of sugar to 1/2cup, added a extra hard boiled egg and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.

My family and I LOVE this salad. I usually end up using whatever pasta I have on hand and it always works out great. I like the recipe as written but think it is better if the pasta is increased by 1 cup and if it chilled for at least 4-5 hours before serving.

I'm totally shocked this recipe has such a high rating.  First of all, there is WAAAAAYYYYY too much sugar in this recipe!  When you mix the wet ingredients, it looks like a soupy, yellow, granulated mixture!  Not to mention, I used barely 1/4 c. (had almost 2 cups) to put over the macaroni. I ended up cooking about 1 1/2 more noodles and adding it then, added about 1/2 cup more mayo just to get the sweetness of it down enough!  I did not care for this recipe!

This stuff is the best! Reminds me of the macaroni salad they served in our cafeteria in high school -which was very good, by the way!- I only left out the hard boiled egg in this case since I'm not fond of them, and it still tasted very yummy.

I, along with most everyone else who rated this recipe, think it is Great.  I did cut down on the sugar, added the cheese chunks and some spredded cheddar, and all the rest of the ingrediants.  I also decided to add some green peas.  It adds more color along with the red pepper.  This is definitely a keeper in my file!!! I also cut down on the celery.  I think that taste can sometimes be overpowering and 3 stalks is a lot of celery.

Edit 12/31/15 - I have now made this recipe more times than I can count.  My husband loves it with the tweaks and its always requested at his company pot lucks.  I cut the amount of red pepper in half and I use Ditalini noodles instead of elbow.  He loves it!

I made this for my husband (I don't care for macaroni salad).  He liked it but thought that a whole red pepper was just too much.

Loved this recipe, and I normally am not a big fan of Macaroni Salads. As noted by others, reduced sugar to about a quarter cup. Also used Hellman's and a mix of ranch rather than Miracle Whip. Will certainly make this again. I also would use more hard- boiled eggs next time.

I love this macaroni salad! It's simple to make but has a dressing which is different from the norm. The Miracle Whip and mustard combination really work and the addition of red peppers adds a splash of color. Don't use regular mayo, it won't have the same flavor.

This salad is awesome! The only thing I changed was I put 1/2 the sugar in. First time I made it was as per recipe which was good but a little too sweet for me.. Now its perfect not like it wasn't good in the first place. Thanks for sharing Connie!

This recipe has been one in my box for almost a year and finally I made it for a BBQ we had this weekend. Wow...have I ever been missing one of the best macaroni salads I've ever tasted...why did I wait so long? I pretty much followed the recipe except for reducing the sugar, I just  kept tasting the dressing until it reached the sweetness desired, probably even less than 1/4 cup. I left the onion out, not my preference but some of our guest do not like raw onions, so I added green pepper along with the red. Used cider vinegar and used Kraft light olive oil mayo. The dressing absolutely takes this mac salad over the five stars. I made early and let it sit all day in the fridge, reserving about a half cup of the dressing, added that in to make creamy for our serving time at dinner. The reviews were very helpful and suggest you read through some. It makes quite a bit which is a good thing since seconds were requested by our guests.

Excellent macaroni salad recipe, and I am not even a macaroni salad person!  I always thought  it was a waste of calories, but I could not stop eating this!  I followed the recipe, except for cutting the sugar down to 1/4 cup (and it was still sweet) and I doubled the macaroni.  Will definately make again.

Wonderful macaroni salad.  I used roughly 1/4 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  You definitely want to let the salad chill for about 2 hrs before eating to ensure all the flavors come together and the pasta is well chilled.

Yummy.  Thankfully I read reviews and used 3 TBL sugar - that was fine for us, just a little bit sweet but not over the top too sweet.  Also, I used the suggestion to pour part of the dressing over the pasta - I used a little more than half and it was plenty.  Next time I'll just up the amount of pasta or decrease the amount of sauce.

this is awesome! 
The quantities seem right to me but I did reduce sugar to 1/2 cup  based on reviews here.
tip - if making the day before  reserve half of the dressing and mix in  the next day an hour or so before serving, otherwise it soaks it all up overnight, making it too dry.

This truely is the best macaroni salad I have ever had. Hint: reduce sugar to 1/2 cup; chop all vegtables and mix dressing in separate bowls then cook macaroni. Hot pasta absorbs the flavor and dressing. Chill over night for best results. Best flavor and absorbs all of the dressing.

Made this in the summer for company.  It seems like a weird combination of things but has a great flavour.  It's even better the next day.

This was the best pasta salad I've ever made.  I used the suggestions by previous reviewers and cut the sugar to only half a cup, and used an entire 12 oz box of pasta, because it does make a lot of sauce.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a T, and it was terrific.  Rave reviews at a potluck for this one and many requests for the recipe.

This is a great salad - just an FYI if you are using plain mayo, youll need the full sugar amount - using Miracle whip - especially the no fat - you'll definitely have to cut the sugar way down.  MW fat free is loaded with it!  Take a look at the sugar in your dressing before adding extra.  I didnt use celery, but I did add green pepper to the Red peppper wow what a looker (and taster!) Sometimes a little shredded carrot on top is also a great addition.  If you dont have to, try not to skip the celery seed - it adds a little something.  This is definitely a fantastic summer addition!

Wish I had read the reviews before making this salad!  I did cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, but this was WAY too much if using Miracle Whip.  It might had been okay using regular mayo, but I agree with most that 1 to 2 T would have been sufficient, if used at all.  Also, I used sweet pickle relish instead of dill relish, it seemed to make more sense to me.  Otherwise, made as written and my husband did like it although I thought it was too sweet for my taste, hence the 4 star rating.

Cook up the macaroni up to a week or more and freeze it. When ready to use, rinse under cold water and drain. By doing this, macaroni does not absorb the dressing and it tastes like you just cooked it. I do this with all pasta.

I read the reviews, so figured I would step outside the box and try another recipe other than my own. I am NOT sorry, it is way better than mine!! I did take the advice of several and cut the sugar down to about 1/3 c. I believe that was just right for our tastes. It is simply delicious and I plan to fix it again and again. Try it, you won't be sorry!!

I read a lot of the reviews before making this.  I had to make it for a large crowd.  I was pretty much able to double everything except I only used 1 large red pepper.  I minced the onion, celery and pepper fine so there wouldn't be large chunks of the veggies.  I added about 1 cup of finely shredded carrot for color.  I only had sweet pickle relish and I only used 2 Tbsp. of that so it wouldn't be overpowering.  I used 8 eggs. I used 1/2 cup of sugar in the dressing (remember I doubled the recipe) and cut the mustard to 2-3  Tbsp.  I used cider vinger and added some black pepper and garlic powder.  I didn't have celery seed so I had to use celery salt and cut the amount down.  I made this the afternoon before my function.  I added just enough dressing to moisten at that time, then added some more before going to bed.  I added the rest of the dressing the next morning and it needed every bit of it.  I ended up making 1 more batch of dressing but only needed about 1/4 of it to moisten at the party I took it to.  I'll use the extra dressing for egg salad or potato salad.  I had quite a few people ask me for the recipe but my mother-in-law just had to tell me "it was o.k. but it was too sweet".  No surprise there, she critiques everything I make! I will definitely make this again but would try to cut the prep down by boiling the  eggs and making the dressing ahead of time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is THE BEST Macaroni Salad recipe I was ever used. You can modify the dressing any way you'd like and it still turns out wonderful. I cut down on the sugar but that's only because I don't like my Mac Salad that sweet. My only tip would be use half the dressing at first and let the salad sit in the frig for about an hour before adding the rest of the dressing. You can't lose with this recipe!

I give it a 5 star rating!!!  Delicious!  

Based on personal preference only, I decreased the Miracle Whip to 1 1/4 cup, sugar to 1/4 cup and the mustard by half.  I'm sure it's perfectly fine as written, but this is just the way my family prefers.

We loved this Macaroni Salad however I did follow the advice of other reviews and only added 1/4 cup sugar and in my opinion it was plenty sweet I may even cut down even I little more on the sugar next time and there will be a next time.

I cut back on the sugar as many reviews said, used Helmans light mayo and some sour cream as the base and cider vinegar ( thats all I had). Best macaroni salad, and even better the next day. It did get a bit dry over night so I just added a bit more mayo. This is our new family favorite. Update. Used Miracle Whip the second time. Way too sweet even with cutting the sugar down to 1/4 cup. No one in the family would eat it.

This was really good. I took the advice of others and reduced the sugare to about 1/4 of a cup. I think that it would have been way too sweet for my tastes if I had used the full 3/4 of a cup that the recipe calls for. I used chopped dill pickle in place of the relish. In my book, a five star recipe with the sugar reduction! Thank you Connie!

Very good recipe.  I too reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also used scallions instead of onions, they are milder.  I added a bit of fresh parsely and chopped up the bread and butter chip pickles for the relish...seemed to go well.

Very good tasting macaroni salad.  I made it as the recipe is but used 1/4 cup sugar and seasoned rice vinegar.  it I think I could have even cut the sugar down more since the vinegar was sweet.  I agree that this is quite a bit of dressing - I used a full 16 oz box of macaroni and it appears to be plenty "saucy".  I'll see tomorrow though, the pasta might soak a lot up.  I would guess that the full box of pasta makes about 12+ cups of the salad.  I cant wait for everyone to try it tomorrow at the picnin.  I know that even the kids will like it, even though there are onions in it.  I also used light kraft mayo, not mirical whip, but that's my taste preference.  I will definitely make this again.  I think of it as potato salad with pasta instead of potatoes.

I used mayo (I hate salad dressing) and added a bit more dill relish.  The resulting salad was delicious--the whole family loved it.  It definitely makes way more dressing than you need, so I doubled the amount of macaroni.  I think I'll cut down on the sugar a bit next time.  This would be way too sweet if you used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.

the ratio of macaroni to dressing is waaaayyy off.  I doubled the macaroni and halved the dressing and still had to add more macaroni.  As written, the recipe would be way too sweet.  I used a quarter of the amount of sugar and still felt it was way too sweet...can't imagine using that much sugar.  I did like the flavor combinations, however.  Used red onion and added some shredded carrot both to add color to the dish.  Need salt and pepper, and also added some paprika.

It's the taste I've looked for for years in a macaroni salad!  I cut the sugar, as others suggested to 1/4 c.  I also only put in one stalk of celery.  I used cole slaw dressing in place of the Miracle Whip which added a wonderful flavor.  I agree with others who suggest to cut the dressing mixture in half, or use 16 oz. of pasta.  I added tomatoes and cubes of cheddar cheese, too.

The "3/4 cup white sugar" on the ingredient list must be a typo. I added about a teaspoon and that was more than enough sweetness. Otherwise an exceptionally good mac salad.

I used 2/3 less sugar and half light miracle whip and half light mayo and it was great. Everyone loved it.

This was very generic tasting, like any salad you could get from your supermarket.  When I first made the dressing it tasted wonderful but after sitting it tasted so boring and generic this has possibility but needs more spice maybe some cayenne a little less sugar more dill it needs more va va va voom.

The absolute best macaroni salad recipe I have ever found.  I am not a big macaroni salad fan but I find myself craving this recipe. I also used half Hellmans & half Miracle Whip.  Used 1/4 cup sugar and added cubed cheese.

SIMPLY FANTASTIC!!!  I made this today to take to a friend of a friend's get together.  I doubled the recipe as there were a lot of people expected.  I also cut the sugar in half, and I added 2 cups Miracle Whip and 2 cups Blue Ribbon Mayo.  Before we left I had my husband taste it, and he raved about it!  :)  At the get together everyone that tried it loved it and asked who made it!  One lady whom I'd never met before today, approached me and said "Before you leave I HAVE to have the recipe for that macaroni salad!"  LOL  I thought, Well, I could mail it to her, but she wanted to serve it at a wedding in two days so we asked to use the host's computer to log on to All Recipes and I printed it out for her!  AMAZING!  The response to this salad was so wonderful!  I will make this often!  Cut down on the sugar at least by half - you won't be sorry you tried this FANTASTIC RECIPE!  :)  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great salad, but I have to agree with others who reviewed this. It would probably be much better, in my opinion, using only 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the 3/4 that it calls for.

I loved that this recipe called for dill relish and not sweet. Instead of miracle whip I used best foods mayo and I cut the amount of sugar to a little less than a quarter of a cup. Next time I will add a few chopped black olives.

Different than the tuna mac I am used to making but very good. I have made it twice in 3 days and both times upped it to serve 9, first time I only had a few tablespoons left after all was said and done. The first time I used a cup of sugar (again this was for 9 not 6) it was toooo much, so i tried to counter with some heat and it worked out ok. Today I decreased to a scant 3/4 cup. I skipped the red bell pepper and used fire roasted red pepper from a jar instead. I threw in an extra tbps of relish and rubbed the celery seed between my fingers to help release the flavor. Some people mentioned adding some cheese so I threw in a heavy handful of shredded cheddar jack. I know people can get kranky about reviewing a recipe after making changes but I wanted to share anyway. Good Stuff....ooohhhh and I used helmans cause thats what I always have, not miracle whip.

Excellent....everyone really liked this salad. Made a few changes...used a full pound of elbow macaroni, 4 hard cooked eggs, vidalia onion light Miracle Whip, spicy brown musatrd and only 2 Tblspns of the sugar. And of course the rest of the ingredients. Made the day before serving. Just delicious and plenty sweet with just a fraction of the sugar called for. Hubby LOVED it....thanks and will be making again!

Excellant if using only 1/4 cup sugar with miracle whip dressing. Otherwise too sweet. I use whole wheat pasta noodles with light miracle whip & 1/3 cup splenda to help with calories. Still Excellent!!!!

Fantastic recipe! Omitted the celery because of a picky eater in my family, but added more celery seed. Also added garlic powder, onion powder, and some chopped radishes, a little extra relish, and about 1/2 cup of sugar because of other reviews, oh and a little more salt. Oh and I used real mayo not miracle whip.

Delicious !  I absolutely can't stand when people rate a recipe but then go on and list 10 things they've changed....take the time to submit your own recipe !!!  Anyway, I did follow one suggestion since I used Miracle Whip; I cut the sugar in half and it was awsome.  I'm sure if you use Mayo, you need the sugar listed in the recipe.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!  It is great as is !!!

Scaled this recipe down to 4 servings because it would have made a huge salad! I found it was still too sweet. I haved the sugar next time and everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again. Thanks.

This is a great summer picnic/potluck salad--it makes A LOT.  However, I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was too sweet.  Definitely cut back on the sugar a little and it will be perfect!

The salad is tooooo sweet for my taste. 3/4 cup sugar and white vinegar makes this salad really really sweet.   If I try to make this again,I'll cut a lot of sugar and white vinagar.

1 to 2 table spoons of suger is better. I tried it with the 3/4 cups and was way to sweet. Tried it a second time wit 1 1/2 table spoon of sugar and it was just right.

I only used 1/4 c sugar, added extra relish, and used mayo instead of salad dressing.  This was very good - MUCH better than store-bought mac salad.

WAY too sweet. Just, wow. I didn't even get the other flavors of celery, pepper, or onion. The mircle whip and sugar makes way too much dressing for 2 cups pasta! It was soup-y and scrambled-egg-colored. Nobody ate it! I hate to give a bad review to an otherwise well-rated recipe. Sorry! If it improves overnight, I will re-rate it.

This is great! The celery really tastes good in this recipe. I used 1c. mayo and 1c. Miracle Whip, sweet relish, and I cut the sugar down to like 2tbsp it was perfect for us, tangy and sweet at the same time. Hubby and kids liked it, will make again.

I absolutley love this recipe but I did make some changes.  They are as follows: I used mini bowtie pasta (about 10 oz. dried), used 3/4 cup mayo, 2 Tbs dijon mustard, used 1/2 cup onion, omitted the red pepper and used 1 serrano pepper instead (balances the sweetness with a kick), used 1/4 tsp. celery salt & 1/4 tsp. garlic salt, dropped the sugar down to 1/4 cup and also omitted the vinegar.  I also only used 1 large stalk of celery and added a little pimiento for color.  So I guess you can say I made a lot of little changes but used this as a base/guideline, (I did use 3 hardboiled eggs though) it really turned out excellent.  Also, as other reviewers have mentioned (thank you) it's pretty darn sweet using only 1/4 cup sugar, I would definitely start with that amount and if you feel it needs to be sweeter for whatever reason add more after tasting.

This is just way too sweet. I would start with maybe a third of the amount called for and add until it tastes good. This recipe has good reviews, but it looks like just about everyone recomends reducing the amount of sugar. Besides the sugar issue its a great recipe.

Love this Macaroni Salad.  This is my first foray into Macaroni salad, I generally make a vinegrette for pasta, but I'm was making this for others (Pot Luck). So followed this recipe almost exactly, a little less sugar.  It needs to set overnight for the sugar to mellow out. As for Miracle Whip, I used to be a huge snob about MW, but I found some recipes just HAVE to have it, in order to get that just right flavor.  Slaw and this salad are perfect examples.
Thanks, I will make this again and again.

Way too sweet!  Even my friend who will practically eat spoonfuls of sugar thought this was too sweet.  I think cutting back to 1/4 c. maybe?  Also, you need to keep the dressing amount if making for the next day (which allows flavors to blend better) because the noodles really do soak it up overnight. ** UPDATE ** I've tinkered with this recipe and it never works out.  Too sweet or too much sauce or too tangy.  Bleck!

Love this!! Best mac salad I've ever had. Reminds me of my family's potato salad with the Miracle Whip and sugar. 
I used all the sugar, increased the macaroni to 3 cups and eggs to 6. I also added a handful of frozen peas to the hot macaroni when I drained it.

Best macaroni salad recipe I've found. I omitted the celery (I find it bleeds and makes salads watery) and I used sweet relish. I also cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. I'd say start with 1/4 and taste for sweetness. You can always add more.

After reading many of the reviews, I made the following adjustments to the recipe:  
used 3 cups uncooked macaroni. used 1/4 cup plus 1 tsp sugar, used 4 eggs, used 3 T dill relish, used approx 1 c Miracle Whip, used a green pepper.  I did not use vinegar or celery seed. Then I added a jar of diced pimento for color.  Turned out PERFECT !!   This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is worthy of 5 stars with an adjustment in the sugar.  I used 1/3 cup sugar as other reviewers suggested and it was fantastic!  I can't imagine this with 3/4 cup of sugar.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except for the sugar quantity and I omitted the onions because I don't like them.  Definitely a keeper, and I doubt I will buy pre-made mac salad again!

We purchase this salad from an Amish shop from Lancaster, PA (Amish country) and this recipe's taste is accurate.  I made only one change (less sugar), but used the exact ingredients listed.  It turned out perfectly.  Thank you Connie.  It's a KEEPER.

This is a great recipe!  I love it as macaroni salad, but it also makes an excellent chicken salad spread.  I use red wine vinegar rather than the white vinegar and don't usually add the celery seed if I have celery stalks.  :D

We thought this was a great dish. I made it slightly healthier though by using whole wheat pasta, reduced fat dressing & skipped the additional sugar (it was plenty sweet without it).

Absolutely the best macaroni salad I've ever made at home. Yes, it does taste like some store-bought brands, but I've never been able to make macaroni salad as good as store bought before. I love the creamy dressing, mine always ended up dry in a short time. Yes, it is a little sweet, I think I will add less sugar next time I make it but overall it's definately a keeper. I will be making macaroni salad a lot more often in the future now that I have this recipe!

Sans the sugar, this is the macaroni salad that our family has enjoyed for many years.  I am glad to see that this recipe, like my own, calls for Miracle Whip, which I also use in potato salad, chicken salad and egg salad.  Most often, salads call for mayonnaise, which I find rather bland.

This was good but I am SO glad I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. Even then we thought it was still too sweet...maybe that is what makes this an "Amish" dish! I think Miracle Whip makes it plenty sweet enough. Other than that, it was a tasty macaroni salad.

Like all of us, I've made a lot of macaroni salad, but no one ever raved about my recipe before I tried this one. I used light mayo, sweet relish, green or red peppers,apple cider vinegar, and even skipped the celery once for someone who had an aversion - came out great every time! Thanks...

Great recipe - particularly if you want to prepare the salad a day or two in advance. I used quite a bit more pasta, put in two dill pickles instead of the relish and, most important, used only 1/4 cup sugar. NO more is needed. Thanks a for keeper.

This salad was very good with these changes:  Use only 1 cup of mayonnaise (we use mayonnaise), only 1/4 c. sugar is plenty unless you're a pure sugar junkie, and I used only 1 T. of mustard.  Other than that I didn't change anything, although it probably would be good with a sprinkle of cayenne for a little extra pazzaz.

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT!!  Best macaroni salad I ever made. My family went crazy over this. I took one reviewers advice and used 1/4 cup sugar and I made a double recipe with that. I couldn't see using 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I am not a celery fan so I replaced that with carrots. This will be my macaroni salad recipe to make for all time now!  THANKS!!!!!!!   Richie

After reading the other reviews, I decided that Miracle Whip wasn't the right choice.  So I made this recipe and substituted mayo (low fat) instead.  I also reduced the sugar to 2/3 c. (used half Splenda and half sugar).  I substituted carrots for the green pepper as that's what I had and my DH doesn't care for gr. pepper.  I really think you could use any veggies your family prefers.  I also added diced leftover turkey to turn this into a lite summer main dish and served it with sliced tomatoes and cornbread.  It was a real hit.  I think you can't go wrong with this salad if you use mayo.  Then it is definitely worth the 5 stars.  My hubby L O V E D this salad. I will definitly keep this one.

I was leary of this recipe.  I've never had Amish macaroni salad and unfortunately thought it (for whatever illogical reason) was supposed to have a ton of sugar.  I also prefer not pre-reading reviews so as not to be influenced by them.  My mistake.  I was actually surprised it wasn't any more sweet than it was. I sort of got used to it but didn't want to make it again.    After reading reviews, and because it just makes sense, I'm inclined to believe the sugar thing is a typo.  I disagree that it's too much dressing, as I usually do, but I always chill mine and the dressing always soaks in.  Most pasta recipes don't have enough sauce IMO.  I might try this again, and look up some other recipes to see what the "Amish" kind is supposed to be like.  However, I must say that after almost 150 reviews, wouldn't the original poster have "checked in" and fixed it if it was a typo???
EDIT:   I made this again, assuming 3/4 TSP. sugar, and that made it way too mustardy.  I did buy some at the deli and it was nothing like this recipe.

Excellent, with change in sugar to just under 1/4 cup. 
I've made it this several times, and an interesting fact is that it freezes beautifully, thawing as if it had never been frozen.

OMG this is soooo good.  I made it with Penne Pasta, put red, yellow and green peppers some onions, sliced lunch meat (turkey and ham) and of coarse Mozz cheese.  It was awesome.  I Put in three tblsp of sugar.  It was perfect.  I tried two different dressings recipes, before I decided and this was the best.  Thanks so much.  It even tastes like there is bacon in it.  I will be eating this for along time.  I have been craving pasta salad since I live in AZ and it has been 105 degrees every day.

Delicious!!!  This recipe does make a lot--I halved it and it was enough for 4 people.  Also, it does make a lot of dressing, so I followed the advice of another review that dried the noodles first and then added enough to coat and saved the extra dressing to add later if needed--this worked out really well!

Exactly what I was looking for - thank you!  I messed with it slightly to make it more to my own tastes.  I took the onion out, and added finely chopped carrot. I didn't add eggs, and I reduced the sugar slightly.  It's awesome!

This macaroni salad is excellent!  I have never seen people eat so much macaroni salad at a party!! Everyone loved it!  I did take the advise of others and cut the sugar in half.  I've made it twice and both times it flew!  Thanks.

This was great. The only thing I did was cut back on the sugar I didn't use the full 3/4 cup but I did use at least a half a cup.  Oh I also used both green and red peppers from my garden. I like adding color to my salads.

I love this salad! I read the reviews so cut the sugar to abt 1/4 cup
& used less dressing. Next time I will
add black olives & chopped red pepper in place of celery.

This is a fabulous pasta salad.  My husband doesn't like mayo or mustard and he eats this all up!  I added a little green pepper too for some additional color and added more pasta (1 lb. of rotini).  It is always a huge hit for any summer picnic or bbq!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because as written it would have been too sugary and drowning in dressing.
I too cut back to half of the sugar and could have cut back even more. I also cut the Miracle Whip in half. Two cups is definately overkill. I didn't have any dill relish, so I fine chopped some dill pickles. I also added a bit of Garlic Powder and a dash of Accent. I will be making this again with these changes. Thanks for the post!

I grew up on macaroni salad made with tuna and Hellmann's so this recipe was quite different than what I am used to...and exactly why I wanted to try it!  I have to say, this kind of reminds me of the stuff I get at the deli when I am in a pinch, only this recipe is much much better (the guys at the deli must use miracle whip too).  As per the reviews, I cut back on the sugar a lot and only used 1 tablespoon which was plenty.  Also, I made two minor changes.  In place of the celery seed and salt called for in the recipe,I used 1 teaspoon of celery salt instead and because the grocery store didn't sell dill relish I decided to just mince up a a dill pickle.  It is a nice alternative to the macaroni salad my family and I are used to having :)

I followed the advice of other reviewers: only 2T sugar and mixed the (cooked) egg yolks in with the dressing to thicken it up.  My boyfriend thought this was great!  I used salad cream this time, but will probably try half salad cream, half mayo next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best!  I'm glad that I read other comments before I made it though.  I only used about 3 T. sugar and used half Miracle Whip and half mayo.  I thought I'd have plenty of leftovers but three hungry men ate so much that I barely got to taste it!

i gotta go with the flow here & award this recipe it's well earned 5 stars!  like others, i reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. after seeing what a large amount of dressing this makes i decided to use 3 cups macaroni, 5 eggs & round off the chopped veggie amount. the end result was a delicious & still creamy summer salad. many thanks connie!

This recipe was great!  Kids and adults liked it at a big 4th of July gathering.  However, I used less than half of the dressing and everyone found that just right.

Doubled the recipe, skipped the relish, used Hellman's instead of Miracle Whip, and celery salt instead of seed.  Big change - for a DOUBLE batch I used only 1/2 cup sugar and probably could have used less, it tasted pretty good, but I don't really need the sweetness in a mac salad.  Overall, tasted like a mac salad I'd buy in a deli - pretty good, not fantastic.

Pretty good recipe. I cut back on the sugar as others suggested and used 1 c. miracle whip and 1 c. mayo. I still thought it was a little too sweet. I'll make this again but use even less sugar.

I made this last night and WOW.  It is fabulous.  I took some to my parents,who spend a lot of time near Chambersburg PA and always came home raving about a macaroni salad they would get at a local deli.  Apparently this is a dead ringer for that salad. Thanks so much for posting!  Oh, btw, I did not have celery seed so made it without and it still turned out absolutely delicious.

This one recieved rave reviews, it was fast, easy, tasty and used relatively few ingredients, most I had on hand.  I made only two changes, I used Hellman's mayo, and only 1/4 cup of sugar.  I thought this was good, and a keeper in my summer repertoire.

I love how people totally change the recipe then rate it. I grew up in NW Pennsylvania eating authentic cooking from my Amish neighbors. This recipe, made exactly as written, is AMISH Macaroni Salad! It is sweet as most is, it is made with Miracle Whip; it has celery. If you don't like it, rate as so, and move on to a non-Amish version. Save you add-in's / leave out's for your own recipe instead of ruining this for someone searching for the real thing.

I absolutely love this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  Personal preference had me decrease the salad dressing
and spices that go in it to one half.  Cut out the sugar completely and used natures seasoning instead of salt.  Delicious...This is a staple in our household.

well....yummy! i havnt made mac salad in prob 15 yrs and was lookin for a refresher...wow!!! i did make  a few changes based on pref and what i had in my stock....first thing, which i used to do back in the day....1/2 mayo 
and half miracle whip...which is prob why the sugar amt wasnt disagreeable. i used chopped green and black olives, reduced the chopped onion a bit and sprinkled chopped green onions in as well. grated a big fatty carrot into it and used two large grated pickles in place of the relish...oh! and didnt have enough elbow mac so added spiral to make up the difference....again, wow!!!! cant wait for my man, who asked me to make some, to get home from work and check it out! pretty convinced he is still gonna think im the best cook on the planet!!! oh!!! and wish i could ship some to my grandson down in mississippi!!! he would go nuts over it!!! def thumbs up from one discerning cook who doesnt even own a recipe....

Moved to the top of the list of potato salad recipes.  My husband loves the sauce so much he wants me to try it on pasta salad and coleslaw.  A definite winner.

Loved it!!  Best Mac salad recipe I've had.  Will be a permanent fixture on my summer menu.  Having said that, and after reading the reviews I made just a few slight tweaks.  I really don't like too sweet of a salad of any type, so I only added 2 Tbsp. of sugar which was perfect for my buds, and used apple cider vinegar instead of white.  I didn't have red pepper, so I used the green pepper that I had on hand. I had plenty of celery but no celery seeds so I put in 4 stalks of celery so their was plenty of flavor, and this worked out well.  I also used Best Foods mayonaise, as i am not a miracle whip girl! And this is my preferred brand.  I made it tonight, used just over a cup of mayo.  I'd imagine I may be adding a bit more in am as the mayo was absorbed by the pasta.  I look forward to the next time Ii make it, as i will have the proper called for ingredients on hand and try it just as in recipe except for the called for amount of sugar.  

Thank you Connie for such a delicious treat!!!  Best recipe ever!!

Nice summer salad, but way too sweet if full sugar amount is used. I used green onion for the white, omitted the pickle relish, omitted celery seed, only used 1 tbsp of sugar and it was sweet enough as Miracle Whip is sweet as well, I used 2 tbsps of vinegar as that is what I thought it said, it was good. I didn't use the full amount of Miracle Whip either as I ran out and it was fine.

This macaroni salad is delicious! I altered the recipe slightly by substituting a cucumber for the red bell pepper. I doubled the hard-cooked eggs and added about 1/2 cup to 1 cup extra macaroni (so it wasn't quite so saucy). I also reduced the sugar by about 1/2. I have used Splenda and gluten-free macaroni, too, and it always turns out great. It always tastes best by making it the day before. The celery seed really adds to the salad. It has always been a hit!

No sugar, no vinegar. Use miracle whip and real mayonnaise. If the recipe calls for 2 cups of mayo or whip, just adjust the recipe, use 1 cup mayo and 1 cup miracle whip. Extra eggs do not hurt. If you like them add them. More eggs mean more mayo/whip........    Remember, the longer the salad has to wait for serving, the eggs and macaroni will absorb the mayonnaise and miracle whip. Just add more of each until it is to your preferred consistency. You do not need celery seed either. For a kick add 1 T worcestshire. :)

I made this for a party (doubled the recipe) and it was completely gone by the end of the night!  I added very little sugar (about 1/4 cup) based on other reviews and it turned out wonderfully!

I wish that I had read the comments before making this. The dressing was sickeningly sweet, but I did manage to salvage it with more salt, mustard, and Miracle Whip. As is, this would not have been very good.

I love this type of marcaroni salad.  It was a huge hit with my family.  Made tons of left overs and they didnt stick around for long.  I used Hellman's mayo (we HATE miracle whip) and came out just as good.

I used Mayo and ~1/3cup of sugar and it was perfect. Regardless of if it's SUPPOSED to be a sweet dish, I prefer it more savory.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  It was delicious.  Perfect for our tailgate.

Doubled the veggies, added 4 eggs, used a 16 oz box of macaroni, used 1/4 cup of sugar, subbed red wine vinegar, & used more salt & pepper. Refrigerated for about 6 hrs-had to add a bit more mayo.  Pretty good!  Added some tuna in it for my Husband's lunch the next day.

Awesome macaroni salad - needed a little more dressing and eggs for my taste. I made this the day before the BBQ, used about 3/4 of the dressing and reserved 1/4 for right before serving. I thought it needed a little more but it was still good! I used mayo instead of miracle whip. I also love eggs and thought 3 eggs was not enough for all of that macaroni.  Will make again!

This was a great pasta salad.  My husband loves a local deli's amish mac salad and I am always buying it.  I decided to make this recipe to see if it was similar and the sauce has that nice sweet tang to it that the deli version has.  I liked all the extra veggies in this to give it a nice added crunch.  I do think adding one more hard boiled egg to this would be nice.  As well as maybe an added 1/2 more of uncooked pasta since it is a little soupy.  But we like the extra sauce it has!  I used a green bell pepper and added in a thing of pimentos.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was delish!  The next day it was even better.  Thanks for the great recipe!

They only thing I did differently was reducing the sugur to 1/8 of a cup. It was perfect! One of the best recipes I've tried. I'm glad it worked out because I'm bringing this to a cookout today! Whew :)

3/4 of a cup of sugar just seems to be way too much for most people. I suggest starting out with a couple of tablespoons and then adjust it to taste. Other than that, this is an excellent recipe. Thanks Connie!

didnt have enough macaroni so used farfalle (bowtie) pasta. Tried it on friends at camp ground as a taste test. They ate 2/3 of the bowl...sooo i added another cup of cooked pasta but no more of the other ingredients and took out to supper the next night. everyone loved it. the second time i made it i used 3 cups bowtie pasta and could probably use another cup because there is so much sauce.

This was wonderful!  Served it to my Doll club and they loved it. Changed the pasta to mini penne and add dry dill  weed because I didn't have the relish.  I will surely make again,  Thanks for sharing.

This macaroni salad is very good. I used my food processor to chop the eggs, onion, celery and bell pepper. The next time I make it I will put a little less salad dressing in it though. Otherwise it is excellent.

VERY GOOD. Definitely make the day before or even make the sauce part of the recipe a couple of days before. I really don't like macaroni salad but I made this for hubby and I actually did like it quite a lot - hence the 4 stars. Hubby LOOOOOVED it. It does make plenty of sauce and I had left over pasta the next week so I just made a smaller amount again. Hubby was very happy.

As written this recipe is possibly a 3 or msybe even a 2. Thankfully, I took the time to read a lot of reviews. I cut the sugar way down to 1/4 cup, halved the mustard, used a full 16 oz box of shell pasta, used celery salt in place of celery seed and salt, and added an extra egg. Doing all this made this recipe into a 4! I may be tinkering with this one again...

I am extremely picky when it comes to any kind of macaroni or potato salad, and I loved this!  I will definitely make it over and over, with some adjustments.  I went with one suggestion and used 3T of dill pickles, diced; and 1/2 c. sugar.  I'm not too big on onion, so I used 1/2 of a small onion also.  Everything else I followed as directed.  This is definitely a keeper!

Not a 5 star because it has too much sugar.  But otherwise it is really good.

I recommend using Hellman's mayo.  The first time I made this with Miracle Whip I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. It was good but when I made it a second time I used Hellman's and I added the 3/4 c. sugar.  It made a HUGE improvement for my taste. It is sweet but it's also delicious. I think it would be great with grilled meats or a spicey BBQ. I will make again. I should add that I am a mayo person rather than a MW person and my mayo of choice is Hellman's(or Best Foods here in Phoenix).

Very good! I did take everyone's advice and added only 1/4 of a cup of sugar. I also added a bit more dill relish to cut the sweetness. Instead of using white vinager I used apple cidar. All in all it is a great recipe and my husband loves it!

This is the best macaroni salad I've ever tasted. I actually used mini shells instead of elbow mac.  It's very colorful & pretty.  It was simple and quick to make and so delicious!

This was really good, instead of using regular relish I had some thousand island relish that was made and it turned out great, also made it again with chunks of ham as the family likes ham and they loved it.  Thanks

Wow, this is one tasty macaroni salad, everyone loved this! I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, but next time I may add a little more. I also used the entire pound of elbow macaroni, and the dressing coated this perfectly for our tastes. The next day it was a bit on the dry side, but it was still very good. I will use this recipe again for sure, and next time I may make 1 1/2 times the dressing for the entire pound of macaroni if making this the day before serving. I also topped this with some paprika. Thanks for sharing this super delicious recipe :)

This recipe was great! I should have listened to another reviewer and used 4 eggs instead of three, but I was hungry and needed a snack! Also added a bit if chili pepper each time I ate it and it was great.

This is a very flavorful macaroni salad recipe.  I made it the night before a picnic ,and it was very creamy when it came time to eat.  After one more day, it was even better after all the flavors "married."  This is a keeper!

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and we felt it was still too sweet!  Maybe  1/4 or 1/3 cup would be better, had I put the  3/4 cup sugar it  would have been ruined imo!   I realized I was out of celery after I started and didn't want to run to the store; I subbed green bell pepper for it.  I used 1 cup of regular Kraft mayonnaise and 1 cup of lower cal. olive oil mayonnaise.

This salad is so good and a big hit at picnics and potlucks.  My only change is I use best foods mayo instead of miracle whip.   I do find it's best to let sit overnight so the salad can absorb the dressing.   Don't be decieved by how saucy the salad is when you're done.  The dressing does get absorbed.   FYI- this is a sweet mac salad as I think all amish mac recipes will tend to be sweet.  Thanks!!

I was looking for a fast and cheap meal and came across this. I was a bit leary as we don't like macaroni salad but it had such great reviews. Mostly made it as is but added a bit of dill and garlic and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup per other reviewers. Also added 3 dill pickles for the relish. Teenager and 2 younger ones loved it. Even I was surprised to enjoy it. Thank you for this great recipe.

This is the taste for which I've been looking!  Today is the third time I've made it since I placed this recipe in my Allrecipes.com Recipe Box.  The ONLY problem is that I can't stop eating it once I start.  I eat it for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, and dessert!  Today, I didn't have nearly enough salad dressing, so I had to substitute fat-free plain yogurt.  It turned out fabulous, nonetheless.

I decided on this pasta salad to serve at my daughters 2nd birthday party. It was wonderful. I took other reviewers advice and cut the amount sugar. I used Miracle Whip dressing and apple cider vinegar in place of regular vinegar. I also used bowties instead of macaroni and used the whole box, not just 2 cups. Do make sure if you are making this ahead to only add half of the cream mixture to the pasta, reserving the other half to be added just before serving. This ensures a wonderful, creamy pasta salad.

Sorry, but this recipe in my opinion is 4 stars at best.  There is far too much dressing for the amount of macaroni and veggies, plus I reduced the amount of sugar to two tablespoons and still found it overly sweet.

This is good, but definitely do not put in that much sugar!  I don't think it even needs sugar if you use Miracle Whip.  I only used 1/4 cup and it still seemed like too much.

The best macaroni salad I've ever had and there is so many different veggies you can spruce it up with. I added green pepper, red onion, ham, cheddar cheese and a pinch of garlic powder.

Look no further, this truly is the best macaroni salad! I've made this many times and just decided to change my old review- The 1st time I made it I thought it was too saucy, so then I'd make it w/ half the sauce, but I've since decided I think it's better as written- it really soaks it up over time. Because of this it's best the next day, I think. You can easily adjust, add or omit ingredients to suit your taste, but as written it's a perfect 'classic' macaroni salad... I like to use reduced fat mayo, add 1ts/ea. dry mustard and dry dill, and 1/2ts celery salt instead of seed, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and use sweet relish, sometimes sub 2 finely chopped fresh jalapenos for red pepper. This is waaay better than the store bought deli kind and is a quick, simple, cheap side dish. Keeps well in the frige for a couple days, so make the full amount...

This was delicious! But I give it 4 stars as written, because I think it would have been too sweet and too creamy for our tastes. I added an extra 1 C of pasta to absorb all that dressing (though I used mayo), and used only 1/4 C of sugar. Simply divine! And, I bet it will be even better tomorrow!

Not that this recipe needs another 5 star review but I think this is the best macaroni salad that I have ever tasted.  My husband loves pasta salads but I could never make them until I found this recipe.  Now I make it all the time.  The only changes to this recipe I would suggest is to start out with only 1/2 the amount of ingredients for the dressing mix unless you like soupy pasta (you can always add more later if you want), use Best Foods (that's the only kind of mayo I use), and start with only 1/8 cup of sugar, you can add more according to your taste.  I added sliced black olives and used 1/2 the red bell pepper just for color.  This macaroni salad though is AWESOME!!!

I loved this salad!  I used red, yellow, and orange peppers and it tasted great!  I ended up with too much sauce, and saved the extra but never needed it.  I did cut the sugar a bit as some of the other reviewers had suggested and it was amazing.  I will be using this one again and again this coming summer!

This is super and my family LOVED it, but the proportions are off. There is way too much dressing for the amount of pasta. I used a full 16 ounce package and had a super creamy macaroni salad. I left out the eggs (I just don't prefer them in my pasta salads). I was also out of relish so I finely diced some dill pickles and I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet. When I made it and tasted it, I thought it was good, but it is much better if you let chill for an hour or so - the flavors come together much better and it goes from good to fantastic! Even sitting in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, it never dried out like some macaroni salads do. It stayed very creamy. I will make this again!!

I have been making the same macaroni salad recipe for years but decided to give this one a try. My son proclaimed it to be the best macaroni salad I ever made. I did cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup but I also used sweet relish since I didn't have any dill. I think it would be good with the dill relish as well. I  used mayo instead of salad dressing since that's all I had on hand and I only used about 1 1/2 cups. That was plenty.

Amazing. I love keeping this in the frige because I can have it any time without even having to heat it up and it tastes great just like what my grandmother use to make. This is really a classic recipe for old-fashion macaroni salad. The only changes that I made were that I didn't have the vegetables so I just mixed the "sauce" with the pasta also this recipe calls for way too much sugar so I cut the sugar down and it was still a little too sweet for some people but I loved it. Also it was a bit runny even after a night in the frige so it probably doesn't need that much mayo either.

Great recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup like folks advised and it was perfect.  I also used sweet relish to get rid of it and this was the best Macaroni Salad that I ever made.  Easy and great!

This was good.  We have had our share of Amish Macaroni Salad while living in Amish country back East and this was missing something and I can't put my finger on it.  I cut the sugar in half and it still was PLENTY sweet.  I can't imagine having all of it in there.  Had to sub a green pepper for the red.
It was good and I would make it again- it just wasn't great.

Very good macaroni salad! I didn't have the dill pickle relish so I had to sub with sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar down a bit and the mayo, too. A little too saucy, but still very good!!!

This is the first time ever making macaroni salad and I'm glad I used this recipe!  Very tasty.  I followed the directions precisely except that all I had was apple cider vinegar.  I also added a can of sliced black olives.  Others mentioned that there was too much sauce.  If you like a lot of sauce then it's fine but I don't so I boiled another cup of noodles and threw them in.  I also added another stalk of celery.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will definately use this again!

This is a GREAT pasta salad recipe.  I made the recipe almost exactly as is stated with a couple small exceptions.  First, I used 1/2 regular mayo and 1/2 lite mayo.  And I used sweet pickle relish instead of dill.  These are just family preferences but it was delicious!  Also, I didn't have any celery seed on hand so I used celery salt.  And I did cut the sugar as other reviewers suggested and used a little more than 1/4 cup sugar.  I'll never make another pasta salad again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is THE perfect picnic/potluck/side dish pasta salad. I made it exactly as published. The flavors blend beautifully -- not too plain; no overwhelming ingredient.  It is on the sweet side so don't presume the relish & mustard will stand out. As I said, it all blends. Also, if you contemplate colors as you plan your meals, you can expect a gorgeous golden yellow from this recipe.  Delicious.  Thanks Connie0751.

This truly is the BEST macaroni salad.  I reduced the sugar drastically down to 2 T. and my family devours it every time I make it.  It is always a huge hit at get togethers of all kinds - even Thanksgiving!

I loved this recipe!  I made it for a cookout that we had over the weekend and I had so many people ask me for the recipe it was ridiculous! I did make a few changes.  First of all I double everything in the recipe except for the celery seed.  I didn't have any so I just left that out.  Also, I used two cups of generic salad dressing with two cups of light miracle whip.  It was a little soupy at first but i kept it in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day it was just perfect.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Worth the extra effort.  Made this for a picnic and everybody loved it.   Some said it was a little too sweet but that didn't keep them from coming back for more.  Made it just the way the recipe called for.

I had to comment on this recipe. It is so delicious! I'm not a macaroni salad type person, but this has such a yummy addictive flavor that we found ourselves stealing forkfuls throughout the night.

Next time i make this, and there will be a next time, i will reserve a portion of the sauce. We would have liked it a wee bit drier, but only our preference. All ingredients were kept the same. Delish!!

This was a wonderful Macaroni Salad. I did decrease the sugar as suggested. The proportion of macaroni to sauce was just perfect after it sat for a while.

Very good recipe--I'm not big on macaroni salad, but hubby loves it.  I reduced sugar to 1/3 cup, used about 1/2 a jar of diced pimentos instead of the red bell pepper, and added a can of chopped olives to the mix. Also I substitued mayonnaise for 1/2 of the Miracle Whip called for in the recipe (we just don't like Miracle Whip). Next time, I think I'll add a bit more vinegar for some tang.  Enjoy!

This was a great salad that I will make again. Per the reviews, I cut the sugar back to a half cup (I used Hellman's Real Mayo) and used shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni since that is what I had on hand. Really nice flavor.

Excellent recipe--but I made some changes based on personal preference. Only used about 1/4 c. sugar, increased macaroni to 3 cups (amount of dressing was still sufficient). I think the recipe as written is too wet for our taste--but, again, this is all personal preference. Used red onion for extra color and that worked great. I eye-balled the onion, pepper and celery--enough to make it pretty, but my kids don't like a lot of "stuff" in their macaroni salad. anyway---got rave reviews at a Memorial Day picnic--so it's a keeper. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe as 4 servings for my partner and I to try out before I make it for my son's first birthday in two weeks. This has to be the best macaroni salad I have ever had, and I would consider myself somewhat of a macaroni salad connisseur. 
I did make a few changes with the ingrediants: (For 4 servings)
1-1/3 cup macaroni uncooked
2 hard boiled eggs, diced
1/4 cup green onion, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/3 cup red pepper, diced
1-1/2 tbsp dill relish
1-1/3 cup fat free Miracle Whip
1-1/2 tbsp mustard
1/3 cup white sugar
1-1/2 tbsp white wine vinegar
1/4 tsp celery salt

Next time I do make this recipe (2 weeks from now!) I plan on only putting half the sauce over the macaroni, and leaving it over night, and then adding more dressing as needed before serving.

I also reduced the sugar to about 1/3 cup, and it was plenty sweet.  I used farfalle pasta which I thought looked very nice.  I really liked this recipe, it is not bland, which is usually my complaint about creamy salads.  This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for Macaroni Salad.

This recipe is the greatest.  My family and I enjoyed Amish Macaroni Salad which we purchased from a nearby deli.  They discontinued it so I found this recipe on the internet.  It is even better than the one they had.  As one one of my daughters would say, "It is the "bombigity"  Very good!  I've made it twice in 2 weeks and my kids just keep on asking for it!

I just love this recipe and have wowed both my father-in-law and mother-in-law on two separate occassions (they're divorced).  Don't listen to the people that say you MUST cut the sugar.  It's a personal preference, but I use every bit it calls for and no one I've served it to has ever said it was too sweet.  I never add the relish and I use a couple of green onions in place of the regular onion.  I also use small shells when I have them in place of the elbows.  It's great right after you make it, but it's brilliant once it's had several hours to chill.

The best, however I did cut back on the sugar (only 1/2 c) and it is a plenty. Tastes, as it chills longer, like macaroni salad you get out of the deli.

I made this for our Easter cookout and everyone enjoyed it.  I used a 1/2 cup of splenda instead of the sugar and regular mayo instead of m-whip.  It was delicious, thanks for the recipe!

I used real mayo instead of miracle whip. I also added 1/2 tsp. of dill weed. As per some other reviews, cut the sugar amount in half, but my husband still thought it was too sweet. I liked it though. The last thing I would change if I make this again is to maybe make 1 1/2 times the amount of the dressing, or maybe cut back on the amount of macaroni because after it sat in the fridge overnight it got a little dry. Would have preferred a creamier less dry salad. Overall though a very good recipe.

This recipe is Sooooo Good. It's just like the recipe that I made myself with the exception that I add a little Thosand Island Dressing and Omit the vinegar and sugar. It's so good!

***I have made this over 20 times.  You must give it a try.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

I made this for a 4th of July picnic and it was a hit! Family & Friends loved it! I followed other reviewers advice and cut back on the sugar to just under 1/4 cup and used Splenda instead of sugar.

This is a wonderful salad that tastes so much better than any my family makes. I have been looking for a salad recipe and this is it! The only change I made was to decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup. Other than that it was great! Next time I will try adding peas and tuna! Thanks!!

I was actually surprised this was so good, but I liked it. I did only add 1/4 cup sugar and when I make it again I might add more. The sugar took away the overwhelming flavor mayo has in a mac salad. I will definately make again. Thank you.

Wow!  This is the best recipe for macaroni salad.  I left out the eggs because my husband doesn't like them in mac salad.  I also didn't add the relish or peppers.  Instead I added carrots.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar as other readers suggested.  Turned out perfect and stayed nice and creamy for days.  Excellent!!!!!!

I think the celery salt (I didn't have celery seed) makes this a terrific macaroni salad.  I like that it doesn't taste like noodles and mayonnaise - as macaroni salad sometimes does!  I agree with others that less sugar is needed to make this. I also used sweet relish because it's all I had.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and it's great.

DO NOT use the sugar!
It was WAY too sweet (and I only used half of what it called for!)

It's hard to rate this recipe. The taste is a little different with all the unusual ingredients----macaroni without tuna in it, to me is kind of a waste so I guess this was just ok. Also, I can't understand how people raved about the taste then went on to basically change the everything??????? Well, I did so too, but I'm not raving.  There is no way I would put 2 cups of salad dressing into 2 cups of macaroni, nor 1/2 cup of sugar into most recipes let alone mac salad!

WOW!  I went in search of a homemade dressing for macaroni salad and found what I was looking for with this recipe.  I used a 1 lb. box of macaroni, but used the recommended dressing because of past reviews saying it was too much dressing.  I also used regular mayonnaise (light) and then only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  It is plenty sweet, so if you like a macaroni salad that is not sweet, just omit the sugar all-together.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Oh, and when I saw how much mustard you use I was a little leary, but it turned out to be perfect!  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!

This is an awesome pasta salad!  The first time I made this, I had no macaroni but had quite a bit of bow-tie pasta I wanted to use up.  I nearly doubled the amount of pasta it called for but the dressing seemed to coat it nicely.  Like many people, I reduced the amount of sugar to about 1/4 cup.

Overall this a pretty good macaroni salad recipe.  We also did some minor alterations:  We used  regular mayo and cut it back to about 1-1/2 (you can also use some non-fat yogurt to cut down on the calories, but I had none available) add mayo for proper consistency.  I also used some colorful curled rotini noodles with the standard elbow for a change.  And added about 1/3 cup of Italian salad dressing, about a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley, a few shakes of paprika for presentation.  Because of all the negative experience everyone had with sugar, I added none.  This tasted like a potato salad, which is what I was striving for anyhow.  Good recipe.  I’ll be making this again!

This was pretty good salad.  It was a little wet, but I like pasta salads on the moist side.  A little too much celery flavor for me.  Used green pepper instead of red, but I think it would be prettier with the red.  There's no way I'd use that much sugar.  I think I used about 1/4C and that was plenty.  Miracle Whip is kind of sweet anyway.  Still can't beat a salad made with mayo.  Good if all if you have is MW on hand.

This was excellent, but, like some of the others, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup.  I cannot image making this recipe with 3/4 cup sugar.  I thought it was still a little too sweet with the 1/4 cup sugar, but everyone loved it.  Will make again!!!

Excellent...cut dressing down to 1-1/4 cups Miracle Whip and adjusted the rest of the dressing ingredients accordingly.  Used red onion, substituted zucchini for the red pepper and added a tad of chopped fresh Italian parsley.  Decreased the amount sugar also.

I prepared this exactly as posted..This was way too sweet for my taste. It did taste very similiar to store bought macaroni salad, which I tend to dislike. The mayo soaks into the macaroni overnight, losing its runny texture..My oldest daughter likes it, unfortunately I won't try this recipe again. I guess I'll chalk it up to different taste preferences.

I have always followed my own recipe when making a mac salad, and everyone has always complimented me on it. However, I always find something wrong with it. I made this for Mother's Day, and for the first time did not find a single thing wrong with it! From now on, this is the way I will make mac salad. Of course, I DID NOT use 3/4 sugar. I think this must have been a misprint? I used a TBS, and I don't think it really needed that. But I found the amount of dressing called for just perfect for two cups of pasta, making it very creamy. Next day it is even better.

I really liked this although I thought it was a bit too sweet. So I added about a quarter cup mustard just to take the sweetness away. I will make this again, definitely, but with way less sugar.

I also thought this salad was just okay.  Somehow I ended up with a pretty runny dressing, and had to drain the whole salad.  The flavor was not bad, though!

This salad was good.  My sister doesn't really like macaroni salad or things that are too creamy, but she thought this was excellent.  She kept eating it even when she was full because she thought it was so good.  I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent.  I did double the amount of macaroni because I felt there might be too much dressing otherwise and next time, I will use 1/2 an onion instead of a whole one.  The onion flavor has become extremey strong since I made it two days ago.

I had never made home made mac salad before.  This wasn't very hard, and tasted fantastic. Even my kids who don't ussually eat the store bought stuff ate this, and one requests I make it for every BBQ.

This salad is best if you let it sit overnight and then serve it. The flavors all go perfectly together. The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the amounts of the onion, peppers and celery. They were a little too much for my liking...other than that it's great!

I'm sure the recipe is wonderful just the way it is, but I must mess with things to make it seem like it's mine. I doubled the recipe to feed an army (not literally), halved the sugar (I like tangy better than sweet), used only two thirds of the Miracle Whip (it seemed like enough), and added some garlic powder (because I put garlic in nearly everything). It turned out GREAT. Many compliments all around.

This recipe is great! Just like my Ohio grandma's macaroni salad.  What's nice about this recipe is that as long as you have the basics you can add/reduce to adjust to your taste. I've prepared it with just 1 egg, 1 stalk celery, diced pickles in place of the relish, etc. depending on what I have on hand and it's always good. Have been adding julienned carrots lately and that's a nice addition.  The noodles really suck up the liquid so I save 1/4 of the "wet" mix until just before I serve the salad.

ABSOLUTELY fantastic recipe!  I've never made macaroni salad before and was looking for something to "impress"!  WOW!  This is such an easy recipe to follow.  I read the reviews beforehand and only used 2T of sugar, omitted the celery seed and added the salad dressing mix a little at a time.  I also put some pimentos in it and some sliced black olives.  This was a HUGE hit at the Bar-B-Q!!!  Even my 14 month old grandson loved it!  Thank you so much for sharing this!  It's going in my recipe box and I will most certainly make this again and again!

It is not often you find a flavor combination that appeals to almost everyone. This recipe does indeed.  I 
reduced my sugar to 2 T.  I also used
nonfat mayo (Just-2Good 3 cups) and I used 1 cup Miracle Whip.  I doubled
the recipe.  I omitted the salt but I
heavily salted my noodles as is my practice.  I did not use the celery seed as I have found it to be a little overpowering for my taste as a rule.  The chopped celery is a must tho, unless you just happen to hate celery.  I as another poster found that I olny needed half the dressing mix and was thankful I hadn't poured it on all at once.  I will add this recipe to my book of favorite recipes.
The next time I make this I am going to add some small cubes of cheese as I think it will taste great with all the flavors.  I may also try adding in some breast of chicken, tuna, or some salmon for a main-meal salad.
Thank you Connie for a great recipe.
Don't be shy,give this one a try.

I really liked this recipe, I did make some minor changes, common sense told me a whole cup of sugar was just way too much, I put only 1/2C in but probably could have even used less with equally good results, I also put in a couple of extra eggs and used only 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed, since I have learned from experience that celery seed can be a bit overpowering.. besides these few minor changes, it came out very well and my kids including my two year old ate it, which never happens with any type of pasta salad with vegetables in it..I will definately keep this recipe

I tried this macaroni salad this weekend and found it way to sweet with 3/4 cups sugar.  Found it a little bit liquidy and may cut back on that just little bit.  I am going to try it without sugar next time as the miracle whip is sweet on it own.  I do like the combination of all the other ingredients. Very delicious and quite interesting.  I am definately going to give this a second chance.  I will add sugar if needed in the end.  I also sprinkled pepper and paprika on it before setting it in the fridge for the hour.

This was just delicious, but I altered the recipe a bit adding much less sugar as other recommended. I made a double batch as we had quite a few people coming over for a barbecue. I didn't have any celery, so I upped the celery seed to a little less than a tablespoon. Also, I don't like pickles/relish, so I left that out too. I used a heaping half cup of sugar because I doubled the recipe, but to make a single batch, a quarter cup to maybe a third cup would be plenty. I also added a bit of extra vinegar because I didn't add the relish. Added a green bell pepper as well. It was a huge hit and delicious! Thanks for a great starter recipe.

Excellent! I used 1/3 c. sugar & substituted finely chopped carrots instead of pepper. I also used mayo instead of Miracle Whip. A trick for a creamy dressing: seperate the egg yolk from the hard-boiled egg & blend with the mustard until smooth. I recommend French's Sweet & Tangy mustard.

Wonderful salad, different than most macaroni salads.  It looks as good as it taste.  Only one thing you should know, is this salad is rather sweet.  You might want to cut back on the sugar.

This is very good macaroni salad- flavorful and colorful. I'd definitely recommend using about half the sugar. I also tossed in a little chili powder to complement the peppers.

WOW, was this sweet! This is ok, but far too sweet for me. My husband and I liked it combined with other "bland" recipes. I'll probably integrate this recipe with a few others to find a happy medium.

Ridiculously sweet. I don't understand WHY you would add any sugar at all. Very high calories and saucy. Don't think I would do this again, there's much better recipies out there IMO.

Did NOT sure any sugar but I used sweet relish instead of the dill relish. Used regular mayo too. If I had followed the recipe exactly, I would have thrown out the whole batch.

I sub Greek yogurt for the mayo and cut the sugar down by taste. Always a big hit.

The 3/4 cup sugar ruined this recipe. Cut it down to 1/4 cup. First time using miricale whip in a pasta salad. Not for me. Way to sweet adding sugar to a already super sweet dressing.

Used 1/2 cup sugar and still way too sweet. Just not what we're used to.  My son was bummed because he was really looking forward to it. Would recommend adding sugar a tsp at a time because once it's added it's too late

I literally couldn't eat this.  Macaroni salad isn't supposed to be sweet!   My wife followed the recipe and, as usual,  used me as her taster.  Way too sweet!!!!!  I was convinced that she didn't follow the recipe until I logged in and  checked for myself.  She should have followed the advice of the first 6 reviews and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Don't make this without reducing the sugar.

Followed recipe to detail.  Wow, my guests loved it.  I predicted it was to much sauce and it would be way to sweet.  Loved everything about it, it is sweet and wet, but so good.  Doubled the recipe and still kept few leftovers.  Peppers are a surprise and will add twice as much next time.  7 minutes on the pasta, leave it firm.

It was far too sweet for me. I had to add plain mayo, add more spices, apple cider vinegar and lemon juice.  At least it's a versatile base for macaroni, coleslaw and potato salad.

After reading numerous reviews, I used an entire 1# package of pasta.  I also cut the sugar to slightly less than 1/4 cup, and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip.  Delicious!  I've never made macaroni salad before but this definitely hits the mark - thanks for posting Connie, and to all the posters who took the time to review and post their modifications.

Used the hints of cutting sugar back to 1/4 cup. I make my own mayo, found mixing the sugar and other ingredients in it was quick and easy. Used green peppers since I din't have red.

I guess I'm just not a fan of the sweet taste of miracle whip. Thankfulky I only bought a small jar of it. This was just way too sweet for me but if you like it then great. I prefer Muellers macaroni salad recipe or italian confetti pasta salad. Delish

Excellent macaroni salad.  I love the sweet, tangy, crunchy texture.  The only thing I didn't do is add the bell pepper, just personal tastes.  I think I found the perfect macaroni salad.  Thank you Connie for submitting this recipe!

I have never written a review before but this is just the best pasta salad ever!!! and, I am not a fan of pasta salads. I enjoyed this at a friend's recently and had to try it. Luckily I read the reviews and made adjustments per the reviews. For sure, add another egg and decrease the amount of sugar, for me 1/4 cup was way enough. I also added cayenne pepper because , well, I love cayenne. The most important thing is, as noted in the reviews, only add "mayo" or Miracle Whip sparingly at first, you can always add more later, like the next day.Another tip, I learned about many years ago from my ex mother in law, Dill pickle juice!!!!!! She taught me this secret to use in potato salad and I have used it ever since.The key to this recipe seems to be to add condiments to the consistency that you like.

This is amazing. I did use an extra Egg and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I did not use onion, celery, relish or celery seed (didn't have these items). I only used the red pepper, did add a dash of garlic powder and onion powder. I used a whole box of shells by accident, and it was not soupy at all, almost a bit dry. Took it on a 4 day camping trip and every day the salad got better and creamier. Took the leftovers to work and everyone  begged for the recipe. In fact today was day 6 and I'm finishing it off.. It's better today than any other day. (yes I eat leftovers for 1 week and no i never get sick, even with mayo based salads).

Amazing flavor. My husband told me he would eat the entire recipe (doubled) before we get to our Easter party. I used half whole wheat elbows and half rotini. I cut the sugar to a smidge less than 1/2 cup. I used Kraft mayonnaise, since what is suggested has no place in our life. I was rather generous with the celery seed, vinegar, and relish--heaping the spoons but not going absolutely overboard. I would love to make this a few times a month and eat it for lunch for an entire week. Delicious.

I had searched high and low for a macaroni salad recipe that I loved.  I can make killer potato salad but was having a hard time with macaroni salad.  Thank goodness I found this one!  I have gotten nothing but raves every time I have made it.  I did go with the suggestion of using less sugar because of the sweetness but other than that, it is just what I was looking for.

Delicious and so easy to prepare. We did cut the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. You can always add more if needed...There's plenty of dressing but I used half and chilled the salad then added more when it was cold. A great recipe, I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

Absolutely yummy as written, but remember to reduce sugar if you're using sweet pickle relish (all I had on hand).  I also substituted Splenda for sugar & low-fat mayo for salad dressing (again, all I had on hand).  This is a summertime must have!!!

Too sweet for my taste. My guests didn't seem very thrilled about it either. I won't be making this again. But I've always preferred salty over sweet, so perhaps it's an acquired taste.

Quick change...use 1 1/2 C Miracle whip instead of 2, and 1/4 C sugar instead of 3/4 C, and you will have a PERFECT Macaroni Salad!

Everyone loved this macaroni salad!  I only used 1/3 cup of sugar and it was delicious!  I used vegan mayo, cut out the egg, and didn't use any celery seed.  Excellent recipe!

This stuff is amazing and I always get lots of raves when I take it somewhere!!  I have been making it since last summer & have made my own changes to the original recipe.  First, I cut back on the sugar to just shy a 1/2 cup.  I also cook an entire box (full pound) of pasta because 2 cups is nothing and I think the ratio is better.  This brings me to my next change.  I use a twisty pasta like Gemelli rather than traditional elbow macaroni - the twists help absorb up some of the extra dressing (of which there is PLENTY).  Finally, I despise celery seed so I leave that out (there is already celery in it so I don't think it's necessary).

I made this salad for a Christmas get together with the in-laws.  It was my first attempt at making it, so I was a little nervous to try it out on them.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out Perfectly!!  Everyone loved it, and I was asked several times for the recipe!  This is one dish I will definitely make again and again!

Made recipe for Thanksgiving and not even 1 of 16 people cared for it. Too sweet, soupy and mustardy. Also had way too much celery seed in it.

I was looking for my ex-fiance's sisters recipe for Mennonite Macaroni salad and I couldn't find it. I found this online and it seemed fairly similar. So I made it for a work potluck. We had three seating for lunch and by the time I got there in the second seating, I got the last spoonful. It was a favourite and everyone loved it!

Delicious.  I would have rated five stars but i made a few minor changes.  I cut the sugar just a little.  I'm used to sweet macaroni salad, so the amt in the recipe wasn't that bad to me.  I omitted the celery seed because i don't care for it.  I actually made this 2 days in advance and it improved in taste each day.  However, it start to dry out after the 1st day. So, i added plain mayonnaise to make it creamier. The mayonnaise actually improved the taste to me.  So, if i made again and was going to use immediately, I'd probably substitue about 1/2 C of the miracle whip with mayo.

We liked this, but I found it tasted a little more like a filling for deviled eggs than a pasta salad. We also added 1 cup extra pasta, and it was still just a little soupy.

Good recipe but sugar has to be according to taste. I started with 1/4 and kept adding until it tasted right. Next time I will do that same thing with the vinegar, start with 1 tsp. and keep adding from there. Used 4 eggs. The dressing was too much for 2 cups of uncooked macaroni. Good thing I added an extra cup and a handful (for luck). The dressing was enough for all this. Last bit of advice, I made the dressing first, tasted, added eggs, tasted, then added macaroni a bit at a time, looking for the right amount of 'dryness'. My husband loves the Amish macaroni salad from WalMart, this was what I was trying to copy. The final result we compared with a helping of the store made. He says mine was exactly the same, I say mine was a little tangier. He said this recipe was 'better'.

mmm! I used 1 cup mayo instead of miracle whip, added three splashes of dill pickle juice and chopped pickles instead of relish, 1/4 cup sugar, and extra eggs and veggies - I highly recommend it!

Pretty good! While I prefer Graden's classic macaroni salad a *touch* better, this was also quite good. This is a very heavy, mayonnaise-laden salad (if you're not a fan, continue your search for a recipe that better suits your tastes). Graden'saversion is lightly dressed and has a less creamy texture (her dressing is a bit runny in comparison). Both salads have a sweet aftertaste that makes them VERY similar. NOTE: As many others have done, I too dressed my salad with HALF of my dressing and saved the rest to add as I saw fit. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. and was pleased with the result (3/4 c. sugar would be overkill, IMHO). All in all, I found this to be yummy and a great contribution to the fish fry dinner my hubs and I were invited to. Actually, I have been requested to make this (again) for our upcoming block party next month! Thanks for sharing, Connie! :-)

I made half of this recipe using 2 eggs and cutting the sugar back to just 2 T.  When I combined the salad with the dressing, I reserved some of the dressing to add just before serving to re-moisten it.  I also added just about 1 T. of milk to make it a little creamier.  I made this about 7-8 hours before serving, which allowed the flavors to meld.  I would say my half recipe yielded 4 large servings or 6 modest servings. We both enjoyed this one and Hubs has already been into the leftovers!

I can see how this would appeal to so many with all the sugar in it! But I made it anyway, as I didn't want any leftovers. :-) We originally didn't have any celery, and though it was tasty without it, my husband decided to run up to the store for some as it definitely could use the crunch. We used green onions, but I think red onion would be nice.

Made a couple of changes- 1/8 c. sugar was PLENTY!  Added 1/4 c. chopped carrots for extra color and veggy. Used salad vinegar instead of white. Used sweet pickle relish and added 1/4 tsp dill weed. Only used 1 1/2 c. Miracle Whip. Got great comments at my get-together!

This is the best macaroni salad I have ever tasted.  It got rave reviews from friends and family.  I will tweak the recipe just a little next time with either more macaroni or less salad dressing, it was a little soupy.  But no way was it too sweet!

I followed the recipe exactly, with the only change of using 1/4 cup instead of 3/4 of a cup of sugar. I can't imagine anyone using a full 3/4 of a cup of sugar! Miracle whip is already super sweet. Despite the reduced sugar, I still thought it tasted very sweet. It also had tons of dressing when it was first made. The next day, after sitting in the fridge, it was a tad better. Nothing exciting though. It is pretty much noodles, mirace whip, onions, and celery in my opinion. I guess, I was expecting so much more for some reason.

Do not make the mistake I did...do not sub celery salt for celery seed (I didn't add the other salt)...waaayyyyy too salty.  The 2+ tablespoons vinegar was too much as well ( and I like vinegar).  Next time I won't add any salt or vinegar...just that which comes with the relish.  Otherwise quite tasty (with @ 2 tbsp. Sugar only)

This is the best mac salad I've ever had.  Like the other reviewers, I only used 1/4C of sugar.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip, and I used sweet pickle relish, not dill.  I took it to work and it was gone quickly.

Since Amish macaroni salad is SUPPOSED to be sweet, I used the amount of sugar called for. The vinegar was a bit to strong for our tastes. This is close to my favorite brand I normally buy, but I think, that's even a little sweeter then this. I didn't use Miracle Whip, since we all think it's nasty.  Also, I cut back on the celery, kids just can't handle celery. With those adjustments we enjoyed it.

Not good at all. I followed the recipe as is and had waaaaay too much dressing. Also, 3/4 cup sugar in the dressing made it sickly sweet. 1/8 cup would have been enough. It didn't have very many ingredients in it so there wasn't much to work with. Won't be making it again.

Wow!  I think this is the best macaroni salad I have ever tasted!  I did, as recommended by others, decrease the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup, and since I ran out of mustard, I used honey dijon salad dressing in it's place.  It did soak up alot of the moisture by the next day, so I would recommend using less macaroni or more sauce.  This will be my only macaroni salad recipe!

We loved this recipe!  We used Krafts mayo with olive oil instead of miracle whip.  It is a little bit healthier and doesn't taste as sweet.  We also used the little shell pasta instead of the elbow macaroni just for a change.  Next time, we will probably use a little less celery and might add little bits of ham.  We absolutely loved the creamy dressing.  It has the best flavor.  This recipe will become the family's new macaroni salad.

I'm not usually a fan of Macaroni Salad but was making it for a family picnic and absolutely LOVED this recipe! Like others, I used less sugar than it called for but only because I used Light Miracle Whip which I find to be a bit sweet anyway. If I was using regular miracle whip, I think the 3/4 cup of sugar would have been right! I really enjoyed the sweetness of the salad. I had rave reviews on it and even my son, the picky eater, loved it! Definitely a keeper for my recipe box!

Wow! This is simply amazing!
We found that the onino was almost too overpowering. Green onion would be a better pairing. The egg also got lost in the salad, so I added one more that I had already made. In addition, there was so much dressing, so I added another 2 cups of pasta and 2 stalks of celery. Took reviewer's advice and cut sugar down to 1/2 cup. I did not have enough miracle whip, so I used 1 cup miracle whip and 1 cup mayonnaise. This had a fantastic taste. I think I will split the two from now on. It changed the flavour and balance the zip and plainness of the two dressings. Thank-you so much for the recipe!

As written this is a three.  It is way too sweet.  We reduced the amount of sugar to half of what it called for and it's still too sweet.  With some tweaking it is a good base just careful with the dressing.  Going to add some pasta to it and some other veggies to save it.

I also made some slight changes. After I made the wet ingredients I read the reviews and decided that it would be to sweet, so I dumped them and started over. Cider vinegar, 1/4 c sugar and green peppers from the garden were the changes and, voila!! Deliciousness. Thanks for the headstart on a "new classic" around here.

Very good recipe! This is the first time I've ever made home made macaroni salad and this one was the closest to what I liked, but I still changed it up a bit. Instead of just 2 cups of macaroni, I used a whole 16 oz box, so I didn't have any "soupy" problems like other reviewers. Also I used 4 eggs, 1 stalk of celery (not really a fan), used a green pepper, cut up 2 dill pickles since I had no relish, and like others said definitely cut the sugar to 1/4 cup!! I'm so glad I read the reviews first because it's still a little sweet for me, but everyone else loved it! Also I didn't have celery seed. Still a fantastic recipe and one I'll use many more times. For me, this was a perfect starting point.

Much better than store-bought macaroni salad!  I only used 1/4 - 1/3 cup of sugar, left out the celery seed and used an entire box of macaroni.  Very good!

This was very good, I brought it to a pot luck and everyone liked it.  I did change what other reviewers suggested.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and used 4 eggs, Also I used Mayo instead of Miracle Whip.

Fantastic!!  Made this for a Memorial Day barbecue.  Only change I made was to use Splenda.  The recipe fits into my low-carb lifestyle

Absolutely delicious.  Used whole wheat pasta because that's the only thing I had on hand.  Used real mayo (1.5 cups) and 1/2 cup of maple syrup instead of the sugar.  Used old-fashioned whole grain mustard.  Instead of the red pepper, I used blanched broccoli.  And I substituted leftover rotisserie chicken for the egg.  So the onion wouldn't be so strong, I let them sit in a bowl of cold water for a few minutes.  I really enjoyed this.

Outstanding. I used regular mayo, left out the celery and increased the amount of macaroni I used by half a cup. I was a little skimpy with the mustard just because I dont care for it and the fake yellow color that comes along with it. I guess it depends on what kind of macaroni salad you grew up with. However, this recipe is one of the best ones I have tried. Will make again.

I agree with previous reviews about the amount of sugar being too much. Next time I will try honey or agave nectar instead. I would also add one more egg. I added paprika and only put in half an onion. My husband liked it, but he has a sugar-tooth. I personally thought it was too sweet, but definitely worth trying again with modifications.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I made a few modifications: 2 celery stalks, 1/4-1/2 a large onion, 1/2 tsp of celery seed, 1/2 a red pepper and 2/3 cup of sugar.  I also used a whole box of rigatoni.  This makes a lot.  Next time I will only make half of the recipe.

Very flavorful but overly sweet even after cutting the amount of sugar by half.  The recipe states the number of servings as only 6 but the amount it made could easily feed 12.

I really wish I would have read the reviews first, I usually do!  Wonderful salad with wonderful flavors but next time I will only add about 1/4 cup of sugar.  At dinner my 4 year old son asked for more candy salad!!!

Fantastic!  I read through the reviews, and I loved the following recommendations from fellow cooks:  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, when chopping the egg I used all the whites but only 1 egg yolk, used miracle whip, replaced white vinegar with cidar vinegar, and used the jarred sweet roasted red pepper instead of the fresh peppers.  Awesome!!

Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, use light mayo or light miracle whip and it's delish! With a lighter dressing there isn't as much oil for the pasta to absorb so you will only need half the dressing. Use the leftover dressing to make the best coleslaw ever.

My favorite side dish for a bbq.  The only change I make is to reduce the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/4 cup.  Highly recommend.  I dream about this macaroni salad!!

Sweeter than the macaroni salads I usually make in a good way. I used mayonaise instead of Miracle Whip because my family agrees every mac salad we've ever made tastes worse with Miracle Whip ( fat free mayo is banned too).

This was delicious -- exactly what I was craving. I took everyone's advice and only used 1/2 c. sugar. I didn't have celery seed, so I used 1 tsp celery salt and omitted the salt. It might actually be a little too creamy, so I think I'll add a little more macaroni plus extra celery and bell pepper next time.

I really enjoyed this macaroni salad.  I used 1/4 c of sugar as others suggested and it was plenty sweet for me, my mom and husband.  I can't imagine using 3/4 c of sugar. I think everyone should try this recipe.  It's really good!!

I've used this recipe for months and have just never got around to reviewing it.  I was reminded tonight when we ate it that this is the very best macaroni salad. This is the only recipe that I ever use, and we never buy macaroni salad in the grocery store deli anymore!  (I do modify it by only using 1/4-1/3 c. sugar as other reviewers have suggested)

This is exactly as a remember growing up. I just love it. I did lighten the recipe with using just egg whites, a splenda blend and a light dressing. It still came out perfect. I've made it several times and everyone loves it.

I gave only 4 stars because I only used half the sugar.  At first I thought there was too much dressing, but in the end it seemed just right.  This is not like the amish that I buy here in Lancaster County PA, it was better!

Amazing :o) Everyone was scared to try it and I said it closely tastes like egg salad, and everyone loved it! I only used 1/4 sugar as well and it was plenty, and I added 1 green pepper! This is the only kind of leftover my husband ate over and over. Loved it!

I left out the eggs, used chopped dried onion because I was out of onions, used frozen chopped up peppers, didn't add celery, and used 1 tsp of celery salt in place of the salt and the celery seed.  It is sitting in the fridge right now "marinating" for dinner, and I can't stop sneaking little spoonfuls of it!  It is soooo yummy.

This was a good salad. I only added 1/4 cup of splenda and personally thought it was too sweat.  I also added only 1/2 the mayo, used whole wheat macaroni and put cucumber and bell pepper in it because I had them on hand.  It dissapeared at the bbq we hosted and I had 4 people ask me for the recipe.  I would give it 5 stars when I make it without the sugar:)

I made this for the first time today.  I added some pickle juice because I was missing vinegar.  It still tasted great.  I also added yellow, orange, and green pepper to it just for different flavors and textures.  I also used a little less sugar, 1 and 1/2 cups.  It was devoured in no time.  What a great salad!  I can almost see how to change flavors a bit by using different veggies too.  I did use salad dressing type mayonaise and loved the flavor.  Great salad.

I wanted to find a new macaroni salad recipe because when I make it from scratch myself, I tend to use the same ingredients as my potato salad. Even though I make a fantastic potato salad, I wanted a different taste. This is absolutely the most amazing macaroni salad I have ever had in my life. I always read the reviews before I make a recipe, and usually find myself irritated by the people who change the recipe before first trying the original version. I am now guilty of doing just that. So many people said this was too sweet, so I took some changes from different reviews and proceeded to make the best macaroni salad my family has ever had. Thank you Connie0751 for giving us this amazing recipe, and please accept my apologies for making the following changes: I didn't use Miracle Whip at all, but used real mayonnaise instead. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I only used 3 tablespoons white sugar, and because I like spicy tasting food I diced 1/2 cup of radishes and added to the mix. A lot of reviewers complained that the recipe made a very soupy salad. I was not serving it until the next day anyway, and like a lot of reviewers said, by then it had soaked into the pasta and was absolutely perfect! I will make this my go-to salad from now on, I am completely addicted!!

I was worried about the taste because of the different ingredients used, but I was very surprised by the flavor of this dish.  It was really good and I got many positive comments.  The changes I made per other reviewers were:  used one box of small sea shell pasta, added one extra egg, only used 1/4 cup sugar, used cider vinegar vice white vinegar and added a dash of pepper.  Since I added so much pasta, I think I should have doubled the sauce as it was a little dry.  I prefer to have a more creamy macaroni salad. Will be making again for the 4th of July cookout.

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making. I went by the fact the recipe had 4 1/2 stars. I felt 3/4 cup sugar was too much when I was preparing it, so decided to use 1/2 cup...still way too sweet, a quarter cup or less is probably best. Using sweet relish in place of dill may eliminate the need for sugar altogether. Also, 6 servings is extremely inaccurate, the finished recipe fills a 2 1/2 quart mixing bowl to the top! The recipe as written only garners 2 stars from me, with tweaking it could achieve 5 stars.

This was good as written, but I wish I had read more reviews instead of being in such a hurry.  Next time I will cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  Everything else will stay the same!

This is really good, albeit, a little sweet.  I happen to like it that way - but I may take the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut back on the sugar next time.  It's really good though.

I took others advice from reviews and decreased the amount of sugar to about half of what the recipe calls for. I also think there is a little too much mayo and will put in less next time. I did not use Miracle Whip as I had Hellman's mayo which worked just fine. I also did not have pickle relish and just put in pickle juice and that seemed to work fine too. I would definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I did however substitute some of the ingredients.  Used Mayo instead of salad dressing. Used 18 packets of splenda instead of sugar. Also instead of regular elbow noodles I used Dreamfields lo-carb elbows.  We are a carb conscience family.  It tasted great!!!

This salad is sooo good. Made it a couple hours ago and tasting it right out of the bowl it was wonderful. Its going to sit for a few more hours and I know its going to be even better. I followed the recipe pretty much I used green peppers (no red on hand) and apple cider vinegar because I prefer it to white vinegar. Its a totally awesome recipe for Amish Mac Salad, thx for the submission ;)

My family and I just didn't care for this macaroni salad.  It's just too sweet and I reduced the sugar down to 1/4 cup!  I'm sure it's just a personal taste preference so if you like a sweet macaroni salad you will probably like this.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly except for reducing the sugar and liked all of the other ingredients, it was just too sweet.  I think the amount of dressing is perfect though - I put about half of the dressing on and let it sit in the fridge overnight then put the rest of the dressing on the next day and I thought it was a good consistency.  All in all it was a decent macaroni salad that definately was eaten and did not go to waste but is not something I would make again.  I'm still searching for the perfect mac salad!

Very good and creamy.  I added much less sugar and mayo.  You can adjust this recipe very easily to your taste.  What I like is the dill pickle relish (didn't have any so diced the baby dill pickles I had on hand).

Wonderful recipe.  Perfect for picnics.  Some reviewers found there is too much dressing.  I find if you use an entire box of pasta, this is not an issue.  However I do agree that the sugar needs to be cut down.  I use 1/3-1/2 cup and add to the right taste.  I also use Miricle Whip Light.  I like the flavor and it cuts down on calories.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. After making it a few times, and following some of the other reviews, I have concluded the following: The best way to eat is the day after. So, make this dish a day in advance, pasta and all, and you'll love it.  Don't mix all the pasta at once because it will be too soupy.  It calls for too much sugar, therefore, taste as you're mixing the sugar to make sure that it is to your liking. I have a sweet tooth and it was way too much for me the first time. I upped the eggs to 5 and only used one tabblespoon of mustard.  I can eat this by itself, but not without refrigeration as some of the ingredients give it a really strong taste before blending.

I have made this recipe for years and LOVE it.  I generally follow the recipe to a T, but sometimes I omit the red bell pepper if they are out of season.  This dressing makes a WONDERFUL potato salad also.

This was truly one of the best recipes that I have ever gotten from this site. It was a 5+ all the way. Follow the recipe but I did cut back to 1 1/2 cups of salad dressing. Overall, received rave reviews and I agree. Definitely a great recipe. Can't wait until summer...

Delish!  We did alter the recipe per many review responses - 1/4 cup sugar; 1 1/4 cup salad dressing plus 3/4 cup mayo; full box of elbow macaroni - and it definately worked great.

This was pretty good salad.  I could not bring myself to add that much sugar, so cut sugar in half.  The mustard seemed a little strange to me in macaroni salad as I've never had it that way, but it was ok, I think I just prefer mine without mustard.  It did stay nice and creamy for a couple of days.  I think I would make this again, but cut back on the mustard and sugar.

Awesome!  The I used 4 eggs and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Next time I will reduce the Miracle Whip by 1/4 cup, though my husband liked it just the way it was.  I think it's a must to refrigerate overnight.  I tasted it about 2 hours after I made it and served it the next day.  It was 10x better the next day.

I recently made this for a work party and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I'm happy to share it!! I did double the macaroni and celery and there was still more than enough dressing. I also added cucumber because I had one that needed to be used and I Love cucumbers.

I have made this recipe several times now and everyone who tries it LOVES IT!! I am NOT a miracle whip fan AT ALL, but this recipe is actually better with the miracle whip then with mayo. I have also found that a combo of the two is pretty decent. My hubby doesn't like red peppers so I substitute finely diced carrots so that there is still some color and it gives the salad a nice crunch.

This will be my new macaroni salad recipe, it was very tasty and got great reviews from the family. There was too much dressing and sugar but I actually dumped the mixture, while it was still warm, into my strainer and let some of the excess drain off. It was perfect! I also didn't add the peppers or onions just as a preference. Love this recipe!

Wow!  This was really good.  I left out the salt and eggs, used red-wine vinegar and also used Splenda instead of sugar.  It was very good, even after 30 minutes.  I think next time I may leave out the onion, as it seems to have a pretty strong flavor.  Thanks so much for this great, easy recipe!

YUM!!!  This is awesome!  I did go with other reviewers advice and doubled the pasta.  There would have been too much sauce if I had not.  I did not decrease the sugar though.  Amish macaroni salad is sweet. This is my new favorite.  I think I will also try it for potato salad as one other reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the great recipe!

07/24/08 This is the single best amish mac salad recipe in the the USA, if not the world! I was never a fan of mac salad but my husband, who was raised in Lancaster County, really loves it.  When he asked me to make him some I found this recipe and tried it.  YUMMO, he 
L O V E S it, and so do I.  A real keeper. Don't be afraid to make this one.

Outstanding!! This was the best macaroni salad we ever had. It tastes like macaroni salad you can get on salad bars. I followed the recipe as is except I omitted the celery seed and celery--we don't care for it. And this makes LOTS of salad, so be sure to scale the recipe down (6 servings is more like 10 servings). LOVED IT!!!!

OMGosh this is the best mac salad I have ever made. The only thing I didn't have was the relish but it was sooooooo good. I made a 5 quart bucket for our family get together and it was gone. Everyone said it was great. Thank for the recipe.

This salad rocks!! I made some modifications  based on personal preference and the result, in my opinion, was fabulous! I used 3C (12 oz) macaroni and kept the dressing measurements the same. It was the perfect amount.For the dressing, I used regular mayo, decreased the sugar to 1/3 C and the mustard to 2T.I adjusted the salt to suit my taste, added fresh ground pepper, and omitted the celery seed. For the salad,I used 5 eggs, cut back on all the veggies to about 1/2 of what's called for, as I didn't want them to overwhelm the taste of the salad. I also used 3T sweet relish rather than dill, red and yellow peppers, added a small can of sliced black olives and some dried parsley flakes for color. It looked beautifuly colorful and tasted great. A keeper for sure.

This was great--even though I didn't have any red pepper in the house. I think sliced green olives would be good mixed in too. For people who like tuna, this would be good with tuna mixed in too for more of a meal or lunch idea.

Very enjoyable easy and tasty!  Like other reviewers I used a fraction of the sugar the recipe calls for and it was plenty.  I'm not big on sweet macaroni salad and putting just a --little-- sugar in was just right.

This recipe was easy to make and had an excellent flavor.  I didn't have a red bell on hand so replaced with a green one. I didn't quite double the recipe, but made more than the recipe called for.  We ate the whole thing in one evening.  It will be a regular for me and I will use it to replace potato salad at get-to-gathers, because it is easier to make.  It is a keeper...the whole family loved it.

For a Macaroni Salad, this is really tasty.  I did decrease the dressing amount by about 1/3 & haved the sugar amount.  I ended up using ziti noodles instead of macaroni, because that is all I had.  Hubby who dosn't normally even like macaroni salads loved this one.

I made this salad last weekend trying it out for an upcoming party.  I did read the reviews prior to preparing so I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and still found it sweet.  I'd recommend starting out with about 1/8 cup and add more to taste.  Otherwise, this recipe is WONDERFUL!!!  Very yummy!

You might find yourself wondering "how different can a macaroni salad be?"  Well, this one is delicious!!!!  I haven't ever been a fan of macaroni salad because it seems like they dry out after a day in the fridge but this one only gets better!  I think the celery seed is a must.  If you don't have any on hand go get some...it makes the salad very flavorful.  Also, I agree that the 3/4 cup of sugar is too much.  I used 1/3 cup and it was PLENTY sweet.  My husband doesn't like dill pickle relish in salad so I used sweet, also very good.  My daughter-in-law doesn't usually like pasta of any kind and she had seconds of this.  I will make this over and over again.  Maybe next time with some orange, red and yellow bell pepper for added color.

The general consensus is to cut the sugar and I'd have to agree. In fact, for my taste, I'd probably leave it out completely (of course then it couldn't properly be called "Amish Macaroni Salad"). My husband loved it and keeps begging me to make it again....which I will!

Excellent!  I agree the sugar amount is too high.  I use a little less than 1/4 cup Splenda in place of the sugar, mayo instead of Miracle Whip and celery salt in place of the salt and celery seed.

I've made this several times and it's so good!

3 tablespoons of salt & 3 tablespoons of sugar  & T of  garlic  in cooking  water.    Added 3 tablespoon of Chinese sweet & spicy sauce instead of vinegar. Family does not like  relish.  Mayo as needed.  Lots of black pepper.   Cool.   Check for balance before serving.

This pasta salad is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  I took it to a party and everyone is still talking about it, if you can believe that.  I used bow-tie pasta, used peas instead of celery, left out the sugar completely, and added some shrimp as well.  I had no problems with the salad being watery, and that may be because I used bow-tie instead of macaroni--I actually had to make a little more sauce to add to it at the end!

Too sweet for me. Even at 1/4 cup of sugar that was too much. The miracle whip and the relish in itself are sweet enough. Will use mayo and forget the sugar next time. Also too much dressing for the amount of pasta. Personal taste.

Very good salad, smells and reminds me a lot of potato salad.  As other have stated, very sweet, I added just under 1/4 cup of sugar and still found it to be a bit on the sweet side, found myself adding salt and pepper as I was eating...will make again but add sugar gradually by taste.  Also, used sweet relish as that was all I had...next time will use dill.  Overall very good.

This was good, but I did make quite a few changes. Left out the bell pepper, celery seed, sugar, vinegar, cut the celery to one stalk verse three, and used mayonnaise instead of Miracle whip. I also add a little black pepper, and a small can sliced olives. The next day I stirred a package of Starkist tuna into the left over salad and that was supper yummy.

I made this for a family picnic and everyone LOVED it.  Followed directions exactly, even though I was a bit apprehensive about the amount of sugar.  I prepared it the night before, and it was pretty overpowering, but it mellowed out by serving time the next day.  We have some leftovers and after 2 days, it was deliciously mellow -- so don't be afraid to put it together 2-3 days ahead of time.  It gives the flavors a chance to meld and makes it even better!

This was so good!  Made this twice already & followed recipe exactly except I didn't use the celery seed & I think I used a little less sugar the second time.  Will definately be making this again!

This was a pretty good salad and although my guests really liked it, I'm still a bit undecided.  I made it as instructed (but used less sugar) and was impressed by the creaminess and rich flavor of the sauce, but if you're not a huge fan of yellow mustard this might not be the salad for you. The mustard flavor was a little stronger than I expected (but possibly perfect for most people) so if I make this again I'll probably cut it down a bit.

This is really, really good but listen to the majority of reviewers.  This calls for toooo much sugar.  I followed the recipe for the pasta and salad ingredients (didn't use the relish).  After reading everyone's comments I cut all the salad dressing ingredients in half - except for the sugar.  I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup and that was still too much. This makes a lot of macaroni salad.  Will be making this again.

I read other reviews and agree that the original recipe asked for too much sugar. I only used 1/4 cup and it was just fine. I also added chopped ham. I did not have red pepper, so I used 1 oz. of chopped pimento's and it tasted the same. I brought it to a potluck at work and everybody loved it.

My daughter and I both liked this salad.  I did change the relish to sweet since I had that and I didn't add all the extra's.  I may try this in the future with splenda for my diabetic relatives.  A Definate repeat us

I put in only 1/4 cup sugar and used 1 box of bow tie macaroni.  I only put about half the dressing and then put it in the fridge.  Right before serving I put some more dressing to moisten up.  Good recipe, will probably make again.

Well, a little too much mayo for me, and it took some extra time to marinate, but WoW! absolutely the best Macaroni salad ever! I'll be making this one a lot.

Oh and cheddar cheese is a must in my macaroni salad so I added some of that too.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I would've given more stars if I hadn't made so many changes. I reduced the sugar down to 1/3 cup. Used a tablespoon of cider vinegar instead of white.  Used chopped dill pickles in place of relish. Added 1 Tbs sweet relish to the dressing and added some olives.  I also used mayo instead of Miracle Whip.  I would cut the sugar even more if you were using salad dressing because it's already so sweet.

This recipe was tried once and I will look no further for a macaroni salad recipe!  Exellent recipe, easy to follow.  Made 40 serving size for a football team and it was hit.  I used less onion, omitted the red pepper and used Kraft Real Mayo instead of Miracle Whip.

I followed the recipe and the only thing I changed was subbing dried onion flakes for the onion. This had potential but I just wasn't crazy about it. First, equal parts pasta and miricle whip? And more salad dressing than pasta after you mix the everything for the dressing. Way too much salad dressing!  I actually strained the dressing off after I made it and tried it. Also too much sugar, too sweet. Miricle whip is sweet to start with then you add a lot a sugar. Also wan't crazy about the eggs in this. 
I won't make this again as I would just have to change so much in order to really like it.

Thank you so much Connie for this incredible salad!  I made it for a family reunion potluck and it was enjoyed by all!  I didn't put the entire amount of dressing on - and it was perfect - not too wet - or too dry.  I really loved having the red pepper and dill relish in it - just kicked it up a notch. I also cut down on the sugar amount - using only 1/4 cup.  I also used low fat mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip. This will definitely be a family favorite!

I read alot of the reviews before preparing. Since I use both mayonnaise and Miracle Whip at my house, I decided to use mayo. I prepared as written. I didn't have any bell peppers, and I forgot to add the eggs with the pasta to cook. Besides missing two ingredients, this turned out wonderful. I can understand it being too sweet if you use Miracle Whip. Outstanding recipe. I prepared it in the evening, for the next day. When prepared it does seem soupy-but the macaroni sucks that "dressing" up. Perfect the next day!

My husband does not like any kind of a pasta salad until he took one bite of this one.  Wow, it was a hit for him plus all our friends and relatives over the 4th of July holiday weekend.  It seemed like too much sugar tho so I cut that in half.    I have made this twice already.

Love it, Love it, Love it! Made it yesterday to have with our burgers & dogs. The only things I did differently were: (1) I only used 1/8 c. sugar, and (2) I used Spicy Brown Mustard instead of yellow, to give it extra zip. Just had some with lunch -- it's even better the next day! Thanks for the great recipe --this will be my staple Macaroni Salad from now on!

This was a big hit at my 4th of July party.  I used the full amount of sugar, although I think next time I will cut it back as it was very sweet.  Also, I subsituted macaroni shells for elbows and it took a whole box to soak up all the dressing.  Other than that, it was fantastic.

This was really good.  I've been looking for a good recipe that's pretty close to what you buy at the grocery store, but different enough to be homeade and I think this is it.  I only put in 1/4 c sugar like the others and it is still pretty sweet, I would almost say it doesn't need it at all, but it's still good.  That's the only reason for the 4 star rating.  Also, I didn't have celery seed, so I used celery salt.

This recipe is amazing. I am not even a big fan of macaroni salad, but I was craving it and this totally hit the spot. I reccomend it to anyone! Just make sure to lessen the sugar...and I didn't add the pepper or vinegar just because I didn't have any. I also used wagon wheel pasta because it's all I had. Thanks for this recipe!

UPDATE: Just made this salad again twice this week, once for a party and once for ourselves--this time instead of wagon wheel macaroni I used two cups of elbow macaroni...and the sauce was way too thin! I will make sure to use more mac. when I use elbow.

Got a lot of compliments on this when I made it for my in-laws, and they're picky eaters.  I made some changes...put in about 1/4 cup sugar and used half Miracle Whip & half Mayo.  Also used whatever veggies I had on hand...some red & green peppers, red onions, celery, and carrots.  I made a full recipe of the dressing but used a 16 oz. box of small shell pasta and it was just about perfect.  I liked how it had some crunch to it with the carrots and celery.  I'd use this recipe again, with my own little changes of course.

This was so good!!!  I used very little sugar because I prefer it less sweet.  I tripled the recipe and it was a huge hit.  Except for the sugar, I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

The only thing I did different was cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup.  That was sweet enough for us.  Otherwise was very good, will definitely use again.

I thought this was a very tasty macaroni salad......only thing is.....I only used half of the sauce mixture and it was plenty!  I saved the other half, and a few days later made the salad again, and used the other half!

Really good, although I cut way back on the sugar and it was still too sweet.  I made some more of the dressing without the sugar and mixed it in and it turned out great, so next time, I will use just a few teaspoons of sugar.

Like many of the reviews, I cut down on the sugar - a little less than 1/4 cup. Something was missing for us - I will try again, but adding more egg and using real mayo instead of miracle whip.

This is very good.  It makes enough to serve at a fundraiser and it's different from other macaroni salads in that is a little sweeter.  Plus it looks pretty.  This was gone before the other macaroni salads on the board.  Can't ask much more than that!  Thanks Connie0751.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a major hit.  Young and old alike commented on how delicious this macaroni salad was.  It will definitely be my recipe of choice in the future when a pasta salad is in order.

I had to make a salad for a church potluck and this was wonderful!  I did substitute red onion for the onion to add a little sweetness, and I also substituted green bell pepper for the red bell pepper, honey mustard for the yellow prepared mustard, and apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar.  It was a big hit, except I think it made more than the suggested servings allowed.  I will definitely make this again.  I absolutely loved the texture.

This recipe gets five stars for sure!  I love the macaroni salad you can buy in the deli at the grocery store, and this was even better than that.  The only thing I may do next time is cut down on the amount of onion, I'm not sure if mine was just too strong, but a little less of maybe a sweet onion would be great.  I will be making this over and over this summer, can't wait!

I love this stuff! Macaroni salad has always been a favorite of mine. I made this with just a couple of changes. I only had 1/2 the celery on hand that was called for and next time I'll make sure I have enough on hand before I start. I don't care for the little red pepper so I left that out. I used a dill pickle cut up instead of the sweet relish. The only thing I would change next time is to use a little more onion than called for and about half as much sugar. It's good as is but I think it would be just as good with about half as much sugar. Also, this makes a LOT of salad but that was ok by me since I love the left overs. But be aware that it makes about twice as many servings as listed. Thank you Connie for posting one of the best mac salad recipes I've tasted.

I made this salad for a potluck and it was a hit! I did cut back to about half on the sugar, figured I could always add more if I needed to but it was sweet enough for us. Very good.

This was my 1st ever attempt at macaroni salad. I loved the recipe! I read the reviews and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and I used what else I had on hand, and it turned out great! (I added Dill, full box of noodles,  red pepper because I didn't have green ones. I will pass this around!

I used coleslaw dressing instead of Miracle Whip and it gave it a nice zip. Also added ground pepper and cut down on the sugar to 1/4c and increased the salt a little. It was almost still too sweet, but it was fine because of the mustard, vinegar and salt. Didn't have celery seed and was still good. It turned out with almost a honey mustard flavor and there was a little kick to it. Maybe from the Coleslaw dressing, I don't know, but this was really really good.
Great with Hamburgers on the grill!!! YUM!!

Fantastic taste!  I substitued half as much dry mustard to eliminate the yellow color and reduced the sugar as others had suggested.  The dressing yields enough for about twice the amount of macaroni in my opinion.

Excellent!  I'm definitely making this several times this summer.  I cut back on the mayo, actually  I used miracle whip light since that's all we ever have.  I probably used a cup and a third instead of two cups, but kept everything else the same.  Other than having no celery salt on hand, I made it exactly as written.  Yum.  It was so good and made quite a bit.  Great flavor and crunch.  Thanks

It was very good.  I only used 2/4 cups of sugar.  I am glad I did, it may have been to sweet for me.  I added cheese cubes and frozen peas.  THIS WAS GREAT!!  :)  My whole family enjoyed it.  I really liked how creamy it was.

I've made this twice. We LOVE it!!! My changes were to add 3 times the celery, 4 eggs , no bell pepper (spouse doesn't like them) and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. Next time I make it I will reduce mayo to 1 & 2/3 cup of mayo. It's a little too creamy with 2 cups.

Always a hit for a great summertime side dish. I don't use dill pickle relish, I use sweet, and then I cut back on the added sugar just slightly.

It is very sweet, so it is optional that you can reduce the amount of sugar to your liking.  This makes a lot and it seems to stay creamy, unlike other recipes that seem to become dry after being refrigerated.   This is the only recipe I use as well as  other family members who since requested recipe. It will be your only recipe too, after trying it..

This is a great noodle salad!! I crave it all the time. I use 1 1/2 lbs of noodles and I double the sauce except for the sugar. Delicious!! I make this gluten free with Ronzoni rotini noodles. To die for!!

I used the entire box of macaroni and only added 1/4 cup of sugar.  The miracle whip adds enough sweetness,  I think that 3/4 cup sugar, which the recipe called for,  would make this way too sweet.

The only change I made to this recipe was to reduce the sugar per the advice of many other reviewers. I'm glad I did. It turned out quite sweet even with only 1/2 cup of sugar. No one liked this dish so the majority of it got thrown out. The # 1 complaint was that there was too much "dressing" making it too "creamy" as well as it was a little sweeter than the family liked.

I did exactly as written except for decreasing the amount of white sugar to 1/4 cup and increasing from two cups of dry macaroni  to 3 cups.  For vinegar I used Apple Cider Vinegar and for Mustard I used Honey Mustard.  This salad is very refreshing!  Thank you Connie!

The family liked this recipe a lot.  I did as recommended and only used 1/4 cup of sugar, excellent suggestion.  I, also, added 1/2 red bell pepper and 1/2 orange pepper.  I think next time I will also add some sweet peas.  Overall, a perfect side for a barbecue.

Good basic recipe to start with but the sugar content is too high for me.  I added 1/2 c. sugar and it was too sweet for my taste but may be good for others. In the future, I would add some bacon and peas and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very good! I follow the recipe except took others advice and used only 1/3 cup of splenda/sugar. I also used half Miracle whip and half Mayonnaise for the dressing (just because that was all the Miracle whip I had on hand).

I made this for a large BBQ party as a side so I tripled this and made the following changes and/or substitutions: Due to multiple guests needing gluten free dishes, I used gluten free spiral pasta. I omitted the celery, bell pepper, and celery seed. I used sweet relish instead of dill. I sautéed the onion in butter seasoned with a little salt, sugar, all spice, and garlic powder until translucent. Also, I  used 4 cups total of Miracle Whip as opposed to the 6 cups the recipe would have warranted.  And I used a total of a ¾ cup of sugar, so in actuality I used a third less sugar then called for. It was a hit! Several people asked for the recipe which I gladly shared! I will be adding this to my “go to” recipes!

I have made this several times so, I feel I can give a proper review. The first time I made it like I tend to do, I followed the instructions to a "T". We all thought it was a little to sweet. The second time I halved the amount of sugar and the vinegar was a little overpowering. The way I have made it since is using about 2/3 of the amount of sugar and I'm using apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and it takes this to a whole new level! I make it to take family functions and everyone raves over it. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

This is the best recipe except it’s too sweet for my tastes.   Like many other reviews i read,  i cut down on the sugar.  I cut sugar down to 1/4 cup!   Plus u can vary the ingredients  in it too.  I added yellow bell peppers and used Hellman's  mayo instead of miracle whip.
This is my husbands favorite!   I will be making this again and again!

I made this today for a graduation party. I cut way back on the sugar and did two boxes of macaroni and 8 eggs and green onion with the regular Vidalia and some frozen green peas. Only did and 1 half of the dressing and it is one of the best creamy dressings ever.  Hope it stays that way. I kept some separate just in case. Also, my Barrila noodles said 7 minutes, so read your noodle box.

This recipe was a HUGE hit. I chopped my celery up really fine and used green onions. I also added small cubes of cheddar cheese. No one (including me) could stay out of the bowl!

Wow! This macaroni salad is going to be my go-to and in my regular rotation! Made it on a whim tonight because I had nothing planned for dinner. Happened to have all the ingredients on hand for this. I could take a bath in it, it is so good! Even my finicky eaters loved it. The sauce is a perfect balance of savory and sweet. I did use an entire box of macaroni and it had just the right amount of creaminess. I can see how this would be easy to customize with add ins. I think next time I might try it with some leftover diced ham mixed in.

Made this with very little changes other than reducing the sugar by 30% and using fusilli pasta instead of macaroni. Absolutely delicious, will certainly be making this again and again!! Best macaroni salad we have ever had!

I scaled this for 4 servings and scaled back the sugar to 1/4 cup, more could be added if desired, I found it nice with a 1/4 of sugar.  Subbed bow toe pasta vs elbow macaroni for appearance purposes only, tastes delish and is now in the fridge “chillin”!

This was a good option for macaroni salad. I think next time no sugar at all and much less salad dressing using next time. Also pepper was nice. I also added green peppers. Dill pickles as well as relish is a good bite. Very colorful. I also added chives and sliced some hard cooked boiled eggs on top as decoration.

This recipe is fabulous! Followed the directions exactly except sugar (I used half a cup) it's easier to add more rather than take away so I just tasted as I went. I will say that the dill relish offsets the sugar. I also forgot to add eggs :( Next time I will! This recipe is a keeper for sure!

First time I have ever liked macaroni salad. Made minor variations based on some reviews, I.e. reduced sugar, added paprika, garlic granules, used apple cider vinegar. I also added fresh chopped japaleno peppers to add a little kick. Thank you for sharing

This was, quite simply, the best macaroni salad I've eaten and will be my "Go To" recipe now!  I did make a couple of minor changes for personal preferences:  I used real Best Food Mayo vs. Miracle Whip, and decreased the amount of sugar by about a half  as I like a more savory salad (and dislike M.W.)  Also, after making the dressing on the side, I opted to use only about a half of it.

I added cilantro and just a tablespoon of Reg Mayo and left out the sugar so it wasn't over sweet. Turned out to be the perfect balance of flavors.

I had to leave out the onion due to an allergy and I forgot the celery seed, but it turned out famously. I am soooo going to make this again maybe adding some green peppers or maybe lessening the sauce amount.
Super simple and very tasty.

I took other reviewers suggestion of cutting back the amount of sugar added to this dish.  I'm glad I did because 1/4 cup was plenty!  I made this for a church potluck and everyone really liked it.  I'll be making it again for sure!

I've made this quite a few times.  Each time it seems I'm short on one ingredient or another and have improvised.  This time I used gluten free rice and flax elbow macaroni, olive oil miracle whip instead of the regular, chopped dill pickles in place of the dill relish as well as 3 chopped scallions in place of the regular white onion I typically use.  It's just as delicious as ever.  It's a great recipe to double for larger cookouts or groups as well and I've often made it a day or two ahead for such occasions.  There's never any leftovers!

Wow! This is like my mom used to make; it is absolutely delicious. 
I read the reviews and reduced the sugar to just under 1/4 cup and it was perfect for my tastes. Also heeded the advice of not adding all of the dressing and refrigerating it to add the next day, glad I did that!
 I don't eat raw onion and used
 1.5 tsp of granulated onion in lieu. I didn't have the bell pepper to add; I think that would've added visual appeal and needed crunch.  I didn't have dill relish and so substituted sweet relish, which was tasty however I will use dill next time.
So yummy; thank-you for sharing this recipe!

I made a gluten free, dairy free version and it is awesome.  No one can tell the difference!  I used green lentil pasta (any gluten free pasta will do) and Soy-free Veganaise as substitutes.  I also only used 1/8th cup of coconut sugar as I like a tangy salad.  I found the dressing to be too much the first time so I cooked 3 cups of dry pasta and am happy with the result.  Also used 6 green onions as that is all I had and like the flavor.  The dressing is so good I made a batch of just that for my salads.  Love it

Reduced amount of Salad Dressing. Thought there was too much mustard. Sauce was too thin. Husband liked it a lot. My eggs were chopped too fine, he said to make pieces larger.

Love this recipe. Definitely use less sugar though. I used a little more than 1/8 a cup. I also used sweet relish instead as I do not like dill.

My husband loved this so much that he could not believe it was not store bought. I did make 2 changes. 1. I used regular mayo instead of salad dressing. 2. I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 and it was plenty sweet. Overall this recipe is good I would not recommend using the amount of sugar called for though as it would be much too sweet.

My family and I loved this recipe. I cut the mayo in half and filled in the gap with sour cream. I reduced the sugar and added a bit of my maple syrup. Instead of relish I added some dill and a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar.  I also added a tablespoon of Vidalia onion dressing and I chopped half a carrot with the onion and what not. Thanks for a great recipe to work from. I will make this again.

This is EXCELLENT!!!  My husband doesn't care for most macaroni salad because he says  they all taste to much like vinegar!  I made this recipe yesterday and he said "did you make this?"  I said yes.  He said 'OUTSTANDING"!!!!!!  I put some in his lunch for today, and he called me at 8:00 this morning to tell me he already ate 1/2 of it and is going to try to keep the other 1/2 for lunch!!  LOL. Thank you for this recipe!!!  I did not change a thing!!!  I now have an awesome recipe that my husband raved about!!!  Yummo!!!

I added basil, dill, fresh tomatoes, poppy seed and crushed black pepper. Also, mash the yolks and add into the dressing. Only 1/8 cup sugar and double the vinegar.

Excellent. I left out the eggs but added cheese and used both red and green bell pepper. This seemed to taste better to me after it rested overnight. Will make again.

Modifications: 
Used real mayonnaise
1/4 cup sugar
3 cups dry macaroni
Subbed dill relish with 2 teaspoons dill weed

It came out really good. Next time I'll use 2 1/2 cups of macaroni as the mixture was a bit dry the next day; I'll stick with the 1/4 cup sugar though. Could use a little more dill weed, it would be better with dill relish, I just didn't have any on hand. I'll use 4 hard boiled eggs next time too.

I love this salad. Just need to make a couple adjustments. One for the sugar, too much and I also used mayonnaise with olive oil instead of miracle whip which i think would have made it sweeter. I'll cut back the sugar next time and try more mustard.

The point of a recipe is to make it easier for you to balance the amounts of each ingredient.  This recipe fails at that in a spectacular way.  As posted, it calls for an insane amount if sugar.  I cut it to 1/2 a cup when I saw the gruesome pile of sweet starting to stack up in the mixing bowl but I was trying to have faith in the recipe. I'd suggest that you cut it even more.  1/4 cup maybe to balance the vinegar but 3/4 cup is just a nauseating amount of sugar.  Blecccch!

If you love a traditional and rich macaroni salad this is all you.   I used even less than a quarter cup of sugar but almost else as listed -minus the celery seeds, used Mayo instead of Miracle whip and instead of 2 cups of macaroni I used an entire bag of 16oz Tortiglioni noodles.  Fabulous.

Our family love this salad.  I have made it 3 times. Last evening made it for guests and they raved.  I am rating it only 4 stars as I had to use dried chives instead of onions
 and I changed the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup.
I saved a little dressing to put on the left-over salad the next day.  I found it delicious and not the least bit "soupy"

I followed the recipe and it turned out delicious! It was a hit at my picnic. I personally don't like Miracle Whip so I was a little skeptical. But you can't taste that taste.....I made it a second time today and again it was delicious. I highly recommend this recipe

Too much sugar! I wish I had read the reviews first, but I trusted the recipe and was disappointed in how sweet this salad is. I accidentally put sweet pickle relish in also which made the sweetness worse. I added the dill pickle relish anyway and it tasted ok. Don't know if I will make this again :(

Was looking for the familiar taste of Pennsylvania Dutch macaroni salad from my childhood and found it!  I doubled the ingredients and had about half a cup of pasta left in the box so I added it. I stuck with regular mayo and half the sugar.  It was still a bit sweet from what I remember. It's liquidy, but will be perfect after sitting a few hours. I'll update after dinner, but was so excited I had to say thanks!

I forgot to update (probably because there was none left to remind me)!  None of my California friends has experienced the vinegar/ sweet combo in this type of dish and they loved it.  It was much less watery after sitting a few hours. Doubled the recipe again but went with half the sugar and regular mayo. Perfect!  This is a dish that has to have time for the flavors to blend.

This is great, whether you make it as it's written or use it as a base for making an even more jam-packed macaroni salad like I make when using up the old veg. The only thing I omitted was the sugar, because the relish I have is quite sweet and I wanted to keep the bite from the vinegar.

I didn't use the red pepper or celery seed.  I substituted sweet gherkins for the dill pickle, my husband's preference.  We loved the taste and enjoyed a new "twist"  for macaroni salad.

This is a very good salad and hubby loved it! But next time around I won't use all of the dressing, but instead will reserve some of it for another use.  It was just a little too wet for my liking. I'm sure the reserved dressing will be delicious used another way. Otherwise, this is a keeper.

Love this salad!  We have used it several times when we go camping or as a make ahead salad for a pot luck summer picnic.  I usually use 4 Cups of pasta instead of 3 but delicious either way!

Everybody loves this macaroni salad and I am often requested to make it for BBQs. I make it exact to the recipe with the exception of  cutting the sugar to about 1/4 cup because  it was wayyyy too sweet. Letting it sit overnight is a must.

Yes I made a change.  The sugar  measurement is a misprint. It should read 3/4  tbsp,  NOT 3/4 cup !  The Miracle Whip already has lots of sugar.  I don't know where you got this Amish Recipe, but it is way to sweet.  By lessening the sugar and adding more
pasta  one can make this an outstanding recipe.  Perhaps  someone on your staff monkeyed  around with the ingredients to cause lots of remarks .....

I really liked this macaroni salad.  I needed to use what I had on hand so I made a few substitutions.  I used regular mayo instead of Miracle Whip, apple cider vinegar, and since hubby doesn't like peppers, I used a shredded carrot instead, to add more color.  Cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, as per other reviewers.  I think it tasted delicious!  I used 3/4 of the dressing right away and reserved the rest to add later, as macaroni soaks that up.  A keeper for me!

Yum. I reduced the amount of sugar and vinegar by a lot and used less red pepper, but other than that, no major changes. It came out awesome. This would be a terrific alternative to deli macaroni salad and it would go perfectly with hamburgers & hot dogs on the grill. I'll definitely make this again.

I've used this recipe over and over. It's my husband's favorite! I used to buy the pre-made Amish macaroni salad at the deli, but it's so expensive. I took a look at Allrecipes  and found this gem. I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of red pepper and add diced green pepper instead. So good!

This will be my Go-To recipe. Even better than the store bought. The only changes I made were: !/2 cup sugar and omitted onion and bell pepper. Omitted them because my family does not care for them raw in a salad. And 3/4 cu sugar is too sweet. Did not have dill relish, so minced some homemade dill pickles.

I am so happy I found this recipe, and thank you for submitting it. I have prepared this many times and sorry i must agree with others that the sugar is excessive and I reduce it by 1/3. I have made this for family, friends & co-workers. Have doubled and tripled the recipe and if there was meager left overs someone always asked for them and sometimes I said no ha ha. I always make a dish by the instructions and ingredients. Thank you again Connie well done!

SO good!  I did listen to other reviewers and cut the sugar in half, and I am so glad I did because it was plently sweet with half the amount called for.  The only other substitution I made was to use apple cider vinegar instead of white.  Will definitely make again!

Good recipe easy to make - I would definitely reduce the sugar as stated in previous comments maybe to 1/3 or 1/2 cup. I would also use the whole box of elbow macaroni or at least up the amount to 2 1/2 cups.

Will definitely make again - my family loved it!  Several changes, though, based on other recommendations and what I had on hand.  Used about 1/3 c. of sugar, 1 c. reduced fat mayo, 1 T. mustard, 1 t. vinegar, and added some pickle juice instead of relish. It wasn't "soupy-creamy" like Amish mac from the grocery store, but tasted even better - and was a tiny bit healthier.

I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup and reduced the amount of mayonnaise to 1&1/2 cups.  Blend the eggs well and you'll have a wonderful summer recipe.

I will make it again with only 1/3 cup sugar.  It was too sweet and I had to double the salad dressing and add more vinegar to fix the  sweetness.  But I did like it.

This recipe was really good! I followed several reviewers suggestions and made a few adjustments to the original recipe. I used half mayo and half Miracle Whip, and only 3/4 cup of each. I cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup, and used sweet pickle relish instead of dill, cider vinegar instead of white, green peppers instead of red, and omitted the onion. Still turned out delicious!

Absolutely awesome! Was asked for the recipe several times......only slight change I made after reading others reviews was I cut back on the sugar, and used 1/4 cup.  Also, definitely used Miracle Whip. My family has always loved Amish Macaroni Salad and we've always bought it from deli's or the store, so this was the first attempt making it at home. Unfortunately, I don't think they'll ever accept store bought again! Lol! But I'm all right with that!

Very good salad. Served as a main dish on a bed of spinach. Added only 1/4 cup sugar and an extra hard boiled egg.  Didn't add the salt but did pepper to taste.  Great summer time dish. Definitely will make again.

Our new favorite macaroni salad. My kids like it better than the salad I've been making for over 20 years.  After reading the other reviews, I reduced the sugar as well.

Excellent. This has become my go-to recipe. Everyone loves it.  I now only use 1 or 2 eggs, and cut back on the mustard to suit my taste.

The taste is great, simple to make ( I usually have all the ingredients on hand), and it's the first recipe to come up in a search.  The mayo/salad dressing amount of 2 cups is way too much. I used 1 cup and ended up with 1/3 cup of finished "sauce" leftover. I can't imagin this with 2 cups - gross!  I also used only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfectly sweet.

It's amazing! I didn't have half the things and it still ended up delicious! Was a bit too sweet for me though so next time I'll cut back on at least a quarter cup of sugar. I don't eat sweets so it's too much for me to handle.

Amazing Flavor!

Actually, have made this delicious recipe well over two dozen times... And it's has been a hit/#1 favorite, every time it gets made in my home. Some very subtle tweeking... (biggest change for me is the amount of MiracleWhip)...

This is WAAAAYYYYY too sweet as written. I should have been using my head instead of putting all that sugar in. 1/4 of sugar - maybe - would have been enough, if not less. Be careful you're using dill relish and not sweet relish, too. And there is too much moisture.

Really enjoyed this dish - but like some others have commented -  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 C and don't put all the dressing on at once.  This recipe makes a 'ton' of dressing, so I added according to our taste.  This allowed extra for the next night as most of my macaroni salads tend to dry out over time.
I've already had a second request  - and that's only a week after finishing up the first batch. 
Good stuff!

I made this but changed a few things...only added 1/2 C sugar & it was sweet enough. I used Hellman's mayo. Used 1/2 t. celery seed. Used apple cider vinegar. Did not use any mustard... I meant to use some dry mustard but forgot. Didn't use relish. I also used this on 2 boxes of cooked macaroni & it was enough... But we ate the macaroni salad within hours of making it. If it had sat overnight, it might have soaked up the dressing and I think I would've made more to add before serving. I also added peas. This dressing was really delicious.

I made this today almost exactly like recipe. I substituted sweet relish for dill relish because hubby hates pickles but likes a sweet relish! At first I did 1/4 c. sugar but had to add the rest because the mustard needed to be balanced. So for my taste next time I will use less mustard which will mean less sugar! It is in frig chilling. Will check back after hubby tries it for an update!

I finally tried this recipe, after trying millions of macaroni salad recipes.  I think this is one of the best.  I wasn't so sure about the dill pickle relish as I don't like that kind of relish, but in this recipe it works! I wouldn't suggest reducing the sauce because when setting the macaroni soaks up the juice, so what appears at first to be too much, actually ends up being perfect. Delicious.

This is delicious! The only changes I made were for personal taste preferences. I used 4 eggs instead of 3, used 1 cup regular mayo & 1 cup Miracle Whip, and left out the celery seed. The mustard gives this salad a nice flavor. Be warned though, this makes A LOT of dressing. I use it on an entire box of macaroni noodles, & still have some left over.

Been searching for this pasta salad! I've made this one many times now, it's so easy! I love the slightly sweet/vinegar flavor. I usually half the sugar because I think it's much too sweet. I love is trying new vegetables to add to it! Also thinking about adding chicken too! Must try if you're looking for the mayo type pasta salad!

This is a really delicious macaroni salad. The second time I made it, I reduced the onion and added a bit less sugar. This was a huge hit at a big family party and has since become my "go-to" macaroni potluck salad. It is one of those recipes that is easy to personalize, but I would suggest not changing it much because it's wonderful.

Made this for a fourth time now at least. Thankfully I remembered to cut sugar to 1/4c and once again turned out great. I use a pound of pasta and the amount of sauce goes perfectly without becoming soupy. Great simple mac salad recipe and definitely my favorite!

This is a great recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I also reduced sugar to 1/3 cup...probably would reduce it to 1/4 cup next time.  I omitted the eggs do to a time restraint, used granulated onion in place of onion (didn't have one on hand) and used 1/2 tsp celery salt in place of salt and celery seed.  Tasted delicious!

This is my Go To recipe for Macaroni Salad, how ever I also changed a few things. The biggest thing is that I use "Dukes" Mayo because we aren't crazy about Miracle Whip. I also cut the sugar back to about a half cup. I think the mayo needs more than some of the 1/4 cup suggestions. I don't fool with the celery seed, either. I always double the eggs (In our family I could probably add the whole dozen). I'm making this right now for Hubby to take to a picnic tomorrow.

Delicious!  My only advice is to make a bit more sauce.

I'm really glad I read some of the reviews before making the recipe, or this would probably not be a positive review. This is a really nice macaroni salad, if you use less sugar than called for. ven using just 1/4 cup of sugar, was a little too sweet for me. I'll have to make it again to be sure, but I think the sugar could be eliminated altogether. Also, as one reviewer mentioned, if the salad isn't going to be completely eaten when first served,  it's a good idea to hold back a bit of the dressing, to add in for the next day.

The best macaroni salad I have ever tasted! I did make some adjustments, I used the whole box of macaroni, and only 1/4 cup of sugar. Definitely a family favorite for my children and my husband.

This is a really good recipe for macaroni salad . No changes needed. We eat it almost as fast as I make it. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested keeping some of the dressing aside to mix in right before serving. I never thought of that and it makes a big difference.

I made the recipe as written with exception to cutting back on the sugar to 1/4 cup as recommended (I also used Miracle Whip).  I found it still too sweet for our liking and would recommend only using 2 full tablespoons.  The dressing was, not quite what I was looking for.  Maybe a little less prepared mustard next time.  Great combo of veggies!

Very good salad but as other reviewers pointed out,  I feel that you need to cut back on the sugar. 1/3 is plenty for my family. This is a keeper though, very yummy!

I made this but scaled it down by 1/2 cup of pasta and I overdid the onions by accident.  It turned out really good!  Had a cookout and my husband and I are the only ones that like spicy food.  We ate this and it seemed really spicy but really good.  Couldn't figure it out but came to the realization, just had a lot of onion (white).  Really tasty!

I made this, and we loved it. I doubled the recipe but only used 3 cups of  Miracle Whip and 1/4 cup total sugar. The flavor was perfect the following day.I will definitely make it again. I thought the onions would be overpowering, but the salad was delicious.

Great recipe!  I used 1/3 cup sugar and about a 1 1/3 cup mayonnaise to make it a tad healthier.  I also chopped a couple of dill pickle spears in place of the relish.  The day I made it I was a little disappointed even after a couple of hours in the fridge but the next day it was excellent.  Definitely a keeper!

LOVE IT!!!!!  This salad is delicious!  I suggest cutting back on teh sugarMaybe to 1/4 cup.  Add it to your taste.  Since it makes so much dressing, I add enough dressing to coat the pasta, and refrigerate over night. If the salad is dry the next day, I add more dressing. You can also make more pasta, there is plenty of dressing. Great Stuff!!

I really enjoyed this recipe though CRUCIAL changes I am making this time around. I'm using strictly mayonnaise and not miracle whip (I enjoy the flavour more) and using half the sugar. I used miracle whip with the called for amount of sugar and my partner liked it. Was way too sweet for my liking.

The flavor in this recipe was great but I wish I'd read the reviews like I normally do before making it- waaaay too much sugar.  I also did not have the issue with the noodles absorbing the sauce like many others did so I wound up with extra.  I will be making this again but next time I think I will make 2/3 of the sauce recipe and reduce the sugar to 1/4 C.  I also will add a couple of extra eggs.  That sounds like a lot of changes, but not so much- :-) just a little less sweet and a little less sauce.  Great and easy recipe!

Have been using this recipe for years.  Only changes is reduce the sugar, and instead of red bell peppers, I use a small jar of pimentos, drained.  Looks good, and goes well. I usually add more pasta and eggs because it gets eaten so fast!  We love it!

Delicious, even my housemate who works in a restaurant loves it. When I got to the sugar, I thought NO WAY, so I just added a little at a time until it was sweet enough. I didn't have peppers, so I used broccolli instead. I probably only used two spoon fulls of sugar. That has to be a misprint.

I too read the reviews and went with a heaping tablespoon of sugar in the recipe instead of the 3/4 cup and found it to be perfect for my taste.  Thank you for the great recipe and will be making this 3-4 times a year.

Only had dijon mustard in fridge.  Other than that didn't change a thing.  This is incredibly good.  Better than the grocery store version which I'm embarrassed to say we love.  I will always use this recipe going forward!

I decided to try this recipe based on all the good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. The amount of sugar in this salad is way too much. It was so sweet. I made it a second time and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it still was over powering.  I made this for a party. Not a crowd pleaser.

3/4 cup of sugar made this way too sweet. 1/4-1/3 cup would be plenty. Otherwise, I am making this again this weekend. Very good!

This tastes like what I think a creamy macaroni salad should.  I added chopped carrots too for color. Lowered the sugar amount as suggested and went with regular mayonnaise.  Even though I used a full box of macaroni, I still kept the dressing amount as is.

This was fantastic!  I did not have any miracle whip, dill relish, or red pepper so I substituted with mayo for the miracle whip,   I used 1/2 a dill pickle and 1/2 tsp of sweet relish for the dill relish, and used Rainbow peppercorn grinders - about six "grinds" to replace the red pepper.  I also added a few cubes of cheddar cheese as an added bonus, and used 16 oz. of mini pasta shells. This is so tasty!

I didn't have any dill relish so added some sweet pickle juice and 1 Tablespoon of honey mustard with the other 2 tablespoons of mustard, I also didn't have elbow macaroni used  2 cups penne rigate. My husband really enjoyed it. This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe! As suggested I lowered sugar to 1/4 C, and used the apple cider vinegar as personal preference also used part of the salt content as garlic salt.

This is my go-to macaroni salad recipe. With just a few adjustments, I think it comes out perfectly. I use a whole pound of elbow macaroni, and cook it as the submitter suggests (bring water to boil. add macaroni. stir. remove from heat. cover and let sit for 10 minutes. then drain, rinse with cold water, and put aside). I bought a 15oz jar of whipped dressing, then just added a tbsp of mayo. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and increased the salt to about 1/2 tsp. It's still a bit sweet, but balanced a little more with the extra salt. I also added an extra egg, just because. I think it tastes similar to our local grocery store's Amish macaroni salad (which I love), and the no-cook dressing makes this recipe nice and simple. Especially good if made ahead, and refrigerated overnight :)

I have made this SEVERAL times.  It is just the absolute best Macaroni Salad going.   I get requests for it all the time.   First time I made it I used regular onion. The only change I made after that was I used thinly sliced Green onions for the onion.  I was out of regular onions and my husband really wanted the salad.  I had to guess the portions but the flavor is awesome.   Make sure you use Dill Relish.  Sweet Pickle relish makes it too sweet.

I finally tried this recipe!!  I spent a LOT of time going through reviews and took extra care in preparing the dressing. I taste tested every step I went through. I opted for a combo of mayo/miracle whip. When I finally decided to add the sugar. I ended up only adding a teaspoon!  I can't give this recipe 5 stars because I altered it as it was. I did absolutely love what I came up with and will make it many more times!!

Love this salad!  At the suggestion of others, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Also used mayo instead of Miracle Whip.  Fabulous!  I love the crunchiness of all the veggies!  I'll add one more egg next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This salad is delicious however I opted to omit the sugar and onions completely. I'm not quite sure why the need for sugar in the recipe (3/4 cups is a ton!). If I were to sweeten it, I would use a little honey instead, but truly I don't see the need.

Pretty good recipe.  I made nearly double the amount of macaroni (nearly 4 cups) and had plenty of veggie and dressing.  Didn't add onions due to a family member with allergies and reduced the sugar by half.

This is great! I did make some changes due to personal preferences: 4 eggs, 1 1/2c mayonnaise, 2 dill pickle spears, yellow bell pepper, 2 celery stalks, apple cider vinegar, dill weed, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic powder, only 1/4c sugar, and Ditaloni rather than elbow macaroni (you get more of a balance between pasta and sauce). This is a definite keeper!

Husband loves amish potato and macaroni salad because it is quite sweet.  So far, out of all the amish style recipes we have tried, this is his favorite.  In fact, it got a thumbs up from everyone at the table, which is unusual at our house. I did not alter the recipe measurements, but I did use mayo rather than salad dressing.  I also put the chopped celery and peppers to the side so that they could add them at the table.  I offered dill weed and smoked paprika at the table to top it off as well.

There was a lot of extra dressing but by tomorrow I am sure it will have been absorbed by the noodles.  It was quite sweet but the dill pickle relish provided a nice contrast to the sweetness. 

This will become one of our go to macaroni salad recipes.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicious and easy. I usually just buy macaroni salad from the deli and go from there, but this time I used whole grain macaroni and made the dressing from scratch. Like others I cut down on the sugar but used sweet pickle relish instead for more sweetness. I used a 16 oz box of elbow macaroni but next time I will try bow ties. I cut the amount of dressing in half, and used mayonnaise, seasoned salt and celery seed but no celery. I also like macaroni salad with small cubes of white cheddar (1/4 pound) and 1 cup of defrosted frozen petite peas. It's only been chilling for a while but it tastes great. This recipe is very flexible and accomodates what you have on hand.

I have made this recipe a half of a dozen times.  My daughter likes it, saying a lot, and my co-workers love it.  I stopped adding mustard because of a co-worker, reduced the sugar and use half mayo and half Miracle Whip. It may not sound like your recipe but it is still the best.  Thank you.

Ive made this exactly as written and it was really good.  I also made it with some subtle changes.   I omitted the celery because my family doesn't care for it.  I used apple cider vinegar in place of white vinegar.  I also used less sugar, about 1/2c vs 3/4c, and I subbed Hellman's mayo for the dressing and horseradish mustard for the yellow mustard.  Absolutely the best macaroni salad Ive ever had.  5 stars for this one.

I have made this recipe several times and each time everyone wants the recipe.  I made a slight change to it.  Use Hellmann's Light Mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip and sweet relish instead of dill relish.

Great salad BUT seriously reduce the sugar!!!
just made it following the recipe to a T... And its far too sweet,  going to have to try rinsing some of the dressing off and start again with the dressing.

One of the best macaroni salads.  I'm glad I read the reviews.  I used less sugar and also used some mayo along with miracle whip.  Really good.  I also used minced onion instead of fresh.  My family doesn't like onions.  I used different colored peppers so it looked pretty!

It's good, but I'm going to use 1/4 cup less sugar next time. It was a tad bit too sweet, but a good, easy recipe to follow.

This makes a lot if you're like us and it's just the two of you you'll want to half the recipe. It made more sauce than I needed so I boiled up & diced a potato - makes a decent potato salad as well. Also I could see this sauce on a vegetable platter for dipping.

I am glad I read the reviews. Like most here I reduced the sugar. {You can always add more but you can't take it out} I used 1/4 cup sugar and still a bit sweet for me. I'll do 1/8 next time and it'll be perfect.

I also shredded a carrot for additional color, I didn't have yellow mustard so I used Spicy Brown mustard. I used Malt Vinegar not white, and I ran out of Miracle Whip so it was 1 cup MW and 1 cup mayonnaise. And like everyone I added an extra egg.

I love this recipe because it's flexible. Next time I might throw in some thawed frozen peas, maybe diced ham or some tuna. Smoked Paprika maybe? This recipee accommodates a lot of variety, be creative or just clean out the fidge of leftovers.

Absolutely love this macaroni salad!  I followed the recipe for the most part and only changed a couple of things...I used about 1/4 cup of bread & butter relish with the juice instead of the dill relish and used a total of 6 boiled eggs.  It turned out perfect for us!  I get rave reviews whenever I take this to a family get together!

I thought this recipe was delicious!  i read a lot of the recipes and was leary about how to make the dressing,  many commented on the amount of sugar and too much dressing made.  I decided to just stick with the recipe and loved it!  I realize it is pretty sweet, but that is what I was expecting when looking for an amish macaroni salad recipe.  I didn't think it was too sweet, and I thought the dressing was the perfect amount, because the noodles tend to dry up and soak in the dressing overnight.  I recommend following the recipe, if you don't like a sweet macaroni salad, then don't make an amish mac salad.

Oh yes! This is just the taste I was craving!  I had no relish so I chopped up a few baby dills.  I used red onion, and I added a bit of black pepper.
In an attempt to make a somewhat healthier version, I also made the following substitutions:
-I used Stevia sweetener instead of sugar, equivalent to 1/2 cup sugar
-I replaced the Miracle Whip with 1 part canola oil mayo, 2 parts plain nonfat Greek yogurt, and a splash of lime juice
-I replaced the traditional elbow macaroni with veggie radiatori, used a 12 oz package
-I used 4 eggs, but replaced half of the yolks with avocado
It's good now.  I know it will be GREAT tomorrow!  I can hardly wait...

I tasted this as soon as I made it and thought it was really good.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to between 1/8 and 1/4 cup, doubled the amount of macaroni, used four eggs.  I didn't measure the vegetables.  I just chopped and threw them in the bowl.  I am waiting for the salad to chill so we can have some with supper,  It makes a lot!

I have made this twice now.  The first time just to try it.  The second time I made a double batch to give out to my friends.  This salad is AMAZING.  But I also did cut the sugar by 1/4 cup down to just 1/2 a cup of white sugar.  Also, I did not have relish and so I followed another recipe for "quick dill pickle relish" and I used that.  Please do not worry when the dressing seems to be too much.  The noodles soak up all the dressing and it ends up with the perfect amount!  I also used Ajinomoto brand Japanese mayonnaise.  Other than that I followed the recipe and I LOVE it.  Now a staple in my recipe collection!

I made this macaroni salad last night and sampled it this morning.  Wow!  It really is the best macaroni salad I have ever tasted.  After reading the reviews, I cut the amount of sugar to 2 Tbls. and used half mayo and half Miracle Whip.  Added a handful of green peas and let the flavors meld.  The result is wonderful!  I will be making this one alot during our hot summers.

I made this salad today with just a few changes. I added Tuna and just before serving I added feta Cheese, somehow the Feta Cheese with the sweetness works for this next time I will be using Chicken instead of Tuna. I love Amish recipes they are they best! Thank you for posting.***Also I didn't use dill pickles I hate them in a salad like this I used homemade butter pickles that I made last year and chopped them up.**8

I loved this!  I didn't cut the sugar and put I the 3/4 cups and LOVED IT!  I love things that are very sweet though so this was perfect for me!  If you like it sweet do not cut the sugar!  Also I used Real mayo and not miracle whip!

Delicious!!  We made this for a luncheon and everyone loved it!  We did make some changes to suit us better.  We didn't add any sugar and made 1.5 tablespoons of yellow mustard and 1.5 of dijon.  We substituted the vinegar for worcestershire sauce.  It was gone very quickly! Yum!!

taste great! when i finished mixing everything together it looked WEIRD but after letting it sit in the fridge after a hour it didn't look as watery and it tasted  so good. my husband loved the pieces of boiled egg in the salad. i didn't have the relish or re bell peppers but i will try it with those ingredients next time. Can't wait to make it for a party, i know they'll love it too!

The amount of sugar called for by the original recipe is perplexing.  The first time I made it I cut the sugar in half and found it nearly inedible; it was far, far too sweet for my family's tastes.  I've made it several times since, replacing the dressing with real mayo, adding a bit of celery salt, using cider vinegar instead of white and eliminating the sugar completely.  My family absolutely loves this recipe with these changes.

It may seem like far too much dressing when first made, but the macaroni absorbs most of this by the second day.  Cutting back the dressing makes it less "soupy" the first day but a bit dry for left-overs.  It's delicious on day one but far better on the second day in my opinion!

I usually do fries with burgers, but this time wanted something different. Went searching and found this. Read ingredients and just went with my own eyeball measurements, omitting some ingredients and adding others. What a wonderful alternative to the same old hamburger dinner!

This was a great salad. I used mayo instead of miracle whip, since that was what I had. I cut down sugar to 1/2 cup and did use a cut up pickle as the relish. My family thought it made the 'keeper' recipes! YUM!

I used mayo not miracle whip and I didnt use relish because I ran out!! It turned out really good!! It was a little too sweet at first but after sitting overnight it leveled out just right.

This is what Macaroni Salad should be! I just made this, with a few changes, and it's amazing. I didn't have celery seed or red pepper so I omitted it. I also used apple cider vinegar and I only used 2 large tbsp of sugar. And I used a whole box of macaroni. So good! Can't wait to take to a work party and all our parties this summer!!

LOVE this salad! The only changes I made was using orange and yellow bell pepper instead of red, and I only used half a cup of sugar, also I used country Dijon mustard instead of yellow, and apple cider vinegar in lieu of white. Very yummy and was a hit at our most recent cookout.

This Macaroni Salad is fantastic. I have made it numerous times. The only changes that I make are I double the eggs, use 1/4 of an onion and I use real mayo. That is only for personal preference. My family asks me to bring for all family get togethers. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the only macaroni salad my husband will eat. Love the flavors of the salad, not too sweet, not too sour. I do follow the other users advice and cut back on the sugar a bit though.

Wow! This was Wonderful! I was expecting the ordinary mac salad but it was a refreshing change. more sweet with those bits of salty dill, Yum. I cut out a fourth of the mayo and sugar but was still creamy and great.

I really like this mac salad.  It is creamy! I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used a lemon mustard target brand mustard. 4 eggs.  A little chopped garlic.  Very nice salad.  This amount is not too little not too much.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before making the salad. I followed the recipe and it's far too sweet for anyone to eat. So disappointed. I will have to try again and reduce the sugar as others have done.

Fabulous, fast, and delicious.  My family was supposed to eat this as a sidedish, but enjoyed it as the main course!

We don't use Miracle Whip, preferring Helmann's, but no other changes were made to the recipe.

Took this recipe, which was way too sweet, and made some changes. It turned out amazing! Used mayo, sweet relish and apple cider vinegar instead of Miracle Whip, dill relish, and white vinegar. No sugar, no additional salt (aside from salted water for pasta), and it was perfect. With the changes, this might be my new go-to recipe for creamy macaroni salad.

Yummy!  Used mayo instead of Miracle Whip, green bell pepper instead of red, chopped up dill pickles instead of relish, all because thats what I had on hand, followed others advice & reduced the sugar, used gluten free macaroni & less onion.  Is best with Miracle Whip or similar creamy dressing.

This recipe is absolutely outstanding! I also cut back on the sugar, a little too sweet as is. The last time I made it, I didn't have enough yellow mustard, so I used dijon instead, and it was great. My kids loved it!

I really have to remember to read the reviews prior to making.  I had this in my recipe software, so forgot to check the reviews online.  Anyways, will definite cut the sugar next time - and I tripled the recipe for a family gathering - oops my bad.  Other than that, it is very good.  I didnt have quite enough M.Whip so used some Thousand Isle to try to make up the difference.  I was still short but not too bad.  I have an Amish crew here working on my house, so they get a kick out of things with the name "Amish" in it  :-)  Thank you for sharing

I thought this was really good!  As most people suggested, I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and that was plenty.  I also added 4 eggs instead of 3 and that worked out well.  Lastly, I think next time I may add a tad less mustard.  This salad definitely needs to be made a few hours ahead so the pasta can sit and soak up some of the dressing.  Will definitely make this again!

Delicious and easy!  Left out the red bell pepper and celery seed(husband's preference) but I feel it would be delicious either way.  Loved that it stayed saucy and moist instead of getting mushy and dry like most dressing in macaroni salad do.

I love this salad!  It's just like something you would get at a deli.  I cut the dressing part in half, used Hellmann's Mayo, only 1/4 cup sugar and sprinkled in some paprika.  The only other change I made was skipping the relish.  Next time there is a potluck, I'm making this!

Great recipe!  I followed advise from another reviewer and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, but still a bit sweet for me but hubby and family loved it!  I also used bow ties and fresh dill pickles.  You could easily substitute potatoes in place of the pasta for a yummy potato salad!  Yummy!

followed the recipe but cut the sugar down to scant 1/4 cup--in my option Miracle Whip is sweet to begin with. I didn't have red bell pepper but a half of a cucumber, left the skin on. Also used one large dill pickle instead of relish-since I didn't have relish and again relish has sugar in it. Everyone loved it and it is a keeper. After re-reading this I guess I shouldn't have started out with I followed the recipe-haven't reviewed many recipes yet-I'll get the hang of it. lol

Great salad and style I had never made before.  I only put 1/2c. of sugar in and thought it was plenty sweet. Every one loved it. Will definatly be making it several times over the summer. The amount of salad was nice since there was only 4 of us for Easter, not so much leftover you get sick of eating it but would definalty double it to take to a larger gathering or barbque.

I'm from Lancaster County, so I don't think this tastes like the Amish Macaroni Salad we have here, but it is still a good macaroni salad.  I cut back on the amount of sugar, only using a heaping 1/4 of a cup.  I will be making this again!

Great recipe!  As other reviewers stated, I only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This will be wonderful for those backyard barbecues!

Took out the celery stalks as a personal preference and used Hellmans/BestFoods mayo instead of miracle whip. Turned out fantastic. Makes a lot. I can see this at many summer BBQ's in the future.

I MUST SAY THIS WAS WONDERFUL.  I HAD TO HAVE A SALAD FOR A POTLUCK AT WORK AND I HAD ALL THE INGREDIENTS AT HOME SO TRIED IT OUT.  THERE IS NOTHING FANCY IN THIS BUT IT WAS DELICIOUS.  I MADE IT AS STATED BUT HAD TO USE MAYO.  I PUT HALF THE DRESSING ON IMMEDIATELY AND THE REST IN THE AM AFTER BEING IN THE FRIG ALL NIGHT.  IT WAS GONE QUICKLY AT THE POTLUCK AND THE RECIPE WAS A BIG REQUEST.

Tasted great, did cut back the sugar to only 2 Tbls. I only used 2 Tbls of mustard and 2 Tbls of vinegar and felt the salad was a bit tart and had to much of a mustardy taste so I would cut back on one or the other.

I thought this was awesome! I also held back on sugar - 1 heaping tbsp was all. Didn't have 2C of M.Whip but filled in w/1c of Hellmans.A little over 1/4C of Apple vinegar. Blended the eggs (3) in with sauce and pureed it, added celery seed, garlic salt and 1 heaping tbsp Dijon. I think piccolini would be better than farfalle but couldn't find! DEFINATELY will do this again, and again!!

I usually omit the celery as we don't like it raw but it's still a great salad! Makes a huge amount so it's great to take to a potluck or whatever.

My husband is very picky when it comes to macaroni salad. He loved this one! Next time I will cut back on mustard. I did use an extra egg and cut back on sugar to 1/4 cup. Otherwise, great recipe.

I have tried a few recipes online and this one by far is the BEST! I only used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 red pepper. I added 1/2 large carrot diced which is an essential ingredient in my amish salad. That topped it off!!!

My family really loved this salad. It is colourful and very tasty. I even got rave reviews from my son-in-law! WOW! For Thanksgiving this year, I tried a different recipe and my husband told me to throw that new one out and to only make this Amish Macaroni Salad. I make the recipe as written and I also have printed it out for my favourite recipes book. It is so delicious!! Thanks for this one.

So very tasty!! My husband is clamoring for more.  I like to stick to the recipes unless I am out of a particular ingredient.  I made this one as written and it was wonderful.  Printed it and it's in my book of recipe favorites.

Great mac Salad!! Family loves it! Only thing I do different is add LESS sugar. First time I made it I put all the sugar in and had to double the recipe to fix it. Recipe calls for way to much sugar. I put in about a 1/4 cup. This is plenty and the salad is GREAT! Thanks for sharing.. We love it!

This was amazing! I've never tasted something sooo goood!  The entire batch was eaten the first day cause my husband and I couldn't stay out of it.  I made the salad just as it asked in the recipe.  As a side note to go with everyone elses sugestion to cut back the sugar, If you have a sweet tooth then this is the macaroni salad to make.

Unbelievable!!! I made this on a whim looking for a simple side with dinner. My daughter came in the house with several of her teenage friends, and they were literally pulling the bowl out of each others hands fighting over it. Usually teens don't get into this kind of food, but they have asked for it every time they come over. I agree on reducing the amount of sugar by at least half. Amish food is supposed to be sweet, but it's way sweet enough. Actually making it again tomorrow to take to the beach for our vacation week. Mmmmm, can't wait to eat it!

This has good flavor but it ended up pretty goopey.  I cut back the sugar to 1/2c and the dressing tastes good, but even after adding additional noodles, is still quite wet.  Then, because I added noodles, it looks pretty bland. I added extra celery and eggs to even out the extra noodles but it needs more color. Next time I'll find some extra veggies to put in and decrease the amount of dressing. Overall tastes good though.

Great salad. I cut back on the mayonnaise and sugar a bit, because it seemed like too much. My family agreed and had me add some chicken bouillon to salt it up. Turned out great.

I made this recipe with my daughter, I'm not fond of mac salad, but w/ a few minor changes... more egg, rice wine vinegar, 1/4 c. sugar and seasonings... It came out delicious!  My daughter loves it too!  I do agree w/ previous posting, don't add all the dressing at once.... mine is a little soupier than I would like.  I "eyeballed" the dressing ingredients.  Also I chopped dill pickles instead of relish.... Just right!  Thanks!

This was great! I followed the recommendations and cut back on the sugar by a lot (only used 1/3 c).  I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple vinegar instead- don't think it made much of a difference (if it did, I couldn't tell).  This would be great for any bbq/picnic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Best macaroni salad we've ever had!  The only changes I made were to use a whole bag of fusilli pasta, 1/2 an onion, and 1/4 cup of sugar.  I made a huge batch for a family BBQ, and needless to say there was nothing left in the bowl.  Easy and delish.  Bravo :)

I served this at a cookout and it was a HUGE hit. It was the exact taste I was going for and the best macaroni salad I've ever had!  I was worried about not having enough for the 15 people coming so I doubled the recipe (since it says it serves 6). Doubling the recipe made a ton of the salad and we had quite a bit left over.  I'm not sure how big of a serving it was indicating, but one batch of this recipe surely feeds more than 6 people. Also, based on everyone's comments, I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was great! I will definitely make this recipe again!!!!

Definitely cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup. My family loved this! We also added some cucumbers and pickle juice instead of relish. Added a bit of pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. The only thing that was weird for me was the red bell pepper... strange mix of flavors. BUT I took them out of my portion and it was awesome!

I made this recipe for a party,my time was short so I had to make it a day in advance. It turned out perfect and there was just the right amount of sauce. Per other reviewers advise I did cut back on the sugar. All my guests and family loved it. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was really good and it was completely gone before I even had a chance to have a full serving! I did change a few things. 1) I used bowtie pasta and used about 3 cups. 2) I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. 3) I used light miracle whip. 4) I used only 1/4 cup of sugar. I will be making this again and again, it was soo easy.

This was just what I was looking for. I ended up using bowtie pasta and blonde sugar instead of white. Even with my lack of ingredients, it came great.  Tip-don't forget how to boil an egg, like I did. My egg came out only half cooked, with the yolk still liquidy. =/

I thought this macaroni salad was great! I didn't have any red bell peppers, so I left them out, but will use them the next time I make this. Yes, there WILL be a next time! Thanks for posting :)

We really enjoyed this macaroni salad.  It has a really nice flavor.  I did have to make a few changes I only had a 1/2 cup of miracle whip so  for the other 1&1/2 cups I used light mayo . also I did not have any red peppers so they were left out.  will make this again

This is really a great macaroni salad.  Noone in my family will buy store bought anymore.  I do agree with other reviewers to cut the sugar back to about a 1/2 cup if you have a sweet tooth.  Maybe half that if you don't.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't add the relish or celery seed since I didn't have those and I didn't add the egg since I'm not a big fan of eggs but it still tasted great.  I will definitely be making this macaroni salad again!

this is delicious- I will not be buying any from the deli anymore!  I kept sugar to 1/4 cup and skipped the red pepper(we don't like it in mac salad).  We also cut down on the onion and celery to suit our taste. YUM!

This is the best macaroni salad ever! I only used 1/4 cup of suger but didn't change anything else.  Love it!  Update- I've made this many times and people ask for the recipe every time.   Since my first review, I have cut the sugar back even more to 2 Tablespoons and it's the perfect amount.

This is a great recipe. I use about half the sugar, but I think the sugar is definitely necessary. I make this a lot for parties and BBQs in the summer. Goes great with anything grilled or smoked.

This was a good alternative to what we usually make for macaroni salad. Tastes like what you would expect from the local deli counter but fresher.

I should learn to read the other reviews before making something. WAY too sugary and sweet, I just ruined a decent dressing by adding all that sugar. Ugh. If anyone is to make this I would recommend cutting the sugar by 1/2 and making a full box of macaroni, not 1/2.

I wondered how this macaroni salad could be that much better than the usual kind, but it is! The egg is a really nice touch. My husband made the same comment a couple of other reviewers made on here: "I don't even like macaroni salad, but this was awesome!". I brought it to a party and everyone loved it. I do wish I had used a sweeter onion (the one I used was a little strong). I followed the suggestion of others and cut down on the sugar. Because I used regular mayo I used 1/2 cup (if I'd used Miracle Whip I would have gone down to 1/4 cup because it's already so sweet). Even the 1/2 cup was almost too sweet, so I definitely would not use the amount in the recipe. I used less celery, bell pepperand onion than the recipe called for because it seemed like too much...but if you like your macaroni salad crunchy then you would probably want to go with the recommended amount. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks so much for the recipe, I WILL be making it often!

Excellent recipe. I have made it several times and it has been delicious everytime. I only alter the amount of sugar I pour until I think I've added enough. (Less that 3/4 cup). ENJOY!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made some changes after reading reviews.  I used 1c light miracle whip and 1c light mayo and only 1/4c of sugar.  I wasn't sure how the egg would taste -does macaroni salad usually have egg??  Apparently it goes well because it tasted just as good, if not better than store bought.  Thanks for a great recipe!  We'll be making this again!

Read everyone's reviews before making the salad, but still tried the original first.  This was a very sweet dressing for us.  Omitting the sugar altogether, and using 1/2 mayonaise and half salad dressing, made all the difference.  A great salad with these changes!

I made this recipe for a bbq we had a few weeks ago.  Overall we were pretty impressed with the flavor, however we did omit the vinegar and the sugar (I waas running short on time and just mixed everything together, didn't realize it until later) and added some other colors of bell peppers as they are one of our favorite veggies.  We were looking for a recipe with a little bit of tang to it as opposed to macaroni noodles coated in mayo and this recipe definitely did the job.  Next time I'll try to follow the recipe a little better and maybe it will earn five stars instead of four.

Everyone that tried this loved it! I added an extra egg, left out the pepper (didn't have one), and only used 1/4c sugar. I will be making this often, thanks!

Good. This is not something that you can eat a lot of. I made this as an only side and feel that it would have been received better if it was a second or third side. I also found that the recipe yields too much dressing so I had to make and extra cup of macaroni.

My husband & I love this macaroni salad.  I have made it three times allready.  Followed it exactly except I didn't have peppers on hand and I haven't added the pepper when making it again. Really don't think the pepper would add to our enjoyment.

Very good macaroni salad but you definitely have to cut down on the sugar.  The Miracle Whip makes it sweet and I used sweet relish instead of dill.  Omitted the onion and celery but used onion powder instead.  There also is alot of dressing for the macaroni so you may need to make extra.  I think this would work really well, as another review suggested, as a dressing for potato salad.

This was pretty good.  I used sweet pickle relish instead of dill, since that's what my husband prefers, and with that it was well sweet enough for us without the addition of any extra sugar!

I made this for a family cook-out and everybody loved it and was asking for more!  Some "changes" I made: I didn't have bell peppers or celery seed and I only used about half a stalk of celery because we aren't big celery lovers.  It turned out perfectly though.  This one is definitely going into my recipe box!  FYI - The "sauce" this recipe made coated perfectly, not too much, not too little.

Excellent Recipe- Per the reviews, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, only other changes were left out vinegar and bell pepper because I was out and added shredded cheese. 

Will definetely be making this one again, VERY good, thank you!!

I liked this recipe the next day. I had orginially made it for supper. It says to let sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour before serving. Well I really didn't like it the first night. But thought it was quite tasty for lunch the next afternoon.

This has to be one of the best Macaroni Salad recipes I've had!
I found it to be too much dressing for the amount of pasta so I either cut the dressing recipe in half or if I'm making it for a pot luck I double the pasta I use.
I also cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup for the full recipe.
I saute my onion in 1tsp of olive oil for 5 minutes and use 1 whole roasted red pepper, jarred works great.I don't always add the eggs and it still tastes great.
This salad is always a big hit where ever I bring it with kids and adults!

I made this for a picnic on the Fourth of July. I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup, and I omitted the dill pickle relish since I didn't have any. I never used to like macaroni salad but WOW this was good!

As recommended by other reviewers, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, used an entire 16 oz. box of macaroni, and used real mayo. I also made this another time but used whole wheat macaroni and a 1/4 cup splenda instead of sugar so my diabetic husband could enjoy it guilt-free. Both ways I made it were excellent! I will make this again and again!

I think this would have been better with less mustard. I took the advice of other reviewers and I used less sugar, but I still was not impressed with the overall flavor. I did not have celery seed so I used some garlic powder instead.

Very good! I added bacon and mozerella slices, omitted red pepper.  I also used celery salt instead of celery.  As other reviews, I used less sugar.  I used a bit more than half of what was called for.

This was a big hit with my family.   I 
didn't use as much sugar, and I left out
the onions.  That was just a personal choice.  I like the basic recipe because you can make minor changes, be creative,and still have a great salad.

Needed to take a large pasta salad to a church BBQ dinner.  Was glad to find this recipe that could calculate the large amount of pasta salad for 30. Loved the taste of the salad and there was plenty for this crowd.  Somehow I had lots of extra dressing so will now use it to make a potatoe salad too.  I used the bow tie pasta and folks raved about the salad and many asked for the recipe.

Good versatile base recipe. I added some carrots, didn't add the red pepper (kids don't like them), decreased the sugar, added black pepper, tried it with adding crisp bacon. Does make a lot of sauce so if you are going to eat it right away, decrease the sauce. If you will eat it the next day, some of the sauce will be soaked up (but you still might want to decrease it slightly depending on how saucy you like things).

I made this receipe for the 4th of July. I wanted to try something new and different & wow was it great! The only change I made was I used bow ties instead of elbow macaroni and I used Helmans mayo instead of Miracle whip. I am definitely going to make it again and even want to try it with potatoes!

I just finished making this for the second time.  The first time I made it, my family loved it.  I, too, really like it.

The reason I couldn't go five stars is because even with 1/4 cup sugar it's almost too much sugar.  I doubled the amount of the pasta, used the same amount of dressing--except for reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup--and it was still enough dressing for my tastes.

Overall, it's a good recipe that I will continue to make, with a few tweaks.

I followed the recipe exactly with the one exception of the sugar, I used only 1/3c as others suggested.  I'm a huge salad fan but unfortunately not so crazy about this one.  I could see it being an excellent base for egg/tuna/chicken salad sandwiches, but a bit too much "zip" for a macaroni salad (not so crazy about the sweetness, and a bit too mustardy maybe?). Its certainly getting eaten, but I won't be making this again.  Just my personal taste preference, sorry :(

wow!! what a GREAT recipe!! I did not add the eggs, as I do not like them and I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup instead on 3/4. My husband LOVES this recipe. I made it twice within a week and he is already wanting more! Thankyou for submitting this!

I have yet to try this recipe but sounds almost identical to Filipino Chicken macaroni salad to the T. I'm sure I'll enjoy it!

Was just okay.  Not too exciting, and not much flavor other than the taste of Miracle Whip.  I didn't have relish, so I used a few teaspoons of pickle juice instead to give it some of that flavor.  Won't be making this again, I don't think.

Almost perfect, however next time I may heat the onions and celery so they soften. I didnt care for how crunchy the onions were, and I even diced them very small. Perhaps after sitting overnight they may soften, but I felt it took away from the rest of the wonderful salad. It also made enough for an army! I'll have to cut the ingredients in half next time. I'll definately make again. Thanks!

almost exactly as I remember it from home in PA, right near Amish country!  My only suggestion would be to add a little more mustard to have the yellow consistency that the amish macaroni salad I remember had.  But it was just a welcome refreshment from the Publix supermarket brand that was always missing something that I couldn't quite figure out.

This was delicious.  Used mayo instead of Miracle Whip and half the sugar.  Tastes like macaroni salad from the deli, minus that strange gummy consistency.  Will definitely make again.

This is always a big hit when I take it to potlucks. I use both red and yellow bell peppers and add a little sliced green onion as well to make it even more colorful. I add a bit more vinegar, maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons and only use 1/4 cup of sugar and it has a nice sweet and sour tang.

Ok, this was interesting. The first day I was not impressed at all and neither was anyone else. I cut the sugar in 1/2 and it was still SO sweet! However, the second day I really enjoyed it and I finished it off by myself within a couple days. I will make it again and cut back even more on the sugar and it will probably be perfect.

I could not stop eating this stuff!  I left out the onions because I don't care for them.  I rather enjoyed the sweetness of the dressing and thought it was balanced off with the vinegar.

My first attempt at making macaroni salad and I am very happy with this recipe!  Looks fantastic and tastes even better.  I added 1/4 cup sugar and that was plenty.  I also took a previous posters advise and only added enough dressing to coat pasta/veggies.  Thanks for the FANTABULOUS recipe!

I changed this recipe a little just because of personal preference (I used mayo instead of miracle whip and I didn't use any sugar) but this recipe still turned out wonderful.  I took it to our family Christmas party this year and many people told me it was the best macaroni salad they had ever had.  I had made way too much for the amount of people that were there but didn't have any leftovers to take home with me.

A really excellent macaroni salad, just like the kind you pay 2.99 a pd for in the deli. Which is exactly what I was looking for. Slightly sweet.. really excellent, will make it again for the holidays.

Very good macaroni salad. The only change I would make for next time would be to dry the macaroni out more or use a different shape, it came out a little watery.  Also used Dijon Mustard since it was all I had at the moment. The longer you let it sit, the better. I can't wait to see what this tastes like tomorrow!

The first time I made this the only one that could eat it was my teenager, and she ate the whole bowl! My husband thought it tasted like a really sweet version of kfc's potato salad. So the next time I made the dressing,( Using everything but the macaroni, I used half the sugar and I didn't have the right relish so I chopped up 2 small dill pickles ) I used it as a dressing on potato salad...awesome! It is better than anything we have ever purchased and I think this is going to be my new potato salad dressing. I am making this recipe for macaroni salad (with half the sugar called for)to take to a birthday party this week-end and I'm sure it will be a hit. This dressing can work for both potato and macaroni salads, which I think is great.

This was exceptionally smooth and tasted even better the next day. I didn't have any miracle whip salad dressing, so I subsitute it using 1 1/4 cup of mayo with about 3 TBSP of ranch dressing.

I gave this recipe 4 stars due to the changes I made due to suggestions from other reviewers. I omitted the relish due to personal preference, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used mayo instead of salad dressing to cut the sugar a little more.  I also used the entire 16 oz. box of pasta rather than measuring 2 cups.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight and took it to a football gathering.  There were no leftovers, even though I doubled the recipe.  One friend went so far as to call this the best macaroni salad she had ever tasted!

This is a very good pasta salad. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. The only thing I would change next time is to put less celery.

A very good macaroni salad, but a little too sweet for our family. I even reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I will make it again, but try it with even less sugar.

This was the best macaroni salad I've ever made.  My family LOVED it, including my ultra-picky 5 year old.  

We don't like our macaroni salad so creamy, so I used an entire bag of salad macaroni and it was perfect!  I will definitely make this one again.

This is good stuff.  I only use half of the sugar called for, but DON'T leave all of the sugar out!  This recipe works great for potato salad also.

This is really excellent! I use the basics of this now for my potato salad as well.....it is much better than the bland old potato salad  some of us grew up with!  I don't use the pickles, just my personal preference. I also use a little less sugar, but individual tastes will vary, so try a little and you can always add more!

This is the best mac salad sauce I've yet to find. I always add some green peas, and a yellow or orange bell pepper to it as well.

This is a very tasty macaroni salad but the recipe makes way TOO much dressing.  Next time I make it I will use half the ingredients for the dressing and less than half the sugar.  I made the whole recipe and only needed 1/2.

This salad was very good, however I did use the advice of others and only used 1/4 C. of sugar. I also used an entire box of elbows and could of added more, there was way too much dressing. Next time I'll double everything but the dressing.

The best macaroni salad I've had! I followed the recipe exactly except I added half a cup of sugar - and it could even use less. I doubled the recipe to leave some at home and take some to a barbecue. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't really care for macaroni salad but the recipe sounded good so I tried it. I cooked the entire box of macaroni, I used sweet relish, eliminated the mustard, I followed the advice of others and used 1/4 cup of sugar, I used celery salt, some pepper, I used 1 cup of miracle whip and 1 cup of real mayo.I have to say this is very good, I really like it. I am taking it to a party tomorrow. Enjoy!!

I decided to try this recipe when I didn't have my usuall Kraft macaroni salad to go with a bbq I was having with some relatives,and it was a hit.Everyone wanted the recipe.My boyfriend even liked it,and he is very fussy about what he eats.I also passed it on to a couple friends and they've had others ask for the recipe.The only changes I made was to omit the onions and I sometimes use green peppers instead of red or I might put a little of both in.

This recipe sounded so yummy even though the sugar content was a bit high. The first day I didn't like the flavor too much thinking it was too sweet. I added about a tablespoon more of vinegar and some fresh ground black pepper. On the second day I noticed the sweetness mellowed out and a nice tang developed. The third day it tasted pretty darn good. Problem is that it wasn't a hit with my family and I had to toss it out.

I loved this recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of potato salads.  I like the taste of the dressing, but am not a fan of the huge chunks of eggs and potatoes.  This recipe has that potato salad taste, but without the huge pieces.  It's a nice mix of the typical potato salads and pasta salads.  I would definately make this again.

WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR!!  I reduced it to 1/2 cup and it was still really, really sweet.  I also used pimentos instead of a red bell pepper and I added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts.  Otherwise, it was an okay recipe.

This is absolutely the best macaroni salad I've ever had!!  My father and 90-year-old grandfather loved it, too!  Yes, it is sweet and yes, it has a lot of dressing... just the way I LOVE it! I used lite may instead of miracle whip just because I prefer mayo.

This was by far the best macaroni salad that I've made.  I didn't add the sugar, instead, I substitued the vinager with rice vinagar (adds the neccessary sweetness, without overpowering) and added a little Louisiana Hot Sauce for a kick.  All the picky men in my family approved, so you know it's a good recipe.

Probably put too much mayo in it... a little too much sugar in the recipe so I would cut down on that -made it too sweet.  Also I added salt and pepper to taste.  Good for picnics.

I really enjoyed the creamy texture as many salads are too dry. I used sweet pickle relish (dill was not on hand) and cut down on the sugar to two tablespoons. Definitely will make again.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  Made this to go along with hamburgers on the grill and homemade burger rolls.  Cannot eat alot of it because of how rich it is but still good.  My husband doesn't like celery and the kids don't like raw onions but they liked this recipe.  I did not have a red pepper but that did not affect the turnout for our liking.  Thanks!!!

I loved this macaroni salad because it turned out very creamy and flavorful.  I substituted the onion for just the dried chopped onion though.  Still very good!

Overall, this was pretty tasty for macaroni salad. However, I only used about 1 tsp of sugar. I feel like the dressing could have used a little more flavor... it really just tasted like mayo & mustard.

Good recipe but you really need to cut back on the sugar - way too sweet.  Also I cooked additonal macaroni after I finished mixing because I thought it was too creamy.  I will make this again with these changes.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty tasty!  I lightened it up by tossing 2 egg yolks, using light mayo and plain yogurt, and cutting back to 2 Tablespoons of sugar.  I also added a little bit of chopped cheddar (I can't have macaroni salad without it!)  We are taking this on a picnic with Oven Fried Parmesan Chicken, Cucumber Sandwiches, and Pina Colada Ambrosia.  Can't wait!

of course, i agree with the sugar thing. also, i hate miracle whip and used mayo. this is a good bouncing board recipe, and let's you add or subtract to your own liking. i used too many noodles, since others complained of too much sauce, so next time i'll use a lot less. i also omitted the celery seed, added chopped green onion for regular onion, added garlic powder and shredded carrot. i'm sure i'll do this again. thanks!

Used a 1# box of macaroni and that was way too much for two people...so I ate all that was left (lots!).  Really crunchy and good.  Followed exactly right down to the Miracle Whip.  We were adding more salt, though (our preference) at the table.  Next time might add "something" spice-wise but we aren't sure what yet.  Great recipe, love all of that crunch!  Thanks!

I made this as  batch for 50 using the recipe multiplier and had compliments for weeks after.  The celery seed and miracle whip were touches my mother had in her recipe and this one is just as good as hers was.

Excellent Salad, but I would leave out the sugar next time, I find the Miracle Whip adds more than enough sweetness...if using Helmans or something like that, the sugar might be needed...
Thanks!

This was good salad.  I cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup, also added half mayonnaise, half miracle whip.  Needed a little more salt after my alterations.

Really good. This was quite sweet without adding sugar, I think the submitter meant that you would add sugar if you were using plain mayo, not salad dressing.  Used 2/3 cup of all vegetables and added some imitation crab. I might try 1/2 mayo next time.

Good.  I made recipe exactly, and thought it was to sweet.  Also, it is loaded with vegetables.  I thought this was an overload.  Next time I think I will cut back on the sugar, and veggies.  But, it was a nice start to mac salad.

i made this salad for a pot luck of 10 ppl. it looked great and everyone was really exicted to try it. it was ok. nothing special, i added only 1/4 c of sugar b/c i like tangy instead of sweet mac salad. i think it was a little bland, i put in a lot more salt. my dressing i used Renee's Ceaser dressing and i think that made it taste a lot better. i don't think i will make this again - there just just nothing special about it.
