I would not make this again.  I cut the recipe in half.  The poppy seed mixture was lacking in taste and quantity.  The top browned too quickly, and the overall taste was bland.  I had to throw it away.  The other reviewer's use of 4 mini pans would probably spread the poppyseed flavoring around better.

This bread turned out amazing. I couldnâ€™t find my regular loaf pan so I divided the recipe in half and made 4 mini loaves. It was more work this way, but definitely worth it. The semi-sweet mixture was delicious and not to over powering. Very tasty...next time I will add more walnuts.
