This was plain and was done 25 minutes before the time given. I almost burned it. I'm going to look for a new recipe with more flavor.

Just wonderful!  Although, mine didn't have nuts because I didn't have any on hand, it still turned out great.  This will be the recipe I use from now on for banana bread.

This turned out a lot darker than I've ever seen banana bread turn out -- but it was moist and tasty regardless.  I'm just learning to cook/bake on my own and this was easy and fun to try!

This banana bread tastes funny, it's too moist.  I have never tasted banana bread this moist, too moist for my liking.  Doesn't even taste like banana bread, more like a wet dessert.

I was very impressed with this yummy recipe for banana bread.It was very easy and delicious! I decided to double the amount of walnuts and that made it it even more yummy! All oven temps vary but I was able to take 10 minutes off of the total cooking time.I will definetly use this one again!

I used butter instead of oil only because I like the flavor of it better and I used half whole wheat flour. I completely forgot the nuts only because my kids were acting like heathens and I just....forgot. Nice basic banana bread without frills. My oldest boy especially liked this. This was really nice with my morning coffee. It is a little heavy.

I have this recipe memorized! We all love this bread. Sometimes I add 1/2 cup chocolate chips which is delicious! We'll make 4 loaves and it's gone in a week! Needless to say I try not to make it more than a few times a year since it's so addicting.

This honestly came out SO GOOD! I didn’t have the oil so I replaced it with equal parts unsweetened applesauce.  It may be the best banana bread I’ve ever had....

It was good, but seemed a bit dry. The timing was all off, so I had to keep checking on it. I'ver had better, but it was easy and still tasty. I'm going to try another recipe rather than making this again though.

I love this banana bread but I did change it up a bit. Instead of one cup of sugar added half a cup because I do not like my banana bread really sweet.

I made this bread and everything was perfect. As a matter of fact my daughter and son-in-law were in Hawaii and they said it was better than the banana nut bread from the famous banana nut bread store! Made 2 loaves 1st day and made 2 more the second day. Would not change a thing

This is a very good basic recipe.  I added 1tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon and replaced 1/2 of the oil with Butter.  I only baked it for 1 hour.

This bread is excellent -- rich and moist and good.  I have four suggested changes to it when you've made it often enough that you want variety:
(1) Substitute self-rising flour for the regular flour, and omit the baking soda.
(2) The bananas should ideally be almost overripe. They are sweeter that way, and easier to mash.
(3) Rum extract can be substituted for the vanilla extract and is a slightly richer flavor.
(4) A half-tablespoon of Pumpkin Spice (can be bought commercially, or made using a recipe available on Allrecipes) is a pleasant addition to the flavor.  Pumpkin Spice is used in some other recipes for Banana Bread.

I do not have buttermilk on hand so I used regular milk instead and it turned out great. The temperature and baking time were perfect.

Baked this for my bf and best friend and all three of us LOVED it! We ate the whole loaf hot out of the oven. Very moist. I added a. Cup of vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and added cinnamon. Also threw in an extra banana because I LOVE  when it's hot and mushy. Definitely using this recipe from now on.

I added cinnamon to it! About 1tsp into the wet mix. Then topped it with cinnamon and sugar after I poured it into the pan. It gave it a kick! ;-)

REALLY REALLY the GREATEST!!!!!  The only thing I changed was I added a 1/4 t. of salt.  I also used 2% milk with vinegar for the buttermilk...  Perfect every time!!
Thank you Julie:)

This is a good, basic banana bread recipe.  A little cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top before baking is a nice touch.  Watch the baking time, I baked it for less time than called for and it was still a little too dark on the bottom.

I made exactly as stated and it was amazing. I did find that it needed a little longer to bake though. My hunny had me make two in two days. He loved it.
