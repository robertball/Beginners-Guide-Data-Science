We steamed this pudding because I thought it was more like a steamed pudding than a cake.  I don't have a microwave.  I made it in individual servings, like I make brown bread.  I steamed this for about 1/2 an hour. The flavor is delightful; it reminds me of Figgy Pudding!

Well! I fell in love with it, its just great! Even though I had only whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. Everybody in my house and most guests loved it. There was one guest who did not like it but his choice is different, maybe. Served it with ice cream and coffee filled wafer. Thanks for a lovely, quick recipe.

This was so easy to make and delicious.  It reminded me of dumpling from many years ago.  Great with custard!

My daughter was awarded Reserve Champion from the 4H judge for Microwave Cooking with this recipe! And, we all love to eat this dessert, too. I drizzled half & half over the dessert at home; otherwise, the recipe was made just as directed.

Tried this for a Burns Supper, worked well, just bear in mind that the mixture will bubbble quite a bit when you add the dry ingredients due to the baking soda so use a big enough saucepan, also if leaving it cool fully, keep it covered to prevent too much crust.  lined the bowl with baking parchment and slid out no problem

I made it today. I wasn't sure  what spice blend to use, so I used Chinese Five Spice Blend. For dried fruit I used a package of 3.5 oz. dried blueberries. For rest of the dried fruit amount I used cherries, golden raisins, and cranberries. It is very tasty! I cooked it in my largest mixing bowl.

I'm not Scottish nor do I know much of traditional Scottish food. I had a box of dried fruit I wanted to use during the holidays. I made this for two different parties because it turned out so well.
