This recipe was pretty good- considering how simple it was.  I did however, make a few changes.  I only had lean ground beef on hand, so I just seasoned it.  Also, I added a little bit of the spaghetti sauce to the filling to make it easier to stuff the pasta.  Also, A spoon nor my fingers were working for me so I put the filling in a ziplock baggie, then cut about a half inch off of the corner.  I then, basically, used it as a pastry bag to stuff the noodles.  worked wonderfully:)

WOW! I was SOOO impresseed with the easiness and wonderful taste of this. The comments and reviews helped out a lot to make it great. I bought regular cream cheese and spiced it heavily with basil, oragano, pesto, and 2 cloves of garlic. For those heay spice lovers, I judged whether it was enough by the smell. If it still smelled heavily of cream cheese, I added extra herbs. I also used a few pinches of thyme and one dash of cumin. 

I also added a blend of italian cheeses instead of just mozzerella, and used more than the reciepe called for in the mixture. I saved just enough to sprinkle on the top of the dish.  

I also had enough to make 14 shells moderatly stuffed. 

This made awesome left overs too! Next time I might try lean beef (the sausage ratio to cheese mixture was a bit high), and reduced fat cream cheese as I don't want the flavor or the fat of it, but I do want the richness. 

Thanks for sharing!

This recipe just didn't have enough flavor for me. It was a little too overpowered by the cream cheese. I think the next time that I make this, I will decrease the cream cheese (maybe even try an herb cream cheese) to 5-6oz and add more shredded mozzarella. I will also add some fresh herbs such as parsley, oregano and perhaps a little basil.

Wow, these are amazing! I added extra spices because I love flavor, and it made it fantastic! I have also put the filling into jumbo shell pasta, which was easier than filling the manicotti, I thought. To fill, I used a ziploc sandwich bag, filled it with the meat, and then clipped off a corner, like a makeshift frosting bag. Filling and clean up was so much easier.

This was very GOOD, with a few add in's. I used Italian sausage to give some spice. i also added onion and fresh mushroom to the meat. After added the cream cheese, I put in garlic powder, organo, basil, and pepper. The add in's gave lot's of flavor! Will cook again.

This is the best recipe! I did add a few things though, I only used about 3/4 of an 8 ounce package of cream cheese and added more mozzerella and also a container of ricotta. I also added about 1/4 tsp of italian seasoning. It was very very good!!!

This recipe was fabulous.  I did make a little change.  I used ground beef as well as ground italian sausage.  These two were a good flavor.  I had never made manicotti before and was a little leary.  It was great.  Using the cream cheese gave it a smoother flavor then ricotta would have.  Also, the cream cheese made it easier to stuff the pasta.  I did use more cheese on the top.  This was a true keeper recipe.  Thanks.

This was a great recipe. I did make some changes, just to get in some more veggies. I added some onion, red pepper and zucchini to the meat and sauteed them and some fresh spinach to the cream cheese. Also I used chedder cheese instead of mozza as that is what I had. I was really happy with how it turned out and will be making it again, maybe using different veggies next time.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count, and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it!  I always make some type of adjustment to the recipes I use, however this is one I haven't tampered with at all.  It is excellent AS IS!  I've served this countless times for dinner parties, friends, and for family.  Its always a huge success.  The recipe makes more than 6 servings, though, so I always freeze the extra mix for later use.

My whole family loves this recipe.   I make it as it is listed here.  My father is very picky when it comes to pasta dishes and he can not get enough.  The only downsideis there are Never any Leftovers!!!

I did not have jumbo shells so I put the mixture on lasagna noodles and rolled up.  I used reduced fat cream cheese & lots of Italian spices. Added minced garlic to the turkey sausage. Good!

My husband does not like ricotta cheese, so this recipe was a great way to get him to eat manicotti. I love manicotti with 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 hot ground sausage. Per others' reviews, I added 3/4 of the cream cheese, made up the difference with mozzarella cheese. I also added seasonings to taste- basil, garlic salt, garlic powder and a pinch of oregano.

DELICIOUS!  Here's what I did.  I added 8 ounces of ricotta.  I used sausage and ground beef (1/2 pound each).  I added parsley, a good healthy tablespoon full (make it 2 tablespoons), 2 tablespoons of italian seasoning.  I covered the top of them with mozzarella and poured a 24 ounce can of red sauce over the top.

I made this recipe for my husband one night and he loved it.  He now requests to have it about once a week.  I did take the advice of a few others and added some seasonings, such as garlic, basil, and oregano.  Also sprinkled some parsley before serving it.  I like to make this the night before, that way when I get home from work, just have to take it out of the fridge and place in oven; makes supper seem much quicker!

This recipe is a keeper!!! We LOVED it.  I did make a few changes though.  I used 1/2 lb. HOT ground sausage and 1 lb. hamburger.  I also seasoned the cream cheese/sausage mixture with oregano, basil, garlic powder and onion powder to taste.  My husband doesn't eat leftovers, but he's looking forward to having it tomorrow for lunch!

Awesome recipe!  My whole family loved it, including my picky 2 year old and the champion picky eater of all time, my 9 year old nephew!Wasn't sure of the cream cheese but decided to dive and give it a try. Was I glad I did! I'm sure it will become a family favorite.  I was surprised at how easy it was, too.  Never made manicotti before, so I was leery of it being too time consuming, but it really wasn't.  I used a tip one of the other reviewers did, to stuff with your hands and it really was easy!  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This was my first time making and eating manicotti. It turned out great. My husband said it was the best he had ever had. I'm not a big ricotta cheese fan, so this was fantastic. At first I tried stuffing the mixture into the manicotti with a spoon. This didn't work very well, so I used my fingers. It worked much better! I must have stuffed my manicotti with too much filling because I didn't have enough filling for all 12.

I did not have pasta shells on hand so I rolled the mixture in lasagna noodles.  I also added some Pampered Chef Italian seasonings to the cream cheese mixture and since I love cheese I added more than was called for.  My 5 and 4 year olds loved this and thought it tasted like pizza.

Great substitute for ricotta cheese. The cream cheese makes it a little creamy but just add extra meat or 1/2 the amount of cream cheese. I used ground turkey. Enjoy!!!!

I don't know who rated this before, but when I did this recipe it was wonderful!  Kids helped out putting the filling in the shells and it was a great family project and in the end, the Manicotti II was excellent.  Definitely a 5 star recipe.

Followed the recipe with the only exception of using more sauce. Very tasty. Picky wife said it’s a keeper.

Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting. For this and every other recipe calling for ricotta cheese, do NOT ever use cottage cheese. Another mistake is par boiling the pasta.

Excellent! I added some of the spaghetti sauce to the sausage mixture.. Also, I used sweet mild Italian sausage. And instead of adding mozzarella on top I used a cheddar/Monterey Jack blend! Delicious!!

Really tasty.  I added Italian spices, diced roasted red pepper and a dash of cayenne for kick.  I was able to fill mine using a soup spoon with no problem and had enough filling to fill all 12 noodles.

We loved this. I used 1 lb sweet Italian sausage and the whole 8oz of cream cheese and thought it was a good ratio. I did use a few dried herbs in the cheese mixture nothing special (whatever you would use to season any red sauce dish) 1/4 of of yellow onion and fresh flat leaf parsley finely diced but that is it, no other changes. It was delicious. My husband went for seconds and kept saying how good it was. This was easy and yummy. Definitely a keeper for the ages. I will be making this for years to come:) Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe, although I modified it a bit for our taste. I followed the suggestion of other commenters and added lots of spices to the cheese/sausage mixture. And I didn't have the manicotti shells so I just put cooked pasta in the bottom of the casserole dish and spread the cheese stuff over it and then topped that with a pint-jar of my own homemade tomato sauce. I would have used more tomato sauce, but the dish I was using was too small... 
I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe. I did take the advice from others and spiced up the cream cheese with dried herbs from my pantry. I loved the creamy texture…but I might cut back on the cream cheese next time. I also used hot Italian sausage and it added nice heat.

This was great for a quick and easy dinner!  I didn't have any pasta shells, so I just cooked some bow tie pasta, put them on the bottom of the casserole dish and layered the cream cheese mixture on top of them.  Then I added a thin layer of mozzarella in between the cream cheese mix and the sauce, then finished the top layer with a sprinkling of mozzarella.  I also added some herbs to the cream cheese: a rosemary and garlic herb mix that I found in the grocery store's spice section.  It was great!

Excellent and easy! I use JD hot sausage and am about to make a double batch as it was requested by my husband for him to take to Thanksgiving pot luck at his work.

I was dreading going to the store just to buy ricotta, then found this recipe.  Really good with the cream cheese and less guilt.  I added lots of onion and garlic and Italian seasonings and used the filling to stuff shells.  EASY and good.

Waaaay too much cheese.  My husband loved it, however.
