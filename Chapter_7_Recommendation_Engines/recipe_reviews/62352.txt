This turned out well.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were good.  Will make again because it was so easy.  I think I will reduce the amount of herbs just a bit because they were a little strong.  Thanks for the post.

My family LOVED this.  The all of the seasonings made a very tasty gravy, and the chicken was so tender.  I used an oven roaster and did it in the oven.  I skipped mixing the seasonings in a bowl...and just sprinkled them right onto the roaster to my hearts content, and then poured in the broth & wine (really not having a problem with overwhelming greenness).  I also added potatoes & carrots in with the shrooms and onion.  Good eats lilsis, and thanks!

This recipe is really nothing special. The chicken is pretty bland. What is remarkable is how unappetizing the chicken looks once cooked. The thyme and other spices leave the chicken with a green coating which, as my friend remarked, looks like something Tim Burton would create. I will not be making the Tim Burton Chicken again.

I also used boneless chicken breast so it took less time to make.  The herbs were fantastic I wouldn't change any of those.  I'm giving it a 3 because the chicken had a scary white look to it that will affect presentation if that's important to you.  Mostly though, I could tell something was missing from this recipe.  It needed a kick of some sort.  Next time I'll use some lemon seasoning or marinade to see if that helps.

this was great.....I think that with any cook you must season to taste and I did just that and it did not take away from the original recipe. IT WAS GREAT....added a lil chilly pepper in the pot while the chicken was browning

My family's been making a variation of this recipe for 60 years, and it's always great.  A couple of tips.  For those of you having trouble with chicken color, you must BROWN your chicken well before moving to next steps.   Bone-in chicken holds up best.  For the dried herbs, soak them in hot water 1/2 hr and hydrate them--use water 2-1 vs dry herbs--with fork, squeeze off excess water.  Add hydrated herb mixture to mushroom/onion mixture while it's cooking, along with fresh minced garlic.  Add wine and chicken broth.   Bring to simmer.  Salt and pepper to taste.  No need for all those extra bowls..  Return chicken pieces to covered dutch oven, and bake for 45 min @ 350.  So easy, so delicious!

This turned out to be an excellent meal. As with any recipe you need to adjust the spices to your taste, which is why I started out with half the amount of spices and added more as I saw fit. I also did not get scary white or green chicken at all. The presentation was beautiful. I made this with wings and thighs, and the broth made an excellent gravy for rice. I do not recommend using wings, but a fleshier pieces if you go that route, like breasts or thighs. Thanks for sharing!

I cooked this for my boyfriend's family and they loved it! When I cooked the onions & mushrooms, I threw the chicken in with it which gave it GREAT flavoring. I served bowtie pasta with Bertolli alfredo sauce..which kinda drowned the wonderful flavor of the chicken. I reccomend eating with rice.

This chicken didn't taste very good. The herb flavor was way too strong and the chicken didn't look very appetizing. I am giving it a 3 because I can probably dice this and add it to a soup. It may dilute the strong herb flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I forgot to pick up mushrooms while at the grocery store, so I made this reciepe without it. I did make the sauce into a gravy with flour and water. I topped fresh cut green onions over it and served it with wheat pasta. The chicken was so tender and juicy! I will make this again!

Pretty good recipe.  I just did this with chicken breasts in a deep frying pan on the stove.  It works well.  I thickened the sauce after and made some gravy for the mashed potatoes.  It worked out great!

This was a wonderful dish for the winter months.  I made the gravy and mash pototoes w/ string beans.  Chicken thighs works best.  The flavor is awsome.  Easy, quick and guest will think you cooked all day. .smile

This was a little strong smelling even though we cut the herbs down slightly (due to my stomach problems) but it did taste very good. Despite the smell, the taste was not overpowering as I thought it would be. I think this is a great recipe to make and "make it your own" to your family's liking. I personally like it the way it is just cutting down on the herbs a little and served over pasta. I will be making this again.

This is a great dish.  I made it with boneless chicken breast.  I froze some for future dinners.  I serve it over Carolina seasoned rice (the brown one sold in a long tube-like bag).  My husband likes it and my 3 year old even eats it.

I made this meal and it was excellent.  I did add some mushroom and celery to give it a little more flavor.  My family all enjoyed it.

Amazing! I just can't cook though without changing a few things! I used a large cast iron skillet and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I put the onions in the skillet while I browned the chicken. After the chicken was browned I added the broth, seasonings, mushrooms, 1 thinly slicked carrot and 1 chopped celery stalk. I omitted the rosemary and poultry seasoning (husband doesn't like), added 1 t. garlic-red pepper seasoning. Then I added 1 cup Stone Hill Vidal Blanc, covered and simmered until the chicken was done. When chicken was done, I used 4 oz cream cheese and corn starch to make a sauce. I added chicken back in after the cream cheese was melted (use a whisk to mix). I served with cheese tortellini and sauteed zucchini & yellow squash. It's a keeper like that! The color wasn't great but the taste was amazing!

Added red peppers, green and black olives, EVERYONE loved it!  Served it with the noodles and it was terrific! Next time I will roast the peppers. Also used minced garlic and the powered garlic.

It was good, but pretty bland for my tastes.
