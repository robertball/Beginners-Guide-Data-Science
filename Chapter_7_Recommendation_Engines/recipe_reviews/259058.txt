My daughter and I read a book called Saturday Sancocho, and decided to make some, never having had it before. I selected this sancocho recipe because it was vegetarian, and I was familiar with all the ingredients except yuca, which I was able to find at my regular not-particularly-fancy grocery store (and was able to cut with my not-particularly-sharp knives.) I thought it would end up being a bit bland because of the lack of spices, but IT WAS DELICIOUS! Five folks ate with us, and everyone loved it. I meant to take a picture of it so I could post it here, but forgot. Sorry. Served it big, shallow bowls with a scoop of plain white rice (in the same bowl) and sprinkled with cilantro.  It plated very nicely and the corn on the cob chunks gave it a special flair. I'll definitely make this again.
Thank you for posting, lllilliputian!
