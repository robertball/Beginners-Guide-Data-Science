As luck would have it, my grill ran out of gas right when I was about to prepare this dish.  So, a lucky accident occurred thats worth another try! 
I dumped the entire thing, marinade and all, into a deep, stainless saute pan and sauted everything.  I lidded the mixture for the first 3/4 of the cooking time (to ensure that the meat was cooked and the veggies soft).  Following this, I increased the heat and removed the lid, thus boiling and thickening the remaining juices.  The result was delicious!  What was originally the marinade became a thick delicious sauce.  The pork was ridiculously tender, and the greek flavor was prevalent throughout.  
The only thing I will be careful about next time is saltiness.  I added the soy, as directed, but then also seasoned the dish and mine came out just a bit too salty.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish! I made it a little differently because we don't have a grill... I marinated pork chops & veggies for about 3 hours and then baked them in the marinade at 325 F. Once they were finished baking, I removed the chops & veggies and thickened the marinade with a little cream and flour until I had a nice sauce. Excellent flavor!!

My husband and his friend went NUTS over this. DH practically ran back to the kitchen for seconds! The only thing I did differently was I didn't skewer it; just tossed it in a baking dish and baked at 400 for 25 minutes. I served this over rice. Thanks a lot!

I tell you what, I know very well that soy sauce is not a traditional ingredient in anything Greek, and I don't need any hopped up foodies screaming authenticity in my ear. I LOVE this recipe. It is absolutely delicious. I do use low sodium soy, so maybe others find it too salty if they don't. That's well and good. Have some common sense and taste your marinade before you add any meat! If it tastes salty, add more lemon juice and oil. Problem solved, my friends. I marinate red peppers and red onions right in with this. The marinade makes for a lovely caramelization, and this goes splendidly with Tzatziki Sauce I. I serve this on pita with cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, tzatziki and feta cheese. Mmmm. Can't go wrong. This also works well with chicken. Please don't listen to the nay-sayers. It really is delicious. Would I lead you astray? ;)

So there is no soya sauce in traditional souvlaki but this is still a great recipe. If you want the real thing omit the soy sauce. Very simple. There is nothing wrong with adding the soya if you like it. Maybe not authentic but still very good. Give it a try.

This recipe is AWESOME!  We also served it on warm pita bread with cucumber sauce, called Tzatziki sauce on this website and submitted by Dinah, but I added 1/4 c. of mayo to keep it thicker.  It turned out wonderful.  I also topped the sandwiches with diced tomatoes.  I used 2 lbs. of pork tenderloin (Hormel Always Tender brand) instead of 4 and it made five skewers of meet!  And I even ommitted the green peppers.  This was plenty for sandwiches.  I still made the same amount of marinade and I'm glad I did.  The marinade doesn't make that much and it was perfect for two pounds.  I added a Greek seasoning, found in supermarkets, to both the marinade and the sauce instead of salt and pepper.  Can't remember the name but it's in a yellow with red shaker container.  It's a staple in our house.  Thanks Abby for a real "keeper."

I can honestly say not one of my Greeks friends would EVER add add soy sauce to their Souvlaki & call it authentic.

Excellent recipe!  I marinated two pounds of cubed pork tenderloin for about 8 hours and it was so tender.  We skewered the meat separate from the onions and peppers because they don't cook at the same rate.  I served this with Tzatziki II, white rice, and Good for you Greek Salad.

EXCELLENT!!  This is so flavorful, and leaves the pork so tender!  I can't believe how easy it is!  And this is a very versatile recipe - I have made it with pork, chicken, and beef, and all are great.  I have also made it on kabobs on the grill, or as a one-dish entree (stirring the marinaded meat, peppers & onions together and baking in one pan).  And you can serve with rice, or in a pita and cucumber sauce.  Best part is, nearly everyone likes it - even my kids (5 and 3), who don't like much!!  Thanks for sharing.

I have never had Souvlaki but it looked good and had so many rave reviews I had to try it. I am so glad I did - we were out of charcoal so I made it on the stove. It was wonderful. The meat was melt in your mouth tender and had sooo much flavor.I marinated the meat for 4-5 hours. When I started slowly browning the meat I put the red & yellow pepper and onion in the marinade for about 10 minutes. Then added that to the meat and let it simmer on the stove covered.
 It was Delicious !!!!!!!
Leftovers the next day were really salty.

I make these on a regular basis. I buy pork loins on sale, cut my meat up and add the pork chunks and marinade to a freezer bag. I freeze it until I need them, works beautifully.

Awesome recipe.  I used it for a Greek themed dinner - and everyone raved about it.  Even better than eating in Greektown, my guests all said.  I was even surprised how good it was.  I did double the marinade and used chicken breasts instead.  SOOOO easy.

Delicious flavor but I needed to cook it a little longer. I don't like pink pork. Otherwise, this is a great recipe!

We loved this recipe! And I figured out a few shortcuts to make it even easier to prepare! I marinated the pork (which I found at Trader Joe) overnight along with the peppers and onions. I soaked wooden skewers and built the kabobs the next morning. When I came home that night I preheated the oven to 400 and lay the skewers across a cookie sheet. They were done after about 25 minutes. The oven was an excellent alternative to the grill, which we only use seasonally. I served it with "Orzo and Rice", another quick and tasty recipe from allrecipies directory. The only addition to the rice dish was a sprinkling of feta on top! Yummmm!

Excellent!!!!  I let mine (pork & veges) marinade for 2 days.  Then, because I didn't feel like threading that much, I threw the entire thing into a large glass baking dish and popped it in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes then broiled for about another 15 minutes until done.  I ended up with all those wonderful juices and served it over rice.  My better half loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks.

Loved it!  I used the entire marinade with 4 thick cut pork loin chops which I cubed, one red onion and one gr pepper.  Used 2 tbs of lemon juice only because I didn't have fresh. Then took another reviewers advice and instead of skewers I baked the entire recipe, marinade included, for 15 min at 400 and then broiled for another 10 min.  Served it all over rice and the sauce was sooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe, this will become a regular in our house!

Great recipe. Served this with a Greek style couscous salad (lemon juice, olive oil, black pepper, feta cheese, fresh basil and green onions). Husband wasn't even asked but he declared it was a five-star meal. Went well with a California Zinfindal (Rancho Zabaco). Marinated for 24 hours.

Amazingly good.  I grew up in a city full of Greek restaurants.  When I was craving souvlaki, I found this recipe.  O. M. G.  I too was skeptical about the soy sauce, but DON'T leave it out. I used low-sodium soy sauce, so those commenting about saltiness, just switch. I probably added a bit more lemon, and used a mix of chicken and pork. I make double the marinade so that I can marinate the vegetables separately. We all loved it.

This dish was very tender and flavorful. I used beef instead of pork and it turned out rather well. I let it marinate overnight and the flavors did nto overwhelm the meat. I served this with tzatkiki sauce, saffron rice, pita bread and tabouleh. It was delish!

My family loved it! I made it with the greek potatoes and the easy yogurt cucumber sauce on allrecipes. I did add mushrooms and green olives to the marinade and it was awesome. I also cooked it on a George Foreman grill since I don't have a real one and it was perfect!

OH SO GOOD!!! I used very thinly sliced sirloin instead of pork. I didn't use any veggies so I added 1 tsp. of onion powder to the marinade. I will definitely be making this quite often. I served this with "Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce" a recipe from this site.

I have made this with both pork and chicken.  Both were outstanding.  I learned somewhere to put meat and vegies on different skewers.  It gives you more control in cooking.  I serve this with Greek Style Potatoes also from Allrecipes site, add a greek style salad and you have an easy but really great dinner.

I give this recipe 5 stars! We ended up marinading in a large ziplock bag in the fridge over night and the flavor of the meat was very close to the lamb meat that is used in gyros. I warmed up some pita rounds and made my own cucumber yogurt sauce. (mix together plain yogurt, finely chopped cucumber and some ranch dressing)

I don't have a grill because I live in a condo. I baked the skewered meat @350degrees for 10mins. I then brushed them with Marinade (reserved marinade liquid + a TBS of a GOOD Teriyaki sauce). I turned them, brushed the other side, and placed them under the broiler for +/- 5 minutes per side brushing with marinade after turning. I served this w a Greek salad and a tzatziki sauce (Greek yogurt, grated cucumber minus liquid, salt, pepper, shallot, garlic, dill weed). This was the best meal of the week.  Thank you so much for the recipe. This one is a keeper!

Great grill recipe!  I froze extra in the marinade, thawed it and threw it on the grill with fresh vegetables.  It was quick and easy.

This recipe was fantastic, I made it for a Greek dinner I catered and got so many compliments.  I did not grill it, I just cooked it in a crock pot on high for 6 hours, and then served it with pitas. I was leery of the soy sauce but it added alot of flavor, once it warms up I will try it on the grill.  Thanks, this one is a new favorite.

I cut the porkloin into little cubes and marinated it overnight.  To make things a little easier, I cooked the entire thing (marinated pork, marinade, raw onion and red and yellow pepper slices) in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes.....it made a great filling for pita bread and tasted great over rice (and the resulting "sauce" was fantastic).  I disagree with whoever wrote that the recipe called for too much lemon ~ I used alot MORE lemon and garlic and it was terrific!!  (Try prepared tsaziki sauce from Costco or Sams as a side.)

I'm not even going to comment on the soy sauce in this recipe, the fact of the matter is this marinade is delicious.  I used pork tenderloin, but chicken would work just as well for a change of pace. My only change after tasting the sauce was to add a couple of teaspoons of white sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Ok, like others, Soy Sauce isnt Greek, but who cares when the marinade is so good? I used this on mushrooms, pork, chicken, peppers and shallots. It was "rock my world" good.   One recommendation: definitely allow enough time to marinate. If you only allow a short time, I have found that the flavors from the marinade are weak. I recommend overnight or at least 6 hours. I also use low sodium soy sauce, so maybe this is the reason, but regardless, try this and I know you will not be dissappointed!

I read the review about leaving out the soy sauce to make traditional Souvlaki, and made two batches, one with the soy sauce and one without.  I thought they were both very good.  Most of my guest preferred the kabobs made with the soy sauce.  The marinade works well with other types of meat.  I use it for shrimp (without soy sauce) and marinate the shrimp 15-20 minutes.

OMG!!! This was the best meal I've ever made hands down.  I followed exactly except for adding the veggies.  I made a tzatziki from foodnetwork, served the marinated grilled meat in warmed pita pockets with fresh slices of onion, tomato and the sauce.  We felt like we were in a greek resturant.  I will make this again and again. Wonderful flavor, thank you thank you!

I'm a big fan of greek and other mediterranean food, but believe it or not, even in the San Francisco bay area it is extremely hard to find a greek restaurant. To help feed my craving for this, I tried this recipe but marinated it for 24 hours. It tasted like some of the best souvlaki I have ever tried! This goes great with Greek Lemon potatoes.

This was absolutely delicious! I wish I had marinated it longer,but it was still very fragrant and mouth watering.I,too,didn't barbecue it on the grill,but rather baked it in the oven at 325 degrees for 35 minutes.I also tossed in potatoes with the marinade and it made a meal in itself in one dish!

Excellent!  I used more garlic and lemon juice and served it with the garlic feta dip recommended by TMoore. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/60543/garlic-feta-dip/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%201  Easy and good enough for company.

It is such an easy recipe to prepare and tastes as good with chicken as it does with pork.  We have used it many times and I have passed it on to several family and friends.  A real winner.

This was excellent! I live 10 minutes away from Tarpon Springs, Florida, where the Epiphany is celebrated every January. Very large Greek community. We eat at Greek restaurants all the time. This was very close, if not as good as the souvlaki we get eating out. More effort but, less expensive to feed my brood. Please try this recipe...it is awesome. Thanks!   Erin

This was by far the best recipe I have found for Souvlaki! We made Tizki ( I know I spelled that wrong) and put the meat in a fresh pita and smothered it with the sauce. I loved that it was so easy and that it was healthy fast food!

Very yummy! I marinated the pork overnight, and baked them in the oven, as another reviewer did. Delicious! Next time, I might try adding more lemon, though.

I make this at least 1-2 per month and my family LOVES it! I tend to double the recipe though, so I have enough to use as a basting sauce throughout the cooking process! Wonderful and VERY tasty!

This recipes never fails to please.  I recently did a vegan version for a potluck and subbed the pork for eggplant.  This marinade is great with pork, chicken, beef, lamb, tofu or just veggies.  I've tried all variations and they all came out fantastic.

Used two thick boneless pork chops and my bf kept asking if it was tenderloin! The marinade really made the pork tender. Served with Tzaziki and warm pita and boxed Couscous. Will have again. Thanks!

This was great! I was very skeptical about the soy sauce, so I only made a half recipe. I marinated overnight and cooked in a baking dish in a 350 oven for 45 minutes with the veggies. I could not pick up even a hint of soy sauce! Served with yogurt sauce and whole wheat pitas. YUM!

We loved it. I made it for a gathering. I did change the recipe slightly. I used 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup low sodium soy, the juice of one lemon, basil, italian seasoning, pepper to taste and 1 tablespoon worchestshiire sauce. With about 2.5 pounds of boneless pork ribs cut into 1 1/5 inch cubes into a large gallon ziplock baggie and marinated for about three hours or so. I cooked them on the grill for about eight to twelve minutes turning once. We served them on tortillas with homemade tzatzski sauce, red onion, tomato and lettuce. They where amazingly like what I get in my favorite greek resturant. Hubby says "Make thme again!!"

My family thought this was awesome. It is such a simple marinade, yet so flavorful. Will definately surprise you. I think the trick is to let the meat come to room temperature in the marinade on the counter for at least one hour before you grill it. Ooh it makes the marinade permeate the meat so much deeper and the flavor is throughout the meat instead of just on the surface, especialy with chicken which is very hard to flavor through.  I added about 2 lemons worth of juice instead of just one and it reminds us of our favorite greek restaurant in town. DEEELICIOUS!!!
*We serve this with Greek Feta fries. Steak fries on a plate, take 2 cloves of crushed fresh garlic, mix with a tablespoon of lemon juice and sprinkle all over hot fries. Then sprinkle about 1/2 (or more if you like) of crumbled Feta and sprinkle with dried Oregano, salt and pepper. YUMMMM!

Delicious!  I did what another poster suggested and made two batches of marinade, one for the meat, the other for the vegetables and then skewered them seperately.  It smelled heavenly.  I grabbed a piece of crusty bread and started dipping it in the marinade the vegetables were in after I skewered them, it was SO good.  I had to dump the marinade before I ate the whole loaf of bread.  I plan on making this again and again.  My husband asked if he could have this with steak and shrimp for his birthday meal.

This was really good. I just used the marinade on boneless pork chops (all I had at the time) and broiled in oven (it was raining ~ couldn't use grill) I enjoyed it and am looking forward to being able to cook it on the grill!!

Superb! This souvlaki is unbelievably good. It tastes even better than the souvlaki I've had at my favourite restaurant. It's a very simple, easy recipe and easily adaptable to chicken and lamb. I have served this to friends and the only complaint I have ever gotten is that I didn't make enough. Thanks Abby, for sharing such a great recipe!

I have made this several times over the summer and it was great!  It is a good idea to let it marinate longer than suggested if you have the time, but I would not recommend leaving it overnight since it came out very salty when I tried that.

After my vacation to Kos in Greece, I really got my eyes up for this wonderful dish. I never thought I could make them as good as they do down there, but this recipe, with chicken instead of pork, tastes better than any souvlaki I have ever had! Serve it together with a proper greek salad, rice and pommes noisettes -MARVELLOUS! Highly recommended!

marinade made pork very tender.  Melts in your mouth.  Great served with hummus and pita bread.

I prepared this recipe without the soy sauce as other reviewers said it was too salty. After cooking it, the pork was tender, but all I could taste was the lemon. I don't know what went wrong, but my tastebuds didn't like it.  I did make the tzatziki sauce from another recipe and that came out fine.  I don't think I will make this recipe again.

Made this with 1 pork tenderloin. I halved all the ingredients.  Was a bit worried about the soya sauce overpowering the meat, but on the contrary.  The pork was moist and flavorable. Will definitely make again. Would be as yummy using chicken,beef or shrimp

Wonderful! Made as directed and wouldn't change a thing. Really enjoyed using pork loin a new way, as in not making a roast.

The taste was decent, but since when does souvlaki marinade include soy sauce? It gave it more of an Asian flavor than a Mediterranean one.

Doubled the marinade and did it on 8 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Let them marinade for 2.5 hours, then bbq.  Fantastic - will definately do this one again.

I know that pork is the traditional souvlaki, but I used this marinade on chicken.  One word - yum.  As some reviewers felt the soy sauce made it too salty, I used lite soy sauce and had no problems.  Try this with the tzatsiki sauce submitted by Teina P.  Very tasty!

Unfortunately we did not like this - the soy sauce is not a good flavor with this dish and not very "Greek"-like.  We were looking for a very different souvlaki recipe.

I have made this twice now to rave reviews.  Even people who said they did not like pork loved this.  I used twice as much lemon and 1/2 the soy.  Also made 2 times recipe as altered above for 2 larger pork tenderlions.  We will be making this again many times.

I made this the other night and it was great. I baked it instead of grilling it b/c I live in an apartment. It turned out so moist. I laid the skewers down in a baking dish, poured some of the marinade at the bottom, and then covered it with foil. MMM...It made it very moist and tasty.

lots of flavour for pork but it's just ok.  i'd prefer this recipe with chicken or beef.  I also don't get why there is soy sauce in the dish - doesn't seem very Greek to me.

We have a dinner club and I made this for the entree when we had "Greek" night.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy!  I put the meat and veggies on separate skewers since the veggies cook much faster--I learned this trick the hard way!

I have made this recipe MANY times.  Served on pita with tsaziki sauce and fresh tomatoes, yummy.  Better than gyros!!  Great marinade.  One of my favorite ways to serve pork tenderloin.  My 11 year old son eats this, and he is extremely picky.  A keeper!

Whenever I ask my boyfriend what he wants for supper, the answer is inevitablly "I don't care".  BUT, the other day, when I asked him what he wanted, he requested this dish.  I never used to like kabobs, but I LOVE this.  Served simply with white rice, this dish makes a delicious and healthy meal.  Two thumbs up!

This is the best ever. I used fresh thyme and oregano and lamb. Marinated all night. Served the cubes (cooked under the broiler) in a tortilla (like gyros) topped with tzatziki and onions and tomatoes (substituted the green peppers). Onions and tomatoes marinated with the same ingredients, different bowl. SIMPLY AMAZING! It was the real thing.

I have tried several souvlaki recipes, but this was the absolute best.  I double everything but the soy.  I was skeptical on the soy but it does wonders in tenderizing cheaper cuts of meat.  I just use regular pork chops and trim the fat off.  Serve with tzatziki sauce(Costco's is to die for!) and greek salad.

This was some of the best souvlaki i've ever made. The marinade worked really well, it flavoured and tenderized the meat. Use real lemon juice, the bottled stuff wont give you the same flavour. I added mushrooms to my skewers and they grilled up nicely.

Wow, the marinade is to die for!  Be SURE and marinate overnight - that is the key.  This tasted so authentic (I have been to Greece, and also frequent Greek restaurants where I live), I couldn't believe.  Note that you can just throw it all in a skillet and sautee it, if you are pressed for time.  I served it with "Tzatziki Sauce II" from this site, pita bread, and a side of grilled vegetables mixed with olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was great!!!  I used tenerloin and marinated 24hrs.  I put the meat and veggies in seperate ziploc bags with double the amount of marinade in each. I also added whole mushroms (stems removed) and cherry tomatoes to the bell pepper and onion. Served with Oven Brown Rice (from this site) and grilled yellow squash halves which were basted in left over marinade.

There was something about this that just didn't work.  I liked the flavors but found the lemon to be too overpowering and thought the meat was way too salty.  I'll definitely have to try again but will definitely serve this with tsaziki(I love it but can't spell it) sauce next time and probably will cut down on the lemon and soy sauce.

Great change from the typical daily recipes.  Marinating for 24 hours makes this dish excellent!

This is so easy and my husband loves it!  I do the marinade in a plastic zipper bag and I add potatoes.  We serve this with warm pitas.

Very good.  I added more lemon and more oregano, as I didn't have enough time to let it marinate for 3 hours.  It turned out great.

This was wonderful!  I didn't make kabobs but rather grilled the pork tenderloin and made grilled onions, peppers, and yellow squash on the side to put into pitas with cucumber/dill/yogurt sauce from Epicurious website.  My husband loved these!

I used apple cider vinegar (1/4 cup) in place of the lemon and it was perfect.  Served it over rice with a fresh garden tomato and tzatziki sauce.

Excellent recipe...in Albuquerque there is a restaurant, Town House.  This recipe matches their tasty Souvlaki.  I made with chicken tenderloins, but next will be lamb.

This was amazing.  I put the entire meal, including marinade in the oven to bake at 375 until the meat was cooked through.  So juice and tender.  I served over white rice with Tzatziki passed at the table.  Definitely saving the recipe!

EXCELLENT!!  I made ours with chicken. I marinaded the chicken and onions together then, as others, put mine in roasting pan and baked for 10 min at 400.  Added in the peppers and zucchini (subbed for green pepper) and mixed together...five more minutes in oven then under the grill for 10 to give it a char. Chicken moist and veggies were al dente. DIVINE!  Served with Greek style potatoes by Cathie from this site...also excellent.

I've used this recipe numerous times...should have reviewed it before now.  First time, I made as written and it was great.  Second time, I doubled the lemon and garlic and added a bit more soy.  Either way, delicious!  Along with the pork, I skewered onions, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, lemon quarters and mushrooms.  Marinating 3-4 hours does the trick for my family.

Loved this!  It tasted almost exactly like the souvlaki we get at our local Greek place.  Be sure to add a little paprika for flavor.

Absolutely FABULOUS! A must-try recipe for sure. Let it marinate over-night to get that nice, juicy flavor; it's well worth the wait.

I made this for our Mom's Night Out, which was held at my house, and this recipe was out of this WORLD! I love Greek, who doesn't? I have to say that this recipe really wowed and impressed the other moms. I made it EXACTLY as it is written, and I wouldn't change a thing! This was so easy to do, I'm making this a regular recipe in my repertoire. Thank you soooo much Abby!

This recipe has become a staple in my household. I've tried it with pork and chicken and both are just as tasty. When it is too cold outside to grill, I throw all of it in a saute' and serve with rice.

lovely. Not as flavorful as I had anticipated, and I followed it exactly (except for not grilling - had to use the oven). However, I served them with the pita recipe from this site as well as the tzaziki (sp?)sauce. Turned our delicious, but could have been more flavorful.

DELICIOUS! This marinade produced succulent, tender pork tenderloins. I didn't cube the pork, I wanted to grill these whole over indirect heat. I did double the marinade because I wanted to be sure there was enough to cover the tenderloins. I marinated these for 8 hours. I received so many compliments on this simple dish. I can't wait to try this using the skewers. For such a few simple ingredients, this is just perfect! I highly recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing :)

The souvlaki turned out very tender, but as others have said, it was a little salty.  I think next time I will cut back on the soy sauce and add some red wine vinegar.  I added more garlic than called so it was nice and garlicky.

This was perfect as is.  I cooked it in the broiler and the juice was the best! Grilling would have lost all the good juice so I will stick with the broiler from now on.

This recipes is great.  I added a few dollops of sesame oil and used one slice of red onion between each piece of pork, which really gave it a great flavor.

Excellent marinade! Great flavor for grilled pork. I do not make it on skewers and have not made it with the onions and peppers. I have a grill plate for my grill and toss the pieces of pork on that and they grill up fast! Great with the greek potatoes from this site!

Sorry, not for us.  Perhaps I've been spoiled.  I was fortunate enough to go to Greece, plus live in a community state side that had numerous Greece restaurants ran by Greeks.   This isn't what Souvlaki tastes like.

There is a very important point left out in this recipe. If you are using wooden skewers, soak them for 1 hour in water, this prevents the wood from burning on the grill

I've meant to comment on this recipe before I found it last summer and make it quite often. Just delicious. We love it. I follow the recipe to the tee except I add more onion. I like the flavor the have after marinating and then grilling. A great dish.

I made this last night exactly as written and it was fantastic. I cooked the pork, pepper, and onions in a stir-fry basket on the grill since I didn't have any skewers and it turned out moist and tender. Served on warm pitas with tzaziki sauce, accompanied by white rice and a Greek salad. Very very easy and tasty, will definitely become a summer staple in my family.

This is one of my favorites!  Made it again last night and served with pita bread and bean sprouts and homemade tzatziki sauce.  This is so easy and the flavor is wonderful.  If you don't want to use soy sauce just increase the oil and lemon juice a little and add a few pinches of salt.  Perfection!

This was just so delicious....I hardly ever do pork on the grill for fear of it drying out and not being tasty enough. Well this recipe is excellent...marinated the meat for over 24 hours. It was soooo flavorful and moist. Will most definately make again, family loved this as well! Thanks!

I was put off by this one because of the soy sauce, but after I read the reviews I dropped the soy sauce and added a little white wine instead. I should have added a little more salt but I forgot. I won't next time.
I lived in a suburb of Athens when my husband was still active duty Air Force and this souvlaki brought back all kinds of pleasant memories. It smelled wonderful while grilling and tasted wonderful. My husband thought so too. I made my own recipe of tzakiki and had some fresh French bread (which isn't quite as good as bread from a neighborhood Greek bakery but you take what you can get in Texas. Thanks so much for this recipe. I will definitely make this again!!

Made this for company and it worked first time. Added large mushrooms to kebabs. I marinated the meat for three hours. I felt that the meat was tough, but that was not the fault of the recipe. Since it is pork, I wanted to make sure the meat was done. I might try beef next time. Will make again for sure. I paired these kebabs with a fresh nectarine salsa.

I find this dish is better when you omit the soy sauce.  Maybe becauce soy sauce is not a traditional ingredient (that I know of) in a souvlaki, so I am not used to the soy flavor.  I substitute the soy for white wine (not a cooking wine), and add a little kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Don't leave out the oregano, it's a vital ingredient in souvlaki, and really gives it a lot of flavor!  And be sure to marinate...the longer you do, the more tender the meat.  This recipe also works well with chicken, lamb, and beef.

Very easy to make. Very tasty. I intended to marinate these for a couple of hours. However, we got invited to a last minute dinner and my prepared meat got thrown in the fridge overnight. SO MUCH BETTER. This was great with a tzatziki sauce recipe that we found on this site. Yum!

My husband and I thought this was great!  Our children enjoyed it too.  I followed the recipe just as stated, except my pork loin was only 2.88 pounds.  That was perfect for our family of 5 with a little left over.  I also used red onions instead of yellow.  My husband grilled these on our Webber charcoal grill (in the cold!!) but I couldn't imagine them any other way!  Excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly except I stir fried the pork instead of grilling it.  It was very good - even leftover and made into a wrap.  It was very easy and I will make it again.  I gave it a four because it could have used a little more flavor.

The soy sauce detracted from this recipe.  But, it did add the necessary amount of sodium.  You could probably replace salt for the soy sauce.

This is easy and excellent.  My kids are picky and they loved it.  I was too lazy to skewer them so I just put it all in the fry pan.

Tonight we're having it again.  This time, I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 tsp of balsamic vinegar to the half I plan to freeze in the marinade.  The balsamic should break down the fatty pieces of the tenderloin I bought.  We'll see how that goes in a week or two.

This was so good and even better--so easy!  I served it with a greek salad with olives and feta and made some tzatziki sauce from the site and it was to die for!!  The ONLY tiny thing I would have changed is to have added just a pinch of salt to the marinade; a little bland for my taste, but that's it!!

We made these a few nights ago and they were great. I was late so the marinating time was only about 45 minutes, but they still had a lot of flavor.  I also baked them in the oven since it was snowing like crazy out.  I will definitely make these again with pork or chicken and toss them on the grill when the weather permits.  I took the advice of another cook and made the Tzatziki recipe from Dinah and it was wonderful with the pork.  These are simple and healthy with lots of flavor.  I highly recommend this one, it’s a keeper.

I was trying to find something different to do with pork tenderloin ('cause I don't like pork). I tried this recipe exactly and my whole family loved it. I had enough skewers made up to invite our best friends as well and they commented on how good dinner was. The best part was the cleanup and the fact that it really did look like a gourmet meal.  I will, for sure, make this for my summer backyard barbeque with my friends.  Thanks for a great recipe.

FANTASTIC! What a delicious and enjoyable meal. I used chicken instead of pork and doubled the marinade for 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I put all ingredients in a gallon ziploc and marinated overnight. So tasty. Next time I will heat marinade and add back over grilled chicken to make it extra saucy although my chicken was very moist and juicy. I made the tzatziki I sauce and added grated cucumber. Served with warm Greek bread and a Greek salad. Also had rice pilaf with toasted almonds. My husband said it was better than eating out. Threw the whole meal together in minutes as the chicken was already in marinade. I am serving leftover chicken diced over greek salad for lunch tomorrow. All three kids gobbled it up too! This one is a keeper!

Came out ok. Served up the brochettes (pork, green pepper, onion) in pitas with a tzatiki (spelling probably wrong) sauce made with yogurt instead of sour cream. Very messy but very good. As it was 10C outside, I chose do do them under the broiler (10-15min). Watch them and turn them and they'll come out scrumptious.

Excellent.  I swapped red peppers for the green (because I prefer them) and added mushrooms (awesome).  I didn't feel like making skewers so I simply grilled everything in a grill basket, and went back to stir everything up twice to ensure it was cooked on all sides.  Super easy recipe made with ingredients always on hand.  Tastes great on its own but making some homemade tzatziki to dip it in (also super easy) elevates this even more.

Excellent, excellent meal.  After my husband's first bite he exclaimed "very good marinade; VERY, VERY GOOD marinade!"  A tip if you're using bottled lemon juice - just match the measurement of the soy sauce or olive oil (2 Tbsp soy sauce = 2 Tbsp lemon juice).  A must try!  
PS. I will say that when I put the meat and onions on a pita with tzatziki sauce, it really took away from the flavor of the kabab. 
UPDATE: Made this recipe a second time and served it with pita chips.  This recipe is one of our new favorite dinners!

This marinade is phenomenal.  I made it recently but was a bit skeptical about the amount of soy sauce in the recipe.  But wow!  I marinated the pork and chicken over night and it was just delicious.  I used it for chicken breasts recently and i doubled the lemon (to 2 lemons) and it was absolutely AMAZING.

Don't let the soy sauce fool you, this recipe is AMAZING.  Make sure you get proper soy sauce though, the cheap stuff will make it tastes like cheap chinese food.  Pearl River Bridge, or Lee Kum Kee LIGHT (refers to the colour) soy sauce are my top recommended brands.  Kikkoman will do also since it's available at most grocery stores without having to go to the Chinese grocer.  Never, EVER buy VH or Mr. Goudas or generic brands of Soya Sauce.

I didn't mean to review Soy Sauces but success of this recipe is so dependent on it!

I love Souvlaki but never made it before at home. After purchasing some Tzatziki dip that was being featured at Costco, I decided to make some. After researching the web for marinade recipes, I was struck by how similar it was to Cuban "Mojo" marinade which you can buy at most groceries in the Latin section. The basic incredients where all there...garlic, onion, oregano, citrus, olive oil, salt, pepper, etc. I had a bottle of Mojo so I gave it a try. I cut center cut pork loins into 3/4" cubes then marinaded them in the Mojo and grilled them on the gas grill. I served them with pita, tzatziki sauce and a tomato, cucumber and feta salad. Best Souvaliki I have ever had!

This is one of my families favorite dinners. I have cooked it on the grill both inside and outside. I have also cooked it in batches in a skillet (without skewers).

I followed this recipe exactly and we absolutely loved it. The meat was tender, and very flavorful. I marinated it for a little over 3 hours, and then grilled it on the barbecue.  We served it with Jasmine rice and Tzatziki Sauce using the "Tzatziki Sauce I" recipe on this site. We couldn’t have asked for a better meal. This is a keeper!

Delicious but I marinated the meat overnight and served with tzatziki sauce over it and rice. Used leftover tzatziki for dipping with pita. A huge hit with the in-laws.

This recipe is a 'keeper'!! I rarely cook with pork, but the pork turned out tender and juicy and oh so flavourful. I highly reccommend cooking on the barbeque for best flavour.

I didn't use any peppers, cause I didn't have them, I cut up the onions quite finely, and I used a thick cut pork chop cut up.  Marinated it for about 5-6 hours and cooked them on my grill on top of my stove.  Very tender meat and very flavorable.  Cooked the small pieces of onion alongside the meat and served them inside pitas with lettuce and tzaziki sauce.  This was SO good! Thanks for sharing.

Really yummy! I used the marinade recipe on a whole pork tenderloin and grilled it whole. I forgot the soy sauce, but, I added a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar and that gave a nice kick. I also added a couple shakes of Greek seasoning, red pepper flakes and garlic powder. Mmmm...Thanks!

My whole family loves this. Not only do we make it on skewers, but sometimes I just marinade whole pork chops or chicken breasts and then grill. I even fill freezer bags with meat and marinade then freeze. The meat takes in the flavours as it freezes and thaws. This is one of my all time favourite recipes.

YUMMY! I used red and orange peppers and didn't marinate the onions, I was afraid they'd make everything taste like onion, other than that I followed the recipe faithfully.  I marinated the meat and veggies separately for about 2 hours then skewered them and put them on an indoor grill and it turned out great! A little bit of rice with lemon, tomato and feta as a side dish and some tzatziki to dip it in and it was fabulous! Now I no longer have to go out to eat to have good souvlaki! Thanks so much for the great recipe! Oh I also used red, not yellow onion :)

Oh my God!  This is such a good recipe!  I don't know how anyone could rate it 4 stars!  I used the marinade with chicken and let it sit for about 8 hours.  When making the marinade, I used twice the amount of olive oil, lemon and garlic.  I also made a Village Greek Salad to accompany it.  When the skewers were all barbequed (about 20-25 min with chicken), we threw some pita bread on the BBQ and then emptied the skewers into the pita and added tsaziki sauce.... making them chicken souvlaki wraps.  They were to die for!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! :)  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Not that this recipe needs another glowing review, but WOW! I live in a famous Greek area of my city and I have never had souvlaki as good as this. It is always over-cooked, tough and dried out. This souvlaki was so tender and flavourful, to say we loved it would be an understatement. This recipe will be made over and over for the rest of my life! I am going to try it with chicken and lamb, too, but I think the pork will always be my favourite. The heavenly aroma from the marinade was just incredible! But I have to admit to a small change to the marinade recipe... I had to double all marinade ingredients EXCEPT I kept the soy sauce at 1/4 cup, so as not to overpower the lemon and oregano. I also threw in some fresh oregano with the dried, as I had an abundance of it in my herb garden. And be sure to use fresh lemon juice...it really does make a difference. I combined it all in a giant ziploc bag and refrigerated it for about 5 hours. OUTSTANDING! Thank-you, Abby, for the best recipe ever!

I made this recipe for my husband's family, who are GREEK - fisr generation from Greece. They all loved it, and asked me for the recipe. A few weeks later at another family party, they used the recipe and I was told that "Now everyone in the family uses this recipe for souvlaki". The chicken was very moist, not dry at all. I soaked my skewars in water, and marinated the chicken & pork & veggies(in 3 separate glass bowls) overnight. I used the recipe exactly as stated, I wouldn't change a thing!

This was pretty good.  I used the marinade for pork chops and cooked them on a stove top grill pan.  Very tasty served with Tzatziki sauce, greek salad and rice pilaf.  Next time, I may use slightly less soy sauce and a bit more garlic.  Can't wait to try this with chicken!

Instead of using pork tenderloin as the recipe calls for, I used 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts (the full amount of marinade was used).  I marinated the meat for about 4 hours and it was excellent!!  I have to admit that I had my doubts about this recipe for souvlaki when the recipe called for soy sauce to be added to the marinade (and I did use light soy), but it was really tasty.  The meat came out very tender and delicious, I served it with Burnt Butter Rice (also found on this site), it was an excellent combination of flavours!

EXCELLENT marinade.  The soy sauce is the key I think.  It's not traditional (garlic really isn't either) but it WORKS. (PS, I live in Greece.)

This is probably some of the best pork I have ever eaten.  I was concerned that we wouldn't be having "authentic" souvlaki without using lamb, but this was fabulous.  I omitted the green bell peppers from the recipe and only used 1 onion, as we only had 2 lbs. of meat.  I was concerned about the use of soy sauce in the marinade (not a big soy sauce fan), but it added just the right amount of saltiness.  We used cut-up center cut pork chops and grilled the kebabs - the meat was so tender it was almost falling off the skewers.  Served it in grilled pitas with sliced tomatoes and a tzatziki sauce found on this site - deeelish!

This was fabulous, very easy. Its better then restaurants or any other recipes I've tried for souvlaki. I marinated for 24 hrs. I also baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 min. Will definately do on the bbq when it thaws out up here. A definate keeper. Thank you for sharing Abby.

Mmmm Mmmmm good! Yummy way to cook pork. We couldn't grill them so my husband broiled them in our oven but they were still delicious. Terrific dinner for the summer, goes well with rice.

Although we found it to be a bit salty, it makes  delicious, tender, and flavorful grilled pork. The lemon gives a nice hint of something different. We used with regular loin pork chops, and only had time to marinate 2 hours. Great!

This is the best souvlaki recipe I have ever made. It has become a family favourite and great to serve large groups at the cottage.  I use a boneless pork loin roast instead of tenderloin when I am serving to a large group.  Thanks for the receipe it is a keeper.

Tasty dish, I served on rice pilaf. I over cooked the pork by accident and it came out a little dry, but very good flavor.  I'll try again.

This recipe is great. I used red peppers and sauted the onion and red peppers slightly before sliding onto the skewers with the pork. Use plenty of lemon.

Perfect recipe. Cooking time was right on, with a slight charred exterior, and tender and flavorful inside. I served over parsleyed white rice, which worked well. I made the Tskaki sauce on here to accompany, which was fabulous. Thank you for such a great new way to cook pork chops!

Excellent marinade.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the soy sauce.  Marinated overnight.  The meat was tender, the marinade subtle. I marinated both pork and chicken. I can't say which was better...they were both delicious. I will use this as my base going forward.

This is a full-proof recipe.  I started late, got the marinade and vegetables prepared, then realized the meat was still frozen.  I cut the meat up into 1-2" pieces, then finished defrosting them in the crock pot, along with the marinade and veggies.  After an hour or so, I put everything in a glass roasting pan and baked it, as others suggested, at 425 degrees for 25 minutes.  I then broiled it for 5 minutes or so.  My cooking reputation is not good, and after what I considered a fiasco, I was very surprised that the meat still turned out so good.

I wasn't sure about the soya sauce in  a Greek recipe, so since I was making both chicken and pork anyway, I did add the soya sauce to the chicken but not to the pork. The family consensus was that the chicken tasted better. It did not have a soya sauce taste at all, but the flavour was very good.  But I want to be clear, the pork was still very good. I had extra meat after making skewers so I  baked it, covered for 45 min. I'll report on how it is next day, tomorrow!

I used yellow & red bell peppers instead of green due to personal taste, but, other than that prepared exactly as the recipe stated.   The pork was perfectly tender and had a lot of flavor.  I served on Mediterranean pita bread with Tzatziki sauce.

I did what other reviewers have suggested and just poured the whole bowl of meat and marinade into a pan and baked it. The flavor was good - I think next time I'll marinade longer.

I made this and it turned out delicious! My husband said it was the best meal I had made yet.  I did not kabob it.  I cut everything up and put in on a baking sheet and cooked it on convection bake in my oven.
It cooked tender and juicy and got nice and browned. 
I baked some pita pockets and filled them with the ingredients and topped with homemade tatziki sauce.  I also did not use but a few dashes of soy and not what the recipe called for.  The soy is way to overwhelming if you use much more than a dash.

Wow! I was looking for something to make with what I had on hand and this was amazing. I grilled it outside and used a small tenderloin I had. Next time I will make with tzatki sauce. This is a keeper.

Yeah!  A dish we all liked!  I have a vampire (anti-garlic and onion husband), so I reduced it to 2 cloves and didn't do the onion and it still had plenty of flavor for me bu not too overpowering for him.  :-)

I loved this recipe! I used lamb instead of the pork called for in the recipe. I think this really enhanced the flavor, but some people don't like lamb.It was a bit of a pain to cut up a leg of lamb, but it was well worth it.

Omitted the soy sauce.  That's not Greek.  Marinated for 5 hours and it could have benefited from a little more lemon juice and salt and pepper, which I added while cooking.  Other than that, when paired with the tzatziki sauce this was something I could not stop eating.  Very good.

Great recipe that the whole family loved. Next time I think we'll half the recipe as it made allot. The plus side is that the pork also goes great either warm or cold on a greek style salad. Will definitely make again.

Another recipe the family loved. I skipped the oregano (not a fan) and used Greek seasoning. Will likely use more seasoning next time, just to get a bit more Greek feel to it. I doubled the sauce, as others suggested, then baked it at 350 for 40 minutes. Ah, now, on the second go around. I did add more Greek seasoning, as well as more garlic. This time, I did the bake/broil method another reviewer suggested. 400 degrees for 15 min., then 7 1/2 minutes on broil. Some tzatziki and pitas, or as a salad (used the Greek House Dressing from this site) and they fought over it.

I made this up when I was pregnant and looking to stock the freezer. Assembled everything except the peppers & put it all in a freezer bag. When I cooked it, I added the peppers & baked it in the oven per another reviewer's instructions.  It was phenomenal!

This is a very good recipe, I used to work at a Greek restaurant years ago and this is just as I remember.  I have used it with pork and beef, I also tried it with chicken but did not like it as well as the pork and beef.

I have tried this as a marinade AND as a pan-cooked meal, BOTH are unbelievably delicious! It works with pork or chicken and is a favorite in my house and with my guests!

FANTASTIC. This recipe is fabulous! I used chicken instead of pork, omitting the onions & peppers and pan-fried it instead of skewering. I did 4 chicken breasts, but only 2 made it to the table as we kept 'trying' pieces. Served with a salad and rice. Have now made this recipe 10 times. Love it. Thank you!!

I did chicken instead of pork, and then accidentally subbed oregano with sweet basil instead (oops)..still good! Also, baked in oven at 350* covered with Al for about 15-20min ..didn't bother with skewers.  Came out tender, juicy, and DELICIOUS!

This recipe is excellent and far better than "authentic" souvlaki.  Great on chicken or pork, in the oven or on the grill.  I usually double the marinade and add zucchini and mushrooms.  Serve with couscous, a greek salad and the Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce from this site.  Outstanding!

This recipe was so tasty, absolutely delicious on the BBQ. My husband loved it and my mother asked me to make it for our family reunion! I even loved it and I'm far from a pork lover. The pork was so tender after marinating that it fell off the skewers, and the taste was wonderful. 5 stars for sure! This one went in my favourites list.

this is a fantastic and very simple recipe. i make souvlaki twice a month now. the only thing i would add to the instructions is to soak the wooden skewers for a while before using them so they dont burn as quickly on the bbq. yummy yummy yummy.

This was good, but even as I was eating it I wondered about all the raving reviews. I used a 2 pound tenderloin with 1 onion and 1 green pepper, but I kept the amount of sauce the same. I put it all in a casserole and stuck it in the fridge for about 3 hours, then baked at 400 for about 20 minutes (we don't have a grill). The meat tasted good, but the flavors weren't that strong-and I don't think it tasted anything like souvlaki :P It was tasty, though, and easy-I'm sure I'll make it again.

So good! I used chicken thighs instead of pork and it came out so good.  The smell of this grilling was making my mouth water.  

I too served it with a tsatiki sauce.  Next time I'm going to make sure I have pita bread on hand as well.

My husband made this in the oven and it was delish!! He seared the meat, then put it in a pan, poured in the liquid mixture and put the peppers and onions on top of the meat, covered it with foil and cooked it at 350 degrees for the first hour, then 250 degrees for 2 more hours. Superb!!

I made this with chicken and while it was good it wasn't the souvlaki I'm used to. I marinated this overnight and it still wasn't as garlicky as I'd like. I would at least double the garlic and increase the oregano to achieve the flavor of souvlaki at greek restaurant's I've been to. I didn't skewer this either; had my hubby just basket grill on the barbeque. Veggies were delish but still missed strong flavor in the meat...

Very good recipe! Let the veggies & poker marinate for about 4 hours and grilled to perfection, meat was so tender it fell right off the skewers. Takes some work making the skewers but was worth it.

it was ok. I have my tastebuds set on eating a traditional tasting souvlaki but this did not really taste like what you would get in a restaurant at all. I think the soy sauce throws it way off. The rest of the family liked them but they werent anticipating any particular taste either. i have moved on and looking for a better marinade recipe instead

Excellent marinade for pork tenderloin and also works wonderfully on boneless chicken as well.  Instead of serving it as a kabob we grilled just the meat on skewer and served in a pita with sauteed mushroom and onions, cheese and a variety of sauces depending on people's taste (ranch, tzatziki, mayo etc).

So good, so easy!  A full batch was too much for my family so I put half of the batch in a ziplock bag for another day, and everyone liked the second batch better, so I'd say marinate longer if you can.

I only used the marinade from this recipe for some pork chops with Tzatziki Sauce.  Per the suggestion of a Greek reviewer I left the soy sauce out and it was delicious.  Will try the entire recipe sometime.  A keeper!

We've made a recipe very very similar to this for years. I found it in Jeff Smith's Frugal Gourmet cookbook. Yes, I know, soy sauce in a greek recipe? Sounds strange but it tastes great. Serve it with homemade tzatziki, a nice tomato and feta salad and rice. Very yummy

Very tender and juicy.  I'm not a big fan of pork but this recipe was fabulous.  I should note that I omitted the soy sauce as it didn't quite seem like it belonged. Update:  Made with chicken this time and did use low sodium soy sauce.  Turned out great.

This was delicious!  The pork tasted great.  I didn't have enough time to marinate the meat as long as I wanted to but even so the flavor was amazing.  BF wasn't too sure about Greek night but he ended up asking for more!!  I will be making this again.

I took a pork roast and cut it into strips then marinated as per the recipe. (only had about two hours to marinate)  I did not skewer but rather laid the strips on the barbeque and flipped them after a couple of minutes.  There was my husband and I for supper as well as our son-in-law and 2 granddaughter, 10 months and 2 1/2.   The youngest eats anything and this was not an exception however the two year old did not want to eat it.  We told her she had to eat two of the pieces that were cut up on her plate - not only did she eat these but finished up the rest! My husband and son-in-law also enjoyed it.   The pork was very tender and oh so flavorful.  A real keeper.  Thanks for a great, easy meal.  Served with Oven Roasted Greek Potatoes - recipe from this site.  Great combo that use many of the same ingredients

Made this tonight for my 5 year old and my Fiance who is from Greece. I'm just beginning to like greek food and felt this was the safest one to try to make myself. Despite the remark from the previous poster the soy sauce added enough of a flaver to keep it from being too dry like i've had Souvlaki in the past. My Fiance really liked it and was very impressed even my 5 year old who hardly eats a thing cleared his plate so thanks for the great recipe!

This was a hit in my house! I made double the recipe so I could freeze it for quick meals during the school year, not knowing if we would even like it or not. My daughter, who is a very fussy eater gobbled it up. I left mine in the fridge overnight marinating and it was extremely tender. Served it with grilled pita bread, tzatiki and salad. Definitely a keeper!

I first tried this recipe when I was looking for something to do with a pork loin - i grew up jewish and we never cooked pork!  I tried this for something different and my husband devoured it like i'd never seen . . . he finally stopped eating long enough to tell me that he used to go to a little hole-in-the-wall place in canada, almost weekly, just to order their souvlaki, and this tasted EXACTLY like it!    For a long time, my youngest got excited whenever he saw the 'meat on a stick', and actually called it 'yummy meat'.  Due to allergies, I have reworked this to use chicken and leave out the garlic, and we still love it - thanks!  (but we do sub half the soy w more lemon, to reduce the salt)

I loved these.  Marinated the meat in one bag and veggies in the other all day.  Skewered right before grilling.  Very good flavor.  I used low sodium soy as I always do so we didn't find then too salty as others had mentioned.  Also, used orange and red peppers as that is what I had on hand.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe

DELICIOUS!  I will make this over and over again.  I followed the recipe for the marinade to the letter, and it was amazing.  The soy sauce is barely noticeable.  It just adds a bit of saltiness.  I broiled these in the oven for about 10-15 minutes and served it with Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce found on this site.  Incredible combo.  A must try.

Wonderful!!  I did make a few changes.  For the sake of time I wanted to cook in the slow cooker.  I put 2 pork tenderlions (about total 3 lbs) in the slow cooker with the marinade the night before and cooked it on low for 4 hours and 50 mins.  It was tender and had great taste.  I also used less sodium soy sauce.  I served with some Tzatziki sauce and it was fantastic!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! The marinade is great on almost everything. The first time we made this, we followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I really didn't have the time to skewer so we just marinaded some boneless pork chops and grilled 'em up...They were so GOOD!

I made this and used the broiler.  (Grill is closed this time of year!)  It was good, but I'm going to wait until summer to make it again as I think grilling would be a better choice.  Nice served with white rice and a Greek salad.

Tastey and good for you!  My husband who claims to hate green peppers even ate those!  I prepared this exactly as written.  Cooked it on the GF grill (since Iowa winters are SO cold).  Delish.  Served it with rice pilaf as suggested.  The souvlaki is only 5 Weight Watcher points/serving!

This is much better without the soy and add a little dried mint and possibly some wine to the marinade to make it taste more "Greek"

This was really good. I added mushrooms, and forgot skewers so I had to cook on the stove. Used Greek Tzatziki recipe from this site and added cucumbers and was great! Next time I'll try it with the pork intead of beef for stew. Yum! Thanks!

Wonderful flavor that the whole family enjoyed including our pickiest (burger, pizza) eater. 5 stars are only given to those dishes which are truly amazing. Having said that I will be making this again.

The only changes I made was to use 3 lbs of pork, and to include 1 red pepper, mushrooms and 2 yellow squash. Served with roasted potatoes and garlic green beans (recipes on this site).

Tasty, I added a little more lemon juice and a little less oregano. I will be making again with beef and chicken.

Hey, it's not traditional but it's tasty. The only reason it didn't get five stars is because I'm still looking for the perfect, authentic souvlaki recipe. This is still pretty tasty and if you make a good recipe of tzatziki to go along with it you won't be disappointed.

I messed up on this recipe and let it sit too long (with substituted balsamic vinegar!).  I might try again another time...

Great recipe!  I made mine with Chicken - bf doesn't like pork.  Served with Greek Tzatziki by Leelee Cooks and Greek Orzo Salad by Patrice.

I lived in Greece for awhile and have to say, this recipe brought back some wonderful memories! If I've got them, I throw some cherry tomatoes on the skewer just for another added taste (not as authentic but tasty all the same). I serve the souvlaki in a pita with homemade tzitziki sauce and it's delightful! Have served this to company and gotten rave reviews!

This is one of the best recipes that I've tried given the time/quality ratio. Everyone loves this meal, and it requires so little effort!  I use red peppers, and lots of extra onions. Purple onions instead of yellow is my family's preference by far.

This was the best marinade ever!  My husband and daughter had a fit over it and begged me to make it the very next night! The first time I made it with chicken, but had to bake it because it was raining outside (I just left it in the marinade and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes).  Two days later we tried it with pork and as luck would have it, it rained again!  Nevertheless, this was great and will be used again and again.

This was super easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I used half to make the recipe on skewers cooked on the grill.  The next day I cooked the remainder on the stove top and was equally yummy!

This was GREAT!  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and did not use the soy sauce. Instead I used about 1/2 tsp of sea salt.  The flavors of the lemon and the olive oil were just exquisite - a definite keeper!

This was just average for us.  I didn't make any changes, as we wanted to try it as it was written.  It wasn't bad...it wasn't bland.  It just wasn't more than average.  I've been trying new marinades lately and this one probably won't make it into regular rotation.  Sorry!

Wow! Deserving of all 5 stars (IMHO). Made this tonight for a quick dinner. Preparation was a breeze. Marinated pork and veggies for 2 hours. I made enough marinade for the full recipe, but cubed a 1.25 lb. pork tenderloin (enough for 4 servings). Made 4 skewers. Broiled about 10 minutes total, turning every 2.5 minutes. The only substitution I made was to add minced garlic rather than crushed garlic to the marinade (when I reached for the fresh stuff, I realized that it was past it's prime...). Served with rice pilaf and wish I would have also made some taziki sauce for dipping (but these are great without)! My bf loved the onions especially and told me that I could have just marinated onions and grilled them and he'd be happy! Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This was FANTASTIC! The pork was so tender and flavorful. You could of cut it with a fork.  I served with saffron crispy rice and corn on the cob.  Need I say more??

Delicous!  I used the sauce to marinate pork chops for 3-4 hrs.  For me, I could definitely taste the lemon juice and oregano, which I loved!  I used teriyaki marinade sauce instead of the soy sauce to cut back on a salty taste.  Worth making again :)

Used this on pork tenderloin, but left the tenderloin whole instead of cutting it up.  Let marinade for a couple of days before grilling.  It smelled and tasted so good.

Ok, i followed this recipe to a T but at the end I got lazy. I was engrossed in a movie i was watching and got hungry so i browned the meat and veggies a little bit in a frying pan for a bit, then i put it in the oven for a little while instead of grilling.. I can just imagine how delicious this recipe is when done on the grill as written, even done in the oven it had a great flavor, i loved it and will definately make it again.

Yum-O!!  I made this with the tzatziki sauce as recommended--it was the perfect creamy match for the grilled pork that was perfectly seasoned and seared.  Thanks for a winner!  Very easy too!

Soooooooooooooo good!  Wasn't sure how the pork tenderloin could taste as good as the lamb but it was awesome.  Next time I will definitely double the sauce as some reviewers suggested.  I also pan sauteed the meat and the sauce coated it nicely.  Make sure you don't over cook the pork.  Also made the cucumber sauce from this site and the greek salad.  Such a great meal!  Have already shared the recipe with 2 other friends.

This was a fantastic recipe- I used only two pounds of pork tenderloin, and used five peppers in a near rainbow of colors.  Aside from that, I kept to the recipe and really loved the addition of soy sauce- though not exactly authentic, it really helped the pork keep it's juiciness! 

I think next time, I'll definitely add a few more greek herbs and spices for added flavor! :)

Yummy!  Reminded me of Gyros.  Marinated meat had a really good flavor.  I used pork tenderloin and it was  perfect.  I prepped everything the nite before and marinated everything after I got home from work the next day.  I didnt cook them on skewers, but instead, a grill basket I have.  That was so much easier and not messy either!  I served it on pitas and topped it with Tzatziki Sauce(yogurt and cucumber dip from this site) and tomatoes.  We both really enjoyed this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a big hit.  I didn't have time to marinade the meat for very long.  I will do so next time.  I was a little nervous with the soy sauce, but this dish was great.  I served it with Oven Roasted Greek Potatoes and Greek Green Beans from this site.  Also some store bought pita bread.  Dinner was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm trying to watch my salt intake, so I substituted white wine for the soy.  WOW! So very easy, good and versatile.  I marinated a couple of hours..could have used more, but I was worried about the lemon juice cooking the pork.  I would say I'll marinate for 4-6 hours next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

I used boneless pork chops that were on sale, cut them up and marinated.  With the prices at the grocery store pork loin was out of the question!  Pork chops did beautifully.  Great recipe, everyone raved on and on.

Delicious. Served with Tzatziki sauce from this site along with some rice.

Didn't have a grill, so instead I cooked in the oven at 325-350 degrees for 35-40 minutes. The sauce/juices that seep to the bottom of the pan make the bottom a bit soft and fatty, so I wiped off the skewers and put them on a non-stick grille pan on high heat for just a couple minutes to sear the bottom nice and crisp. Turned out great, but I'm sure an actual grill would've done this recipe more justice. Perhaps even a grate/grill surface placed over the baking pan (so the juices could seep down and away from the skewers), would've been better. Regardless, it still turned out fantastic.

Halved the recipe, and instead of a second green bell pepper I used whitecap   mushrooms (large onces) sliced in half so that they were nice and thick.

I think this is what food in Heaven tastes like.  I loved the mix of flavors in this recipe.  I marinated it for about 3 hours but I also doubled the sauce and had less meat then the recipe called for.  The only other change I made was that I added Kosher salt to the recipe.  I am addicted to Allrecipes and I think this is one of the better recipes I've found on this site.  Will definitely make this again.

Thanks!

I wish I had known about this recipe before!!  I have been trying a great deal of recipes lately and this is by far my favorite.  I doubled the marinade (and let them sit in the fridge for about 6 hours) and then baked the kabobs on bamboo skewers in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes.  I served the Souvlaki with homemade pitas and Tzatziki also from this site.  My husband was VERY impressed--which always makes me smile.  :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

That was amazing! I don't need to go to a Greek restaurant to enjoy excellent souvlakis anymore! I tried it with pork tenderloin and with chicken breasts and OMG! You HAVE to try this. It's a keeper.

Delicious!  I doubled the marinade and used half for peppers, onions, and zucchini.  I let both marinate overnight, the meat and veggies were great.  Will definitely make this a house favorite.

These were delicious.  The fragrance was wonderful from the start.  My guests were late arriving, so I marinated a little longer than the 2-3 hours recommended, and think that was a plus.  The only suggestion I have is to remind users that salt will help this dish quite a lot: it makes the lemon just jump out and provide such a nice harmony to the oregano. Thanks, JANICER8 for such a simple, beautiful recipe!

Soo yummmyy!!! I used 2 whole tenderloins, i dont know how much they weighed, they were the standard ones from costco. I doubled the marinade so that all the meat were covered.But next time, I'll def marinade it overnite. The flavors were wonderful, but it barely penetrated the insides of the meat. I baked it in my oven 400 for 25mins like other viewers said, and it was awesome. Leftovers taste even better the next day reheated. Served with a greek salad, and a good garlicky tzatziki and some couscous. Will try this on my new outdoor grill or other meats some time. Thanks!

So easy and so delicious!  We make this twice a month, at least, along with this site's Tzatiki sauce recipe. I have never really let it marinate for hours as suggested, I just make the marinade and as I'm cutting up the pieces I put it in the bowl.  The onion pieces are the hardest to skewer.  Still so worth it!!! :)  Delish.

This was awesome! The only things I did differently was to leave out oregano (it's too expensive to buy in the country where I live). It would probably have been nice to have it, but I don't. Still, it was delicious and tasted Greek! I also prepared the dish in a wok, cooking the meat first and then adding veggies toward the end. Served it with a cucumber yogurt sauce, but would have been just as good without. Absolutely delicious!

I'm always looking for new recipes for pork tenderloin as my family loves it.  We also love skewers, so this fit the bill perfectly!  I used bottled lemon juice (3 Tbsp), and threaded only the meat on the skewers.  I served it with green beans and rice pilaf and it was fantastic.  Very tender and full of flavor.  I will definitely do this again!

This is fabulous. Like many reviewers, I too was met with disappointment when I discovered my grill was out of gas as I went to light it. Found that several reviewers said 25 minutes at 400 in the oven.  Perfection! That's why I love this site. Great recipe and will make often.

This recipe is SOOOO good. I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I am so glad I tried it!! DELICIOUS! I followed the directions for the marinade and let the meat sit in it overnight. I completely forgot to marinate the veggies, so I just omitted them and grilled the meat on skewers. They came out wonderfully - tender and super flavorful. I served them with homemade tzatziki sauce and a big ole' greek salad. What a great meal!! This one is a keeper- THANKS!

this was super easy and very good.  I did add a few things. I used red onion instead of yellow just to give it a kick, used the juice of 2 lemons, not just one, and added 1 tsp. of dried dill leaves.  The combination was delish!
Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmm....so good. My husband loved this and he is a picky one to please! I made it just as stated-no adjustments-which is nice, and it came out perfectly, very tender too. Will be using this often and will try with other cuts and types of meat. Great recipe!

Everyone said the flavor was delicious, even though due to too much yapping, we neglected the souvlaki on the grill for too long and overcooked it a bit.  Also, I think I might double the marinade as it was hard to sufficient coat the kabobs.

This was great.  I am not much of a pork eater so next time I will try it with beef or chicken.  I made it with cucumber sauce (cant spell it) and we ate them as gyros. It was great.

This was amazing! I made it for a Christmas Eve dinner with a Greek theme there were no leftovers at all.  It was easy to make and when paired with rice pilaf and the greek salad, made a great dinner.  We will definitely use this recipe again when it gets warmer for a BBQ.

Outstanding!! I made mine with chicken and marinated most the day. My husband said on a scale of 1-10, he would give it a 20. I didnt marinate my onions but basted them with olive oil. Put them on seperate skewers and broiled all of it since it was raining outside and I was unable to use the grill. So good and definitely a keeper!

I tried this with Chicken and made Pita sandwiches out of it and my family loved it!!  Even the neighbor kid invited himself to eat with us.  I added dill dip, fresh feta cheese, raw onion, and wrapped it in warm Greek Style pita bread.  Great Recipe!!!

Very simple and easy, not to mention very tasty.  I left my pork to marinate for a day and a half.  Next time I'll try the same mixture with chicken.

Very nice recipe.  I threw this on my George Forman grill and the pork came out very tender and juicy.  I feel like it could use something more, but I don't know what.  I would try this again with some sort of sauce.

I made this for a crowd and everyone loved it! Instead of grilling on kabobs I slivered the peppers and meat and threw it all in a dutch oven then lightly browned. Terrific! The sauce was out of this world!

This is so great and easy.  I'm so lazy, I don't even bother to skewer it.  Instead I have a grill pan that I throw everything into.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it as a trial and we had guests over who raved about it.  It's very similar to the souvlaki at our local Greek Festival.  I made it with chicken and pork tenderloins.  Both were excellent.  I didn't want to start the outdoor grill, so I used my George Foreman and it worked great.  Still had a grilled flavor, but was very easy to clean up.  This one is a keeper!

This was a great marindae, though like some other reveiwers suggested, go light on the soy sauce. I'm not a big pork or lamb eater so i went with what i had in the firdge and used a VERY VERY cheap, not so lean steak. I cut the steak into EXTREMLEY thin sliced and then dropped them into the marinade to soak for a day. When i was ready to cook i just took the meat, and the marinade dumped it into a frying pan with some mushrooms, and then packed it all into a pita with some lettuce, tomato, onion, feta, and the tzahiki I recipe from this site. It was great! Thanks for such an awsome marinade!!

This is an excellent marinade that I use when I make a pork tenderloin which I cook in the oven with cut up peppers and onions. I serve it with a greek salad, flat bread, and tzatzik sauce.YUM!

i have waited and waited to try this dish for fear of disappointing myself. it turned out pretty close to the souvlaki we eat at a very expensive place. not bad, but may need a little more marinating time so the flavor would really stick. thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Too much of a lemon taste for me, it might be because I marinated it overnight.  But the pork was very tender and delicious.  I used a whole onion as well as three tri-color bell peppers.  I don't have a grill so I just cooked them in a skillet on medium heat for about 20 minutes and drained the juices.  

Goes great with the Tzatziki sauce I here on this site and some pita bread!

Absolutely delicious!!  I used sirloin steak instead of pork.  I followed what others said and reduced the soy sauce.  I added a little extra lemon and ground black pepper.

Good marinade for pork.  I did not used the onions and pepper and just cooked the pork chops whole rather than skewering them.  I also cut way down on the oil and let it marinade for 24 hours and the meat had so much flavor.  Will use this often since I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

I doubled this recipe for a board meeting.  I used a full double batch of the marinade on the pork and probably could have used more.  I made a single batch to marinate the vegetables separately and it seemed to be about right.  Instead of grilling skewers, I baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then broiled for 15, but the butcher cut my meat about three times too big, so this would likely be a bit long for the proper size pieces.  I then served it on flatouts with Tzatziki Sauce II from this site, crumbled feta, and chopped romas.  It was well-liked, but the meat was dry - I felt this was a combination of not enough marinade and the previously mentioned size problem.  Overall, a good recipe.

I will not have to visit a greek restaurant for my gyro anymore.  These kebobs were so good.  The marinade made the pork so tender.  I followed others' advice and marinated my veggies separately. Will make this one again and again.

Quick & easy. We will double the marinate because we didn't have enough for the meat & veggies. Since we like mushrooms, we're going to add them & eliminate the green peppers. Yellow & orange peppers are the best.

It was pretty good, but in my opinion not five star worthy.  We used chicken, so maybe it would be better with pork.  If I make it again I will make it with pork and may change my review at that time.

Really great recipe!  Whole family loved this pork! I served this with tzatziki sauce from this site and put it in pitas with tomatos and cucumbers.  The only change I made was to grill the meat on skewers without the peppers and onions.

Despite scaling the recipe down to 2 servings, I tripled the marinade. Used purple Bermuda onions instead of yellow onions. Served with Oregano Roasted Potatoes (on another website) & fried zucchinini. Thanks for sharing!

Substituted chicken breast for the pork. Other than that followed recipe as written. These had just the right amount of ingrediants. A little time consuming threading the skewers but well worth the effort. Optimo!

The first time I made this recipe, it went over so well, that I wasn't allowed to share left overs! So, 4 days after, I put together a family cookout and tripled the recipe!  I served on flat bread (like pita bread) and made a recipe from Emeril for Kicked Up Tzatziki sauce.  I received nothing but RAVES, from the youngest of 11 to 72.  The meat had a superior flavor and was  extremely tender.  For my personal liking, I  added some shredded lettuce and a little hot sauce.  Reminded everyone of the gyros we get to have once a year during a local festival.

Yum!  This marinade is divine, the only thing I changed was I used pork chops and added red pepper flakes (don't think it was noticeable though) and accidentally let the meat marinade for about three days.  Tasted awesome anyway and we'll have it again for sure.  Thanks!

I ended up marinating the pork for 2 days (too late to cook after golf!). I grilled it on medium heat and served it on warm pita with shaved onion, sliced summer tomato and tzataiki sauce sprinkled with feta. Pretty amazing. The only change I would make is doubling the marinade and tripling the garlic!

Before today I'd never had Souvlaki.  I can't believe what I've been missing!  This recipe was PERFECT.  It's a hot summer day and something off the grill was just what the day called for.  I halved the recipe and used a pound of thin cut pork chop and a pound of thin chx breast.  I doubled the marinade because it didn't seem like it would be enough.  I marinated the meat for about two hours, throwing the veggies in at the last minute.  I won't be playing with this recipe any more, it was perfect.  Plus, it yielded LOTS of leftovers, which I'm sure will go quickly!

Awesome! I ended up marinating this for about 18 hrs. I made it for Easter Sunday. I also baked chicken because I am the only lamb eater in the family. Once everyone took a taste of this so they could reaffirm their distaste for lamb they were shocked. Lamb isn't so bad now. Too bad eat you chicken! I said. Next time we will talk about lamb for everyone.
Your recipe rocks!

I love this recipe. I leave off the oregano. The taste is not overpowering, it's easy, and leaves meat tasty and tender. You can whip it up in no time and keep the sauce in the frig if you have some leftover. Excellent recipe. Definately a keeper

My picky husband gave this one high marks.  It's one of the few marinades made with soy sauce that doesn't taste like teriyaki.  At the last minute I decided to add a tablespoon of sour cream to make it a little thicker.  It turned out great.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe is incredible!  My kids love it too!  It really impressed my boyfriend when I made it as the first homecooked meal for him.  Served it with flatbread, greek salad and macaroons!  Great meal!  I make it heavy on the lemons/zest.

Very good. I did this under the broiler rather than on a grill. Flavor was very good, but some of the meat was a little dry. Not all, though - perhaps those pieces were just too small. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Sharon this recipe was fantastic! My husband and two sons loved it. They asked if we could have it again tomorrow. That's a first! I made two recipes of the marinade and put the veggies in one freezer bag and the meat in another. I marinated it for 24 hours. The meat was so tender that we didn't even have to use a knife.I served it with warm greek pita bread and tzatziki sauce. Thank you!

Wow this makes ALOT!  I used 2 lbs tenderloin and 2 chicken breast and I had enough for 5 plus plenty of leftovers.  Marinated for 24 hours in 3 separate Ziplocs (so I had to make a little extra marinade).  Received rave reviews - made the meat very tender and tasty.

Is there any way I could give this more stars??  I make about one and a half times the amount of marinade but double the amount of lemon (we like lemon).  I also marinate the meat separately from the vegetables so I can spoon a little of the extra sauce over rice without worrying.  If you must use bottled lemon juice, about 3 Tbsp. equal the juice from one medium lemon.

This is an excellent recipe, there's no doubt.  I too was a little leery of a souvlaki recipe with soy sauce, but I guess it is just a way of adding salt.  We used tamari sauce because we didn't have soy, and chicken breasts instead of pork (chicken souvlaki is one of my all-time faves).  I am too lazy to use real lemons, so I used lemon juice, but I wish someone could tell me how much an equivalent amount of lemon juice would be?!  I have experimented and it seems to the type of recipe that is very forgiving, you can adjust it, or screw it up totally, and still serve something decent. For instance, I forgot the oregano last night...ooops! My wife couldn't tell, she loved it even as it was.  I used our hamilton beach grill because we live in an apartment building.  Onions were omitted purpously. I used only half of our chicken last night, the other half has been marinating still, added the oregano this morning ;), can't wait for dinner.

This was excellent.  My husband and I and our 2 year old loved it.  My 3 and 7 year old would not try it though.  I used red and yellow peppers insead of green.  I marinated everything for 3 hours.  I would marinate longer next time for a stronger flavour.  I cooked my vegetables and meat on seperate skewers.  The veggies took only 5 - 10 minutes.  The pork took 15.

This was my first time making souvlaki, and I will definately make it again! I would not change a thing in this recipe! I did not have enough pork so I used two chicken breasts as well. I bet it would be good with lamb too! I thought 2 onions would be too much so I only used 1...that was mistake! I really needed those onions! I ended up making 14 skewers, but I could probably have squeezed everything onto 12. It's nice meal for 6. I served it with tzatziki sauce. YUMMM

I love souvlaki and was very excited to try this recipe. I made it with chicken, marinated it over night and added the peppers a couple hours before I grilled it and it came out better than I could have hoped.  I will definately make this again and again!  Now I don't have to pay top dollar at a Greek restraunt for souvlaki!  The only question I had was the lemon.  I used a lemon I had grown and it was rather large and juicy.  I think I may have had a little too much lemon, but it was still excellent.

VERY good, though will add juice from 2 lemons next time. The acid from the juice is what breaks down the meat fibers, making the meat tender and flavorful. I left the veggies out of the marinade.

I skewered green & red peppers, mushrooms and purple onions on seperate skewers, brushed with a mixture of balsamic vinegrette. I let them sit for approx. 1 hr prior to grilling. 

Served the Souvlaki with Tzatziki Sauce II from this site, grilled pita bread and rice pilaf. Everyone loved it!

Delicious! Easy to prepare in the morning and let marinade all day.  I used the pre-cut pieces of pork for "city chicken" that our butcher prepares.  On less messy step cutting the pork.  Will make again.

Excellent recipe Abby!!  All 4 of us gave this 2 thumbs up...and that's quite a compliment coming from my 2 little ones.  I used about 2 lbs of pork, left the marinade ingredients the same and let it sit for about 7 hours in the fridge.  They turned out soooo tender and the flavor was phenominal.  I highly recommend this one.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really good.  My husband and I were trying to decide if we liked this or the Grecian Pork Tenderloin (also from this site) better.  I like the meat equally, but I liked that we cooked veggies with it.  In addition to the green peppers and onions we also cooked red pepper and button mushrooms.  It was nice to have one less thing for me to do in the kitchen (I made some wild rice mixture) and we both love grilled veggies.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious and very easy to make.  No muss - no fuss.  The only thing I changed was, as others did, used more lemon and added minced garlic.  Threw the meat, veggies suggested plus cherry tomatoes into a plastic bag and let marinate. I could only marinate it for two hours and do suggest that you marinate it longer to get to enjoy more of the flavor. Wasn't able to grill - broiled it in a preheated broiler for 8 mins. on each side.  We don't like our pork well done (like our mother's had to cook it - tasted like shoe leather!).  I picked up chinese pork fried rice from the restaurant and served the kabobs over that.  Since I used the broiler I was able to capture the wonderful juices from the kabobs and spooned that over the top.  It's a pretty and easy dish to serve to company - you can have everything skewered beforehand and just pop it on the grill or broiler and dinner is done.  No pots and pans, etc. to deal with!  I love kabobs and this was different - it's a keeper.  Thanks Abby.

I used boneless sirloin and substituted onion powder for the oregano, due to family preference.  I also marinated vegetables separately in Italian dressing.

Very enjoyable. My husband and I  agreed tha the flavour was just like the Greek restaurants we use to go to.  The kids were not too crazy about it, but they ate it anyways.  I would make this again.

Easy to Make and Delicious!!!  I alternated Pork and Beef on the Kabobs!  I also marinated them for 2 days (not intentional).  I thought the marinade would overwelm the meet, but it didn't.  I also add tomato slices.  Definitely will make this recipe again!!

I've used this marinade a few times. Last time I marinated a whole pork roast. Put it in a zip lock bag and put it in the fridge for a few hours. Very tasty!!

i baked this, like another reviewer.  however, before it was served, i used my table top grill to "finish it off" so it would have grilled flavor.  just delicious & a keeper.

A keeper! I marinated the meat overnight. Served in warmed pita bread with a cucumber, dill yogurt sauce  (3/4  cups yogurt, 1/2 tbls. dill weed, a seeded, chopped and drained cucumber, 3 tlbs spoon milk, salt and pepper.  Mixed together and allowed to blend 1 hour.)

This is an amazing recipe.  It is great on pork and chicken.  The left-over sauce makes a great stir-fried rice.  Thanks a million.

We made a couple changes to the recipe but nothing drastic.  Half of the batch was made with chicken and pork for the other. Also replaced green peppers with an assortment since they were available. Served with tzatziki sauce but was fine without it too. Delicious.

Used only half the amount of pork in recipe and with sauce it seemed like the right amount for 4-5 people. I also added cherry tomatoes for color.

The major change I made is that since I had run out of normal olive oil, I used some basil-infused olive oil for the marinade. As it turns out, the basil flavor really went well with the oregano and other ingredients in the marinade. In any case we loved the recipe and will make it again.

I think if I would have grilled it it would have tasted better but it was raining. I added mushrooms ??. I think the next time I’ll add pineapple or something with citrus.

This is on a regular rotation in our house, I have used Pork, Chicken and Steak with this. I serve it with Sarah's Feta Rice Pilaf (excellent) and Naan Bread or Pita and Tzatziki. It is a hit with everyone in my house! And people can complain all they want about the soy sauce- and I admit it may not be something that is authentically put in souvlaki,  but this is a great dish.

I've used this marinade on a wide array of meats and cuts, it's so awesome the longer you marinade the better! Excellent with Rib Eyes, Elk and Pork. I cant not even begin to explain how awesome this is, this round I added a bit of sugar and cumin seed with the oregano gave it even more of a Mediterranean twist. Thanks a bunch!

Very good and not too salty.  Who cares if it has soy sauce.  If it taste good then use it!  Next time I will make it in oven and save time by not threading and grilling it.  Served in pita bread with Chef John's tzatziki sauce.  I will make again!

I found out something very interesting ...soy sauce in not used by the Greek culture to make Souvlaki marinade lol.  This elderly lady I spoke to was Greek...but this recipe was better than a famous Greek restaurant in Toronto.  we haven't been back since.

Delicious followed recipe as written .  Served with pita bread and tzatziki sauce. Also served the orzo rice dish which is also on this sight  I did make changes to that recipe by sautéing some onions and garlic before adding the orzo then added feta cheese at the end.  
Will be adding this to my rotation of recipes

Everyone at our house loved it, even my 10 year old who is not always very open-minded about new foods! Yes, I even included the soy sauce, although reduced the amount slightly. I doubled the meat and the marinade, but stayed with 2 peppers and one onion, which was sufficient for our family. Served with greek salad, pita bread and feta cheese spread. Success!

Very good. It marinated overnight. I couldn't taste the lemon.  It earns 4 stars on the day I grilled it, but 5 stars the day after.  The leftovers were so good!

Very tasty! Our only addition was a shake of dry bones seasoning. This dish goes into our rotation.  And to think it takes 12 min on the BBQ, Bonus.

We recently got a Big Green Egg & have been grilling more.  Tried this tonight, and it was really good!  I scaled it down to 4 servings, and tried JLAMBERT's tzatziki sauce (wasn't sure how big her "container" was, so I used her measurements more as a guideline).  Meat and veggies were great -- husband kept going back for more.  Really enjoyed the sauce, but next time I will have a lighter hand with the dill.  ~~~Thanks so much for the recipe . . . we really enjoyed it!

I used 3 tbsp of bottled lemon juice , and 1 large clove of garlic. I threaded the pork sideways so it would stay on skewer and marinated for an hour or two and put on BBQ for 15 mins or so turning frequently . It was tender and delicious. Also made greek potatoes to go with it.

Loved this recipe.   Only way I want pork tenderloin now.  I made it exactly as written the first time.  After that, I made 1 change, I only added 2 tbsp of soy sauce to cut the saltiness down per my own preference, and added 2 tbsp of red wine vineger.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe... It is my go to recipe and make it quite often.   I make it as is.  It is a great one to serve for company.  I usually skewer up my pork and veggies on separate skewers and serve with rice & fresh pita bread, greek salad and Tzatziki... Yummy!!.  Yes, it may not be authentic... (because of soya sauce) however, I love it and everyone I have ever served it to loves it too!!

An absolute hit with the whole family.  Doubled ingredients for 5-1/2 lbs of pork tenderloin and added red, yellow and orange bell peppers and baked in oven at 350 for 40 minutes.  Everyone loved it!

Liked this simple marinade but the soy sauce does make it not quite authentic.  Just did the chicken in chunks instead of on the stick for time and didn't have veggies available.

This is so good and so easy. I have made this over a dozen times and have used chicken  breast too. It's great with either pork or chicken and always turns out amazing. One time the bbq ran out of propane half way through, so I tossed them I to the oven and they were delicious . Thank you for the recipe!!

I left out the soy sauce but otherwise followed the recipe. I marinated the pork, green pepper, and red onion over night. It was a hit! My husband went crazy over it. I served it with a homemade tzatziki sauce and rice pilaf.

This was amazing!  Whether soy sauce belongs in Greek food or not, it definitely had the right flavor.  My daughter who eats like a bird and often skips the meat actually came back for seconds.  I marinated the pork overnight, but other than that didn't change a thing.

Easy, and entire picky family loved it. I'd use JLambert sauce suggestion for spread...with modification the pork already has garlic...sauce completes this great dish... 1/2 container of sour cream, 1/2 cucumber finely chopped, teaspoon of dill or less depending on your fam. preference. Coat inside of pita with the sauce, layer spinach at the bottom, then add pork and green and red pepper then a dlop of yum sauce...on fam. Calendar rotation, thank you
Ps don't over grill the pork leave slightly pink in side.

This was fantastic! Left the pork to marinade for about 4 hours and it was lovely and tender. Grilled it for a bit longer too as I get worried about underdone pork and it was still fabulous! Very easy to make with nice simple ingredients. I've been ordered to make it again, it was a great success!

This was awesome.  Served with grilled asparagus and grilled zucchini and yellow squash for a low carb meal.

This is, by far, our go-to recipe for the grill this summer! Really fantastic! We've been using pork tenderloin or chicken thighs. We increase the garlic and allow to marinade as long as possible (left it for 2 days at one point). 
We measure all of the ingredients (minus the meat) into a small mason jar and shake shake shake.

This is a delicious, easy, and versatile recipe. I usually omit the green peppers as a taste preference and serve in a pita with a few slices of red onion, a couple of slices of tomato, some lettuce and a touch of cucumber sauce. Very good. Thanks for the recipe.

I bought some pre-made beef and chicken kabobs from the grocers. I reduced the serving size to 6 and put them in for about 4 hours.  I didn't try the beef, but the chicken was excellent.  Just a subtle flavor, but definitely a recipe I'll keep on hand for making my own kabobs with next time!

delicious! we use this marinade frequently in the summer for grilling pork cubes or chicken breast. Sometimes we have a Greek-themed meal along with it, but lots of times we just use it as a great basic marinade. Very tasty and kid-friendly.

we absolutely loved this recipe!  have been trying to experience different cultures as of late and we decided to go Greek this time, and this recipe captured our attention.  Was AWESOME!  My husband was the one that made it and he did say that if I reviewed it to mention that he did double the marinade - that he didn't feel that it was enough as the recipe called for, but that was his only negative comment, if you can even call that negative :)

Brilliant! I have made this now several times as presented in the recipe, as suggested by reviewers, and with a little monkeying of my own. I am so very pleased to opine that there is just no way to improve on this skillful base recipe (Well, maybe the feta cheese when it is served over rice). Recipes like this just come along so infrequently that I could not help to comment just to say thanks to the submitter. Thank you Ms. Benner!

Very tasty. I served it with some tzatziki sauce on the side, Greek potatoes and a salad. It was a huge hit even with my 6 year old. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Tender!  Do make double the sauce.  I cooked mine in a mesh pan made for grilling...saves a lot of time skewering!  Next time i will add more veggies, but keep everything else the same!

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly, except added cherry tomatoes to the skewers and marinated the meat and vegetables all day. Broiled instead of grilled.

My hubs and I both really enjoyed the marinade. I marinaded boneless chicken in it, which we grilled and ate with a simple Greek salad. Yes, I'm not sure if soy sauce is too Greek, but whatever, it was a great marinade regardless--best one I've tried yet from a bottle or this site. I may cut down on the soy just a bit next time to see how it tastes. But it's great the way it is!

I rarely review recipes, but this souvlaki was amazing. The meat was incredibly tender. Served with the tzatziki sauce from this website and mango couscous. Best meal I've made in a very long time! Oh and I used a pork loin (not tenderloin) and only needed one to serve 4 people.

This is a dependable recipe for pork souvlaki -- you'll get the flavor you're looking for! I made this so I could have pork gyro sandwiches, which were delicious! I used a tzatziki sauce recipe from this site as well (unsure which one, sorry!) The vegetables tasted delicious also, and the pork was really tender.  I would use this recipe again, but I will say that my boyfriend found the oregano flavor to be a little strong.  I personally liked the strong oregano flavor but maybe it's just not good for some!

The marinade for this is terrific, I particularly liked what it did to the onion, making them sweet and slichtly caramelized. The plan was to cook these on the barbecue but a sudden downpour meant I had to broil them instead. Maybe because of this the meat was a little chewier than I would have liked, I did them for about 15 minutes turning regularly so it's possible I overcooked the pork. Still a great meal which I plan to repeat soon using lamb. Thanks Abby.

My daughter has a new favorite dish!  She recently discovered Greek food, and rather than spend $$ at the local restaurant, I tried this recipe.  Very easy to make, though I did bake it in the oven instead of grilling it.  This will definitely go into our regular rotation.  Thanks for posting!

I was really suprised at how easy this was ~ and how well this turned out. I'm not really a fan of Pork Tenderloin - but this recipie turned out to be super tender. It seemed to go over really well with my Supper Club girls too - I'll file this recipie away for emergency situations.

This was delicious! I ended up doubling the marinade to cover the meat and vegetables,it didn't make very much. Other than that, it was great as is though! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious. We used red onions and marinated overnight. It might have been a bit salty with the extra marinating time so next time I will probably use low sodium soy sauce.  I served this with 5th Sister's Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce.  So Good.

We don't have a bbq, so I cooked these on the stovetop. Tasty, but next time I will not bother skewering everything (even though I know souvlaki should be this way - it was kind of a pain)

Excellent recipe, however I may try adding some red wine vinegar or red wine in place of some of the soy sauce to make it more traditional.  Also am going to try to find Greek oregano.  Served this with grilled pitas, tzatziki sauce II, and good for you Greek Salad.  Great combo together.  My husband absolutely loved this dish, plus we felt that we were eating very healthy which is usually our goal.

Perfect as is. No need to add any additional ingredients. My husband and friends rave over this dish, just make sure that you marinade it for at least 3 hours.

Only getting 4 stars b/c I did as the top reviewer suggested. I didn't add the soy sauce. To compensate for the lack of it, I did add about a teaspoon of salt. I also used this on boneless skinless chicken breasts cubed. And it was SO good. It had the perfect flavor I was hoping for. I plan on making this again next week using pork :)

I made this for dinner last night for my family and my in-laws.  It was a big hit and even my daughter liked it and she is a picky eater.    I marinated the pork and veggies over night and then cooked everything in the over for an hour.  I look forward to redoing this recipe and cooking it on the grill when the weather gets nicer.

The recipe is straight out FABULOUS!! I never even thought about trying to cook Greek food but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! My mom even mentioned that it tasted like it came from a Greek restaurant! The only difference was I didn't have any skewers so I just grilled the chicken in pieces on the grill. Superb recipe! Definately recommended!

Although there are 500+ ratings of this insane recipe already, I'm adding my rave review because I think this is my favorite dish of the whole summer!! I thought the pork would be dry and tough (like it always seems to turn out for me) but it was beautifully tender from the grill! I followed our Greek reviewer on here and opted out of using the soy sauce. I splashed a little red wine vinegar in instead. MY FAVORITE!!!! Thank you Abby!

Excellent!!!  I've made this recipe several times now and it always comes out great.  I throw everything into marinate that morning and then it's a quick easy fix that night.  We love ours with the Tzatziki Sauce II and grilled pita bread.  Just brush your pita with a little olive oil and toss it on the grill until nice and warm.  Add a salad and you have a wonderful, healthy meal!!

Tastes like the stuff you get in Greece- even with the soy sauce!  I used a lot more lemon garlic and oregano though. I also used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin- not as dry and has more flavor.  Best when served with white rice and cucumber sauce.

Amazing taste...I did all the prep the night before including marinating the meat.  I just skewered and threw on the bbq.  I prepared Tzatziki sauce to go with it....delicious!

I couldn't give a rat's  whether these are authentic or not.  All I know is that they tasted GREAT.  I added a teaspoon of white sugar to the marinade and I used both chicken and pork - it was very good with a couscous salad (couscous, chopped feta, chopped tomato, chopped cucumber, olive oil and maggi).  Thanks for an easy recipe, I'm going to use it often!

I realize that soy sauce is not a traditional Greek ingredient, but that fact cannot take away from how TASTY this is.  No need to change a thing.  I served it with some rice and tahini/yogurt sauce.  Seems like a very versatile recipe that could be used in gyros and with many different kinds of meat.  Might try this with lamb soon.

I thought this was a good recipe, I would definitely try this one again. I made a few changes though.   I used 4 lemons instead of 1.   I add a couple of tablespoons of greek spice/seasoning.   I an added a small diced onion & diced green pepper to the marinade.   I added about half a cup of Parmeasan Cheese to the marinade.  I didn't add the soya sauce.  Instead of the BBQ, I poured the pork & marinade into a pot & boiled everything for about an hour. I strained the pork out (I wasn't a big fan of the marinade as a sauce) & added it to some fettucini.  Overall, this recipe was good & has a lot of potential for variations.

Very traditional recipe, except Greeks don't use soy sauce.  This is an old family recipe used and eaten with great pride, success & Tzatziki sauce (but don't use soy sauce.)  You can also use pork and barbeque some potato slices in olive oil for a great side dish. Of course don't forget the bread.  Opah!

This was so delicious! I didn't have that much time so I only marinated them for about half an hour. I'm sure they'd be better left longer, but don't be discouraged if you don't have the time. They still came out great. I couldn't grill them, I was about to put them in the stove, when I decided to try them on the griddle. They came out great and I paired them with the greek potatoes recipe, which is also excellent.

I made this recipe for my wife and I last week and it tasted exactly how I was hoping it would.  I tried using balsamic vinegar instead of the soy sauce though for a more Mediterranean taste.  It was though we ate at a Greek restaurant!

This was very tasty! I only give it three stars because its not very authentic (soy sauce was very dominant not something I associate with greek food) but dont get me wrong it is DELICIOUS and it comes out juicy and tender and the marinade is great. I did notice that you need a longer cooking time than 8 or 10 minutes. But that may be due to the fact that I cut my cubes a little bigger. Also after getting home from the store I noticed I didn't have any skewers, so I just popped the meat on the grill and sauteed the green peppers and onions. overall very good.

This was fantastic!  Very easy and flavorful.  I used a 2 lb. pork loin cut up and marinated for 2 hours, threw in a casserole dish and baked for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  I served with rice, pita, a cucumber dill sauce and pita bread.  My 2 and 3 year old kids even ate it.  A keeper!

This is an awesome recipe! I usually make it with whole mushrooms or baby portobello mushrooms, onion chunks and red peppers & marinate all the veggies with the meat. Excellent! Be sure not to overcook the pork!!

Perfect marinade for kabobs.  I've used it for chicken, beef, and pork, and added squash, zucchini, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Very easy to make and pretty good, according to the meat eaters in the family. The only change I made was to use sweet onion instead of yellow onion. My daughter said she thought she would like it better with chicken, so I will try that. Thanks!

Great recipe, very simple to make and tastes pretty authentic to me.  I marinated the meat and veggies all day instead of just a few hours, and substituted orange bell peppers for the green.  Next time, I'll try my own tzatziki sauce, as others have suggested.

This souvlaki recipe turned out wonderfully, flavourful and authentic tasting. Just a reply to the reference on the "greek not chinese" review. Soya sauce works as a tenderizer; it's not for flavour. The reason for this is so you can marinade successfully in two to three hours. All in all great recipe!

Not sure what happened with this, but we did not like this recipe. Not a lot of flavor, even after marinating for 2 1/2 hrs. Thankfully I made wonderful tzatziki sauce also on this site, since this is the only way we ate it. Sorry, but I won't make this again

I had never tried Souvlaki before and my husband and I loved this recipe! Marinated the meat overnite and it was very tender. As others suggested, I used 1/8 cup red wine vinegar and decreased the soy sauce to 1/8 cup. Also used my own recipe for tzatziki sauce. Can't wait to try it with lamb and chicken!

This was a recipe my whole family loved.  The only thing we did differently was we did not add the vegies b/c I have some picky eaters.  Was quick and easy and tasted great and tender.

For years my husband has raved about the pork that one of his friends makes when they tailgate at football games.  I have tried every recipe for pork that I could find but he did not like any of them... until now!  This is fantastic!

Update:I agree with the reviewer today-so what if soy sauce is not Greek. This is my very favorite "Greek" marinade! In fact we are having pork chops, cut to fit skewerw along with fresh squash, fresh bell pepper and fresh onion for kabobs tonight. BUT, this marinade has been delicious also with other meats! Thanks, Nobody'sGirl for such a winning recipe! ANOTHER UPDATE: I now use this marinade for roasted vegetables-any to your liking..the grill or oven. The natural sweetness of the veggies is divine!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My only complaint was that the flavors from the marinade didn't really come through as well as I expected.  I marinated the pork for 5 hours.  Very tender though, and I will make it again.

Yum! That tzatziki sauce that another reviewer recommended goes GREAT with this. The dish is also paired very well with the tomato artichoke rice salad on this site. DELICIOUS. I split the recipe in half because I was only making dinner for two, but I kept the marinade amounts the same and that turned out to be just enough. If I make a 4 pounds of pork tenderloin next time, I'll double the marinade. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is really good.  I didn't have the peppers, so I used yellow squash and egg plant.  I quartered the onions, squash, and egg plant.  I let the meat and vegetables marinate together.

I made this for dinner this evening, and it was very good.  My older daughter does not eat red meat or pork, so I marinated some chicken for her in the same marinade, aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I also served some yogurt sauce with it.  Yogurt, cucumber and dill.  My husband loved it.

Definitely leave out the soy sauce, otherwise, it is more like asian in flavor.  Really delicious using white wine instead as another reviewer suggests.

This is a recipe that I go back to time and time again. It is a winner, no question about it. I always grill my shiskabobs on my stovetop grill and it works out beautifully. I've also tried this marinade on chicken and loved it. It's a heavy repeat in our meal rotation!

This was so easy and delicious!  I used pork stew meat instead of the tenderloin because it cost less and it still turned out tender...I added fresh mushrooms and I marinated it overnight...it smelled so good on the BBQ the next day!  I just served it with plain white rice.

We loved this!! My husband couldn't stop complimenting me and my picky daughter had seconds! Grilled perfectly. My other picky eaters don't like bbq so I just cooked theirs in a wok in the house. Will cook many more times. THanks!

Great!  Made with the Tzatziki Sauce recipe from this site, and served with warm pita bread and a Greek Salad.  It was a wonderful dinner.  The Souvlaki was very tender and flavorful.

OH MY!! These are sooooooooooooooooo fabulous!!
I used pork tenderloin and cut them into 1" chunks and marinated for about 5 hours, than skewered onto bamboo skewers.
I also used 2tbs dried oregano & It turned out fantastically!
We grilled on med heat for 10 mins each side and served in a bun.
We served with Greek Style Potatoes from this site. 
We will be making this again.

This was great.  I used 2 lbs of pork loin (what I had on hand).  The amount of marinade was perfect for that much meat... if I make it with more I would double it.  Also I broiled them because once I skewered them I found out that my grill was out of gas :(  but they still turned out great! My hubby wants me to try it with chicken next.  I served them on pita with shredded lettuce and tzatziki sauce from this site.  Will definietly make again and again.

AMAZING!!!!! I baked in the oven in the sauce instead of cooking on the grill b/c i live in a condo. Cooking in the sauce was SO good. Also made taziki that a past reveiwer described and it was great too. the pork was so tender i could cut it with my fork! I am telling everyone i know about this recipe.

This was one of the best recipes I have found here.  What I was hoping for and more!  I had to substitute lime juice for the lemon cuz I was out, but I don't know if it made a difference (will try with lemon next time).  Like others have said, this will become a regular dish at our home!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good but not spectacular.  I've had this recipe printed for a while so I didn't go back and read the reviews, next time I'll marinade the meat and veggies longer as so many have suggested.  I used lemon juice concentrate and low-sodium soy sauce.

Fantastic.  you will need to do at least double the marinade to completely cover 4lbs of meat.  I recommend 3x.

We really liked this recipe! I marinated it for 4 hours but will do it overnight next time. This is going to be one of our regular dishes from now on. I doubled the marinade and served it in a Pita pocket with the Tzatziki sauce from Serena on this site. Excellent!

This was sooo good and easy.  The only change I'd make is double the marinade to make sure the meat is submerged completely-it was more moist that way.

Simply excellent!  I had to double the marinade recipe to give me enough to thoroughly marinate the meat.  I marinated the meat for 6 hours.  Just so tender!

LOVE IT!!! this recipe is a definite family favorite! i substitute the pork with chicken (i just marinade the breasts whole, they cook up on the grill better) and during the summer our favorite veggies to use are zucchini and summer/crookneck squash. to save on dishes, i use 2 big ziploc bags and put a batch of marinade in each one, put the veggies in one and the chicken in the other. let them marinate for a few hours and it all comes out tender and juicy! we love it served over sticky rice too. for the marinade, i always add a little extra garlic and lemon juice because i love the flavor. this is going into the family cookbook!

I cut up the meat and veggies the night before and placed in a gallon bag. Mixed up marinade the next morning and poured it into the bag with the meat/veggie mix. I let it marinate all day while I was at work. Skewered it and hubby grilled it for dinner. They were great! Great flavor and a healthy dinner. Served with cucumber dill sauce and a green salad on the side. Thanks!!!

Great recipe! I was short on time as I had to be out the door to work in 15 minutes...so instead of cubing the pork I just cut a pork loin roast into steaks and marinated with veggies for 9 hours. When I got home I cooked them on the bbq. The meat tasted wonderful and was super tender. This is a keeper!

Love the receipe, can work on all sorts of meats. Hubby tried it, and love it, and he's pretty picky.  Especially with yellow/read bell peppers, normally he wouldn't eat them at all.  Probably will add more onions and bell peppers next time, because the sause is so good.

AMAZING recipe! So easy to do and so much flavour. We used cubes of pork and added veggies like mushrooms and grape tomatoes and ate the souvlaki on warm pitas with tzatziki. Used bottled lemon juice. Really, really tasty.

This is my favourite souvlaki recipe.  It is SOOOO easy, and the results are great every time.  I use it over and over and it is always a hit with guests.  I serve with store bought tzatziki but it is good on it's own too.  Serve with Greek salad and a side of roasted potatoes.

Awesome recipe! I followed the exactly, except that I marinated the pork overnight. I served it with Tzatziki sauce and warm pita bread for lunch. It was so good that I re-use marinade for some chicken breast that I had on hand. I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours and had it for dinner. It didn't taste really good. So, I decided to marinade it overnight. And it taste awesome the next day!

Yummmmmmm!!!!!!  I could eat this every night.  It's awesome with the tzatziki sauce.  I marinate for a few hours longer then called for though and use more onion and green peppers.  The kids love it too and they're picky eaters!

Pork was very tender and it had a good flavor. I marinated it about 8 hours. Next time I think I would cut back just a little on the oregano.

Very easy to make.  My husband and I agreed this tasted just fine by itself (i.e. no gyro).  I used tomatoes and mushrooms instead of onions and bell peppers, since we don't like them as much.  Turned out really good.  I used 2 lbs of tenderloin and doubled the marinade to make sure I had enough.

This had a real authentic Greek taste. Came out nice and moist. I was surprised how much it tasted like lamb. Easy to do, especially when you use a George Foreman machine.

Easy and delicious...what more can you ask for in a recipe.  I had unexpected guests the night I prepared this and everyone loved it.  I served it with a green salad and some rice cooked in chicken broth with fresh chives added. YUMMY!

Great recipe.

I made just a few modifications.  About 2/3 of the soy called for-- still a strong soy flavor... some might want to half it, but 2/3 was just about right for me!  Added just a little Thyme.  Used tri-colored peppers instead of just green (my SO hates green pepper)  -- didn't need as much onion as listed.

Also, and regardless of what else you do-- you'll want more marinade!  I ended up tripling mine, but doubling would have been enough.

Again, great recipe!!!!

Super easy to whip up, a little chilly here in Canada for bbq still so cooked in the oven on baking sheet.  I don't think it really tasted like the souvlaki that i know but it was still good.  Served on pitas with tzatziki sauce.  Will make again for sure.

This is a recipe I'll be using again and again. I accidentally omitted the soy sauce but it was still great. I let it marinade overnight so the flavor was very strong and the pork so tender! Serve on a pita with tzatziki, feta and lettuce for a great easy meal.

This recipe is just the best.  LOVE the flavor, ease, and simple ingredients.  Have only ever used with pork so can only speak for that.  This is definately the only souvlaki recipe I use!

This recipe probably doesn't need another 5 star rating, but I'll add mine to the others.  Made as some suggested (less soy sauce and only 2 lbs of pork tenderloin). Grilled veggies and meat separately.  Served with warmed pitas, "Tzatsiki Sauce I" from this site and a salad (with feta crumbles) dressed with "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing," also from this site. Husband said "better than a restaurant."  Will defintely make again.

This was so good!  I used thick cut pork loin chops and it turned out tender and delicious.  I let everything marinate overnight.  I also used the broiler instead of the grill because it is Winter in Chicago and I don't know about you, but grilling just isn't on my agenda. Delicious, though.

Wonderful taste. I used a full recipe of maranade for 2 lbs of pork loin, which turned out to be the perfect amount. I used about a tablespoon of rosemary along with the other spices.  This was terrific with tzatziki and feta wrapped in a soft taco shell or in a pita.

The marinade was great.  I would suggest a more tender meat like lamb, but the pork was pretty good.

This one's a keeper!  Served with rice pilaf and a Greek salad, my family thought I was serving takeout from a real Greek restaurant.  Like other reviewers have said, marinating the pork overnight is a good idea.

Delicious, but a tad salty with all the soy sauce. Next time I'll use half the soy sauce. I suggest slicing the tenderloin instead of cubing. Makes it easier to cook and you can use the broiler quite easily.

I really, really liked this!  My hubby and I pigged out.  I did feel that the soy sauce flavor was a bit overpowering, so I may add a bit less next time.  I served over rice pilaf and added a huge spinach salad and we had an awesome meal.

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times and the only thing I have changed is that I generally use 2-3 lbs of pork tenderloin rather than the 4 lbs it calls for.  It's impressive, easy, delicious and healthy!  What more could you want???

Fantastic recipe & very easy to make.  The meat was so tender & moist.  The only thing I might do next time is add a little bit less lemon juice.  I like lemons, but the flavor was a little strong.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!! I have made it at least every week since I have found it. The only change that I make is that I double the recipe for the marinade and marinade the meat and veggies separately. I usually serve the meat with couscous or steamed rice. The left over marinade from the veggies is really good to drizzle over the rice too!!

I marinated this souvlaki over night and then served it with a greek horiatiki salad with cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano and onions and pita bread. It was absolutely delicious and one of the best grecian recipes I'd ever tasted.

Great recipe.  Tasted like we had ordered it from a restaurant.  We used chicken instead of pork because that was what we had on hand and it turned out great.

This smelled divine while on the grill... and tasted great too.  I marinated the meat only (2 days), then added raw veggies to the skewers.  This took about 20 minutes on a med-high grill.

This was so yummy! Great to make on a weekday as the cooking and clean up time are very minimal. Simple enough for a quick meal but delicious enough to serve to guests!

This recipe was great.  The marinade made the meat taste super tender.  The reason I made this is because I don't really like pork all that much and I had some that had been in my freezer for a while that I needed to use.  I have to admit, pork cooked this way is pretty good!

My husband (the pork hater) loved this recipe. It reminded me of a family marinade we currently use for beef. I would have never thought of using it with pork! Wonderful recipe, thanks!

EXCELLENT!  I added mushrooms and served in pitas as someone else suggested.  I also served with the Tzatziki sauce that is featured on this site as well.  The mushrooms were REALLY flavorful.

Love it!  Great for summertime.  I don't have a grill so I use my broiler when I make this at home... have to skewer the veggies and chicken separately to get them to cook correctly, but quite delicious!

This was a great souvlaki recipe.  It is a little salty though, so I would recommend cutting back on the soya sauce.

This was great! I used a 2 lb. pork loin and marinated for 7 hrs., then threw it all in a covered dutch oven and baked for 45 min at 350. The only thing I would do differently is cut pork into smaller pieces. (Just personal preference)

Made this for my family, served with the Tzatziki sauce by Dinah, rice pilaf, and pita bread.  Despite the fact that we couldn't taste the marinade too much (I doubled it AND let it sit overnight!), everyone still raved about it.  The sauce earned somewhat of a mixed reaction, but I'm not sure if that was my fault or just because it was up against picky eaters.  Overall, a fantastic dinner idea--- just wish I knew why my marinade wasn't as flavorful as everyone else's!

I am vegetarian, but I made this for my family on my mom's birthday and they said it was delicious! We marinated it for a few hours and then grilled it. It went well with tzakiki (or the cucumber garlic yogurt sauce). Make this recipe!

I had people coming into the kitchen all day to find out what smelled so good and I hadn't even started cooking it yet.  I marinated it overnight and used good, very lean center cut loin.  A very good turnout!  Somebody ought to bottle this marinade!!!

I thought this was excellent.  Wish I would have had some pita bread with this.  Would defintely make it again, maybe with chicken.

We loved these souvlaki (although I did put a little too much lemon the last time but then my husband is not a fan of lemon).  I was so surprised how much they tasted like the real thing and were so easy to make.  Made them twice already and can't wait to make them again.  Thank you Abby for this delicious recipe.

This was so delicious. I made mine without the green peppers and added tomatoes. I also broiled mine, adding the tomatoes at the last few minutes. The meat is so tender and yummy!

I made this for son's 11th birthday dinner. My husband and I really liked it, but the kids were not as convinced. I'd make it again if I could find a good recipe for cucumber sauce.

I absolutely could not believe how great this tasted!  Words can't describe how good this was.  My husband loved it!  I definitely will make this again and pass the recipe along to friends and family.

This is the hands down duplicate to the Souvlaki Plate I order at my favorite restaurant!  Total prep time was minimal and my 3 "fussy eating" children loved it!  I have a Rotisseire and this is the perfect recipe for that!

I found this recipe VERY lemony.  Next time I won't use nearly as much lemon juice in it.  I think I'd actually like it better with chicken (with the lemon flavour).  I also added extra oregano and liked it better with that addition.  It was very easy to make, which of course is a big plus!

This recipe was excellent.  I had recently made a batch for my class after studying Greece and it was a hit with the others, the kids just ate them up.  And I'm a kid too, infact, even I thought it was easy, and delicious too.  Thank you!
