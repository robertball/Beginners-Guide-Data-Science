I have been making this Jelly for about 10 years.  I have used the canned jalapenos or 4 fresh jalapenos with seeds for heat. If using fresh make sure you turn the jars so it doesnt all sit at the bottom.  Always comes out great!!!

This is great!  I buy ready made Jalapeno Jelly and it is EXPENSIVE! Now I make my own and it is easy and good.  I made it exactly as written.  Eat it on a plain old soda cracker with a tiny dab of creamcheese...Heaven!  Then I made super hot jelly with red bell peppers and habanero chilies...WOW! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Easy to make and delicious. I used 4 fresh jalapenos (with seeds) in place of the canned ones and skipped the cayenne and food colouring. I thought the jars looked perfectly lovely without the colour - sort of a greenish yellow in the jar, that looked colourless and clear when spread.

I love this recipe! I have made several batches and it turns out perfect each time. I use 4 fresh jalapeno peppers and I chop them very fine in my food processor and leave the seeds in them for heat and I do not add the cayenne pepper.

Simple, fast and easy. The end product is wonderful and would make a very nice addition to Christmas or gift basket. Sweet with a warm finish. I added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to the second batch and it kicked up the heat just a bit. Both batches are very good.

I see from the reviews that I am not the only one just now experimenting with making jelly.  This was my first attempt, as well, and with a little planning, the whole process went smoothly.  And the jelly is wonderful!  I did some research first, then used the peppers from an ornamental plant that range from purple to orange and red.  The colors are subtle, but very pretty!  The peppers are hot, so the taste is sweet and just slightly spicy!  Perfect!

This was the first time I have ever attempted jelly of any kind, and it came out perfectly! My family said it was the best jalapeno jelly they had ever had! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Too sweet, but the flavor was amazing.  I will add a cup less of sugar next time.  It was yummy!

Today was the first time I had ever made pepper jelly, It was a Success, thanks to this easy recipe.  I did use fresh jalapenos from our garden, and rounded out the 8 oz with pepper slices that you use on nachos.  I left some of the seeds in the fresh peppers, and would probably leave a few more next time for a little more heat!

This was a fabulous recipe! I used sliced jalapenos from the garden (chopped in food processor along with peppers) and kept the seeds in. I added a few red pepper flakes, turned out great! It was so good, I made a 2nd batch right away with no red peppers and less seeds for gifts!!! Thanks so much!

First time making this recipe and first time making jelly.  I read all of the reviews and finally changed it a little.  Used 6 fresh jalapenos along with the 3 green peppers.  Used 6 cups of sugar instead of the six and a half.  I left out the cayenne pepper and had just the right amount of heat for my family and friends.  I did add the green food coloring, but will opt out of adding this next time.  I had enough for 9 half pints of jelly.

This recipe is prettt good!! I used apple cider vinegar, because that's all I had, and I used my magic bullet to blend the 6 fresh jalapenos I used, and doing that, it made a natural green jelly.  I also added a bunch of fresh chopped cilantro at the end, because I had it, and I wanted to use it. The jelly is really yummy!

Excellent recipe!  Substituted 6 jalapenos for the diced chiles and left the seeds in.  Then used the food processor to combine the jalapenos and green peppers.  Additionally, as previously mentioned food coloring was not required.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I substituted 5 fresh jalapenos instead of the canned ones. I seeded four out of the five, and also added in the cayenne pepper, since the jalapenos were so mild. I was worried it wasn't going to set up, as it was so runny when it put it in the jars, but by the next morning, it was completely set up. We loved it so much, I made a second batch a few days later to last us through winter.

I used powdered pectin- apparently, liquid and powdered pectin are not interchangable- mine is runny. It tastes very good, so I will try this again using the liquid pectin. I also did not use food coloring.

This is such an easy to make and wonderful jelly.  Will be making some in a day or two.  We have found it's an awesome topping (amount to your liking) for almost any kind of meat.  Hardly ever eat it on crackers.  Altogether too many carbs.

Used 1 jalepeno and one to two banana peppers seeded instead of chili peppers. Also used some red and yellow peppers for color.  Used 3 tbsp dry fruit pectin when I made a half recipe instead of liquid.

Jelly turned out great.Making second batch with peppers we just picked. Thanks for sharing recipe.
