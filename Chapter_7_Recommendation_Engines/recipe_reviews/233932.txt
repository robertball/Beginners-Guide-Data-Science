Made this for a "snack" for my kiddo so I cut the recipe in half and subbed orange juice instead of lemon because he doesn't care for lemon and added some garlic and onion powder. I was really surprised how yummy this came out really flavorful and nice and moist. He loved it and I loved how easy it was.

I really liked this, not only for how fast and easy it is, but for the flavor. I'm not a dill "freak", and the quantity seemed like a lot for the liquid involved. Also was leery of the sugar, but wanted to make this exactly as the recipe states. I'm the first reviewer; but I'm also making this in honor of the author (BevF), who passed away a couple years ago I'm told. I hope she sees I'm a fan!

Easy and delicious!  I usually make my salmon on the grill, wrapped in foil, with butter, lemon, lemon pepper and dill, but this is so much easier!

I made this in my lekue microwave steamer and it turned out perfectly!  I used rosemary because I didn't have any dill.  This is definitely my new favorite recipe for salmon when I'm short on time.

I love salmon any way it's cooked.  I didn't have a lot of faith in this recipe because it was so easy and with only a few ingredients, but it was delicious!  I'll certainly use it again.  My husband hates salmon and even he rates it a 4!  It was moist and picked up the flavors  of the  seasoning.  I loved the fact that the house wasn't smelling of fish!

Very easy to make. Great flavor and not a lot of fuss or time required. I didn't have as much salmon, so mine was finished in five minutes. Also, I didn't have a casserole dish with a lid, so I just used some saran wrap and all went well.

Perfect for a quick meal. I rarely use the microwave for more than reheating. I buy the salmon filet from Costco and cut it down for freezing. Cooking for two. Already skinned so I cut the cooking time to 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning to suit your tastes and you wonâ€™t be disappointed. Steamed some asparagus and dinner on the table in 10 minuets. WOW.

I made no changes and we loved it!  The poaching liquid is so tasty, it would be a good soup. We also poured it over the rice we ate as a side.

Fast, great texture and flavor. I used ginger syrup (from our Moscow Mules) instead of sugar.  Will probably back off the "sweet" next time -- my mistake -- but worked great even with just one filet. Thanks for sharing an efficient technique!
