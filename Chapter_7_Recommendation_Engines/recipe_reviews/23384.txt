I make this all the time and people are always requesting a copy of the recipe.  I do add 1 teasp. minced garlic, 2 more tablespoons of mayo than called for in the recipe and I use 4  green onions instead of leek.  Everyone loves this one and it is so easy to make.

I really liked this recipe, but when I took it to a New Year's Eve party it didn't get eaten very  quickly.  I loved the way the artichokes and peppers made the dip so hearty and the marinade on the artichokes was yummy......I think the reason that it didn't get eaten is because it doesn't look very pretty.  It almost looked like a funky salsa or something, but I would serve it again at my own home so that I could explain what it was and I think it would go over better.
~~~~~~~
I made this again for a smaller get together and it was gone before anything else.....I loved it, and when I could tell people what it was they really enjoyed....

So, I really changed this recipe b/c I wasn't sure what we'd be in the mood for.  Diced the red peppers, and chopped up ONE can of artichoke hearts.  I then added one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, softened, 3/4 c. mont. jack cheese, 3 cloves garlic, 1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper,  1 c. mayo and 1 Tbsp dried minced onion. I tossed all of this in the food processor and ground the heck out of it.  Threw it in the oven for 20 minutes @ 350.  Served with Pita Chips (recipe from this site) and an assortment of fresh veggies.  My guests could not get enough, and had to force themselves to stop eating, so as to have room for dinner!  Even my picky picky 9 year old gobbled it up, and has requested we have it again tonight.  The artichokes really set this apart, and it's just such a pretty dish to set on the table.

I make this recipe for all of our get togethers.  It's definitely a favorite!  I substitute green onions for the leek though.  Also, make sure to only use real mayo, fat free won't blend properly.

Very tasty and a great alternative to the traditional artichoke/parmesan/mayo dip. Very colorful. My first experience with leeks - now I'm a big leek fan. They can be substituted for onions when you don't want such a huge onion-y taste.

This dip is delicious!  I brought it to a pool party yesterday and I received rave reviews!  Very tasty.  I would cut up the artichokes and red peppers next time, the chunks were very large for a dip.  Otherwise, awesome!

This was a great appetizer for my dinner party.  I put it together a day ahead and just heated it up.  Served with a variety of crackers, this dish goes very quickly.  Even my 14 year old who turned his nose at the thought of an artichoke liked this one.  It's sooooo easy, but tastes and looks like you really worked hard.

Excellent Recipe!!!!  I served it with multi-grained crackers.  I swear the dip was gone within 15 minutes of me setting it out with my other appetizers.  Kids really didn't care for it which was fine, more for the adults.  Served it for 30 adults and would recommend doubling recipe for this size of crowd.

This was delicious.  I love to make appetizers.  I made this at a party and everyone wanted the recipe.  It is probably one of the most requested recipes of all.  The roasted peppers give the dip a great flavor.  I couldn't really taste the leek.

This is a tasty dip that is absolutely hideous looking.  I added onions, granulated garlic, pepper sauce ("red hot"), salt, and pepper during the saute to add more flavor (it needs it).

Everyone agreed it tasted wonderful, but looked gross.  This would serve as a great stuffing for peppers or tomatoes.

Made for first time at my Christmas party, and was not disappointed!  Increased mayo by a few Tbsps and used the green onions instead of leeks, as suggested by others, and it was the most praised of the 5 appetizers I served.  People were "swooning" over it!  This is now at the top of my "favorites" list!!

It was all-right but there was a lot of this left over at Christmas; I did modify it some.   I used a red bell pepper that I saute'd lightly, a bit more mayo and skipped the butter, seasonings (garlic/pepper/salt/cayenne).  I also added one can of chopped water chestnuts for crunch .    I wanted it to be cheesier like the hot spinach/artichoke dips you get at Chili's restaurant but this just tasted like hot veg. with mayo imo...   I think it had most of all what it needed but maybe I'd add a cup of mozzarella to it!

YUMMY YUMMY!  I added some minced garlic to the oil and also added some extra mayo.  The extra mayo was a little too much - I'll try the recommended amount next time - cause there will definitly be a next time for this dish!!!  THANKS!

I made this for  New Year's Day party and it was a hit.  Per other reviewers, I added 1 tsp garlic and red pepper flakes. I made sure to drain well, bumped colander in sink till no liquid came out, mine was not watery/oily at all and really looked pretty. (nothing like the picture with the recipe).  People who tried it kept saying to other - "You have to try this, it is so delicious".

This is WONDERFUL!  I used green onion, c'yan pepper, cream cheese and garlic as suggested by other reviewers. I coursely chopped the peppers and artichokes and added coursely chopped green onion tops for contrasting color.  It was a pleasing presentation and a devine taste!  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful, wonderful!!! With a couple of additions to this recipe, I get rave reviews from everyone who samples this wonderful dish!  I added a couple cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, Hot sauce to taste (I used Cholulu brand), and red pepper flakes to taste. I like a little snap to this recipe.

This was really good! I love artichokes steamed and I really like roasted red peppers, but they didn't taste as good as I thought they would together.  Still it's a great recipe! Thank you for offering it Eileen!

Just ok.....I was expecting better, the taste was good but my guests thought it was too watery as did I. I have a fabulous hot artichoke dip recipe that I usually make, saw this one and thought....what a fabulous spin on the orignal dip....think I will stick with the plain artichoke recipe. Sorry!

This is AMAZING! We would give it 6 stars if we could!! Since we had fresh artichokes around, we used them instead of canned hearts. We used 9 baby-sized ones, and then used the leaves for dipping, which was great. We also used 2 large red peppers which we roasted ourselves, instead of buying the already roasted ones in bottle. This is soooooooo good! We'll definitely make it again.

Roasted red peppers make this COLORFUL!!  : )  It's kind of chucky, which was great because you don't fish around in a bunch of sauce to find an artichoke and it is easy to scoop on cracker.  It is a SURE FIRE crowd pleaser.

Holy cow!!!  I have make this twice so far and both times it has been a huge hit.  It was perfect with a glass of wine and crackers on a summer evening.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

This was much sweeter than I anticipated. I was hoping for something a bit more savory. Even with an added dash of cayenne pepper, I found this a bit too sweet for my liking, but good if that's what you are looking for.

My kids, 13 and 11, love this. I use part marinated artichokes and part artichoke crowns in water for a little less oil. Tasty flavors.

WOW!  Made just as written, but substituted lite sour cream for mayo and 4 green onions for leek.  This literally disappeared within ten minutes after I put it out.  A double batch has been requested for the upcoming 4th of July party.  Thanks for the recipe, Eileen!

Fantastic dip!!  I decreased the butter to 1 Tbl. (was plenty!), and used light mayonnaise - worked out fine!  I also added 1 clove of garlic, minced, which was key, and added another leek (I love them!).  Serve with tortilla chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first artichoke dip I ever made.  I used pre-grated parmesan cheese which was ok but next time I will shred fresh parmesan.  Everyone enjoyed the dip and I was asked for the recipe.  I served with wheat crackers and it was delicious.

This was delicious!  I added 1/2 Cup Monterrey Jack Cheese as others had recommended.  I couldn't find jars of roasted red peppers, so I also did my own - which was MUCH easier than I expected.  I used 2 Red Peppers - cut in half lengthwise, clean out seeds, place on broiler pan.  I drizzled Olive Oil over the top, broiled, turning every 1.5-2 minutes until the tops were charred.  I immediately placed them in a brown paper bag to cool.  When I was ready, I simply peeled the skins off and voila - I had roasted red peppers!

I took the leftovers and mixed them with brown rice.  I then had a couple of lunches on wheat tortilla wraps - wonderful!

Absolutely delicious!  Grocery store didn't have leeks so I used an onion instead.  Next time I'll double the recipe because this doesn't make much.  Barely enough to cover bottom of 8x8 pan.

This recipe was pretty good.  It tasted very similar to the spinach artichoke recipe I have but that may have been because I used shallots instead of leek.  I will try it again and buy the leek.  Used more parm than it called for cause we like cheese!  Thanks for the recipe.

AWESOME!  I made this for a wine and cheese party last night.  All recipes used different cheeses.  This was fantastic!  I made a double recipe and there were no leftovers!  I'm KNOW I will be making this to take to future parties.  Really good and not too cheesey, but had great flavor.  Served with Lahvosh flat bread.

Made a few minor changes (just can't help myself!)...used green onions instead of leek and added a small garlic clove.  I roasted my own red peppers and added about an ounce of cream cheese.  Yum Yum!  Rave reviews from the party I took it to.  Thanks for the recipe :-)

I cook A LOT and this is definitely the recipe that I have received the most comments on - it disappears fast and I always double and triple the recipe.

The only alteration I've done is to grill my own red peppers.  It's cheaper and adds a really fresh flavor.

Very good, thanks. I think I'll add red pepper flakes next time, like one of the other reviewers suggested. It could have used a little more zing, but I'll definitely make it again.

Not a bad recipe, but just not my thing.  I think I would just stick with a regular old spinach dip instead.  I just didn't like the blend of flavors too much (and I love artichokes and roasted red peppers), and I don't think my guests did either....I had a lot left over. Thanks anyway!

Excellent.  I used a jar of roasted red peppers w/ garlic cloves and used red onion instead of the leek.  Took it to a party and it got great reviews.  Also good w/ tortilla chips.  Will definitely make again.

First I have to say that this recipe is excellent how it is. I did alter it however the second time around. I added six green onions instead of the leek, and added 5 large minced garlic cloves. These changes made it perfect for my tastes and my family as well. I also tried it with tortilla chips, pita chips, toasted pita bread, but my favorite was wrapping it in some warmed tortillas. I have made this several times in the last couple of months, and it has been a success every time.

Absolutely fabulous.  I make this all the time because everyone is always asking me to bring it to their parties and to e-mail them the recipe.  Huge hit!  I double the recipe and the bowl is always practically licked clean.  Thanks Eileen!

This was wonderful!  Other reviewers noted that this  was not a very pretty-looking dish, but we thought it was bright and colorful!  Instead of buying the jar of peppers, I just roasted 3 small ones myself.  To cut down on the grease that the marinated artichokes can have, I used the canned variety.  The smell was wonderful and our guests devoured it within minutes!

I made this for a cocktail party and it was a huge hit.  People asked for the recipe and it was gone rather quickly.  I served it with thin baguette slices and crackers.  I agree that it looks kind of ugly, I think I will work on more attractive presentation when I make it again this weekend.

Took this to a church potluck and it was a big hit.  Full of taste; don't need a lot per cracker.  Couldn't find a leek so used a bunch of green onions; think it would have been even better with the leek.  If you use good quality, fresh grated parmesan, as I did, you probably could use a bit less, maybe 1/2 cup.  But overall this was a winner.  Will definitely be making it again.

Unfortunately this recipe was just okay.  I thought it was too oily, and it needed something more - a little bland.  I thought 3/4 cup of cheese would be plenty but it wasn't creamy at all and I couldn't really taste the cheese in the dip.

This recipe was just okay. Very bland. I even followed the one reviewer's suggestion to add garlic, which would have given this dish even more flavor. Not sure what it needed, but it was definitely lacking in the flavor department.

I've made this several times for dinner parties, and never changed a thing.  I think it's fantastic.  It's true that it's not as cheesy and creamy as some hot dips, but that's actually one of the things I like about it:  when you're eating this one, you feel a little more like you're eating actual vegetables, and not just hot cream cheese on a cracker.  (Not that there's anything at all wrong with hot cream cheese on a cracker, mind you!)  I do think that it's important with this one to use real (and preferably freshly grated) parmesean, the best that you can find or afford; the powdered stuff in the green box won't have a strong enough flavor and won't melt or brown properly.

I added 1/8 cup chopped scallions and omitted the butter & leek, just due to calories & ease of preparation.  I also added 1 tsp garlic powder and used a total of 1/3 cup of mayonaise.  I brought this to a New Year's Eve party last night where there was a lot of food and this was the only dish that was completely eaten.

I was trying to match a restaurant recipe (from Racines in Denver, CO) so I took out the leek and substituted cream cheese for the mayo. It was delicious and very close to the restaurant. You need to add more cream cheese than mayo though to make it creamy, about 1/2 cup for a halved recipe, and around 1 cup for then full recipe. Just eyeball it. Also I'd suggest roasting your own red peppers, I used one full pepper for the halved recipe.

Fabulous! I followed this recipe, using my own roasted red peppers, but also added 1/2 cup cheese(you want something with a bite).I used aged cheddar and a few slices crumbled jalapeno havarti. I also added 2 cloves minced garlic, and used regular Hellmanns mayo. I didn
't find it neccessary to increase this from the 3 Tablespoons called for.

The best! I added a little more mayo than called for to thicken it based on other reviews.  I also added some minced garlic.  I have made it for three parties now, and everyone raves about it.  I agree that it is not the most attractive dip.  I transfer it to a small chili crock and it seems to make it appear a little more attractive. If your not sure if you should try this recipe, you should! Thanks Eileen!

This was a big hit. Served with quarters of small pita pockets.  I reduced the serving size to 10, that was a mistake.  I had such a small bowl of dip for 10 people I was almost two embarrassed to put it out.  Keep the serving size at 32 if you are planning it for a sizable gathering.

Not bad, though I didn't have a leek or green onions, so I had to use a small white onion. I don't recommend doing so, the onion slightly overpowered all the other flavors. That is my fault though, not the recipe's. Thanks.

Yummy!!!! Everyone always requests me to bring along this dish to family gatherings. I serve it with pita bread sliced into little triangles, the best dip I have ever tasted

This is my new favorite dip. I added a clove of garlic in with the leeks, and I accidentally used 12 oz. of roasted peppers, but I thought the amount was perfect! I like this much better than the creamy versions. Served with baked pita chips.

A favorite at our new years party! (I'm a little behind on rating this) Everyone loved it - I even forgot to add the mayo until the end...which worked out because of a lactose-intolerant friend. The recipe just wasn't as creamy as it could've been. Still delicious!

I made my a little hartier by cooking up a chicken breast cutting it in to small cubes.  My frilends and family love it.  I make it for every party!

Tasty, but I like more fat with my cheese, so I tend to add some mayo.

Very good medly.  I used an onion instead of a leek, added cayanne pepper since my artichoes were not marinated.  I also used fresh roasted red peppers.  I used a trio of cheeses including cream cheese in place of the mayonaise, parmeseacn and feta.  I also added garlic and jalapenos as others suggested.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe, thanks!

This fed six people nicely with no leftovers. I did add about 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. Used light mayo and it seemed to turn out just fine. A friend who is a wonderful cook said she wanted my recipe so I know it must have been good.

It was a very pretty dish. If I liked peppers I may have liked this dish more. Not a bad flavor by any means, just not my preference.

three dips on the table and this one was devoured before the others were barely touched.  i was proud to have made it.  Added garlic as suggested and used a jar of pimento peppers instead b/c they were a lot cheaper

I have wanted to make this for some time and was disappointed with the end results. The appearance is beautiful because of the red peppers but the taste was just O.K. I think it may be better today after the flavors have melded together. I left out the leek and substituted onions in its place. I don't think that would have affected the recipe that much. Maybe more cheese? And cream cheese?

This recipe was really good.  The second time I made it I punched up the flavor with a white onion instead of a leek and also sauteed in two teaspoons of minced garlic and two teaspoons of hot pepper sauce (ex Tabasco).  I also took other reviewer's advice and added one more tablespoon of mayonnaise.  Much better.  Everyone loved it.

this was my first time making dip, and it turned out really well.  i didn't have any leeks, so i used shallots and green onions instead.  i also added some garlic, tobasco, and lots of fresh ground black pepper. it turned out great.

This was very good-although I do agree with a previous poster that it does need a little kick to it.  Next time I will add red pepper flakes to it.  But it was very good!

I adjusted the recipe to make 45 servings when I was printing it out, it fit perfectly in a glass 9inch pie dish. This was requested by many people at my son's birthday. Very good and simple to make. A keeper!

I added 1/2 grated pepper jack and used 4 tbs. mayo instead of 3 to stretch this recipe, and it came out great.  The second time I made this, I used a cheaper mayonaise, and there was a lot of grease in the dip when it came out of the oven--be sure to use Hellmann's or Kraft.  I found that some white onion can be substituted for the leek.  I also put some cayenne pepper in to spice it up more.

Very tasty and a nice change from cream cheese/sour cream dips. I added some minced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes, as well as salt (tasted before transferring to baking dish and def needed salt). This is basically veggies loosely held together with the mayo and parm. I think it would adapt well to additions, inc other veggies/seasonings, even a bit of cream cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

This tasted good, but it was a bit too much "savory" for my tastes. If I make it again, I wouldn't just drain the artichokes, I'd rinse them to get off the vinegar. I'd also drain the butter from the combination before putting it in the pan for the oven.

This was just ok for me. Kind of bland - so I added garlic and pepper. It was pretty greasy - even after patting down the peppers and hearts with paper towels. I made it for a Halloween party and it was one of the few things leftover. I doubt it will go into my regular rotation - but maybe with some tweaking it could be better.

Excellent recipe as is, but I have altered it to fit my tastes, and I love it even more.  I substitute six green onions, only the whites, for the leek. Also, I'm a garlic lover, so I added a few fresh cloves, minced.  From crackers to bread, I have tried it all. But really, tortilla chips work perfectly fine with this. If you can find flour tortilla chips, you'll love it even more.

this was pretty good. it came out very oily, which I'm sure was my fault for not draining the artichokes & peppers better. I used green onions instead of a leek, and added some shredded romano cheese in addition to parmesan. next time I'll add crushed red pepper flakes because it could use a bit of spiciness, in my opinion. this would be good with toasted baguette slices.

This is just plain freakin' delicious.  If you are tired of the same old artichoke dip, please make this.  I don't use marinated chokes though, I buy canned artichokes usually in brine of some sort.  I love it because you are only using 3 tbsps of mayo.  The red pepper gives it zip.  Bring copies of the recipe, you will be asked.

Simple and delicious. I added more than double the mayo, but used light without any problem. I served this on store bought garlic flavored pita chips. We were scraping the bowl after 20 minutes.

Very good and easy - a nice alternative to the ultra-creamy, rich artichoke dip that most people make.  I used light Miracle Whip and added some minced garlic (that I cooked briefly) and it turned out perfect scooped up on sliced of french bread.

Everyone loved it.  I added a little minced garlic as others suggested to give it a little more flavor.  Very good!

We thought this was good, but thought it needed cream cheese, or sour cream added to it. I like the red peppers in it though. They really go good with the artichokes!

This dip was delicious!  I toped it with a little bit of extra parmesan before baking and served it with crackers.

A clear hit. Made this with a Christmas dinner on crostini, came out terrific. RAVE reviews -- far surpassed the turkey (although maybe that was my fault ;). Woukd make again and again. I used fresh, home-made roasted peppers -- I think this made a difference. I would also try with some onion, with some green onion, or possibly with some red onion as well.

OMG!!!  This is the best artichoke-Roasted Red Pepper Dip EVER!!!!  My husband and I were just eating it with a fork by the end, and we were so full there was no space for dinner.  Ddefinatly add the pepper jack cheese and garlic.  I'm not a huge leek fan so we used green onions which worked perfectly!!!  Best stuff ever.  And we even used low fat mayo!

This dip disappeared every time I put more out!  I recently had 5 girlfriends over and they loved it.  The Parmesan and mayonnaise give it a little tang and I loved the flavor of the leek opposed to an onion flavor.

Excellent, cept I did alter it a bit.  Left out the butter and leeks, made my own homemade and roasted peppers (roast pepper over flame until peppers are burnt, then place them in paper bag, let them cool off, then peel skin).  I added 1-2 cloves of minced garlic and just handmixed all the ingredients, then baked it, no need to cook it over the stove.  Served these with pita chips, they were great.

My guest hates onions, so we made half according to directions, and the other half leek-free, which turned out alright too.  We had our dip atop country italian bread, which was the perfect level of softness.

This is a nice change to the Artichoke Dip that I make so often.  I didn't have a leek and used 1 can of regular
artichoke hearts instead of the marinated ones.  I found that 3 Tbsp of mayo(reg. Hellmann's is the best!) was not nearly enough and used about 3/4 of a cup.  I also added grated Monterey Jack cheese as was mentioned in a few other reviews. I like to serve it with taco chips.  It was delicious and devoured quickly by our guests.
