I made this sauce exactly like the recipe except I did not puree the strawberries because I wanted bits of fruit in it. I did have to add a little more cornstarch mixture to thicken it up.  With that said, though, this is a great sauce for pancakes, ice cream, cheesecake, or pound cake. Just the perfect sweetness for my taste.

Great sauce, love the balsamic. Could use some lemon juice, I thought.

As always, Chef John, delicious! I paired this with a flourless chocolate cake (from this site) and while the cake was good alone, this sauce made the cake outstanding!

Awesome!!!!  Now Chef John, Can you freeze this sauce at all??  Or do you have a recipe for one to freeze??  It is just my hubby and me and I don't know how long this would last.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out great. It wasn't overly sweet and thickened up nicely. I served it over Italian cheesecake.

This sauce is amazing!! I couldn't stop tasting it! I didn't have fresh strawberries, so I thawed 2 cups of frozen strawberries and it turned out perfect. I also omitted the 2 Tbsps of water since the frozen strawberries created enough juice once they thawed. Now, I wish my cheesecake had turned out just as a great, but it was my first time to bake one. I think I will try Chef John's recipe next time! :) Thanks for a super easy and yummy sauce recipe!

Made exactly from recipe.  It was great over garbanzo bean chocolate cake from this site (also 5 star). By the way, one pint of strawberries is 2.3 cups.  I would go light oin the sugar. Sauce was also good on ice cream and waffles.

I always use this when I make cheesecake. The balsamic vinegar is a rather interesting touch. You really need to watch it after you put a cover on it. Too many times have I checked on it, and then had it boil over a minute later. It really seems to ruin the consistency of the sauce - makes it thinner, I think. One thing I've started doing is leaving it in the blender with the cover off after pureeing it. I've found that it makes the sauce a little thicker. Anyway, I love this recipe!

I made this to go over some mini cheesecakes this weekend.  It was simple and quick to fix and it was DELICIOUS!  Everyone loved it.  It made a ton, so I froze half to use later - I'm envisioning pancake and waffle topping...ice cream topping...and perhaps even a chicken dish!

Delicious! I added a little more cornstarch to thicken the sauce more. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used Arbor Mist's Strawberry Mango wine... To die for! I baked a white cake, used homemade whip cream and drizzled over that! Mmm!

I've been making this recipe for my strawberry tarts for years.  I add cornstarch and cook it long enough to get a thick consistency.  I refrig overnite before spooning into my baked tart shells.  The only difference I make is using lemon juice to taste instead of balsamic vinegar.  Everyone loves my tarts!  Put a dollop of whipped cream or cool whip on top (I like mine as is) and it's a delicious dessert.  Oh, I also add just a tiny pinch of salt while cooking to bring out the flavor and I sometimes use red food coloring to brighten it up.

Paired this beautifully balanced sauce with vanilla cheesecake. Thank you for the recipe! This is definitely my go-to for strawberry sauce from now on. The balsamic vinegar added a lovely flavor.

Easy recipe, came out perfect and balanced the creaminess of the strawberry frozen mousse I served with it. I added a bit more balsamic but thats just a matter of taste.

Fantastic. However used lots of lemon juice instead of vinegar.  Made this with a 6 year old girl and it was so easy she did it mostly alone.  Go Addi!

Amazing recipe! I added a little bit of both vanilla and almond extract for flavor, and it turned out wonderfully.  With the amount of cornstarch in the recipe, it is the consistency of a medium sauce; slightly thick, but still runny. I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken it up for a topping.

Absolutely delicious! I added lemon zest and an extra splash of balsamic vinegar. I did not blend the strawberries as I was using this for cheese blintzes. Still licking my lips!

This sauce is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except that I sliced my strawberries with my egg slicer before adding them to the pan and then I did not have to puree it afterwards because they broke down almost to a puree.

I used this recipe with fresh blackberries instead of strawberries. I  also used a potato masher (gently) while they were simmering instead of pureeing for extra texture. The subtlety of the balsamic is amazing. This sauce is fantastic!

I used frozen strawberries and it came out well.  I also did not purée it since I didn't have a blender, but was still pleased with it.  Will definitely make it again the next time I want a strawberry sauce. It went great with cheesecake!

This sauce was great!, with that bit of balsamic...hmm!!! I didn't puree the complete batch, only half the batch as I wanted to see and taste the strawberry chunks, was perfect topped onto a cream cheese whip mixture sandwiched between the One Bowl Chocolate Cake recipe from here....My family thanked me very much!!

So easy and yummy! I can easily use this on desserts other than cheesecake (which, by the way, turned out awesome according to Chef John's recipe).

5  stars for taste—it was delicious, especially drizzled over the flourless chocolate cake I made.  I had a couple of issues, though.  No matter how long I blended it, the tiny seeds (and there were so many of them!) never pulverized—very annoying!  (Not the recipe’s fault .)  I ended up pouring it through a fine mesh strainer.  Also, even though my strawberries were ripe and red, my sauce was pink and stayed that way even after refrigerating.  Out of season strawberries, perhaps?  Again, not the recipe’s fault—this  is a lovely sauce.

We were discussing balsamic vinegar at our Easter dinner. 'It's my secret ingredient in so many dishes,' my daughter-in-law said. I said nothing...until she tasted this amazing strawberry sauce over chocolate cake and said how much she loved it. Then I told her about the secret ingredient. Everyone at the table loved it. I made it exactly as written and will make it again and again.  Thank you!

This was the perfect sauce...so quick and so simple!  I halved the entire recipe because I didn't have enough strawberries to use in the sauce plus use as a topping for my cheesecake.   It was absolutely delicious and it was enough for one cheesecake.  Initially I planned to omit the balsamic vinegar but I'm so glad I didn't.  It definitely adds a pleasant tang to the flavour.  Chef John, thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

This sauce is delicious, quick and easy! I made it just as the recipes says, but added a bit more cornstarch to make it a little thicker. I puréed it with my immersion blender. I spooned it over cheesecake and it was perfect!

Impeccably brilliant! Everyone  had it on ice cream and or cheesecake. Then at 1 a.m. caught my husband at the fridge eating the sauce out of the jar! He's usually the chef in the family, a real great one I might add, but this sauce he asks me to make when we go strawberry picking. I actually didn't puree the strawberries as I love a little chunkiness (to chew and savor when eating it with my cheesecake) just chopped them up nice and itty bitty in the pot. I won't lie, since I've seen my husband sneaking spoonfuls of it, I eat it on it's own as well sometimes, just not in the middle of the night ;-). Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Awesome sauce!! Made this to serve with a semifreddo dessert I made for my son's birthday dinner. The balsamic balanced the sweetness of both the strawberry sauce and the dessert! Did add double the balsamic vinegar as I had more than a pint of strawberries. Froze some of the leftovers and put some in the fridge. Thanks Chef John! Your recipes always work!

I have just made this to have with a sweet chocolate and almond cake.  The sauce is absolutely beautiful, a little tarty but that's what you want when having with sweet chocolate.  If to tarty add extra sugar but I didn't want to.

I made this using 2 cups of whole frozen strawberries.  It turned out perfect to top my flourless chocolate cake. I did use an immersion blender as I did not want purée, but wanted the sauce with a few chunks so this was easier to control. Definitely will use this recipe again.

Used frozen strawberries and pureed with an immersion blender. Absolutely delicious over homemade angel food cake! The balsamic adds a great dimension to the flavor - and the house smelled amazing while it simmered!

It taste good but mine came out pureed and did not look like his.  I don't know how he used a blender to puree as the recipe calls for and had it come out looking like this?  The strawberries look much like they have been stewed and loose their color.  Next time I will not puree and add fresh berries at the end

Made it several times, sometimes I purée and other times I don't. It's amazing both ways.

I really enjoyed this sauce with some cheesecake I had. I used strawberries that were somewhat overripe as they didn't taste as good on their own. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar with added sugar and it still tasted great. My mom said it could go on ice cream too after she tasted some off of the spoon. I agree & it could probably be eaten by itself. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this recipe. I think will be perfect for cakes that are mildly sweet to give a boost in flavor to them. I read that someone had to add a bit extra corn starch well to my taste, as long as you let it cool down this will get rid of its runny texture and after you put it in the fridge it will thicken a bit more. My recommendation would be to let it rest overnight in the fridge. It will make a difference. I also think that you can use about 2 or 3 tbsp of sugar if your strawberries are very sweet.

Made this for the first time on Father's Day 2014, serving it over Sour Cream Angel Food Cake from Kroger. We all really liked it! I followed the recipe except didn't bother to thicken it. Instead, I used the emulsifier to blend the cooked berries into the sweetened liquid. When everything had cooled a bit, I added an additional pint of berries to the mixture.

Just wonderful.  Served it with cheesecake for Easter.  I used my food processor instead of a blender and it worked just fine.  I doubled the recipe for one cheesecake and there was enough leftover to top one bowl of ice cream.

Really simple, and REALLY good. It didn't thicken up as much as I like it,  but that's easily remedied with a bit more cornstarch. An elegant taste for such a simple recipe. If I had a fresh lemon, I might've added a bit of zest just to brighten it a tad.

This sauce was very easy and thickened perfectly.  I chopped up the fresh strawberries before cooking and decided not to puree because I like the pieces of fruit in it.  One problem I had was that the sauce kept overflowing the pan when I left the lid on.  I had to take it off for the last 7 minutes.  We ate this on waffles and it tasted really good.  The only reason I gave this sauce a four (there aren't half stars or I would given it four and a half stars) is that I did not like the tart balsamic vinegar smell while cooking.  It really turned me off, even though I love balsamic vinegar.  I will make this again but replace the vinegar with lemon juice.  Thanks, Chef!

This sauce was amazing!  I doubled the recipe and pureed half of the strawberries and sliced the rest so I could have sauce and strawberry slices.  It was wonderful!  The perfect sauce for cheesecake!

I made this sauce for the New York Cheesecake and I happened to have a little bit of vanilla ice cream sitting around. The cheesecake is for tomorrow. At the point in the recipe before the cornstarch mixer, I put aside a bit a of this glorious sauce. My mouth is in heaven! I can not think of anything that's ever been this delicious in my mouth! I believe that my tastebuds might simply explode from deliciousness-overload, if the cheesecake is even ½ scrumptious as I'm expecting it to be. I am nearly certain that this sauce has to illegal somewhere…it's just too delicious.
