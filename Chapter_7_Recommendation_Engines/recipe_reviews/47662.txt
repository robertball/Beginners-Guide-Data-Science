Very easy and tasty meal. My 2 year old son loved it! I will definitely make it again, but next time will use a bit less miso paste and a bit more water--the sauce was a little too pasty for me.

Yummy! I used a lb of meat instead.  Reminds me of something my mom used to make! Thanks for sharing!

Taste like miso with pork. The miso accented the stench of pork actually, which is not good at all. I still ate it though.

I made this exactly as stated except I used 3/4 lb of ground pork.  This has way too much miso.  I kept adding water to tone down the taste.  It ended up tasting almost like miso soup with ground pork but not as good as miso soup.

Super delicious and fairly easy.  Just prep everything and go.  The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't keep very well.  Amazing while fresh though.

So easy and delicious. LI didn't have ground meat, but want to use tofu. So, I cooked it with some shrimps and peeled edamame - even my picky 2.5 years old Loves it too. Thanks for sharing!

My 2nd time making this. Very simple but delicious recipe that my husband and 8 year old love. I used 1.5lbs of pork and doubled the rest of the recipe. Also added some seaweed at the end along with the green onions.

This was very good, tasty and quick!  I just happen to have all the ingredients without having to go to the supermarket which is a rarity.  Will definitely make this again!
