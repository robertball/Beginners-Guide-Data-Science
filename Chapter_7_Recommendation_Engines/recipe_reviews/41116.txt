Fabulous. Made this as a side dish and we loved it.  I did however, increase the Parmesan Cheese to 1 cup and used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I will be using this recipe often, not only as a side but for appetizers as well. It was easy to make and absolutely delicious. Puts a whole new light on eating the dreaded broccoli. Thanks for sharing this recipe Heather.

These are really delicious!  I modified based on the reviews I read here:  more parmesan cheese (3/4 cup), less onion, only 4 eggs, half the butter, and double the stuffing.  GREAT results.  

I think it needed the extra stuffing, to bind up the wet ingredients and make them keep their shape.  Once you take the mixture out of the fridge to make the balls, give it a good stir to really get the wet ingredients mold-able.

The flavor is great.  Really delicious and a big hit with my family.

Easy and a big hit at a party!  I couldn't find chicken flavored stuffing, so I used herb stuffing.  Was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cannot believe how good these are!! I only made them because I had half a box of stuffing that needed using up, but they are SO good that I'm going to make them for Thanksgiving dinner next week (and plenty of other times too)! The only changes I made were to use extra-sharp Cheddar (I mistakenly thought I had Parm), and also fresh brocc (I can't stand the frozen stuff). Although they were pretty easy to form into balls, you could easily just spread the mixture in a dish, and bake as directed. I'm also thinking of making them with broccoli and cauliflower. This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks so much, Heather!

This was my first time trying these, and I'll be making them again for sure, but I'm going to experiment a bit.    This time out, I subbed the parmesan for sharp cheddar, which was yummy.  My only concern is that they were to "egg-y"  Next time, less egg adn butter.  I'll also be sauteeing the onion and experimenting with adding various seasonings and possibly, sauteed mushroom.  The flavor was OK, it just seemed to be missing something.  I think these are a great nibbler, I just want to tweak them to be a bit more flavorful.

These were pretty good, but my family has always made them with two 10 oz. packaged of chopped spinach and no onion, and I like those better. Also, I baked a few of these before letting them sit, and not only was the stuffing still hard, but they leaked. Letting the mixture sit is definitely a vital step.

Easy and delicious! I saved myself a dish and some time by just covering the frozen broccoli in a large bowl w/ saran wrap and microwaved for 7 minutes, then let it drain and cool in a collander while I mixed the ingredients in that same large bowl. I used 16 oz. of chopped broccoli, 3/4 cup Parmesan, and 1.5 pkgs. of the stuffing, but kept the eggs and margarine the same. I subbed 1/4 cup dried minced onions and did garlic powder, not garlic salt, at 3/4 tsp. I made the balls slightly larger, so I ended up with 26 total. Everyone at a potluck gobbled them up and one person asked for the recipe. For something that looks like "nothing special," it sure turns out great.

Very good!  I doubled the stuffing and the broccoli...kept the wet ingredients the same....except I decreased the butter to 1/2 c. I was able to make 80- 1 inch balls that I scooped out with a cookie scoop.....I scooped them onto a cookie sheet and froze them...then put them into freezer zip lock bags for easy use. I did make 20 of them tonight and they are delicious. Thanks for a tasty appetizer!

This recipe has been a hit every single time I've made them.  I was afraid my husband would not like them because he is picky about vegetables, but he absolutely loves them.  The only thing that I do different is that I mince about 1/4 of an onion and I tell others to use as much onion according to their taste preference.  You can also even use two boxes of stuffing and they still turn out delicious!

Tasty!  There were a lot of suggestions out there.  Here is what I did.  I kept to one box stuffing mix and the full amount of broccoli and it was fine proportion-wise.  I did use only 4 eggs though and only 6 T. of butter.  They turned out great and I would recommend this combo for anyone wanting to maximize flavor and health.  If you have skinny hips and don't care - feel free to add the full butter!

An easy to prepare, inexpensive, delicious little appetizer that people LOVE!  Thanks so much!  I increased the amount of parmesan and used only about 14 cup of minced onion.  Everyone raved and they were all eaten in a flash!

Yep, YUM! And crispy! No salt, used garlic powder. 1/2 C. Butter only, 2 eggs (might use 3 next time), and used 3/4 C. Parmesan, 3/4 C. Cheddar. Delicious! Course black pepper adds a kick. A shake of basil adds depth as well. Baked for 17 minutes and they came out crisp and perfect. Boyfriend loved it, and he's not a stuffing lover. I'll keep this one for the next finger food appetizer I need!!

Way too much margarine (fat) so they come out greasy, and obviously not a real healthy appetizer.  I recommend a Zucchini Cheese Garlic Appetizer found in Allrecipes by NorthernLights.  Much tastier and moist but with much less grease!

I've made these for years and are always a hit...even with people that don't care for broccoli. I don't cook the broccoli first tho...just thaw and mix as directed...also...I use herb stuffing mix not chicken and add a little extra cheese... yummy!

This is a great recipe, however I recommend you decrease the amount of Margarine, use fresh cooked broccoli and fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  There is already enough seasoning in the stuffing mix to flavor the appetiser.  I made them at christmas and they went quicker than the potato dumplings!!!!!  Now that says something!

we make this recipe many times a year, but we use 10 oz. spinach, cooked a few mins. then drained and squeezed dry.  We only use 2 eggs if large, 3 if smaller, and 1/2 c. margarine, and use garlic powder since the stuffing mix is already seasoned.  We found it gets too mushy and greasy to work with, and this also cuts out more of the fat and cholesterol.  Very good recipe after the changes.

Very easy to make and they taste great! Some changes I would recommend:
1. Use 1/2 the butter
2. Use fresh garlic
3. Don't use any salt (stuffing is salty enough)
4. Use 1 small onion

Very good recipe!  Since broccoli is among my favorite foods, I was hoping they would have more of a broccoli flavor (I know I'm probably in the minority there!).  I can definitely see how non-broccoli lovers would still enjoy this dish -- the more finely chopped the broccoli, the less you can tell it's even in there.  For that reason I'll probably use bigger pieces next time -- I can only imagine how good this would be with fresh broccoli.  I did cut back on the butter to 1/2 cup to keep down the fat and calories, and added some minced garlic which blended nicely with the other flavors.  I think they'd be even better with a greater amount of parmesan.  Thanks for this crowd-pleasing, easy-to-make recipe!

Surprisingly good!  I used one 14 oz. bag frozen broccoli and two packages of stuffing.  Really good and easy, my group loved them.  I liked them best at room temp.

This was not to bad should have put less parmesan in it.  As one reviewer suggested I cooked the whole batch up into a 9 inch glass pan, otherwise was pretty good.

I can not rate this yet I need a question answered. Where do I go to ask if I can make these broccoli balls and freeze them and just reheat when I am ready to use.

It was absolutely delicious. My entire family loved it and requested the recipe.   The only complain they had was that it was too salty.   I will definitely make it again but next time I will take out the butter completely or use unsalted butter. I hope this will make it less salty.

Easy to make and good!  I doubled the amount of brocoli and used fresh instead of frozen and added chopped parsley.  I used fresh garlic and omitted the garlic salt.  Great!

Always a hit.  I usually have to double the recipe, because they are so popular.  I use a 16 oz bag of broccoli & double the cheese.

I thought this was yummy however I do agree with the other people I will be using a little more cheese next time and skip the garlic salt.  I wasn't really that hungry but I couldn't stop eating them.

I made a mistake and purchased cut broccoli, not chopped.  Therefore the pieces of vegetable was too large to make into balls.  I noticed this after all the ingredients was mixed.  SO what I did was put all of it in a baking dish and baked it.  Even though it wasn't balls the dish was still delish.

I thought these were going to be sooo good, but they weren't my favorite.... They were impossible for me to roll and some of them fell apart while they were baking. Not sure why I followed the recipe and ingredients to a "T". I wouldn't make these again, thanks for the interesting recipe.

I made exactly as stated - except for decreasing the onion as many suggested - I found that they were way too buttery - if I do try again, I will cut the butter in half.

These are same as spinach ball recipe.  Took to a party and everyone loved them.  I have made several times and had to bump this to a 5 star.  Always get asked for recipe.  And while there are a lot of bad for you ingredients (margarine and eggs) at least you get some really good for you broccoli.

Didn't really care for these. The flavor of the stuffing was too overpowering for me. I think I would have preferred a more "traditional" broccoli popper (if there is such a thing). Thanks anyways.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and loved them. Next time, I will try them with shredded zucchini instead of broccoli.  I will definitely make these again.

These were just ok. They needed some more spice I think. I served them as our main course with pasta sauce. My toddler ate them so that was awesome. I'm going to play with them a bit more and see if I can get the rating up.

These are really good. Kind of fatty, but I cut it down to 4 eggs and just did a stick of margarine (probably don't even need that much) and they still turned out really good. Kind of like a casserole in a ball. Yummy.

Excellent!  My children (5 and 1) devoured it and hardly realized it was full of broccoli.  Next time I will dice the broccoli a little finer to make a smoother texture and I will reduce the butter a bit but otherwise this was great!

thanks for sharing,Heather, this was a fantastic recipe !! I made it for a church potluck supper the very day that i found it on allrecipes.com. Everyone raved about it. The only change I made was to bake in 9x13 baking dish  instead of forming individual balls.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but I was not able to get proper ball form. The egg dripped to the bottom of each ball and baked underneath each ball, so I couldn't serve them, however the taste was fine.

I thought these were great!  I thought all the ingredients were perfectly measured; I wouldn't add or lessen anything.  I will definately make these again as an appetizer, but also as a side dish for dinner.  Easy and GOOD!!!  Thanks!

The only time I make appetizers is to take to parties or get together and I like to take something extra special. These are just ok. Not terrible but not great either. I wont make them again but if someone else did, I would eat one. No surprises.  The flavor after they are done baking is what you would expect. Like you put lots of broccoli in your box of stuffing mix. Which isn't bad, just not what I want to take to a party.

I simply can't stop eating these, I've found I like them warmed as cold too me didn't taste as good.  I made them according to the recipe EXCEPT  I used Savory Herb Stove Top stuffing mix instead of Chicken flavored as I like my food a with a kick and more spices....but I'm making them again this morning (yes they are that good) but this time I'm using 1/2 Broccoli and 1/2 Cauliflower so I'll let you know how they turn out.  Extremely good snack, even for breakfast with coffee!!

Delicious!  I took previous advice and only used 1/2 cup of butter.  I also used less onions.  With less moisture to absorb I only had to let the combined mixture set in the fridge about 20 minutes before shaping into balls.  Everyone enjoyed these!

These were SO YUMMY!!  The only thing I changed is I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  They turned out absolutely wonderful and we gobbled them right up!  Very quick and easy.  I definately will be making them again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Didn't need to cook the broccoli because it was thawed.  Made the changes recommended by others:  more cheese and less eggs and butter.  Everyone liked them a lot, but me - I didn't care for them.  I'm not a big boxed stuffing fan so that is probably why.

These were very tastey, they would taste great paired with ritz crackers. The only thing I would do differently is to add more cheese. A great appetizer!

I prepared it the night before and then baked when guests arrived.  None was left; they were a hit and everyone asked for the recipe.  It must have been good then!!!

Everyone loved these.  I served them as a side dish, but they would do well at a party.  I thought they were too salty, but everyone else thought they were just perfect.  The stuffing is moist and the balls hold together very well.

These were GREAT!  I made them as a side dish with dinner.  At first my fiance was very unhappy to hear that I was making broccoli for dinner, but we both gobbled them up and were wishing I had made more!

These were very good.  Very easy to prepare, but quite messy to roll up.  I added more broccoli and more stuffing mix (almost 2 pkgs.) but left the liquids the same and they were still very moist for rolling.  Will definitly make again.  Everyone like them!!  I got about 45 - 50 balls too, instead of 36.

The recipe itself is great! Instead of the pre-packaged stuffing mix, I used a recipe I found on Allrecipes.com called Savory Stuffing Bread, it is amazing! I also used fresh, steamed broccoli, real butter and real garlic. Fabulous!

We loved it! My son who is a picky eater had seconds!  I changed a few things, I added 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese, used only 5 eggs,  cooked (fried in pan) the onions, used fresh broccoli and added the powdered spice mix that comes in dressing box, but will use half the powder mix next time because it was a bit salty. Served it with corn on the cob and caesar salad.

I love this recipe.  Great for appetizers or as an extra added side for dinner.  Great way to make my kids eat a vegetable.  I tried something different.  I combined 1/4 cup of swiss, 1/4 cup of sharp cheddar and 1/3 cup of parm. I sauteed 1/4 cup of fresh onions with 2 cloves of minced garlic, only used 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of butter.  Once the mixture was done, I let it sit for 10 minutes before placing in muffin tin pans.  They were amazing.

Not bad, my boyfriend liked it. It was a good way for me to use up the extra broccoli I had and a great thing to have in the fridge when I needed something to snack on. We enjoyed it hot and cold. Although it was tasty, I'm not sure if I was blown away by it. I did like the fact that it was easy to make.

Outstanding! These were such a hit with everyone and super easy. I used fresh broccoli (steamed it then chopped up) and more than what was called for. I also only used 1/2 cup butter and I think you could prob use even less. Since I couldn't use bread stuffing since I am gluten free, I used an entire can of gluten free seasoned bread crumbs. They take longer to bake than what recipe calls for and I turned in the broiler for a few minutes to brown tops as turning them individually they would fall apart a little. Also, let them sit out for like 5 minutes before serving and they will no longer stick to foil (I foil lined my cookie sheet easy clean up). I plan to try this with cauliflower next time. Great recipe!

I have made this twice and everyone liked it.  I followed a number of the reviews and decreased the butter to 6 Tbs and eggs to 4 and increased the cheese.  Sauteed the onion (and used less) with minced garlic.  I added some chicken or vegetable stock, to make up for the reduction in liquid I was creating by reducing butter and eggs.  After baking them, I tossed them in a crockpot on Low, to keep them warm for serving (although I also like them at room temp).  Used parmesan the first time, cheddar the second--liked it both ways.

I LOVED IT! So did my friend and my daughter.  I did switch it up a bit but left the recipe alone. I made them into muffins, I used cooking spray and the same heat from instructions and baked for a 1/2 hour and turned the muffin tins (could just be my oven) until a little bit brown. I also put the cooked broccoli in the food processor because the bag of frozen broccoli I bought I thought the pieces were to big to make balls or muffins with. We had some that night and I noshed on the rest the next day...all day. It yielded 18 muffins.

Only used a stick of butter and 3 eggs, with a 5oz package of stove top stuffing.  I sauteed the onions in the butter when melting it and steamed fresh broccoli rather than a box.  Really good!!

I made these for my friends and they were a huge hit. I love broccoli and will definitely be making these again! The only substitutions I made was I used about a quarter or a red onion (I'm not a big onion fan), and used a clove of real minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.

I made a few changes.  I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup margarine.  I also used fresh broccoli.  I chopped the florets and then sautéed them with the onion until they were soft.  I'm not a fan of boiling or steaming veges.  I also cooked them a bit longer than 10 minutes because I think I made the balls a little on the big side.  Everyone loved them!  So tasty.  I will definitely make them again.

I made this last year on Christmas Eve. It was such a big hit, there were no leftovers. I'm going to make again this year. I mix everything up the day before and roll in balls, refrigerate. That way saves time in the kitchen the day of your party.

Love it!  I used sharp cheddar instead of parm and upped the garlic. Had to keep them in the oven longer than specified, as I rolled the balls larger than 1 inch. Golden-brown is a nice rule of thumb to use.  Will definitely make these again!

Made these yesterday  as test  to see if I liked them well enough to take to family holiday party  Served with garlic mayo. I liked them warm or cold. I used  1/2  amt of butter, 4 eggs (will try with 3 next time)  &  little extra stuffing & they were just fine to roll & bake.   Plan to make to take to party tomorrow, so we'll see how they go.

I really liked these, and it was a great way to get my daughter to eat broccoli.  They were also pretty easy to make.  I followed the recipe as is, although next time, I may use less butter as the pan I baked these on had a lot of grease/butter on it when I pulled them out of the oven.  Will become a regular in house as I don't really like broccoli plain.

I made these for a potluck and everybody wasn't sure about them till they tried a bite.  Really easy and fairly healthy!

Big disappointment... I tried this recipe twice and each time I was let down... It took forever for the balls to brown and they never held a nice "ball" shape. This recipe just isn't for me and I probably wont be trying this recipe again.. However, its always nice to try something new thanks for sharing.

Stuffing is one of my fav side dishes. I thought these were great. I will have to figure out a healthier version though. Way to much butter and eggs!! Not the healthiest but definitely delicious.

Really tasty! Next time I'll try garlic powder instead of garlic salt, cause I found them a bit salty. Other than that really good!

I served these for my boyfriend and myself. I quite liked them, but he didn't. Perhaps if I were to serve them at a party and see others rave about them like other reviewers did, I would like them more. I think I'll keep the recipe for a while and test it on other people. I'll add more Parmesan next time, as recommended.

Made these on Christmas Day. They turned out well. I used sharp sliced cheddar cheese instead of parm. Also have the mix chill for at least 1 hour!!

A HUGE hit at a family party.  Next time I will use much less butter, and will try with an egg white, or egg substitute, as we are cholesterol aware.  So delicious, my sister asked us not to take any leftovers home, so she could have more...and she's pretty hard to impress!

I made these tonight as a side dish for our chicken dinner and they were very tasty! Mine turned out a little dry, but that was my fault for trying to *healthify* them. I used about 1-1/4 cups egg beaters instead of the whole eggs and didn't add the butter at all, which is probably why they ended up a little dry, but the flavor was great! I will definately make these again using the original recipe (and the healthified one when I need to)! Thanks for posting. :)

These were savory and good overall. I used parsley and some cheddar cheese and doubled the stuffing. Next time I will use reduced sodium chicken stuffing since it is a bit too salty for my taste and unsalted butter.

I am going to give this 5 stars because they tasted really good.  They were too moist to roll though.  I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to soak up all of the moisture.  Maybe I used too much butter?  Anyway they were yummy and my family loved them.

I’ve been making this recipe for years and it never disappoints. I don’t change a thing. I always get asked for the recipe whenever I bring these to a party or potluck. I agree with other reviewers that these are delish hot or cold. I love being able to bring these to my office holiday potluck luncheon and not have to worry about them being warm. Yum!

Just O.K.  I made them with the suggested changes...less eggs and butter, but more parmesean cheese.  Two people asked for the recipe.  However, I don't think I would make them again.

I was looking forward to making these. I love broccoli and thought what a fun unique way to use it.  Well I thought it was horrible. I was amazed how many people gave it good reviews. I even used fresh broccoli to get more flavor. I used less eggs as other reviewers suggested. On account of it being to eggy with 6. I think the flavor or the dried stuffing was to overpowering and the rest of the flavors didn't seem to be anything special. But give it a try , other people loved them.

First time making these or anything like them. I cut the recipe in thirds to use up the extra fresh broccoli I had on hand.
I also used my large cookie scoop, so these are more like 2" balls, actually perfect to go with a main dish. I doubled the bake time and the are perfect!!!
Very easy, very delicious !

Outstanding... I adapted the recipe slightly.  Used Herb Flavored Stove Top (not chicken), and used 50% more broccoli. Last 7 min in oven, sprinkled on some Italian bread crumbs. #crowdpleaser

I am a garlic lover, so more garlic, more parm. cheese, and I would have cut up the broccoli more, as it seemed a bit like a 'tree sticking out' of the ball... but they tasted great and hot or cold... loving this site, find most comments really helpful,

Delish!!!  Great easy recipe.  Made this last night when friends came over, it was very fast and easy to make and tasted GREAT!!  Loved by one and all!!  Only grated cheese I had was mozzarella,  I made 18 instead of 36 and put them cup cake pans instead of baking sheet.  They were wonderful, served with bell pepper lasagna  from this site and it ended up being a great dinner!!  I am already planning to make them again, as in tonight!!!

Do yourself a favor and make this recipe! You will not regret it!!!

These had a nice presentation but tasted like boxed stuffing to me.  I won’t make them again.

These taste great, but there is waaaayyyyy too much butter.  I think I would cut the butter content in half next time.

Like some suggested, I cut the margarine in half, used 4 eggs, and increased the parmesan to 3/4 cup. I also used 2 cups of the stuffing mix rather than the whole envelope. The balls were more stuffing flavored than broccoli, which I wish would have been more prominent. I will probably make again, but I'll try adding more broccoli and maybe switch to panko crumbs or a mix of stuffing and panko.

Always gone pretty quickly. I tend to make them a bit bigger and serve them with a dip like sour cream mixed with garlic powder & lemon pepper seasoning.  I also have mixed french dressing with sour cream - makes a yummy sauce, too.

My husband loved these.  This is second time making these.  I used Country style stuffing instead (mashed up a little) and I use unsalted butter.  Chopped up broccoli a little more this time as well.  They were even better than the first time.  Our neighbors liked these as well.  Gave the wife the recipe.

These were really good. My 7 year old granddaughter absolutely loved them! I used frozen riced broccoli that I steamed in the bag to try to retain more nutrients. I think the riced broccoli worked perfectly to help them get and stay in a ball shape. I may have made mine a little too big because they took about 20 minutes on 350 to get done. Other than using the riced broccoli and increasing the cook time and oven temp, the recipe worked great. Oh yeah, I also left out the onions as my family doesn't care for them.

I have a hard time finding chopped broccoli, so I normally put it in a food processor with the onions (picky kids who think they don't like onions). I love these, hot or cold!

Cut down to 3 eggs but would increase to 4.  Was very good. Made for family Sunday supper and everyone except two fussy grandsons really enjoyed it.

I made no changes, unfortunately, none of my family liked it.  It was easy to make, and certainly made a lot, but if nobody eats it, who cares.  We found it very dry and lacking in flavor.

Huge hit.  Made this for an open house, numerous people asked for recipe.  Loved the fact that it's true finger food.  I served with a bowl of ranch dressing for those who wanted a dipping sauce.

It is pretty easy to make.  I used a small cookie scoop and made 50 bites.  A good recipe for a party.  I think next time I'll cook the broccoli a little longer so I can mash it a bit more.

My family loves these and my son was excited to bring the leftovers for his lunch at school today as they are delicious either hot or cold.  Easy to make and delicious.  My changes were to use 4 eggs and 1/2 cup melted margarine---I can't imagine them being moister with the extra eggs or margarine.

I made this on Mothers Day for the first time.  Everyone was curious what it was, and the first tray was gobbled up by the time I could say Parmesan Broccoli Balls!  They were a big hit.  I only used four eggs, because that is all I had but other than that I kept to the recipe.  It is so easy to put together, just remember to leave time to chill.  I think I will prepare a batch to flash freeze to make it even easier for the next party.  A true "keeper".

Although I did 1/2 broccoli, 1/2 spinach, they still came out wonderful and held their shape. I also increased the parmesan to 1 cup and decreased the eggs to 4. This recipe is one I would repeat as a healthy alternative to meatballs that my children will eat.

I made them in muffin tins adding  shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Baked a little longer until cheese was melted and they were lightly browned.  I put some in freezer.  Quick breakfast or lunch.  Just microwaved until warm.

These were a hit! After reading some of the reviews, I made them with sharp cheddar, 4 eggs instead of six, sauteed the onions first,  I only found a 12oz package of broccoli florets,  so chopped them up after cooking. I will definitely make these again!

These are so good!! I did not use the onion because I am just not a huge fan of onions, but I did use onion powder. I also added some chili powder and that made them just perfect.

It tasted pretty good although a bit too much "breading" I think. There were left-overs, of course. You really have to seal the left-overs really, really well as the broccoli has a really strong scent.

My eight-year-old son made this for his first time cooking/planning a meal.  I did the chopping but, otherwise, he made them on his own.  We have since made them a regular part of the rotation.  They are easy to make, and use easy-to-find ingredients.  They have been well-received each time I've made them, and there are rarely leftovers.  They are good cold, however, and re-heat well.  I usually use frozen broccoli because it saves time, and I do vary the form of the parmesan some.  Follow the directions on this one (not necessarily the 'ingredients'), and they'll turn out great!

I added the extra cheese as mentioned by others but it was bland and dry.

I followed a few of the modification recommendations: more cheese and less butter.  They turned out great and I will definitely make them again.

I though this was a little to dry. I think I will try it again but adjust the ingredients a bit.
