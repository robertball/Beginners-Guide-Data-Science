Lindsayyyyyy! :) Thank you! As we "buzzed" over, I subbed with blueberries. I added 1t orange extract to the vanilla yogurt. Maybe a citrus thing, but I think it tastes lemony ... It probably tastes citrusy, but whatever - it's good! Half t might be too subtle, but 1t wasn't too much - just me yakking. ;D I sprinkled the cookie sheet with cornmeal, too. No turbinado so I sprinkled on leftover colored red sugar. With the berries bleeding, the red made it even prettier. Very light tasting & low sugar breakfast, snack ... Thanks, Girl! I think you'll be getting more reviews soon! :)
