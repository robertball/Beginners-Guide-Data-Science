Very yummy.  Would be very pretty as a salad for company.  I used fresh oranges rather than canned mandarins.

This was a very tasty salad. I did not have any grapes, so I used dried cranberries instead. This is a very good, basic, and healthy salad recipe!

A lot nuttier than I expected, but it added to the flavor, making this a very tasty side salad.

This was a wonderful salad. Juicy. Mild flavor, everything went well together and none of the flavors was too strong. What a great way to eat my spinach! Thanks Cathy, I loved it.

This was a HIT at Easter this year!! It's so yummy!! Used mixed greens(that included spinach), instead of just spinach. Made a BIG difference. Easy to make too!!
