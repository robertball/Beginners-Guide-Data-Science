This pie is always a winner.  Instead of the traditional graham cracker crust, I toast coconut in butter in a skillet and press it in a pie plate.

this was good, and had a nice flavor, but the marshmellows just didn't do it for me or my family.

I love this EASY recipe.  I started making it for my family as a teenager when I came across this recipe in a coupon flyer.  I always think it looks like egg salad in a pie shell :)

Very good.  Light and fluffy.  Next time I  might use French Vanilla pudding just for something different.

I made my own homemade graham cracker crust. I followed this recipe exact. We were divided on this pie--the kids thought the marshmallows were an excellent addition but the grownups thought they were a little weird in this pie. Either way, it was a quick pantry dessert that made for some fun around-the-table conversation.

I wasn’t sure how this would be with marshmallows, but probably one of the best banana cream pies I’ve made. Are used a Nila wafer crust instead of graham crackers!

The flavor of this pie is great, but those marshmallows are kind of surprising in the first bite.  After I got used to them, I liked it a lot.

With the way the recipe is now, I would call it a marshmallow pie with hints of banana. I made it with half the amount of marshmallows and didn't exactly measure the bananas but used enough to cover the bottom of the pie and double layer it. The next time I plan to add banana to the pudding itself.

Loved it! You can jazz this pie up as you wish, or prepare as directed--so many possibilities! So easy to make, too--and I love that there was basically one bowl to clean.  I used French Vanilla pudding, and it was delicious.  Expect the marshmallows to get very soft--almost like the texture they get when they are in ambrosia--they lose their firmness but give the pie a nice firm consistency.  Next time I think I'm going to try the coconut crust that another reviewer put on here.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty much the "All-American" cool whip, instant pudding, banana, marshmallow, graham cracker deal.  If you like the ingredients, you'll like the pie.  A homemade graham crust was the only adaptation I made.....I think it is a bit better than the pre-made, although those are super convenient.

I tried this because my husband loves marshmallow and pudding salads. I used banana cream flavor pudding instead of vanilla and threw in some coconut. DH loved it. I think it would be a bit bland if made just as written, but it's one of those recipes you can add your own creative flair to or just use what's in your pantry.

This was good, I would make again. I just wish I could figure out how to make it more marshmallow consistency. I found them to be a little too soft after being added into the mixture and setting in the frige.
