this recipe was fantastic! i made it in the slow cooker and used woodchuck which is a hard cider. i've never felt the need to review a recipe before, but i feel that this deserves all five stars. it was the most tender, juicy and flavorful pork roast i've ever cooked. we didnt have any leftovers in my house.

I made this roast for dinner today and I have to say it was very, very good.  I made it as the recipe called for.  I did however, double the spices and because I had a bag of Granny Smith apples, I peeled two apples and sliced them really thin and put them in the pan with the onions.  The only beer I had available was Corona Light so I used that.  The out come was beyond my exceptations.  It was really, really good.  The apples added a tartness, but didn't overwhelm the taste of the pork roast.  I've tried the Autumn Pork roast from this site(that recipe is awesome as well) but this recipe had a completly different taste.  Both are wonderful and I'll be making both recipes often.  Because of this site my cooking abilities have really improved.  I'm not always serving the same dishes over and over......I'm a huge All Recipe.com fan.  And often refer the site to friends and family.  Keep the good stuff coming....

WOW. How simple and delicious. One major problem with the recipes though... you forgot to mention what a delicious gravy the drippings make! I will say I doubled the amount of rub I used, but this could be a personal preference thing (but other might want to try it). I'm also curious about trying apple cider instead of beer. Might be good, and make for an interesting gravy.   One thing... it took forever to bake and I had to add a little more beer... but I think I my have done something wrong. Not sure what happened there.

Fabulous/5 Star/Easy!!!  The house smelled out of this world when it was cooking.  I followed recipe exactly except that I had a 3lb roast and I used the full amount of seasoning for a 5lb roast.  Would do that again. Served it with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes (from this site), corn on the cob and applesauce.

I made this in my crock pot and it was great!  It only took about 3 1/2 hours on low (my crock cooks pretty fast)  for my 2 1/2lb roast.  I also cooked green beans (frozen) and carrots with it and they,too, came out fabulous!!

I am a fairly new cook. . my fiance said he wanted a pork roast for dinner when we were trying to decide on what to eat.  I had never made one before and I found this recipe!  This recipe was GREAT! My fiance LOVED it. Alongside the roast I made mashed potatoes, pork gravy (just the package kind) and creamed  sweet corn! The combination of the 3 was tasty!  Where I live good meats are hard to come by so I only had about a 2.5 lb roast. . .which was great for just 2 people. Even though the roast was smaller I still used to same amount of all other ingredients! I added garlic cloves to the roasting pan with the onions, and I added garlic powder and onion powder to the rub! Miller Lite beer is the only way to go in my family so naturally I used that.  The great part. . I have leftovers for dinner tonight! BBQ Pork sandwiches it is!

Never really knew what to do with a pork roast.  So glad I found this recipe first in my search.  Fantastic!!!  Altered slightly using Bud Lite Lime (no regular lite beer in the house).  Husband and stepdaughter raved---delicious!

Great base recipe!  I used my dutch oven and Heinekin light beer.  The house smelled great and the roast was so tender!  The only thing that I would do differently next time is double the seasonings.

After reading the most helpful reviews, I used a 2# pork sirloin roast and put Warsteiner beer with the roast.  It is just for me & my husband. I used the exact amount of seasonings, only reducing the salt to 1 tsp. & I added 1/3 cup of some homemade apple butter to the beer before placing in a crock pot.  I cooked on high starting around 11 am and it was falling apart within 4 hours in the crock pot.  I served with maggi (authentic German dumplings) spaetzle, Gundelsheim (Original German Recipe) Barrel Red Cabbage, homemade mashed potatoes and Trappey's jalapeno Black Eye peas with some additional seasonings for New Year's day.  My husband made the Beer Bread 1 to go with this.  Will update you on the finished product. 
Update:  Heavenly.

Excellent!  Did end up adding more liquid about 1/2 way thru. (bud lite w/lime)  Nice and moist and made a flavorful gravy.  Added 2 cups chicken broth and thickend with cornstarch.

This was really tasty! I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the rub ingredients. I didn't have garlic powder, so I minced about a head of garlic and used it. (We're garlic lovers.) I used Woodchuck Cider as well... I figured that apples and pork always go well together.  Made the pan drippings into gravy. My 5 pound roast finished in just under 2 hours.

Awesome.  I slathered the pork roast with the basil, marjoram, pepper and 'fresh' crushed garlic in the morning and let it sit all day.  I also took another reviewers advice and put a few tablespoons of saurkraut underneath the roast while it cooked ... so super good!  For gravy I took the drippings (and I had lots of beery drippings left) and added half a package of dry turkey gravy mix.  Outstanding!  I used Coors Light. Thanks ChasingStorms!

I thought at first this recipe was going to be bland when I looked at the ingredients, I opted for this recipie because I didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand. I was so surprised how well it turned out!!! The only thing I omitted was the marjoram as I didn't have it on hand. I used Kokanee beer (canadian 5%). I also substitued regular salt for Kosher salt. It only took me 1 1/2 hrs to cook my roast and I used the liquid and drippings that was left over to make the gravy.. I added an extra cup of water and a quick "mushroom gravy" package to the liquid mixture. It made for great tasting gravy to accompany the roast! The kids just gobbled it up... I will definitely be making this again!

This was very aromatic and good flavor.  I add carrots and potato in at the last hour of cooking as I like as few cooking pots to clean up as possible.  When I next make this, and I will, I will add double the onions as they pick up so much of the flavor.

I often use beer when roasting a turkey so I knew this would be spot on with pork. I used a twelve pound bone in fresh ham that had a nice layer of fat on top so there were no worries about it being dry or having to turn it during cooking. The beer added a wonderful flavor to the drippings that resulted in one amazing gravy. Thank you so much!

Awesome! I couldn't find a boneless pork roast at the store so I used a 5 chop bone in roast. The roast and the gravy I made from the pan drippings was fantastic. Both my boyfriend and my guy roomate cleaned their plates. When there aren't any leftovers, you know you cooked something good. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

I'm never quite sure what to do with a pork roast. I found this recipe and it was amazing! Being proud parents of a 2 and 5 year old who are picky eaters, my husband and I aren't big drinkers, so we didn't have any beer on hand. I had a 6 1/2 pound bone-in pork roast. I doubled the herbs, let them marinade on the roast for a few hours, then used a mixture of apple cider and chicken broth with a 1/4 cup of white cooking wine in place of the beer. After cooking with the onions for 4 1/2 hours in the slow cooker it was fabulous! Even my picky eaters wanted seconds. Served with scalloped potatoes and corn and it was a huge hit! Highly recommended! Thanks!

This is delicious!  I made it as written, except I used a 2.5lb roast instead of a 5lb roast.  I kept all the amounts the same though.  It was perfect.  I also made it in the stock pot (like a slow cooker recipe) instead of in the oven.  It cooked about 4 hours and was perfect and delicious when it was done.  I would give this more stars if I could!

Simple and quite good. The roast was moist and succulent. Just make sure you use a  light beer, I had to use a regular beer and I felt that the beer flavor was a little too overpowering. We all enjoyed it, and next time I will use a light.

Five stars cause the men of the house devoured it and raved about it (and that rarely happens).   Me, personally, I wouldnt drink a beer if lost in a desert with no water, so I just couldnt get into the flavor  - all I could taste was the beer (but I was the only one) I also thought it was way to heavy on the black pepper (again not a flavor I enjoy) - that was the only thing I could taste when I made the gravy, so I didnt serve the gravy. Next time around I am going to cut way back on the pepper and try it with a hard cider instead of beer

This one was a pleasant surprise. I've been disappointed by beer-based roasts before (I'm looking at you, guinness brisket recipe), so I didn't have any real expectations going into this one but I'm glad I listened to the reviews! This was wonderful. Only change I made was to toss in some cut up carrots and quartered potatoes with the roast. I used Corona beer. For a recipe where you basically throw everything into a pan, toss it in the oven and forget about it, this was very very good, and all of the vegetables that cooked with it had great flavour as well.

Made for Christmas one year and it was good. As with any roast, you have to watch the internal temp to make sure it doesn't get overcooked.

This was good. I doubled the spices. Cooked the roast for about 2.5 hours. Put the drippings in a pan and added flour to thicken it up to make a gravy. Thanks

This recipe was great as written! I used a 5-6 lb bone in pork roast, bud light beer (was all I had on hand)and threw in about a half cup of left over chicken broth as I was having a large crowd for dinner and wanted more gravy. Used the amount of spices as written rubbed over the entire roast. Covered it with aluminum foil and baked for about 3.5 hours. I removed the foil for the last half hour to brown it down a little more. Used the pan drippings plus a little extra water (about 1/2 cup) and made the best gravy. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork and very moist and had great flavor. My family loved it! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. :)

Made this in my slow cooker and was VERY impressed.  Had to substitute basil for marjoram because it was what was in the cabinet  Meat was tender and tasty.  Gravy made it to die for! My 4 and 6 year old ate it well, as did my husband! The fact that it took a total of about 5 minutes to put together made it a win-win.  Will definitely make this again and again! 
Oh, and I used full flavor beer, Hofbrau Octoberfest, because again, it was what we had.  The gravy had a fair bit of beer flavor, but the pork wasn't too much, hubby said maybe we should have marinated it in the beer first!

This was ok.  We used hard cider and needed to add a cup of chicken broth during roasting and another cup with flour for thickening the gravy.  Added a few dashes of browning sauce and the gravy was very good. We served the roast and gravy with home made sauerkraut and potato dumplings.  The roast was good, but there was nothing remarkable about it. Four stars essentially for the gravy; would be 3 stars for the roast itself.

This came out just right.  My oven required additional 45 minutes of baking time.  I remember I had this in Muenchen, Germany in a beer hall.  Just wondered if the recipe originated from Germany?

I only gave this a 4 star as I agree with other reviewers and increased the spices.  I used about 1 tsp of marjoram, about 1/4 c fresh basil and 3/4 tsp of garlic.  I omitted the salt altogether.  I also cooked  in  a crock pot on high for 4 hrs then made gravy with flour and a bit more beer.  I loved the result.  Great gravy.  I will make this again.

Loved this PORK!!!  I lined my pan with foil for easy cleanup and used Victory beer 12.5% alcohol.  (all i had)  It was delish.  Cooked for 35 minutes covered with foil, then another 35 minutes uncovered.  Let stand (covered) for 20 minutes before slicing.  It was a 3lb piece of pork butt.  Fiance loved it too!

Oh My, Yum!  This was delicious!  I was just about to give up on pork roast, they just never seem to turn out right - either bad/bland taste or too tough.  This was perfect flavor and tenderness.  I can't wait to have company to make this for! I had a Hormel preseasoned roast (onion and garlic flavor) so I used about half the spices listed. Oh, I forgot to mention the smell in the house - they should make that into an air freshener!  It was mouth-watering!

This was excellent! The pork had excellent flavor and was really quick and easy to prepare. I used Miller Chill light beer with lime. As others have said, the drippings made a marvelous gravy. My roast was so lean that I had no fat in the drippings so I used butter for the fat to make gravy and still used the juices. Next time I plan on using shortening instead of better in the gravy and less salt on the roast. It was a bit too salty for my tastes following the directions exactly. Overall this was a big hit with my family.  There are hardly any leftovers and my husband said he liked this recipe better than my usual pork roast, which is one of his favorite meals! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

The meat was very tender and had a good flavor.  I made gravy from the drippings as suggested by other reviewers.  When I asked my husband to rate the recipe he asked if the gravy was part of the recipe or just something I added.  He gave it a 4 star without the gravy and 5 stars with it.

This is a "must have" recipe.  I just made this.  I followed the ingredients exactly, except I added 1/2 tsp of marjoram and 1/2 tsp of basil.  I cooked it in a small roasting pan so the amount of liquid was perfect.  I used Bud Light Lime beer.  My roast was slightly over 5 lbs and took 2-1/2 hours to cook (last 1/2 hour on convection).  One thing I would do differently next time is brown the roast first, then cook it in an uncovered pan because it was slightly on the dry side.  If I made gravy it probably would have been ok -- but, still very tasty without it.  Thank-you ChasingStorms for this wonderful recipe.

I made this using Woodchuck hard cider like another reviewer said and it was juicy and delicious.  I turned the roast every 30 minutes but I kept the lid on instead of taking it off after 30 minutes as instructed.  It was my first time making a pork roast so I was nervous about drying it out.  I didn't need to worry as keeping the lid on produced a tender, moist roast.  My husband loved it too!  He saw an ad for pork roast on tv while we were enjoying dinner and said we should buy another to make this again.  Needless to say, we will be having this amazing recipe again.

this was good as others have reviewed it.  I adjusted the beer to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup applesauce to mix with the onion and spices to make the rub more pastelike to brush it on.  I think this made the roast a little more apple tasting so will reduce to only 1/4 cup and use 1 1/4C beer next time.  I can't speak to the gravy bec my drippings ended up burnt to pan before I added more beer.  All in all, I would make this again but be sure to check the liquid amount more carefully so the drippings don't burn and leave nothing tasty for gravy.

We had this tonight and it was awesome.  We followed the suggestions of sliced granny Smith apples and chopped onions in the slow cooker.   Cooked 1 hour on high and 3-3.5 hours on low.  The other half used the reserve juicoes in the slow cooker and made a delicious gravy by adding to a simple roux.

This was delicious! I found a great deal on port roast and didn't want to just cut it into chops. I had a 2 1/2 lb roast. I put it in the crock pot on low for four hours and double the rub used a Blue Moon beer (all i had on had) it was super moist. Will make again.

Very easy recipe and it left the meat very moist!  Only thing I did, which I would not do again, is I doubled the rub for a 2 lb. roast (according to all the other reviews).  It became too salty and I think it would have done just fine leaving the recipe as is.  Love how easy it was and I will definitely make again!

Excellent. I difnt have any hard cider, so I put a bottle of beer and some regular cider. Let that marinate overnight. Then put the roast, fat side up, and surrounded it with carrots, celery, potatoes, onions, and apple slices. Came out moist and tender with a great caramelized outside.

Oops!  I doubled the spices because I thought that would be a good idea, but then realized my roast was half the size the recipe called for - so I had quadrupled!  My husband enjoyed it, but I thought it was a bit over-spiced, but still edible.  A wonderfully easy thing to throw together while working at home.  I put it in the slow cooker on low, made it a theme dinner with the German red cabbage and gingerbread pear upside down cake.

LOVE LOVE using the oven for a slow cooker!  I had a jar of rib rub, so I sprinkled it on the pork roast. I threw in 2 heads
of garlic and a tablespoon of peppercorns.  3 beers from the fridge went into the hot tub. Turned the oven to 300 degrees, covered with foil and went to work. DD called a couple hours later and said the roast smelled Amazing!! Told her to turn it off and hubby thought this totally Yummy!! Thanks so much Chasing Storms!!

Excellent recipe for kitchen screw-ups (such as myself). Simple to make.
Excellent recipe for meat-loving family. 
I used Woodpecker Hard Cider, the meat was perfect (kitchen screw-ups, it doesn't make the meat sweet, but if you make the gravy, that hints at sweet.)
I made with Sunday Dinner Mashed Potatoes & the Broccoli & Cauliflower Casserole.

Everyone loved this.  It was so tender and I used Sapporo Japanese beer.  I have made my corned beef with Guiness beer and every time I use beer the roast  is amazing.  We all loved it so much there were no left overs.  Wonderful recipe.

Made this last night - a  2.5 pound roast that was half of a twin pack, and came out of the bag in two long pieces that I made sure to keep "together" as it cooked.  I put the roast in an ungreased oblong metal pan, surrounded (smothered almost!) with two large onions cut in smallish slices and pieces, at least a pound of baby carrots, and five large peeled and chunky chopped Russet potatoes, and then I just shook all the seasonings on top of the meat and veggies.  I was heavy handed with all the seasonings except the salt, using way, waaaay more than a pinch of each, and though I concentrated most of the seasoning on the meat itself, I did sprinkle a little of the spices on the veggies as well.  (The combining of all the spices and then doing a dry rub first is extra work and extra mess in my book, so I did it the lazy way, and it was perfect.  I did turn the roast over as I seasoned it, so some of the spices got on the bottom before it went in the oven.)  My two youngest came over to eat with us, and said the house "smelled like Oma's" when they walked in - so I guess the "German" really does come out in the aroma as it cooks!  I turned the roast and the veggies over a few times as they cooked, and it took about an hour and a half to two hours, just as the recipe stated.  I sliced it in rather thin pieces, and made gravy out of the half cup or so of liquid that remained, and there was just enough gravy in the gravy boat to add a dollop of extra flavor to each of our plates.

I didn't make any changes  and I'll probably make it again, but I'll check the meat thermometer every 15 minutes the last 30 minutes.

I followed the recipe as written and added 2 granny smith apples as suggested by another reviewer.  The roast was incredible.  The apples were fully cooked and blended well with the onions.  The roast was very tender and very flavorful.  I will definitely add this to my repertoire.

We made this recipe as written, except we stopped when the internal temp hit 165 degrees because all of the other recipes I looked at said the internal temp would be 145 degrees.  The house smelled so yummy and we couldn't wait for it to get done! It was so tender and the flavor was amazing!  We shredded what was left the next night and had pulled pork sandwiches!

I made no changes and my family loved it.  My son, who normally doesn't like pork roast, had 2 helpings and the gravy is delicious.

This was pretty good and easy, but I needed a TON more liquid than called for. I didn't want to use up the whole six pack, so after the second beer, I switched to chicken stock and then to water. We didn't care much for the gravy, but the roast was nice and tender so it wasn't that big of a loss. Served mine with spaetzle and applesauce. Yum!

Bravo!  i surrounded bone in pork loin with quarterd onions all the way around added 1full bottle of light beer- Miller High Life and the seasoning  and I sprinkled minced garlic over the top.  I added celery, carrots and potatoes on top of the onions just because I like to save time with the veggies.  I added another 1/2 bottle of beer to slightly cover the veggies and baked it for about 2 1/2 hours only because we like our pork to fall apart on the plate.  I was superb!  there was a wonderful tang to the veggies but you would have never guessed beer was the secret ingredient.  I have used this recipe for both pork and beef and both were mouth watering delicious.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe, I have shared this recipe to many friends and family.  Truly grateful in Minnesota!

awesome & easy. used a 5lb pork loin roast with bone in...after reading reviews I decided to go the slow cooker route. I browned the sides of the roast & set it on top of baby carrots, chopped onions, turnips & red potatoes...put remaining vegetables on the sides and top. also put the seasoning mix on before setting the roast in. I set the slow cooker on hi for 6 hours. house smelled divine, and pork was perfectly cooked. veggies tasted amazing. my fiance and his mom gave me thumbs up and told me I should make it again! gravy made with the liquid was very good too.

Fantastic recipe. I've made it in the oven and put in the crock pot. It always greys compliments. If I have left overs they make great sandwiches.

I made this in my crockpot, and it was delicious! My family loved it as well.  It only lasted through 2 dinners. . .Usually a roast this size lasts 3 or more in my house, lol.

Very good! Made a few adjustment...put it in my slow cooker and used 1/2 apple juice & 1/2 beer for liquid. Added celery and more spices. Awesome!!
