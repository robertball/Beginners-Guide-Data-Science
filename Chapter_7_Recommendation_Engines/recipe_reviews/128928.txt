Add a little golden rum for some extra kick and you are IN BUSINESS.  This turned out to be crowd favorite at Halloween.  People at the house liked it and so did the parents of the trick-or-treaters.

This was very good.  I adjusted it to serve 18 and made it in the crock pot.  It was sweet so you wouldn't want more then a glass or two.  I used 2 cans of apple juice concentrate instead of cider and added extra spices.  It was perfect and I saved myself $5 which is always good.

I used a slow cooker and added a bunch of cinnamon sticks rather than just the plain cinnamon.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  I served this at a holiday party among many other drinks and I went through 2 gallons as people actually lined up every time I refilled the slow cooker.  Iâ€™m not even sure the cider got warm before people devoured it.  This will be how I do mulled apple cider from now on.

This was too sweet for us- we would have maybe added more liquor- and used a less sweet alcohol...

This was AWESOME! I had a date planned for a carriage ride and needed something warm...this was perfect!

I had to use what I had on hand so I had to use sparkling apple cider and apple pie spice in place of all the spices. Really good! I'm sure it would be great  either way.

I'll keep this one and use it for years to come...

This beverage was the hit of the party. It was fabulous. I had an outdoor candle party in mid September with a fall theme. I will serve this again and again.

This is an excellent recipe!  Everyone loved it. I think it needs a little more booze and something to cut the sweetness to be perfect. All in all everyone liked it a lot though.  I made 18 servings and with only 4 people drinking it, it disappeared fast!

I didn't have Triple Sec on hand, so I replaced it with rum and increased the amount of orange juice to 3/4 cup. (Actually I put in a little more rum for some added zing, but it's a delicious fall cider with or without more liquor.)

This was quick, simple, and delicious. Perfect for a Fall event. We warned it in the slow cooker and people served themselves until it was gone.

I used Amaretto instead of peach schnapps, and added 1/4 cup Wild Turkey, and 1/4 cup more cider. It was AWESOME! You can't taste the alcohol, but it packs a punch!
