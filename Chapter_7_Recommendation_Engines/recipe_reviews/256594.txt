1.7.17   Followed the recipe with the exception of using 1-1/2 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup water which I think bumped up the flavor.  I used 2 carrots and might even add a third in the future if for nothing else, it adds a pop of color to what otherwise would be a fairly unappealing looking dish (just my opinion).  Made this in the Instant Pot and you taste layer upon layer of interesting flavors.  Garnished with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. It was quite easy/quick to make too. It made more than expected too (a plus). I'll definitely make this again - next time I may add some paneer for more protein. (I figure adding it along with the onions/cumin seeds will help it absorb those flavours.)

Instead of normal long grain rice, I used Basmati. And I used a small handful of whole baby carrots and 5 small (peeled/forked) potatoes (instead of 2 carrots and 2 large potatoes) as that's what I had on hand.

It has potential to be very good. But lacks deep flavor. Instead of water I recommend chicken broth. And possible almost double the spices.

I liked it just fine but my biryani-loving family did not. I think the flavors were not distinct enough. I must admit that this is the first time I've made any biryani -- and I'm only comparing it to restaurant biryani. The overall appearance and taste was more homogeneous than we were accustomed to.
