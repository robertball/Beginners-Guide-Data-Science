I LOVED this recipe.  After mulling over all the reviews, I changed it up as follows:  1) Added 1/2 cup of bananas, 2) 1 Cup white flour, 2/3 cup wheat flour, 3) Did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, 4) used applesauce instead of margarine, 5) added 1t of vanilla, 6) added 1t of cinnamon,  6) used milk instead of water, and 7) added 1/2 cup of walnuts.

It turned out SO moist and no different than full-fat banana bread.

I replaced the margarine in this recipe with 1/8 cup applesauce and the eggs with 6 tbs. egg substitute. This made it completely fat free. It still came out as moist and delicious as ever!!! With these changes, you should lower the oven temperature to 325 and bake it for 40-45 minutes depending on oven. Great fat free recipe!!

I, too substituted applesauce for the butter and used only egg whites, making this virtually fat-free. To battle my fiance's chocolate cravings, I added unsweetened cocoa powder to half the batter and made a two-layer loaf. Um, yum! Thanks for the healthy and versatile recipe!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but must tell you that the shortening in almost any recipe can be replaced with applesauce. I've done it for years. In cookies the result is a moist cake-like texture. With dense "cakes" like banana bread, they come out super moist, but the bake time is usually slightly less than normal. You can also try using half shortening and half applesauce if you prefer more the traditional texture.

I've made this banana bread several times now and each time it is moist, delicious, and absolutely scrumptious! Its never been bland or tasted like a low-fat version. Of course, the riper the bananas, the better the taste. I love that I can enjoy this wonderful banana bread without all the guilt.  Its perfect on the go for a quick breakfast or afternoon snack.  Even my fat-fee-low-fat skittish fiance loves this banana bread! He couldn't tell the difference! Thanks for this healthier low-fat version.  Its a keeper.

Excellent!  I used milk in place of the water. I added some vanilla and a little almond extract. I also sprinkled some chocolate chips on top before I put it in the oven. Baked in 8x4 pan for 55 minutes. Very moist and yummy!

Wow!  All the taste without all the fat!  I've made a number of full fat banana breads from this site and this low fat version is very, very good.  I used 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1/3 c. white sugar, 3 mashed bananas, skim milk instead of water, Sunsweet Lighter Bake instead of the margarine, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract.  It had a great texture and baked up very nice in 50 minutes.  Also, Pam for baking is a life saver when baking breads!!!

Thought the recipie was very good, and didn't taste low fat, because it really isn't. 5 grams of fat when you have to keep fat grams to 30 grams and under a day just wasn't worth it. Won't make this recipie again.

OK.  I have to admit - I added 1 cup raisins, 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 cup chocolate chips, so this definitely wasn't "lowfat" when I was done.  But, WOW was it good with the additions!  I've made it twice now in the past two weeks to use up some bananas that got too ripe.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Thanks for the recipe!!  It's really good especially for a banana bread that's not as fattening.  Very moist & good flavors.  I also added a bit of chopped walnuts... umm umm umm.  One concern though- if using a 9x5 pan, you may want to check after 45 mins.  I'm glad I did as anything longer would have dried it out.

This was one of the first things i've ever baked. I'm 15 and I usually spend my time at malls rather than in the kitchen. But I got bored and decided to try the recipe out. My family ate the entire loaf that night. It was great. And almost too easy. A WINNER.

Great Recipe! I took the advice of others and did half Splenda/half brown sugar, half margarine/half applesauce,1 3/4 cup banana, half H2O/half 1% milk, 1 C white flour/2/3C Whole Wheat, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 cup raisins, and sprinkled the top with chopped pecans and a touch of cinnamon. If you don't put nuts on top, it looks a little bland and boring, so I suggest a little cinnamon for color. I made 6 muffins and cooked for 17 minutes, and cooked 6 small loaves separately from the muffins for 25 minutes. (I had a pan that made 8 loaves and only filled 6). If it is served warm and fresh from the oven, it tends to taste slightly gummy, so let it sit for 10-15 min on a cooling rack before serving. Wonderful and healthy! A great recipe I can feel good serving to my kids, as well as company! Thanks!

This turned out great!! I made it in a cake pan and only had to cook it for half the time, until the top turned nice and brown. Wonderful recipe. Very easy.

I'm always looking for lowfat recipes so this one caught my eye!  It's moist and delicious and does NOT taste at all low fat!  I usually substitute egg whites for whole eggs.  Also, I add 2/3 cup wheat flour and 1 cup white flour in place of 1 2/3 white flour only!!!  It's great!

This was a delicious and moist banana bread recipe.  Not only did it taste great, but smelled wonderful while in the oven and drove my whole house mad! I added a touch of vanilla (not much!) and a tablespoon of fat-free creamcheese  for moistness (reduce the butter/marg first) and it was superb!

I put my timer on my oven on for the 60 minutes, checked it after 53 minutes and it was very done.  The outside was pretty tough and dry.  I would recommend setting the timer for 45 minutes and checking it then. The flavor of the bread on the inside was good though.

Tastes so good for a low fat banana bread.  I used whole wheat flour, splenda and light butter.  I baked for 55 mins, I think 50 mins was maybe enough.

Very good.  I couldn't quit eating it!  I used applesauce instead of the margerine and added chocolate chips.  I also added extra bananas.  The flavor and texture turned out wonderful.

Excellent "healthy" banana bread recipe! Made the following mods according to previous reviewers suggestions: substituted brown sugar for white, 1 cup whole wheat flour + 2/3 cup white flour for 1 2/3 cup white flour, unsweetened applesauce for butter (used entire little individual size carton - about 1/3 cup), ff milk for water; used 3 bananas mashed(about 1 1/4 cups); added 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts; baked for 50 minutes at 325 degrees.  May up the cinnamon and add some nutmeg next time to spice it up a bit more.  This recipe has just rocketed to the top of my banana bread recipe list!  Love it!

I followed some of the suggested alterations like adding more banana (I put in 3 total), replacing the water with (fat free) milk, replacing the butter with unsweetened apple sauce, and lowering the temperature to 325. I also used egg substitute, replaced 2/3 c of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat and added an extra 1/8 tsp. of baking powder (since whole wheat flour doesn't rise as much). I never tried the original recipe, but I think maybe the whole wheat flour helped the texture problem that some people were talking about. I was really surprised at how good this bread was for being lower fat! I thought the wheat flour might make it dry and bland, but it wasn't at all. I will definitely be making this again. For anyone counting Weight Watchers points, each slice of this version is 3 pts. (from 12 servings)

My husband really enjoys this recipe. Banana Bread is his favorite and we are both trying to cut down our calorie intake so finding a low fat banana bread recipe that tastes like a regular recipe is fantastic; however I suggest covering the bread with foil after 25 minutes and removing it from the oven at 50 minutes. You'll get a much nicer looking and softer crust on the bread. Next time I might try adding some pecans to the mix.

Great Bread. Perfect Texture I DID ADD 1 TSP Vanilla and I used half BROWN sugar and half WHITE. You do have to play a little with cook time for me it worked well at lower temp 340 for 50 min . Oh ya I also added WALNUTS. :) Hope this helps

This bread was pretty good, especially for a lowfat one.  It wasn't amazing though.  I would proabably add something like chocolate chips or nuts to it next time to make it a little more interesting.

I followed another's suggestions and made the following changes: substituted 1/3 cup brown sugar for 1/3 cup of the white sugar; substituted applesauce for the margarine; substituted skim milk for the water; substituted 2/3 cup wheat flour for 2/3 cup of the all-purpose flour; added 1 tsp vanilla; and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  This is truly the best banana bread I've ever had and it's so much better for you!

This is a great recipe for a healthier version of banana bread.  I added vanilla and cinnamon like others suggested and I used only 1/2 cup of sugar with an extra 1/2 cup of banana. I also baked them in muffin tins (recipe will make about 12 regular muffins) and it only takes about 20-25 minutes.  Yummy!!

Eazy Recipe!  I used the substitutions that were suggested in reviews.  Replaced the sugar with 1/3 cup Splenda amd will increase it to 1/2 cup next time, substituted 1/4 c plus 1 TBSP of applesauce instead of margarine, replaced half the flour with Whole Wheat flour and added 1 tsp vanilla and sprinkled a little wheat germ on top of batter just before baking.  I think next time I will add cinnamon to mask the aftertaste of the splenda. I did double the recipe and made it into 8 mini loaves.  The cooking time was reduced to 30 minutes.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe! It's light and fluffy, and has lots of flavor for a lower fat banana bread.

I like to add 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and occasionally a splash of vanilla extract.

I also like to add any of the following: a cup of frozen berries (blueberries and raspberries are best), 1/2 cup walnuts and/or pecans, 1/2 cup finely chopped candied ginger, 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips.

For an extra lush version, top it with fresh lemon juice and dust it with sugar.

Goes great for breakfast, toasted, and smothered in fresh applesauce.

First I have to start of by saying that I'm not much of a baker and if I can make this, anyone can if this is your liking. This came out so good. I didn't have a loaf pan so I made cupcakes. Used Splenda instead of sugar, teaspoon of vanilla, cinnamon(tsp),and a dash of nutmeg(like to experiment with different spices) and 3 medium size bananas. This made 10 regular size muffins. Took about 20 minuetes to cook.

I love banana bread and this healthier version did not disappoint me or my family one bit…we ate every last crumb!  I added another ½ cup of banana, and a ½ tsp. of cinnamon, ¼ tsp. of ground cloves, and ¼ tsp. of ground ginger for some additional flavor…I prefer a spicier bread.  This was an extremely quick, easy, and tasty way to avoid wasting some over-ripe bananas!!!

Not the best banana bread ever, but pretty good.  Especially as it is low fat yet still moist.  As others suggested, I added cinnamon, vanilla and ginger to give it some flavor.  It would have definitely been bland without these.  I also added an extra banana to make about 1 1/2 cups.  Used the full amount of margarine and it was very moist.

I thought this recipes was great!  I made a few changes based on other feedback: I used 1/3 c. of the Splenda/sugar for baking, 2T butter and 2T applesauce, 1/2c egg beaters, 3 medium sized bananas, and 1c reg. flour and 2/3c whole wheat.  I bought an 8-wedge cornbread cast iron skillet at Cracker Barrell baked at 350deg. for 42 minutes - each wedge equals 3 WW points - NOT BAD!!!!

I swapped this basic low fat banana bread recipe to suit my healthier choices. Used only whole wheat flour with an additional third cup of oatmeal, third cup of honey instead of the sugar, canola oil instead of margarine, three egg whites (no yolks) and added vanilla, cinnamon and walnuts to taste. It suited my needs for a healthy banana bread. Bake time is the same. Delicious!

Made this over the weekend (had 4 very brown, very soft bananas sitting on the counter). This recipe turned out great -- you can't even tell it's lower in fat. Just as moist as other more fattening versions. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to my batter.

My first banana bread so I'm probably not the best expert but as I couldn't find anything wrong with the recipe (and the result) I give it 5 stars.
Next time I'll reduce the sugar as it was a bit too sweet for me.

I make this bread ALL THE TIME - it's become famous around my office.  I use whole wheat flour and Splenda, and occasionally some flax seed meal, so I don't feel so guilty about adding chocolate chips too. :) Even the "healthy food is for sissies" men I work with devour this and beg for more! It's also really great with dried cranberries mixed in (making 'cranana bread', as it's affectionately known around here).

This is a great banana bread for being lower in fat and calories.  I read the previous reviews and added vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon.  I also added choc. chips.  It turned out great.  Not as yummy as a regular ban. bread, but still great!!!  I will definetly make again.

Good recipe.  I used 2/3 cup whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup S*lenda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a dash each of ginger, nutmeg, clove, and vanilla extract.  I only had one egg on hand, and the bread came out okay but it crumbled a bit when I sliced it.

Great recipe, really cuts down on the calories and is still moist and delicious!  I added a tsp. of vanilla and doubled the amount of bananas and I'm glad I did because if not, I don't think it would have had as good as a banana taste to it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good! I did follow other peeps suggestions using half white sugar half brown sugar, and used apple sauce instead of margarine. I also added dashes of cinnamon, a bit of cardamom, and walnuts. My bread came out slightly dense but still moist but I think I need new baking sodas.

Very good recipe. I added cinnamon and walnuts and the flour I used was combination of whole wheat, white and oat flour. I replaced the margarine with applesause, so it was very healthy. The only thing I would do differently next time is beat the egg whites and fold them into the batter to make to eliminate the little bit of gumminess that it had. The loaf was gone in 2 days and there are only two of us.

The only changes I made to this recipe were subbing out the margarine for an equal amount of applesauce, and adding vanilla & chocolate chips. It tastes absolutely amazing, and is a way better choice nutrition-wise!

Just got it out of the oven.  Delicious.  I changed the recipe just a bit.  I use a little less sugar (natural sugar instead of white).  I used spelt flour instead of white and I added walnuts.  I love it.  Weight Watchers 1/8th is 9 pts.

Soooo Delicious! I made this banana bread last night and it was so good. However, I did tweak it a bit because of my diet. I used 1 cup of cake flour (didn't have all purpose)2/3 wheat flour, 1/4 cup of smart balance for margarine, 2/3 cup brown sugar, rice milk instead of water. I also used vanilla flavoring. It was very moist and a very nice texture. I will make this again and again......It's a keeper. Thanks!

I am giving this 4 stars because of the modifications that i make.  If not for that, it is a 5.  No white sugar, I use brown. Also, go for the butter and not marg!  Add 1 tsp vanilla.  I use 1 c whole wheat flour and 2/3 c finely ground oats.  Sometimes I add 1 c choc chips and other times not.  Thanks

I too used applesauce instead of butter, and added coccoa and cinnamon.  I also only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  I turned the oven down to 325 and baked for 40 min

Excellent!!  I made a triple batch since I had so many bananas.  I didn't use the margarine but substituted applesauce.  I made one plain, one with raisins and the third with crasins, all came out great.

I love this recipe.  I substitute the margarine with unsweetened applesauce (1/4 cup plus 1 T).  This banana bread disappears quickly at all family functions and no one knows that it is low fat.

This is my "secret recipe"...everyone says I make the best banana bread and this is it!  I usually add some chopped walnuts and reduce the sugar a little bit, but it is still delicious as written.  Extra good if you make it a day ahead of time, wrap it up in foil, and let it sit overnight...makes the edges really moist.

Delicious for a lower-fat bread. A quote from my mum "that banana bread is just TOO good"... I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla paste, a tiny dash of nutmeg and about 1/2 cup of walnuts. I would have put in cinnamon if I had had some in my cupboard. Also substituted the water for skim milk.
I had to bake mine for one hour and 35 minutes though, which was weird. Well worth it though!!!

This banana bread has a great flavor, but I added some walnuts and vanilla, and it was yummy! Be very careful with the cook time. After 60 minutes, my first attempt was burnt to a crisp!! This recipe is a keeper:)

So so good. I substituted the eggs with an egg replacer, and the butter with applesauce- it turned out deliciously. I was tempted to eat all the batter before it even hit the baking dish.

These are the changes I made - I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 C chopped walnut, 1/4 C shredded carrot.  Instead of water, I used 1/3C 2% milk and 1/3 C water and I used I Can't Believe it's not Butter margerine.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  After 50 minutes, I turned the temperature down to 300 and baked for 20 more minutes.  Perfect!  Moist with a crisp outside crust and a delicious flavor.  I often bake for a homeless "restaurant" and this is always a hit and I don't feel like I am overloading anyone on sugar.

This is the same recipe I have used for years (from So Fat, Low Fat, No Fat by Betty Rhode) and have adapted my own version from it. Betty's recipe calls for 3/4 C egg substitute in place of the 2 eggs though. Try it out, it's a very good recipe!

This banana bread was delicious, just as good as, if not better than my other more fattening recipes.  I can make this and not feel guilty eating it!  I also only cooked it for 45 minutes.  Thanks.

I followed this recipe to the letter - just doubled it and baked it as muffins.  (A double batch made about 30 regular sized muffins.  Mine were baked in paper liners and took 15 minutes at 350 degrees.)  It's wonderful.  It has a really nice light texture for a lower fat muffin, without being overly sweet.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Yum!  This is flavorful & moist.  It is "just" a good banana bread recipe, which I say only because there are SO MANY banana bread recipes - but this one is "low" fat.  Give it a try.  Then put peanut butter on it so it's not low fat anymore :-p  (Btw, I used recipe exactly, no applesauce or stuff.)

Made this as written except realized I was out of butter so I subbed apple sauce. I found it pretty bland and not enough banana flavour (and my bananas were very ripe). It was just ok for me but thx for sharing!

So good! I added wheat flour in place of 2/3 of the white flour. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce. Added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg, vanilla and almond extracts. Also added nuts and choc. chips. Used a little less banana, but I think whatever on that. Also used half water and half milk. Can taste good to add cinnamon/sugar on Pam sprayed pan.

I follow this recipe to a tee and find it to be really moist and tasty. I can't tell it's low calories at all. This'll be my go-to banana bread recipe going forward. Thanks for sharing!! One tip: check your loaf at 45 min. The trick about letting it sit on its side for 10 minutes works great!! Thanks Lauren!

wonderful banana bread. I baked mine on a 9*13 baking pan for 45 minutes. turned out great. I thought it would be dried because it looked dried. In the other hand the cake is very moist and delicious. definitely will make it again

Perfect! It doesn't even taste low fat. Much recommended for a quick breakfast or snack.

recipe was delicious and very moist.  Also great that it was low fat.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and used applesauce in place of margerine.

I tried this recipe hoping to find a little healthier breakfast bread, this one was pretty good still had all of the flavor of normal banana bread, I did substitute butter in for margarine... I also added some walnuts... After reading the other reviews next time I make this I will try using applesauce in place of the margarine, cutting back on the sugar as long as I have very ripe bananas to at least 1/2 cup and use brown sugar for half of that, milk instead of water, and possibly adding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

First lower fat banana bread to satisfy my husband.  I used Smart Balance Spread (slightly lower in fat) for the margarine in the recipe.  I also used 2/3 cup white whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose.  Great bread!!!!

Very tasty!  I did add cinnamon and did half white, half brown sugar.  Everything else was the same.  It took about 50 minutes for it to bake.  Will definitely make this again :)

The best! I made muffins and baked 20 min. Super moist and tender. Used yogurt instead of water, brown sugar and very ripe bananas. Also added some cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa powder and a beautiful toffee candy in the middle that melted... love ti!

This recipe was a great help to me. However, i was out of all purpose flour, so i simply used self-rising and omitted the baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Also, i made it vegan by substituting 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the 2 eggs, and 1/4 cup of the applesauce for the butter. It turned out so good! i love it and will definitely make it again. This time i might add 1/4 cup more of banana because, although delicious, the banana flavor is somewhat milder than i would've liked. Always room to improve whenever you make something. This was a winner in my book!

pretty good. follow other reviews and add vanilla and cinnamon, use milk instead of water, applesauce instead of butter, half brown/half white sugar. I used white whole wheat flour and couldn't tell a difference.

Because I don't keep margerine on hand, I used butter. I also used brewed unsweetened double-strength (four ounces water to one tea bag) chai instead of plain water to add a little more flavor to the banana bread. I got 12 biggish muffins out of one recipe and they baked up nicely. Next time, I might cut the egg back by one and add in unsweetened applesauce and cut the sugar by half. This would be great with chopped pecans, too. My bananas were REALLY ripe so the bread was a little sweet for us. This was simple enough for my youngest to help me make which I appreciated.

This was delicious!!  Will definitely make again.  I  usee 1 cup white flour and 2/3 cup whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips (between 1/4 and 1/2 cup).  I used 3 medium bananas which was a little more than 1 cup mashed. Next time I will cut down on the sugar since the chocolate chips add plenty of sweetness.

I've used this recipe for a couple of years; but I now I truly love it, but I make it for 36 servings (change in the calculate area) with everything the same, except...  1 1/2 cups sugar; 3/4 cup Smart Balance butter; 3/4 cup soy milk; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon; 1-16 oz package of semi-sweet choc. chips—— baked at 325*F for longer so that edges of the bread do not burn.

Please DO NOT bake for 60 min. I baked mine at 50 min and it was still slightly overdone. Other than that, I think it's a great recipe.

I used applesauce instead of margarine, 1 cup of whole wheat and 2/3 cup of all purpose and added a tsp of cinnamon. Just realized I forgot the 1/4 cup of water but I planned to substitute that with milk.  Even without the extra liquid it was still plenty moist...probably because of the applesauce substitution. I also added 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 3 tablespoons of rice protien powder. I made mini muffins and baked for 18 minutes on 350.  Great snacks for the kiddos.  Anyone have any suggestions on cutting back the sugar? I figure using honey would probably help.  But, 2/3 cup seems like a lot.

Yummy! Used apple sauce instead of margarine, egg substitute instead of eggs, and added 1tsp vanilla.  A little toucgh on the outside but I think I'll just reduce cooking time or add a bit more applesauce next time.

I halved this recipe and used mini cake pans instead of a full bread pan. Following the directions exactly, the cakes only took about 25 minutes to bake! Just something to keep in mind for others who are also doing the mini cake thing. :) Great recipe!

I followed the recipe as it was and it turned out beautiful! It's my first time baking from scratch, so I am pretty excited it turned out well. My oldest sister makes delicious banana bread, but I wanted to try a lighter version and this one was it. I will add nuts to it next time because I've had banana bread with nuts before and they go so well with it.

This is the best banana bread I've ever tasted!  I did make some changes: I used brown sugar instead of white, fat-free milk instead of water, and used real butter instead of margarine.  I added about 3/8 tsp of cinnamon. 
After reading other reviews, I checked it after 45 minutes - I ended up baking it for 52 minutes, and it was perfect!  I will definitely be using this recipe for my home-baked Christmas gifts next year!

This bread was quite good, especially for a lower fat bread. I found it to be a little bit too chewy, but the taste was great :)

I followed this recipe exactly, I didn't make changes. I did use butter instead of margarine, and I just used three bananas instead measuring them out because I've heard 1 cup of mashed bananas takes 2-3 bananas. This recipe makes excellent banana bread. I just finished a piece. The temperature/time ratio seems just about perfect, I was impressed because normally I have to bake bread for longer than the recipe calls for. I wanted a healthier option for banana bread so it would fit under the "bread" category, not "cake". I this recipe does it well, not comprimising on flavor or taste. This is a new one of my favorites. I think I'm going to have to go eat another slice!

This bread came out so good and moist!  I substituted applesauce for margarine and added a tsp. of vanilla.  Used a large muffin pan and baked for 27 mins at 325.

I replaced the margarine in this recipe with 1/8 cup applesauce and the eggs with 6 tbs. egg substitute. This made it completely fat free. It still came out as moist and delicious as ever!!! With these changes, you should lower the oven temperature to 325 and bake it for 40-45 minutes depending on oven. Great fat free recipe!!

Delicious! I used half margarine/half applesauce and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. It's crusty outside and moist (but not too dense) inside. You could cook it at a lower temp if you wanted it less crusty.

Cayate, This bread was sooo good, I used splenda granulated sugar instead of the real stuff and added walnuts. It also made my apartment smell good.

gave it 5 stars but used all of adria's suggestions of march 29th (read her review) plus chocolate chips.  adria's suggestions have cut the fat content even more and left it with plenty of flavor.  bread was super moist, very flavorful and the kids gobbled it up!

I have made this recipe for a few years now and it is my kid's favorite. I often sub out the bananas for applesauce or pumpkin and it is still just as easy and yummy. It even works as muffins too!

To make it fat free, I replaced the margarine with about 1/8 c. unsweetened applesauce, replaced eggs w/ 6 tbs. egg substitute, & used 1/3 c. brown sugar & 1/3 c. white sugar instead of all white.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla & some cinnamon for added flavor. I baked it at 325 for about 50 min.  Tastes great & is completely fat free! It is also very, very moist!

This banana bread was scrumptious, although I made three changes to it.  I agree with some other posters that you have to add half brown sugar (1/3 c.) and half white sugar (1/3 c.) instead of all white sugar (2/3 c.).  I also added about a 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract.  Last but not least, I added half milk and half water.  I baked for about 50 minutes, but it got kind of burned around the top, so you have to watch it.  You could try putting tinfoil over it, too.

I made a batch of this today and it's very yummy. I made it as the recipe states, but I added 1/3 cup pecan chips, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla.
It is very light and fluffy, more cake-like than bread-like. I think it could use more banana, that would make it moister and add more banana flavor, which it could use. Very easy to make, and quite tasty!

I just used this recipe (made muffins instead of a loaf) and it is wonderful! I changed a few things: used milk instead of water, butter instead of margerine, added a dash of all-spice, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and since i'm a cinnamon lover, i added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. The muffins came out moist and delicious (I baked them at 325F for about 22 minutes). Thank you for a great recipe!

Well, I can't honestly rate this recipe yet.. because I changed it so much. I tried to make it even lower in fat, and I ended up sacraficing a lot of the flavor. Instead of sugar, I used cooking splenda, and instead of butter I used zero calorie I can't beleive it's not butter spray... so, the outcome was a bit unflavorful.  It was incredibly moist and if I had added another cup or so of mashed bananas and maybe some cinnamon... it really could have been something good and extra extra extra low fat! It was super easy to make and moist as ever... I will probably try this one again!

This banana bread turned out wonderfully. I used brown sugar and splenda instead of white sugar, non-fat milk instead of water and I added cinnamon, vanilla essence and chocolate chunks to the recipe. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking.

I do have a really good banana bread recipe already but I wanted something that didn't call for a "stick" of butter and a "cup" of sugar. This was perfect! I did add some vanilla and cinnamin like some of the other reviewers and it really came out good!It's worth trying.

A good basic banana bread recipe, though based on my personal preference I swapped out half of the white sugar for brown and still had great results.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bread does tend to bake up faster than the recipe indicates, so be vigilant and check it about 10 minutes early!  I also stirred in 1/2 cup of chopped candied pineapple and 2 tbsp finely chopped candied ginger into the batter just before it went into the oven... mmmmm!

Very good! My kids LOVED it. I loved that its lower fat AND tastes good. I did make the same change as another reviewer and used 1 C white flour and 2/3 C wheat flour as well as the cinn., nutmeg and vanilla. I may add a little more banana to it next time as well. But as is was moist and quite flavourful.

Moist and delicious.  After reading reviews, I used 3 large bananas, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I will definitely make this again though I might try it without the nutmeg.

Cooked it again with whole wheat flour + flax seed instead of regular flour and it tasted just as good.

Yum! I like this recipe.  I do not eat eggs and substituted 1 tablespoon of plain yoghurt for each egg.  Once I added the water, the yoghurt separated, but even with the changes, the banana bread turned out really well. Traditionally, I was using a l-o-t more butter and sugar.  This isn't as sweet as some banana breads, but more to my liking for that reason.  Be sure and use sweet bananas though ... it really makes a difference. I like the overall appearance and texture.  I also threw in some chocolate chips. Give this a try !!

I loved this bread.  I also made the even "healthier" version by using the following subsitutions  Applesauce substitute for oil/margarine.  1 cup of whole wheat flour 2/3 cup white flour, 1 egg and 1/4 cup egg beaters (instead of 2 eggs).  I also used evaporated cane juice (raw sugar) instead of refined white sugar.  This bread is simply wonderful. Moist and dense.  My changes further reduced the calories to 139 per serving with 1 gram of fat.  Really guilt free eating and total enjoyment!  Thanks Lauren!

Terrific Banana Bread!!!  I LOVE banana breads and this one is just perfect.  Full of banana flavor, not too sweet and low fat to boot.  I did increase the bananas to about 12 oz. (It was after mashing 2 big bananas) and didn't change anything else.  It made a beautiful loaf.  The texture was between a very moist bread and dense cake.  When I ate it I didn't even need a plate as the slice held together nicely.  No crumbs falling off!  Will definitely make again later this week for a friend's dinner party.

This is such a tasty banana bread, sweet and moist too!  Great for a lower fat recipe.  I must say, though, I only put in in the oven at 350 degrees for 42 minutes and it ended up slightly too dark.

Tasty banana bread!  I'm glad I found this recipe, as the one my mom has always made had a 1/4 cup oil (and that was AFTER some modification!)  This is a much more healthier version.  I know it's not low fat if I add 1 cup of chopped walnuts, but it's so tasty that way.  I also add about a tsp of cinnamon and a can of crushed pineapple (drained, about 10 oz).  Yum yum!

It is hard to believe this is a low fat banana bread.  Even the end pieces are moist.  My grandkids didn't even notice the difference from the one their Mom always bakes for them.

at 45 min. this was almost burnt. i used oil for margarine so will try it with applesauce, thanks for the suggestion. i also added 1/2 c. of cocoa powder & more water to compensate. i only used one banana - i think more would of helped plus some almonds cut up which sunk to the bottom! i will try pecans next time. thanks for the basic recipe!

I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes, but this is the best!  The crust gets nice and golden but remains soft. The bread itself is incredibly moist. I substituted orange juice for the water and added a handful of carob chips and a handful of chopped macadamia nuts (I know they are high in fat, but I couldn't resist) and then sprinkled just a little bit of coconut on top.  What a treat!  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I used half whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, and replaced the margarine with oil. I also added 1/4 c. toasted walnuts. Delicious!
I only had 2 1/2 bananas, but it would probably been better with 3. It could have been because of this that I enjoyed Banana Bread I more and found it to be moister.

I loved this recipe!  We have been watching our weight but had leftover bananas that were ripe and I didn't want to throw them away.  I used the suggestion from one of the other reviews and used applesauce instead of butter and I put almost two cups of mashed bananas in it.  I also added the cinnamon and vanilla.  It was SO moist and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe and added suggestions.  I would definitely make this again!

Mine only needed to cook about 35 - 40 minutes.  I noticed at 42 minutes that it looked almost burnt at the edges.  I don't know if it's the high altitude but 350 for 35-40 minutes would be perfect

I also used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, leaving everything else as is & everyone loved it.  Certainly as moist & tasty as other breads with higher fat & caloric content.

I had the recipe converter convert this to "6" to make 1/2 doz. muffins, cooked them for 20 min., and they were absolutely wonderful...light, full of banana flavor, and a recipe I'll definitely make again.  A real winner!

This was such a good basic recipe for banana bread. I also used applesauce, milk, cinammon, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and dressed it up with cranberries. I just had my first slice and I'm a happy camper, it's very moist but not mushy. I also added some brown sugar to the bottom of my pan :) I think what I liked most about this recipe is the versatility to make it your own. Thanks :)

After reading the first page of reviews, I decided to change a few things as well. I also used unsweetened applesauce instead of margarine, as well as substituted Egg Beaters egg whites (6 T) for eggs. Then I added a dash of cinnamon, ginger, and a splash of vanilla. I also added 1/2 c. of walnuts, because banana bread just isn't banana bread without walnuts. I poured the batter into muffin cups and it made 14 muffins at about 141 calories each. They turned out great, although I think I could have gotten away with cooking them for about 10 minutes less. I baked them for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, so next time I will try lowering the heat to 325 and baking them for 30 minutes or so. The smell while they were baking was amazing!  Next time, I think I will experiment with lowering the sugar to 1/2 c. With the extra sweetness from the applesauce, I don't think it will be noticeable.

Great low fat recipe. Nobody except my hubby realized that it was low fat :o) I used applesauce instead of margarine and milk instead of water. I added a tsp. of both vanilla & cinnamon also. This was perfectly brown in fifty minutes and made the house smell amazing! I might add a few chopped pecans next time since the calories are already reduced enough that I wouldn't feel guilty!

This was fantastic! I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because I did opt to follow a lot of recommendations in other reviews to make it perfect -- substituted milk for water, egg beaters for eggs, apple sauce for margarine, added cinnamon and vanilla extract as well as my own touch of nutmeg. I also made them in a muffin pan, which required them to cook only about 25 minutes or so. PERFECTION! I'm going to take one with me to work for breakfast.

My only changes to this recipe were a teaspoon of vanilla added, and I used low-fat milk instead of the water.  I've made this several times and for low-fat it's not a bad recipe at all.

I feel it's a bit unfair to rate this because I changed it so much - but I'm actually not crazy about how it turned out, and I feel like maybe it would have been better had I followed the recipe. I followed reviewer's suggestions and added 1/2 cup banana, split the sugar into half white and half brown, swapped the water for milk, and added a little vanilla & cinnamon. Of all these changes, the only one I think I would not do again is adding the extra banana. It has a great flavor and is super moist, but is way too banana-y. The other changes seem to have worked, but I just wish it had more of a bread feel and instead it's all banana - maybe I didn't mush them up properly either lol. At any rate, it's still delicious and thank you for a great lower fat recipe! Now I think I'll go have another piece:)...

This recipe gets 5 stars from me just for being such a delicious tasting low fat recipe. I used 1/3 cup of applesauce and 1 T light butter for butter and eggbeaters for the eggs, added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is great and I couldn't even taste the difference with a full fat banana bread. I did add more banana than the recipe suggested and it came out extremely moist. I also added less butter, but it didn't seem to make a difference. I will be making this bread regularly!!!

ZOMG! STARGAZER8383's idea for dried Cranberries - BRILLIANT!  Used all applesauce (and about a 1/2 tbs more), all brown sugar (a little short on that), and my bananas only measured out to 3/4 cup... But still:  This was really really good - my lil' girl was gobbling this up!  I don't know if I'll ever make another variety of banana bread... And, will NEVER leave out the cranberries. (Be generous with the berries - I used about a handful and a half, and found myself wishing I put GOBS more in).  FINALLY:  Check it early!  I yanked mine out of the oven about 16 minutes early.

This is a great recipe for banana bread! The only change I made was to add some cinnamon to the mix since without it I find it can be a bit bland, but otherwise this turns out very moist and is really simple to make!

This came out really good.  I substituted 1/8-1/4 c unsweetened applesauce for all of the butter and also 1 whole egg + 2 egg whites for the 2 whole eggs.  Also, I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It came out dense and delicious.

I used Becel (non-hydrogenated margarine) and added a little vanilla and a little cinnamon.  The bread turns out so moist.  I like the fact there is so little sugar and the baking time is exact. I have given this recipe to friends and they love it too. Delicious!

This was very good and moist, but I wish it had a little more banana flavor, and I even added extra. I did add the vanilla, cinammon, and nutmeg too. I will definitely make this again. My friend tried it and she liked it also.

Should've used brown sugar instead, but I was rushing. I did remember to add some cinnamon, walnuts, raisins, milk instead of water, cake flour instead of all purpose, and vanilla and coconut extract though. It wasn't bad. Kind of normal ..

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I made it exactly as written and the whole family loved it.  I am sure that there are better banana bread recipes out there - but for a "lower fat" version, this was really good!  I will definitely make it again and again and again.

This was just ok and I  would rather have a small piece of the full fat breads as the flavor is somehow compromised in the lower fat version.

Honestly, it's not as good as banana bread made with the full amount of butter and sugar. So I wouldn't say it's the best banana bread in the world...BUT for how much less sugar and butter this recipe contains, it's surprisingly still very very good! I give it five stars!

Hi! :) I tried making this because it seemed simple enough for a a kid like me to make (im 14 and horribly inexperienced at cooking...i make cup noodles bad)

So I tried it...and this was the first thing I made that tasted decent!!! The only con was that I think I didnt mash the bananas enough because at the end there were a few mushy spots in the bread.

Next time ill put some walnuts in the mixture!! (thats ok to do...right?) This time i sprinkled some semi chocolate chips and they tasted so good that I sent some to the neighbors downstairs.

As suggested, I used half brown and half white sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg each, and added applesauce (1 serving size, about 1/2 cup) in addition to the margarine, and used milk instead of water.  It took 55 minutes  at 350 in my oven. Not as good as a 'full-fat' recipe, but still very good.  I was pleasantly surprised, not too dry or dense.

I made a few changes. Instead of butter I used cinnamon applesauce. I made muffins instead of bread so I added the topping from the "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe also from this site.

Turned out great.  I substituted apple sauce for the margarine, used 1 cup white flour and 2/3 cup whole wheat flour, and added about a tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.

This was so good! Tastes just like (or better than) regular bread. I also added 1 1/2 Tbs vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter. I made 3 mini loaves and added chocolate chips in one loaf. Delicious!

This is a 5 star recipe if for no other reason than it being as good as any full fat, high calorie recipe without it being either. The bread was done in 50 minutes in my oven, and had a nice texture that leaned more towards cake rather than bread. Put some butter over the top of the crust as soon as you pull it out of the oven and you'll get a nice crunchy, tasty crust once it cools.

I used Splenda to replace the white sugar, and cut the margarine in half and added 3 tablespoons of applesauce.  Very good banana bread!  This one is a keeper.

I have been using this recipe for years and years and everyone loves it.  Just some changes: I substitute applesauce for margarine and I freeze my old bananas.  By the time I defrost them, there is already enough banana-flavored water for the 1/4 cup water.  I know it sounds gross but it's a complete hit everytime!
UPDATE (6/2011): I made this yesterday with yogurt subbing for the margarine and water AND 1/3 c flaxseed for 1/3 c flour.  I baked them in muffin pans at 325 for 30-35 min.  Still PERFECT!

This was a great banana bread, but not the best. I used applesauce instead of butter. It definetely didn't take 60 minutes and by the time it had been in the oven for 45 minutes, it was already a little burnt. The texture was a little gummy-like, but the banana flavor was great, and overall a quick, easy, and yummy bread.

Wonderful!  I just made a load of this banana bread this afternoon, and it is all I can do to keep myself (and my husband) from finishing off the whole thing!  Really moist and flavorful.  I used very ripe bananas that I had stored in the fridge and only needed 2 of them to make 1 cup.  I also used one whole egg and one egg white instead of 2 eggs.  I used Land o' Lakes light butter, and 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white sugar as other reviewers suggested.  I also added 3/4 cup finely shredded carrot and 1/2 cup raisins.  Turned out great!  I plan on making a double batch of this once a week so that I have it on hand in the house for snacking or quick and healthy lunches.  Definitely recommend!

This recipe deserves 5 stars with the small changes added (I didn't try the original recipe).  I took other members' advice and added 1tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also used 1 egg and 2 egg whites (instead of 2 whole eggs), and I used 1/8 cup lite margarine and 1/8 cup applesauce, and I used 1/8 cup water and 1/8 cup 1%milk.  I did not have a bread pan, so I used a muffin pan instead and they only needed to cook for about 16-18 minutes.  I did not have enough bananas to make a full cup, but it was almost a cup, and if I had to do this recipe over, I also add more banana.  It tasted great, and didn't seem like it was lowfat.  (It was a little bit spongey, but not too much)  My husband and daughter loved them too.  It made a great breakfast!

I love this recipe!!!  The bread is so moist and yummy!  I altered it some though.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used applesauce in place of margarine, used 4 egg whites instead of whole eggs, used 1 1/3 cup wheat flour & 1/3 cup white flour, and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I also added more bananas for flavor.  The bread was done baking in 35 to 40 min.

Wonderful - very mild!  Added three bananas as recommended by another reviewer to give the bread more banana flavor.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and the top of the loaf started to brown about 40 minutes into cooking.  At that time, I covered the top loosely with foil and finished cooking.  Gave five stars even though my preference is towards the sweeter breads.  Thanks Lauren!!

Excellent, moist banana bread!  It's so good that I like it just as well as my grandma's recipe, which has twice as much butter and sugar.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, and replaced the water with skim milk as was suggested by other reviewers.  My 2-year-old sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top and it's perfect!  I only had to bake it for 45 minutes so be sure to check early.

We enjoyed this recipe very much, but it lacked strong banana flavor.  I used 3 bananas and otherwise follewed recipe to a tee.  I will try it in the future substituting applesauce.

This has become my most favourite recipe.      It is easy to put together. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and replaced the butter with applesauce.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. Right before putting the batter in the oven, I added a handful of chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.
I cut the baking time to 35 to 45 min. or when the top of the bread is golden brown. Everytime the bread comes out moist, delicious and my family don't realize it's healthy for them too!

The banana bread was sweet and soft. I used 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour and 2/3 cup wheat germ, which produced a moist and soft texture.

This was good the first time, when I followed the recipe exactly. It was great the second time, using apple sauce instead of margarine (made it moister), 2 large bananas (instead of just one cup), and adding walnuts. The third time I also added cocoa powder to half the batter, which was also excellent. Thank you Lauren.

This is so good.  I've made this several times as is, but then decided to try using Splenda (for baking) using 1/2 the amount ratio to sugar that is called for in the original recipe.  It came out really good.

I LOVE this recipe!  I used light butter instead of the full fat kind, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, added a tsp of vanilla, a tsp of cinnamon, and a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  Everybody raved about this bread, even the staunch full-fatters!  Thanks for all the great tips!

Great!  We used applesauce instead of margarine, and all other ingredients were organic... whole wheat flour gave it a very hearty texture.  We also threw in a few chocolate chips - absolutely the best banana bread we've made!

WOW! I don't bake much, but I had to clean out the overripe bananas in the freezer so I searched and found such great reviews for this recipe that I had to try it. I am impressed!! I followed the suggestions for using 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup (+ a bitmore) applesauce, and throwing in some chocolate chips. I made it in two mini-loaf pans with enough extra for 3 muffins as well. I cooked for about 40 minutes. Turned out great. They have been out of the oven for thirty minutes and the three muffins are GONE!! Good thing they are low fat...does this mean I can eat the whole thing and LOSE weight!! LOL! GREAT recipe!

This banana bread is delicious.  I made a couple substitions though.  I used 1/3 cup of Splenda sugar blend for baking instead of 2/3 cup of white sugar.  The new Splenda sugar blend is awesome for baking!  I also used 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of the margarine and used white whole wheat flour from King Arthur instead of the all-purpose flour.  I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  My fiance never knew that what he was eating was actually good for him!

Excellent!  I used applesauce instead of the butter (and used a bit more than 1/4 cup), whole wheat flour, and raw sugar instead of white.  I also used three bananas.  My husband (a big fan of banana bread) loved it and had no idea it was low fat.  :-)

This is an incredible banana bread receipe! It looks perfect when done. It was so moist, fluffy, and tasty with dense butter flavor (althought I use margarine). I reduced suger to 1/2 cup. My fiancce (from south) wasn't a banana bread fan at all. But this one is an exception. He said this is the BEST banana bread he had ever had!! a MUST TRY recipe!

This was the first banana bread I've ever made and it was very good.  It was lower in fat too since I added applesauce instead of the margarine, and that worked out really well.  I'm gonna try other banana bread recipes too, but this was definitely really good.

This is a great low-fat recipe. It tastes like regular banana bread, except that it's healthier :) Changes I made: a little more than 1/4 cup of apple sauce to replace the margarine, a few drops of vanilla and almond extract, and more bananas (I used 3). The extra banana and apple sauce make it very moist. It's actually so moist that it sticks to the knife when I slice a piece, which I dun mind cuz I like moist bread. I'll also add less sugar next time. It's a lil too sweet for my taste.

pretty good recipe, i used applesauce as recommended by so many others, and it turned out great! it looked a little watery before i mixed the wet and dry ingredients, but i was using fozen bananas (it works, but looks really really gross). i also added a few handfuls of raisins just for fun - and added sweetness - but the bread was good enough to not need it!

Very good. I made some changes to make it even lower fat. I used just two tablespoons of butter and added about 1/3 cup applesauce, about 1/4 cup pureed stewed prunes, replaced almost half of the white flour with whole wheat flour, used a bit more banana and added some chopped walnuts and raisins. The results were very good, dense and very healthy.

This was excellent, I can't believe it's low in fat and better than the regular banana bread recipes I've tried. It was moist, not too sweet, and held together extremely well. The only change I made was to add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. I was going to throw in some walnuts or chocolate chips but I'm glad I didn't because I didn't even miss them. I baked this for 55 minutes but I could have taken it out sooner. I used 2 bananas to give me exactly 1 cup of mashed banana.

This bread was so excellent. I chose this recipe because all of the others had SO much sugar! Of the flour amount I used whole wheat for the 2/3 cup. That's the only tweaking I did, And it was PERFECT!

just fantastic! Simple, and yummy! But yes, like other people have said, it certainly does not take more than 45 mins to bake this baby!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used egg substitute in place of the eggs and it turned out delicious. I missed not having walnuts in the bread, but that sure would have raised the fat grams. But then again, I thought about how good walnuts are for you...seems like you can never win! Thanks for posting this recipe Lauren, it's a good one.

Very good as it is but better if you add some raisins or dries cranberries. Will make this again, can't tell that it is low-fat.

Excellent and low fat. Easy and quick to make. I added about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. Next time will add finely chopped nuts too. Thanks

3.18.18  Cut the amount of sugar in half, added a few chopped walnuts which I had on hand, and three ripe, mashed  bananas yielded a bit more than 1 cup, but I went ahead and added it.  Typically, when I see “low-fat and fewer calories” on anything, I expect a compromise will be coming.  Sometimes it’s worth it, other times it's not.  But with this recipe, I didn’t feel like anything was being compromised.  I baked in three mini loaf pans for 35 minutes at 350ºF and ended up tender, moist banana bread just loaded with flavor, right up there with the best I've ever had.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

This was a very nice and moist banana bread. I actually really liked this. Only difference is i added Milk instead of Water and good ol' Irish imported butter instead of Margarine.

This is a tasty banana bread! I did make a few changes - I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar;  1 cup whole  wheat flour and 2/3 cup white flour; substituted skim milk for the water; added 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 cup raisins.  Also sprinkled the top with mixture of cinnamon and white sugar.  Will try substituting or adding  applesauce for the butter next time to add moisture.

Excellent recipe, full of flavor!
Here are the things I changed, so I remember them for next time: 1) used 3 bananas 2) replaced water with buttermilk 3)used butter instead of margarine 4) added 2 tbsp instant oats because of the extra banana, since batter looked too runny) 5) added frozen raspberries

Very good low fat banana bread!
Made again:  used about 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white sugar, sour cream in place of butter, and milk instead of water; 3 bananas = 1 c. ;  very good too!

Don't decrease the sugar as much next time. Needs salted butter on it when you eat it because it tastes...erm healthy.
1) Added 1/2 cup of bananas, 2) 1 Cup white flour, 2/3 cup wheat flour, 3) Did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, 4) used applesauce instead of margarine, 5) added 1t of vanilla 6) used milk instead of water

My favorite banana bread of all time -- the only recipe I'll use now.  Given that I've seen banana bread recipes calling for an entire CUP of oil, using only 1/4 c of butter is pretty good.    (I have, however, substituted fat-free vanilla yogurt for the butter --as an experiment-- and it did work OK, if you want to make it entirely fat free...).

I made this bread for a work breakfast we were having.  It disappeared so  quickly and I received numerous compliments.  I was pleased with the way it turned out, but thought it could have been a bit sweeter for my own personal taste.  Next time I will do some of the substitutions others suggested such as applesauce instead of oil and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white.  Overall a good recipe.

Oh my, this recipe was awesome! I am always trying to healthify old standards and this was a really great version. Like others, I added just a few dashes of spice-cinnamon and nutmeg-and I actually baked it in my new 4-loaf baking pan, and so they baked much more quickly than one standard loaf (about 35 minutes) I was able to make two of the loaves with pecans and two without, for those who don't like nuts. I can't believe how delicious and light the texture. I was afraid it would be too gummy or dense but it was really lovely. I already want to make another batch, because this one is going to be gone very quickly! This recipe is a definite keeper!

I was really impressed that it came out moist and looked beautiful. The picture looked alittle flat but it doesn't come out that way. I'm on my 2nd loaf today and only added some pecans to add alittle crunch.

This recipe was pretty good.  I liked it because it wasn't as sweet as other recipes yet sweet enough to resemble the real thing... I did use whole oats and walnuts in the recipe to add a little more fiber.

I was really impressed! This has been sitting in my online recipe box for quite awhile now... such a shame! I used butter instead of margarine and used apple juice instead of water (more flavor?). I also made into muffins and dotted with some chocolate chips for fun. (Healthy additions, I know!)   =) Final result was a great muffin - perfectly peaked, moist and delicious! Great banana flavor!

I followed one of the reviewers suggestion and made muffins.  The suggestion was to bake it at 325 for 30 minutes.  I pulled my muffins out at 25 minutes and they were burned! I would like to try this again, but I would do either a loaf or bake the muffins for less time.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe. Super easy to make, and you can add any kind of extra ingredients at the end. I am fond of either chocolate chips (1 cup) or cranberries (1 cup). Makes a really moist bread.

I followed a lot of the other reviewers.  Replaced white flour with wheat and cut down on the sugar.  I double the applesauce in replace of margarine.  I also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Very yummy!  It cooked 35 minutes on 350 and then placed foil over the top and cooked for another 10 minutes  at 400.

I've made this twice now and I think it's pretty good. I didn't give it five stars because both times mine ended up a little dry which could have been an error on my part or my oven. It definitely tastes better with nuts or fruit mixed in.

of all the recipes i have found on this site, this has become one of the family favorites.  i made a few minor changes....all similar to those already posted.  i used applesauce rather than margarine, milk rather than water....and i dumped a whole slew of cinnamon in because that is just how we like it.  i have given this recipe to many friends....all love it!

It was eatable but a little bit heavy and not fluffy. I followed the recipe and did not change anything.(not a keeper) Last week I made another recipe and rated it yesterday (the best banana bread), This one is really the best like the recipe says it.

I tried it with the variations of half brown half white sugar, 1 cup white flour 2/3 cup wheat flour and added vanilla and cinnamon.  Great - cooked a little too long - only took about 45-50 minutes in my oven.

This was really easy and tasted great! I used sweet and low instead of sugar to make this recipe sugar-free.  I followed the suggestions and added vanilla and cinnamon, and also substituted milk for water. I think I will make this again.

This is without a doubt one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever had. The only thing that I changed was I used brown sugar instead of white. Delicious and easy!!!!!

I used half wheat and half white flour, reduced the butter to 1/8 cup and sugar to 1/8 cup of brown, increased the bananas to 1.5 cups (everyone's moving out for winter break and we needed to use up the fruit).  I'm a college student just starting out in the kitchen and have made so many terrible quick breads, so I was amazed when it turned out deliciously moist, naturally sweet and light and the experienced chefs in my house said it was really tasty and asked for more!  It's whole wheat, low-fat and low-sugar, what more could you ask for?  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I doubled this recipe, used 2 1/2 cups of blended frozen bananas, left out the water, cooked it in a 2 qt glass casserole dish. I also put pecans in it. I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour and it was PERFECT despite the fact that I forgot the salt it was still DELICIOUS!

Very yummy!  I did use egg substitute and applesauce in place of oil and real eggs.  However, the first time I made this I used the Splenda for Baking.  DO NOT USE Splenda for Baking in the recipe - Loaf came out hard and too artifically sweet.

I found this to be really terrible. The crust was super chewy and the bread was really dense for a banana bread recipe. Perhaps I stirred it too much. I also subbed applesauce for the butter and 3 egg whites for the eggs as well as added 1 tsp. each of vanilla extract and cinnamon. The flavor wasn't bad it was just the texture. I don't think I will make this version again with all the other choices on this site.

Wow! This recipe was SO good! We had some bananas that I knew weren't going to be eaten, so I decided to find a recipe for banana bread. It was my first time I ever made banana bread, and it turned out amazing. I used applesauce instead of butter, and 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs, and got a fat free bread!

I did make some alterations as did others to make this even lower in fat.  I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the margarine and egg beaters instead of whole eggs.  I also used half white sugar and half splenda brown sugar blend.  The bread did turn out moist and tasty, but it was really dense.  Not sure if this is the normal outcome with this recipe, the result of my substitutions, or something else I might have done.  I don't mind that its dense; it just wasn't what I expected!  Still very yummy and moist, so that's all that matters to me.  In fact, it may be a little easier to toast in the toaster this way. 

If I could do 4 1/2 I would, because this is a great tasting low fat recipe. Not quite a five for me since it really has to be "to die for" in order for me to give a five.

Yummy!! I added some 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. It tasted great!! Definitely a keeper! 
 *******
To lower fat, I suggest using apple sauce. I used all butter this time. After the bread cooled, it was so greasy...

I also changed it up a little, instead of magarine I used a small jar of "Heinz - Applesauce and banana in oatmeal cereal" babyfood.  Sounds strange, I know, but I have a 6 month old. I also used eggwhites in place of the eggs.  I used the suggestion from earlier to add cocoa to the bottom half.
This has turned out to be the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried!

I just baked this wonderful banana bread and love it! I used 6 tbsp. of egg substitute and 2 tbsp. apple sauce instead of margarine, added a splash of vanilla extract and sprinkle chocolate chips on top before popping it in the oven and it came out fantabulous! I baked in oven at 325 deg. for about an hour until knife came out clean. I will DEFINITELY keep this recipe!

I used organic white whole wheat flour and it didn't quite come out as I expected.  I also need to get a better loaf pan..one that is thicker.  It was a bit dry on the bottom and still uncooked at the top.  Overall pretty good, it just needs some perfecting.

I really loved this recipe.  So simple and so good.  And my daughter loves it too.  I should mention I used whole wheat flour and added 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips (my mother-in-laws trick).  I figured both of those things cancel eachother out on the health v. taste frontier.

Used apple sauce, egg substitute, lowered the temperature and baking time, and added walnuts.

Was awesome the next day.

I had some bananas that were too mushy to eat so I looked for a recipe I could use them in instead of throwing them out. I also needed a recipe that had basic ingredients that I had on hand because I didn't want to make a trip to the store.  This recipe was perfect, quick, easy and tasty. I added about double the bananas that the recipe called for, because that was what I had left.  I also added a cup of chocolate chips and sprinkled walnuts on top.  I made muffins and baked them at 350 for 25 minutes.  They were very moist and tasted great.

My boyfriend loved this bread! I used 1 cup flour and 2/3 cup whole wheat flour, and the bread turned out denser and heartier than most quick breads, and has the perfect amount of sweetness. I also sprinkled the top with chopped walnuts before baking...adds a nice crunch.

A very good dense bread.  I added walnuts, 4 bananas and chocolate chunk chips.  It was really good.  Even better the longer is sets.

I added walnuts, cinnamon & vanilla but this was still quite plain and a bit boring. Next time I'll add reduced fat cream cheese, and more bananas.

Pretty good. Nice and moist.  I wouldn't say it's the best I've had, but given the nutritional content, it's okay. I'll try making it a bit healthier and maybe adding a couple more bananas for more banana flavor.

This was ok, just not enough banana taste for me. My co-workers liked it and the fact that it was low fat was a bonus for them too.

I used splenda instead of sugar and I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 2/3 cup whole wheat flour.  I also added a tbs of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (I wanted to add cinnamon, but I was fresh out).  This was sweet and moist.  Next time I will add walnuts to the mix.  It did feel like it needed something else but it was still very good.

I liked it.  It certainly did not have the taste of a fat-laden version, but it had a denseness to it that made it taste far superior to other low-fat versions that I've tried.  I also added walnuts and almost doubled the amount of mashed bananas, but no extra baking time was needed.  Throw in a teaspoon of Banana Extract for extra flavor. Good Recipe!

I followed other reviewer's advice and added 1 1/2 tbsp of vanilla and cinnamon each. Instead of using margarine I used applesauce. This turned out great.

The loaf bubbled up in the middle and was still doughy while the edges were brown.  I ended up scooping the doughy part out and spreading it on top.  Then the middle actually turned out to be the best part b/c it was gooey and chocolatey (I added about 1/4 cup cocoa and 1 cup of chocolate chips).  Overall, good taste and texture and I'm making it again!

This was very good, especially for being low fat. I don't think it tasted quite as good as the real recipe but for having that much less sugar I'll definitely make this my main banana bread recipe from now on! Thanks!

Mmmmm.... very yummy bread!  I ended up adding about a tsp of cinnamon and a little bit more banana then called for and it turned out wonderful.  True... other full fat recipes might taste slightly better, but its worth it knowing that I'm eating something a bit healthier.  I'll be making this bread again soon!! :)

Not bad for a low fat dessert.  Followed the ingredients exactly.  Not as moist as other banana breads but then this is a lower fat version and it does do the trick when your craving something sweet.  Thanks

Truly wonderful recipe. I made it exactly according to the recipe but added about 2 handfuls of regular size chocolate chips to the batter just before baking. It made the bread a little more dessert-like. Outstanding! This bread lasted 8 hours in our house. Everyone loved it.

This is by far the best low fat banana bread I've made.  I added extra banana (I always do) and it turned out wonderful.  Nice crust on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  Not too dense!

This banana bread is amazing. I can't believe any sweet bread with only 1/4 cup margarine could taste this great and be so moist. I also find it tasty to make this recipe with 1 cup white flour and 2/3 cup whole wheat flour.

I have made this bread twice within a week and ate it all by myself! (Cos my husband don't like cooked bananas) Anyway, I used half brown sugar and half splenda. Half whole wheat flour. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla extract. And I used egg substitute in place of real eggs. To top it all off, I added in chunks of sliced bananas into the batter before putting it into the oven! The result..?? Heavenly delicious!! Especially if you're nuts about bananas, like me. I also added raisins both times and next, I am going to try chopped dates.

Maybe there is something wrong with me but I did not think this recipe was anything spectacular. I like my banana bread to be very dense and this is not. Also, I agree with the other reviewer who said it had kind of a gummy texture - the bottom is almost chewy whereas the top seems normal.  I'm not quite sure what this recipe is missing, but quite frankly I haven't found the perfect banana bread recipe yet on allrecipes.com. I'll keep trying!

To die for!  I couldn't believe this wasn't the fattening version!  I looked at my regular banana bread recipe, and it didn't call for cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla, so I hesitated adding them (as other reviewers suggested).  I did add 1/4 tsp. vanilla to this bread, and will do so again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a lovely recipe. I substituted applesauce for margarine/butter and 1% milk for water, and it turned out great. I did need to bake it for the suggested time - near the end, I lowered the temp because the top was nice and brown but the middle was still wet. It turned out perfectly though. Oh, I also added some milk chocolate chips and I'm glad I did- the bread didn't need it, but I needed a little more sweet to get my boyfriend to eat it :) I'm glad to finally find a low-fat , delicious banana bread recipe that turns out a bread that is NOT dense. Excellent!

Great recipie!  I substituted 1/3c S*lenda and 1/3c brn sugar, 1/8c water and 1/8c skim milk, wheat flour, and used 3 bananas, 1/4t nutmeg, 1/2t cinnamon, and 1t vanilla (as per other suggestions)as well as 2 "handfulls" of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The ONLY indication that this was a lower fat version was that the bread was slightly less moist than others I've made.  I'll certainly be making this again!

I think this is really good for a lower fat banana bread. I used 1/3 cup S*lenda and 1/3 dark brown sugar and 3 egg whites instead of the 2 eggs. I then added some cinnamon and nutmeg (a pinch of each), 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I've definitely had better banana bread, but this is by far the best lower fat one that I have made.

I won't rate this recipe since I messed around with it so much that it wouldn't be fair. I accidentally added way too much banana (about double the amount or slightly more)...I was making a whole bunch of different banana recipes tonight and I lost my concentration. Anyway, to compensate for the extra moisture and to increase the health benefits, I added 1/2 a cup of wheat bran on top of the all purpose flour. I also omitted the water. I also decided to use 1/3 white & 1/3 brown sugar, and I used butter instead of shortening since it was all I had on hand. In the end, I think the bread would've been good even with all these changes, except that it cooked in about 35 or 40 minutes...but I didn't check it til 50 minutes. It still tastes ok on the inside, and is definitely nice & moist, but the crust is tough, burnt-tasting, and yucky. I'll have to make this again properly and watch the time closely. Still, all things considered, it's not too bad at all...it will still get eaten up in no time, I'm sure!

This is a great recipe!  I used half splenda and half brown sugar, but it turned out so good, that I think I will use all splenda next time.  I added 3 bananas as others have recommended and also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  Very easy to prepare!  Thanks!

Not as moist as I would have liked, but as it was lower in fat than many of the other banana bread recipes so that was understandable.

This recipe was excellent. I do not have a log tin so I put the mix in muffin tins. I also used wholemeal self raising flour and omitted the baking powder. They were delicious and ready in a flash!

i gave it only a four star because i did not knw is it because i overmix the batter but my bread turn out quite rubbery instead of moist. Also, i used a loaf tin and the bread crack in the middle. does anyone know why it turns out this way? But overall, the taste was good but i will use more bananas next time for s stronger flavour. I also substituted half of the butter with apple sauce.

The flavor is good, but be careful with the time!  I checked mine at 45 minutes and it was just starting to burn... it turned out okay, but next time I make this, I will shorten the baking time.  I took the advice of other reviewers and did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  Probably adding the brown sugar helped to shorten the baking time.

The banana bread is moist and delicious.  I did take the others' advices and substitute applesauce for butter and splenda for white sugar.  I also added 1/4C of chocoloate chips, 1/4C of chopped walnuts, spinkle of allspice and cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  Next time I will probably add an extra banana for stronger banana flavor.  Just one question, is the bread supposed to raise to 3 inches?  cos' mine didn't raise much, only about 1.5 inch thick and the texture of the top and bottom of the bread is more dense than that in the middle.  I will definitly make this banana bread again, as it is so healthy and yummy.  Thanks for this lovely recipe!

it is hard to judge whether it is done. mine turned out having a hard crust after baking for 50 mins. 40 min could probably have been sufficient. nonetheless, it's still very tasty. i added choc chips, replaced margarine with 1/4 cup and 1 tbs apple sauce, mixed white sugar with brown. taste good!

This banana bread was outstandingly delicious.  Even my mom liked it and she's a tough critic to please. I did some modifications to this recipe with some of the suggestions that were posted.  I cut back on the butter to 2tbsp and added 2 heaping tbsp of applesauce and folded in some chocolate chips.  Instead of adding water, I substituted that with skim milk. Also, I cut back on the white sugar since I was adding chocolate chips.  After the loaf was done and cooled slightly, I decided to melt some white chocolate to glazed the top of the loaf with it.

This recipe is excellent.  I used applesauce like several other people mentioned.  The only thing I had around the house was fruit punch applesauce, but I think that added an interesting flavor.  I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  My baking time was a little longer.

I searched for a low fat banana bread recipe because I am trying to eat healthier and loose some weight.  This recipe is so good and I am making it so much I am probably gaining weight.  I replaced the butter with applesauce and use brown sugar instead of white.  It is great.  As a matter of fact I am making some right now!

Great banana bread. I substituted apple sauce for the margarine. It was so moist and so full of flavor. I couldn't believe it. You can add anything to this bread. Chocolate chips, coconut, dried fruit, grated zucchini, cinnamon/nutmeg, walnuts. The list can go on and on. This is my new banana bread recipe. Thanks.

I've made this so many times, and it always comes out moist and delicious. I usually add about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to give it a little spice. Also, it has never taken 60 minutes for my loaf to cook. It's usually done in about 45 minutes, so start checking about that time so it doesn't overcook. :) Wonderful bread though, I really enjoy it. Thanks much!

This recipe came out just perfect. It's so simple to make and the baking was absolutely trouble free.
I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and I sprinkled some ginger for added flavour.
I will definitely make it again.

This is the BEST banana bread recipe posted and it's easy to make. The only changes that I made were to add 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips, 1 tsp of vanilla and sometimes I add 1/4 of walnut pieces. It's just depending on who you are making it for, some people like nuts or chocolate. Enjoy the recipe, thank you for posting it!

I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it was delicious. I had a coworker say that she did not like banana bread but she loved this!!

I'm not an avid baker, but this recipe turned out great!  I used applesauce instead of butter/margarine like a few people suggested.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!  :)

Great recipe... and I'm not usually a Banana Bread lover. Per others' suggestions I replaced the margarine with applesauce (1/2 cup) and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I've added this to my favorite recipes notebook!

i originally was going to give this recipe 4 stars but i'm glad i didn't write it up right away because after 2 days the flavors of this bread really bloomed! like others, i substituted a rounded 1/2 cup. applesauce for the margarine & decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. of course i was compelled to supplement the flour with 2/3 whole wheat & added a heaping 1/2 cup of golden raisins. no nuts this time, but who knows the future? thank you lauren!

This is a very, very good recipe.  I used 3 very ripe bananas, light butter, reduced the sugar to half a cup and added half a cup of chocolate chips.  Big hit!!

5 stars for being easy to make, 5 stars for tasting so good and 5 stars for being healthy!!!  As per other reviewers, I used a little over 1/4 c. applesauce in place of butter, 1/2 c. sugar instead of 2/3 c. and 3 bananas.

Great taste for a lower fat recipe.  I added an extra banana for good measure.

This is a keeper! It's very easy to put together since its all in one bowl.It was ready in 40-45 min. I made the mistake of putting chocolate chips on top right before I baked it. Mistake. Some fell off when I turned it upsidedown. Next time I'll add one more banana.

I always appreciate the reviews as much as the recipes. From the reviews for this recipe I learned I should add extra bananas, could substitute applesauce for some of the butter and could bake the batter in baking cups. Incorporated all these suggestions and my lowfat banana muffins were delicious. Thanks for the recipes and the reviews.

Delicious recipe! I read other's comments and took some advice: added 1/2cup of chocolate chips, 1/2cup chopped walnuts, an extra banana, plus a healthy shake of CINNAMON, my pic for *special* ingredient! (gave a wonderful hint of flavor to the bread, highly recommended). Thanks for the recipe, will definitely use this again.

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gooooooooooooooooooood.  a google times better than that "almost no fat banana bread"!!! as a poor college student, i didn't have margarine (so i used butter instead, though i would've loved to use the lower fat substitute), i didn't have white sugar, so i used brown.  i didn't have baking soda, only powder, so i used 2x the powder they stated.  it tastes too good. i'm really glad i only had 1 overripe banana left, that i made a small loaf only...otherwise i'd be chowing it all down in one sitting.

I did not really like this recipe.  I did not like the consistancy, and thought the overall taste was not as good as other banana breads I've made it the past.  I used whole wheat flour, so that might account for the things I didn't like.
