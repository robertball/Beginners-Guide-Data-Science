I followed the recipe with the following tweaks:

I added about 4-5 cloves of finely minced garlic to the mixture of bacon and onion. I also used about a palm full of seasoned breadcrumbs and 2 eggs to aid binding. 

Formed into patties and let them sit out for an hr or so before throwing them on a hot grill.

I grilled them until medium ( not well done )They turned out nice and juicy without being "greasy"

If you use thoroughly wet hands when forming the patties you don't need egg, crumb, or anything. The moisture of the water on your hands coats "smooths" & holds the mince together perfectly. These burgers were great. I even added some bbq sauce to the mix, delish!

Knew this would be a flop, but tried it anyway. Of course, they fell apart. They needed egg and breadcrumbs. I used real bacon pieces instead of all that frying of bacon and food processing. I think we will just stick with the old fashioned way.

Burgers had great flavor (will go lighter on salt next time) but they fell apart when flipped.  I think I will use a variation of this recipe in the future.

This is a great way to get the flavor of a bacon cheeseburger without the texture or bulk.  I really enjoy this crispy bacon and onion and this just absorbs all of that into the burger.  The flavor is good but without the texture it's just "missing something".  I also substitute Swiss cheese for the average american to add a little something extra.

I didn't add the bacon or the onion to the food processor because I thought they were chopped enough.  To cut down on the burgers being crumbling, I added 3 eggs to the meat, then rested the meat after forming the patties by putting them in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Was much easier to handle!

I used fried bacon, and cut up pepper jack cheese and cheddar, I added a jalapeno without seeds, salt pepper, garlic powder, onion powder.  I sized it for 4, and added one egg, and a  sprinkling of seasoned breadcrumbs.  I let this set in the refrigerator for 45 min.  formed patties, put on grill.
I usually don't eat a whole hamberger, but this was soooo good.

I liked this recipe and I used it for my culinary project and it was very good I later ate it for dinner and I would love to eat it again. The only thing I changed was I didn't add steak sauce to the burgers

I made these for my finicky teenagers and they LOVED them! They insisted that all future burgers be made this way. I skipped the steak sauce (they can add their own if they like) and used chub beef 93% lean figuring the bacon would add enough fat back in without making it greasy. I took the advice from another user and refrigerated the mixture for a couple of hours. The burgers were epic and will be a family favorite. Thank you Naomi!

A delightful recipe that you would LOVE! Very flavorful! The meal feels complete and delicious with homestyle fries (there is a recipe on allrecipes that is great!). Anyone should try it!
