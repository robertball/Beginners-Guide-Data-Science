For a healthy cookie these hit the spot.  I used brown sugar instead of white and cut it down to 1/2 cup.  Also I used all whole wheat flour.  The butterscotch chips make these phenomenal and so you don't miss the sugar.  Thanks for a way to use up all the zucchini I've got in my freezer!

I substituted 1/4 c. vegetable oil and 1/4 fat free yogurt for butter and added about a cup of cocnut and they are fantastic!

What a fun recipe with a great name. You can say you don't like zucchini, but that excuse just doesn't apply to baked goods with zucchini as an ingredient!  Zucchini makes baked goods more moist, and it doesn't have any strong flavor in cookies, cakes or brownies.  (So of course squash-haters will love these cookies!)  I made them with my toddler, and he loved them.  I used whole oats, but put them in the food processor first, since I've found that works best in oatmeal cookie recipes for me.  I measure the oats after processing them.  I also never bake my cookies more than 8-9 minutes, because that is how we like them!  (My husband thinks a brown cookie is burned and I kinda agree.)  Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies are awesome.  I did not use any nuts, and used cinammon chips instead of the chocolate chips (it was what I had in the pantry) and also added about 1/2 cup flaked coconut.  Baked for 15min.  Cookies are so moist, everyone loves them... especially the toddlers.

I had to cook them for much longer then suggested
(more than 14 minutes each time).  But they were
really good!  I made them without nuts and they were 
still quite good!

These are great cookies! I memory from my childhood on the farm. If you have picky kids, just peel the zucchini before shredding it. Then there won't be any green shreds- They won't be true martian cookies though, but then the kids won't know there's zucchini in them!

These are terrific!!  I'm over-run with zucchini and getting sick of making bread with it.  All of the family loved these.  Only thing I changed was to leave out the butterschotch chips as I did not have any.  Didn't miss them.  Thanks for posting.

I made these for the first time a couple years ago and they have been one of my favorites since. They are extremely tasty and I love the zucchini and butterscotch chips! Not the prettiest cookie, but very good and good for you.

Really really good. Don't like zuccini, so used 2 drops of green food coloring and just stirred it in for color. Gave it kind of a marble effect. Came out perfect. Going to do them in red and green for Christmas cookies. You've got a winner. Myrna

I was looking for a base chocolate chip cookie recipe to modify and this caught my eye because I had a bunch of frozen zucchini in my freezer.  I heavily modified this recipe (used coconut oil instead of butter, sugar-free chocolate chips, half splenda, half maltitol) and it still turned out great!

Delicious! Great way to get your family eating more veggies :) I did replace the white sugar with brown and reduced the amount of sugar down to 1/2 cup.Butterscotch chips were delicious with the chocolate and zucchini, plus the oatmeal gave the cookies another health kick plus were nice and moist. Will definetly make again! Highly recommend.

AMAZING!!!!  I didn't have high expectations when I made these...WOW was I wrong!  I only made one slight modification and that was to add 4 teaspoons of cocoa powder.  These are incredible cookies and I can't wait to make more!  A new FAVORITE in our house.

My favorite cookie recipe.  I never make less than a double batch and they will last a couple weeks in a ziplock bag.  (The ONLY reason I know this is because I sent some to my son in med hold and he was shipped home before they got to him.  It took that long for them to catch up.  LOL)  I don't like nuts, so I don't use them.  I freeze zucchini premeasured for cooking all year long.  I do NOT drain it before I add it in the mix.

I made these for a work potluck and they were the biggest hit out of the office dishes.  I used the specs as described in the recipe; they weren't pretty but they were tasty!  They disappeared, and I still get comments about them.  I will make these for events in the future :)

These are REALLY good!  I was leary about the zucchini, but WOW!  Super delicious!  My youngest is extremely picky and I am always looking for ways to slip him some veggies.  He gobbled these up!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have walnuts OR pecans, so I used some chopped almonds (salad topper.)

Awesome!  Kids and hubby love them!  I made them twice last week, once with just semi-sweet chocolate and the 2nd time with dark chocolate.  I spiced them up with cloves and nutmeg and replaced 1/2 butter with flax meal.  Also used 2 cups zuchini and no butterscotch chips, but 1 cup of chocolate and only used 1/2 the sugar called for.  They were plenty sweet.  Thanks!

I made this recipe with only one substitution.  I didn't have any butter so I used canola oil and they were excellent! Will definitely make again.  Did have to cook them for 17 minutes, I did make fairly large cookies. 9 per sheet.

Really good!  I made a double batch and used whole wheat flour, doubled the cinnamon and used yellow squash (that's what I had!) in place of zucchini.  Awesome.  :)  Froze the extra in sandwich baggies for school lunches.

These are really, really good!  Made them tonight for Back to School night tomorrow.  I left out the nuts since our school is nut free.  I'm going to make these again!  Another great recipe to help me use up my zucchini from my garden.

These are incredible!  A nice crunchy outside and chewy and moist on the inside. I did make some substitutions -- no butterscotch chips or walnuts, so I did 1 cup raisins and 1 cup chocolate chips.  Delish!  The second time I made these I snuck in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the white flour and my husband didn't notice!  Now he says these are the only cookies he needs.  And I think my 3 year old figures that zucchini is supposed to be in cookies.  This recipe and the zucchini brownies, also on this site, are my favorite go-tos when I get a choco craving.

My son and I made these.  We tripled the recipe and added an additional 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips but did not use the nuts or butterscotch chips.  My boys say they are 5 star.  I gave them a four only because they are a "little" bland.  I think they need frosting, but my boys say they are perfect without it.  They are definitely a cake cookie.  Not flat our crispy.  We decided they should be cooked at 375 for 12 minutes.  Otherwise they take 16 minutes and dry out some.  

Thanks for a nice healthy cookie recipe!

These were fun and wholesome. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I like my cookies to have a bit of a crunch, and these did not.  Next time I will put them into paper-lined cupcake tins.  I didn't have quick cooking oatmeal in a box, so I used 3 individual sized servings of walnut, date and raisin oatmeal and it worked really well.  Thanks for another way to use my zucchini!

These cookies are so moist and delicious and very forgiving. I didn't have any semi sweet chips so I added white chocolate and used almonds as I didn't have walnuts or pecans. Added some coconut, too!I am sure they would taste even better with the semi sweet chips and will use those next time. I felt like they were a little healthy to eat,and got to use up some of my zucchini too! Thanks for sharing,Thea!

These are surprisingly delicious! The grated zucchini definitely gives this cookie character and keeps it moist. The only changes I made were to reduce the sugar to half a cup and omit the chopped walnuts so my son could enjoy these too (not allergic, just a choking hazard). The batter could use some sprucing up with the addition of nutmeg, cloves, maybe allspice for a fall-type flavour. Will make these again for sure!

These were just ok.  They were a bit soft for a cookie (despite cooking them a little bit longer) and I found the dough a bit bland.  I would rather save my zucchini for a cake or loaf.

My kids, friends and neighbors all loved these cookies enough that I was glad to have access to a pile of zukes.  I had to cook a little longer than called for in recipe to get them a little golden.  I also thought they tasted better the second day after they'd softened a little.  Yummy...they were a hit with all.

We loved these cakey cookies.  Took them to a neighborhood party and it was the first plate gone.  The kids got a kick out of "surprising" their friends with the secret ingredient.

Actual batter is kind of bland, although cinnamony.  Don't realize it with the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and oatmeal though!  I omitted the walnuts and didn't miss them.  Perfect freezer cookie.  Zucchini kept the cookie moist and little green flecks visually interesting.  I will make again.

These are great cookies!!  My kids (3 & 5 yrs) were skeptical about the zuchinni but you can't even taste it!  The green flecks throughout were cute and I hyped up the space alien bit and my boys keep asking for more--I don't mind because of the oats and zuchinni.  I left out the nuts and used 1 cup of just chocolate chips.  Thea, thanks for a new favorite that's fun to eat.

I love these cookies.  As soon as the zucchini starts to get ripe I make a batch.  I follow the recipe exactly, except yes, I bake them longer, and they are a soft, delicious cookie that really freezes well.

these were great!  Most zucchini cookies have a real "cakey" texture.  But the addition of oats in this recipe makes them more chewy...like a traditional chocolate chip cookie!  Yum!

I can't believe how fast these cookies go - each person that I introduce to them falls in love.  I work with 2 dieticians who even give their approval!  I shred zukes and freeze them for the winter to add nutrition, bulk and fiber to various foods - the one downfall of that is that it is a little soggy when it unfreezes. (2cups frozen=1cup 'squeezed out'  That is actually a benefit for these cookies since the dough is very thick until you add the zucchini.  It also makes for the perfect cookie texture: thick, full of ingredients (these cookies definitely aren't the type to cook out flat), cake-like but firm enough to give you a great bite without falling apart.  Yum, Yum, YUM!!!  Not one person has disagreed.  They're my new potluck staple and it's so exciting to discuss - yes you CAN make desserts more healthy.  Most definitely thanks for sharing this recipe!  And I LOVE the name 'Martian cookies' - that sells the kids everytime, not to mention great for St. Patty's Day too :-)

These taste much better than they look.  I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used peanut butter & milk chocolate chips.  I had to bake them much longer than the recipe said and made 36 rather than 24.  I think next time I'll try 375 and add more cinnamon.

I loved the name of these cookies and the accompanying story, but unfortunately the cookies did not come out well.  I only used 1/2 c sugar and they still turned out WAY TOO sweet!!  I would not make these again, but if I did, I'd exclude the butterscotch chips as they were simply overwhelming.

This was a great recipe to use up my summer zucchinis! My oldest son said, "Mom, these are really moist." I did not cook them till golden brown just till lightly brown. I doubled the recipe too and it came out very well. I will definitely make these again!

The only changes I made to the original were to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce and I omitted the nuts. They took longer than the 12min the recipe stated to cook. The flavor was good, though. Good base cookie recipe. I think next time I'm going to try baking them at 375 like some of the other reviews suggest. Plan to also use 1/4c mini chocolate chips and 1/4 cup mini mms.

I subbed blueberry cruising for the choc chips. They’re not too sweet, which I like. Had to pat these down when they were done cooking to flatten out a bit, and needed 15 minutes to get the bottom golden brown. The tops never really darken so don’t be fooled! Great recipe!

Made them per recipe-no substations. I took them as a donation for volunteers at a non profit. People started asking who made them, then finding me to tell me how good they are! When I make them again, I will double the recipe! Thank you Allrecipes.com!

These cookies are amazing! I made them last year for a family reunion and they have been requested many times since then. So moist and cake-like--delicious! I pressed out the moisture in the zucchini before adding to the batter to make sure it didn't get too wet. Great way to use up zucchini other than in zucchini bread!

Huge hit with the kiddies, and super healthy too... what's not to like? I did refrigerate the dough between batches, led to a crisper cookie. Mine got done in about 12-14 minutes and I got around 40 cookies.

Very interesting. Taste is good, but different--a conglomerate collection of cookies!  I found 12 minutes was enough. Used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar.  Rolled into balls-they held their shape well.

I must admit I was skeptical, especially about the zucchini (not a fan of it by itself). I'm surprised how delicious they are! Think of an oatmeal cookie with butterscotch and chocolate chips. That's almost exactly what these taste like. They're very moist. I cooked them for 10-11 minutes - I did not wait for them to brown except perhaps on some of the edges (I made them smaller than the average cookie). They are so moist - not raw, moist. I guess I'm not the biggest fan of butterscotch so I think next time I'll lessen or omit them and add other things (cocoanut or raisins or more chocolate chips).

I just made these cookies, they are good. I substituted coconut oil for the butter. I also did change a few other things with what I had and did not have on hand. No choco chips, used craisons. I also didn't use the nuts. I added 1/2c coconut flakes. They are soft and just so good. Will definetly make these cookies again.

my entire family loves these - we make a double batch and freeze half of the resulting cookies for eating later in the month.

I followed the recipe, and they turned-out just fine, but I didn't like (1) how they looked (visually, they look like somebody got sick) (2)the cake-like texture, or (3) the butterscotch mixed with the chocolate ... just not for me.

I was looking for something a bit different and found these.  Delicious.  I must agree with some of the other reviews, did take a bit longer to bake, but really, really good.

I read all of the reviews and took a lot of ideas from everyone else.  I used whole wheat flour and granulated honey.  They won't spread out with honey, so I flatten them like I would a peanut butter cookie.  Can't taste the zucchini at all, so it would be a good way to sneak veggies in. I will drizzle some melted butterscotch over the top of these, they are kind of ugly.  I really like them though!  I will make these again!

These are good!  I think the flour could be decreased a bit; they weren't as moist as I'd like.  But overall, I'd recommend them.  You can hardly taste the zucchini.

These cookies were exceptional. All my kids liked them, as well as my husband. And he is hard pressed to like any cookie other then plain old chocolate chip.Even my toddler kept trying to steal them. I made them exactly like in the recipe, except i traded butterscotch cchips for peanut butter chips, and added a pinch of nutmeg (it's my favourite).
