This recipe was AWESOME! Very simple to make! This was my first shot at making biscotti now I'm addicted! Much cheaper and more fun than buying them! The only thing I changed was I used Almond extract...awesome flavor! Oh yeah and to have a little fun I melted choc. chips over a double burner and dipped one side in it and added crused almonds and mini choc. chips to make them look "Gourmet"!! Thanks so much for the recipe! I will use it over and over!!

Very good recipe! Note that the dough is a lot wetter/stickier than I thought it would be. It is more batter like than dough like so keep that in mind when you are shaping your logs. I found it easiest to shape by spreading with my spatula first and then patting into shape with buttery fingers.

I like to toast the almonds first,it brings out the flavor of the almonds.I also sometimes use orange zest in the cookies.

I had to use about a cup of extra flour for the dough to become more of a dough and less of a cake batter :-) But other than that, they turned out great! I used a coffee bean grinder to crush up the almonds, then I crushed up some white chocolate chips in there, and added some extra cinnamon. They came out wonderful! A side note : Before you place the loaves on the pan, spray with cooking spray! The milk got under the bread as I was brushing it, and the sugar caused it to bake to the foil :-0!

I did read the reviews so I was prepared for the dough to be sticky, but that was an understatement.  I bake a lot and my first thought was this would spread once it warmed up in the oven being a thin cookie.  So I decided to seperate ut into two bowls.  The one I left alone.  The other I added about 1/2 cup of extra flour.    the results:  The original recipe batter was hard to work with and did spread a little while baking,  But it also had a nice shape and the taste was amazing when finished. Just enough crunch.    The second bowl with the added flour did hold it's shape better and was a bit easier to work with but was tougher and crunchier with less flavor.

These are superb!!  This recipe is easy to prepare and makes a wonderful gift.  I gave it to all my family and friends this year and they all loved it.  The only change I made in the recipe was to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  The batter was slightly runny for me and it helped it keep its shape.  I also had to add 5 to 7 minutes more for the first baking.  I also baked it longer for the second baking.

Made these for Christmas and everyone loved them.  I was worried that they might be hard to make but they were anything BUT!  They came out just like the kind you can buy at a latte stand.  I even half dipped some of them in chocolate and white chocolate and they were SO wonderful dipped in coffee!  If you've never made them then try this recipe.

My husband actually made this Biscotti and although he isnt Italian he enjoyed making it and tasting Biscotti for the first time... Thank you for an awesome Treat and Memory

Delicious.....first time trying this recipe, a little sticky but worked as explained.  They are wonderful.  I doubled my batch and half of them I dipped the flat bottoms in milk chocolate....I'm already telling my friends to try your recipe.

This was so easy and very good. Not quite as flavorful as I was expecting but I quite enjoyed it. Drizzled melted chocolate on top. I will make it again.

Thank you for this recipe.  I'll admit, I did not follow it to a "T", but give it five stars because it's the highest recommendation I can give and I feel the recipe deserves it. I read another almond biscotti recipe (from another site), and that one called for 3 eggs, but no butter (no fat at all).  Personally, I like the taste of biscotti with butter, so I decided to use 1/2 C butter and reduced the eggs to 2 rather than 3 (other recipe called for 3 eggs also w/ same amount of flour) so the loaves wouldn't spread so much when baking. I was going for a really "almond" taste, so I used almond extract and toasted 1 C of almonds. The results were exactly as I had hoped - YUMMY!!! A tip - when I get ready to toast the biscotti, I place the slices on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet.  Then there's no need to turn them, and toasting only takes half the time.

This recipe was SOOOOO unbelievably simple! I don't eat biscotti, but I made this for my mom for Mother's Day. The only substitute I made was almond extract for vanilla. I dipped them in chocolate after they baked as well. My mom said they were delicious!

Very delicious! I used anise extract for the flavoring. Filled my house with a delicious scent. Only word of advice I would give to fellow bakers that was not included in the recipe was the make sure that the loafs you make aren't too thick so that you don't have gooey spots in the cookies.

This was the second biscotti recipe that I made and the batter for the first was firmer so I was a little uneasy about how this one would turn out.  No need to worry - this is awesome biscotti.  I used almond extract and increased the almonds to more than a cup. I also did not brush with milk and sugar.  On about half (after they were totally cooled) I dipped one end in melted chocolate and then sprinkled with crushed almonds - will definatley make again

I am only giving this b/c I had to modify it some.  I added a 1/4 cup more of flour as others suggested and taosted my almonds and put 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla.  With these modifications they were delicious.  I dipped them in dark chocolate.  I will be making this recipe all the time.

I just made these for the first time. They came out perfect. I used wax paper to help shape the logs. And the batter was not that bad. Did not have to add more flour. I followed the instructions exactly. Next time i am going to try chocolate !

Simple and delicious! I made the recipe with a little less sugar, and closer to 3 C. of flour. I used almond extract (same amount) and just mixed in the almonds to the dough- no milk needed.  They were really good, especially after I drizzled with milk chocolate!

This was my first attempt at biscotti and although everyone liked them I felt they needed more flavor. I did vanilla extract and a splash of almond extract and I think next time I will try the anise. I am thinking lemon and almond together would be really good. Nice and easy to make :)

It was lovely! I was upset to find that I didn't have any almonds on me, so substituted 1/2 teaspoon almost extract, and my boyfriend still raved and asks me to make it again. Thanks!

This is not my first biscotti recipe,  the dough is more like cookie - then like other boscotti doughs - I added more flour and still had to coat my hands throughly to work with it.  And had to cook for about 30 minutes in order to get it to dry out enough.  

The taste was good - I added cinnamon.  Everyone who ate it loved it.

Because of all the good reviews I chose this recipe as my first-time biscotti attempt.  The only change I made was to flavor the batter with 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I didn't have any almonds to add so those were left out.  DEFINITELY make two batches because we were eating them right away.

I absolutely loved the taste of the biscotti. I shared it with my neighbor and she thought I bought them from the store. I added melted chocolate on the top. I give it 4 stars though as it was messy to make and the dough was not easy to manage and after it was baked, some broke off. But the taste was amazing.

super yummy & easy recipe- the batter is runny- i baked it on parchment and made troughs out of the parchment so the cookie couldn't spread out too much.  dont add more flour, it make the texture more dense (not as good).  either refrigerate the dough before cooking or use parchment or aluminum foil to keep the logs in shape

Ok, these are GREAT! So easy and they taste just like my Nonnies! I have made these 3 times already in one WEEK! I've been giving them away as gifts at work, etc. You can wrap them up in pretty packaging, too! Honestly the first biscotti recipe that I've actually loved! THANK YOU!

I had never made biscotti before and was looking for a recipe that I thought would be good for me to try.  This was it!  I followed the directions exactly...I did add 1/2 c. flour more because of other comments...step by step.  It does take some time but in the end they were just what I had hoped for.  I decided to add some melted choc. drizzled over the top and not only does that add flavor, it is very attractive.  Both white and milk choc. work great!

Excellent recipe. Always wanted to make biscotti from scratch.  Added 1/4-1/2 cup extra flour, a 1 1/2 tst, almond extract and an additional 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Cooked a bit longer than 10 min on each side at the end.  Fabulous,everyone in the house loved it.

First time baking Biscotti, and didn't know that it could be done! I did it, and followed exactly as prescribed. It turned out just as if I went to the Italian bakery! The only addition I did was add some crushed pistacchio nuts, and it was a hit with my husband who absolutely looooves all cookies! RAVE RAVE!!! :)

I've made this twice now, and have determined that I need to increase the flour (2nd batch I increased to 2-1/2 c. flour, 3rd batch I'll increase to 2-3/4 c.), and to increase the cooking time (1st batch 15 minutes, 2nd batch 17 minutes, 3rd batch will be 20 minutes).  It was way to runny the 1st batch, and still a little (not much) on the 2nd batch, which is why I'm increasing the flour.  I didn't cook either batch long enough and it was a bit dough-y in the middle, which is why I'm working towards 20 minutes for the next batch.  Flavor is great.  I also don't think 10 minutes per side is long enough.  Maybe my oven is a bit off (??)  All batches I added 1 cup of chopped dried cranberries and 1 cup of chopped almonds.  2nd batch also added zest from 1 orange.  Great flavor on all.

This is an excellent recipe! It's authentic, easy to follow, and my biscotti came out so good! I did not alter the recipe at all. Perhaps another time I'll experiment.

This is fabulous! Like others, I used almond extract instead of the vanilla/anise. They taste amazing and look pretty too. :) Thanks!

This recipe is excellent! I used 1 tsp anise extract, 1 tsp almond extract, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. The taste was perfect. I also used an extra cup of flour so the dough wasn't as sticky. Everyone loved this biscotti. It wasn't too hard either which was great. You can eat this with or without dunking in coffee. Excellent :) Thank you!

Absolutely wonderful... I did follow some suggestions, added a touch more flour, ground up my Almonds, and ground up some Chocolate Chips, also used Almond extract instead of the other flavors... Turned out to our liking and I will be making these for Christmas Presents. I figured baked goods will work well this year!!! Hurray!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This was my first attempt at biscotti. It was so easy! In my opinion they are way better than any biscotti that you can buy at Starbucks. It's an easy recipe and simple to add in cranberries or dip in chocolate, too. They soak up your hot coffee very well. They look professional, also!

I was going to give this a horrible rating because the "dough" was practically batter.  I added a little more flour and hoped for the best, but they didn't hold shape.  I was able to salvage them and the taste is pretty great, if a little lighter than biscotti should be.  I added a little almond extract and dipped the bottoms of the finished product in dark chocolate.  They will do.  True almond biscotti shouldn't have butter, I have now learned.

These were a hit.  One thing I will note for the next time I make these is to use a serrated knife to cut them.  Also I am going to try using almond flavor instead of vanilla.

Yum!  I love biscotti and decided to try this recipe.  I had some dried tart cherries so I added about 1/2 cup.  These were fantastic.  I'm going to make them with dried blueberries next time.  Thanks for sharing!

This came out amazing! I added a bit more flour like a few people had suggested (1/4 cup). I am very happy with this recipe. I added a dark chocolate drizzle. I'll be making this again and again.

I made this recipe yesterday.  First time I ever ate biscotti.  This stuff is wonderful!!  Had it with coffee for breakfast this morning.  How could I have lived without it for all these years.  Making more today to take to Texas for Christmas.  The kids will love it.  Not too sweet which is a problem with most recipes that I run across for the holidays.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I did follow the recipe to a "T".  With the exception of !/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond flavoring and a few more almonds.  It was so easy to make.  Had read the reviews befpre making and chilled the dough before forming.  It worked great.!!!

OK these are awesome.  I made two changes...I tripled the almonds and added 1/4 t almond extract to 1 t vanilla.  They are quite delicate during the baking process...but are the best biscotti I think I've ever had when they are properly dried out.  I drizzled a small amount of semisweet chocolate on the cookies after they were completely cool.  You wont regret making these but they require a light touch during cutting.

This was my first attempt at biscotti and although the overall outcome was tasty it had way too much of a butter flavor.  To actually make it a "dough" I had to add at least another 1.5 cups of flour. Also, the first baking time should be increased to at least 25-30 minutes. I'd also say that the additional 1/4 cup of sugar for a topping is excessive. I only used about 2 tsp and it was plenty.

This recipe is far too wet; first batch just melted in oven, flatter than a pancake;  I then added more flour, and held shape a little better. Too much fussing around; also 2nd baking was not 10 or 15 min, was more like 45 min.  Not worth the effort

I was not sure of this recipe when I made the dough as it was REALLY wet and I actually wondered if I'd missed an ingredient.  However, I plugged along and follwed the recipe to a "T" and I"m glad I did.  While the dough did spread alot more then other biscotti recipes I've used, it did produce a great cookie!  I baked it 10 minutes longer the first time and when I cut it into slices and baked the second time, I baked them 5 minutes longer on each side.  I dipped them in chocolate on one side and sprinkled with sliced almonds and they turned out great!!!!  I will certainly make this recipe again....

As stated, this is a versatile recipe with a strong and reliable base! I made one plain batch of this, and one in which I added white chocolate chunks, chopped pistachios and chopped dried apricots. That was a great combination for this biscotti. Will make again.

A dear friend of mine gave me this exact recipe and we both seemed to misplace the recipe when we get the "feel" to bake these. I just baked the biscotti and of course they came out wonderfully! One thing different that I did is when you cut the bread to shape the biscotti, and baked for 10 min (@ 300 F), then flip and bake the other side. I turn off the oven after 10 min and then leave them in there until they are absolutely cooled off. They come out more crunchy and drier for coffee! I also add dried fruits when I get the hankerin' - This is a fail proof recipe and I highly recommend it!

I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and chopped pistachios instead of almonds because that's all I had.

Followed the recipe exactly, but the dough was incredibly wet so I added about another cup of flour. Poured it on the aluminum foil and didn't even try to shape it. I finished it off according to the directions and it came out looking like it should. I'm used to biscotti being very dry and this came out slightly chewy still. I might try increasing the final baking time by 5-10 minutes per side.

After reading the previous reviews, I followed the recipe very closely.  I used my food processor to make the dough/batter and I forgot the milk wash and extra sugar.  They were wonderful!  This is my new goto biscotti recipe, even my 11 yo daughter likes them.

This was my first try making biscotti and I must say, this is a wonderful and simple recipe!!! It is so tasty! I added some coarsly chopped semi-sweet chocolate. I didn't measure the chocolate, I used what I had left over from some other baking. I think it was a wonderful addition to this recipe. I do recommend using slightly wet hands when shaping the dough as it is a very sticky dough. Enjoy:)

Perfect!  I've tried many biscotti recipes and this one is the best.  I was unsure of the batter because previous reviewers mentioned that it was runny, but I decided to make it according to the recipe.  The batter was soft, but not unmanageable.   I also added extra flavors such as orange zest, almond extract and some dried cranberries, cut into small pieces.  It is wonderful and I'm anxious to give as Christmas gifts this year.  Thank you!

I had to add more flour for this recipe so it had the right consistency and I didn't brush it with milk (instead I brushed it with crisco vegetable shortening) and sprinkled brown sugar instead of white sugar. Also, I added orange zest ad vanilla extract and anise so the taste (and smell) of the egg is hidden. Other than that, it was a great recipe and it was my first time making biscotti.

This is a recipe I'm keeping on hand forever! The only change I made to this recipe was almost doubling the almond (we love nuts). It was amazing, and much easier than I thought it would be. The dough was super sticky, and I didn't want to add flour having never made this before. My sweetheart helped me with the sticky mess. Everything else was smooth sailing. I plan on making these again soon for a gathering.

The batter was a great consistency. I misread the 2 teaspoons of milk as 2 tablespoons so I had a lot of trouble with moisture in the middle which caused the cookie to crumble when I cut it...but that is clearly a personal error. The only downside for me is that it was a little too sweet for my taste. I think I will take the other user's advice and toast the almonds a bit to bring out their flavor. I also used vanilla because I had it on hand but I love the idea of using anise. I will definitely try that next.

This recipe turned out great.Made it for Christmas, and already have requests for more.I  dipped some of the biscotti in chocolate. People liked those the best. I did substitute olive oil for the butter, and added a few drops of almond oil.  For those having problems with the stickiness of the dough it is supposed to be that way, and rinsing your hands with cold water allows you to work with the dough much easier. I also used parchment paper, not foil.

This is a really good recipe. I added dried cherries and the extra tanginess of the cherries made it perfect. I made it again and added dried cranberries, that was good too.

Great flavor. I used a little Anis seed. I also toasted the almonds. It didn't look like much so I made 1 loaf and this was a mistake. It grew and then didn't cook through. I saved them by cutting it after the first baking. They aren't as pretty as they would have been though so I am leaving a note to myself so I don't make that mistake again. This is a keeper. Even my kids love them.

Great recipe but did not make the quantity that it stated. Used almond extract in place of vanilla and added 1/4 cup add'l flour. Sprayed Pam on my hands before shaping dough and it helped tremedously. Baked first time 25 minutes. My family loves it and I plan on making more for christmas gifts.

This was a great basic recipe. I used 1 cup All Natural Whole Wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour to make it a little healthier. I had to add some extra flour because it was sticky. I added pure almond extract with a little dash of pure vanilla extract to add more of an almond flavor. I also used 1 cup of almond slivers instead of chopped, yum!

Wonderful recipe from a local cook...  This dough was just perfect not crumbly or even sticky as some biscotti dough is, which made it very easy to deal with.  I did use butter and almond extract, also did not brush with the milk, just topped with the extra sugar.  Oh yes, how could I forget the extra chocolate chips I just had to add, I am a chocoholic and have to have my regular fix.  Great recipe thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe! I used almond extract instead of vanilla and added extra almonds, lemon zest and a splash of wine to change it up a bit. They were such a hit I had to triple the recipe!

This is a great recipe if you're a newbie at making biscotti. I tried another recipe in the past but couldnt get the cookies crunchy enough. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to make the dough thicker and easier to spread. Warning: This recipes makes a lot of biscotti, actually a massive amount. Now I have a million biscotti and only two people to eat them all:) This recipe is so good.. amazing with almond and vanilla extract together. I did a teaspoon of each to have a strong flavor.

Very good taste, but the dough was too thin, I'll need to add more flour next time.  I also added 1 t of almond ext and 1/2 t of vanilla.

The extra extracts were a great addition. I put in both almond and vanilla. Delicious!

The first time I made this recipe, the batter was too sticky and wet.  Although the cookie tasted great, I figured that I may have done something wrong in the mixing process.  I made it for a second time, but this time I hand mixed the dry ingredients instead of using my mixer and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  It came out perfect!!  I highly recommend this recipe with a slight adjustment.  Thanks for posting!!

This recipe was a great one! I've never made biscotti, and was expecting more of a dough than a cookie batter. Next time I'll remember to use two separate cookie sheets as my two dough 'logs' ran together once in the oven. But, these didn't last very long and I alreayd have people wanting more! I toasted my almonds and next time I think I shall use Almond Extract instead of Vanilla. I also melted some Dove chocolate and dipped them in that. MMMM! Thanks!

Good if you like your biscotti more cake-like. I prefer mine dense and didnt like how this turned out. Be prepared for the dough to spread and flatten. Flavor seemed ok, but not that great. I didnt change the ingred.

I followed the directions but added Almond Extract and a TBS of Orange Zest.  I used two extra large eggs.
The batter was like cake batter, way to doughy to shape into loaves.  I had to add more flour to get it to the right consistancy.  I was worried that they wouldn't turn out right.  
I was quite surprised when I let them cool, I was able to cut these into diagonal shapes without them crumbling.  Even though I added about 3/4 extra of flour the taste is amazing!
There was a mess to clean up after with the gooey dough.  I will make these again!

Hi I did try this version of almond biscotti but somehow it was sweeter thant wanted it to be and it lacked the crunchiness. i have tried almond biscotti with almost the same ingredient with 150 grm of sugar 150 gms of almnod and no butter..it worked amazing for me.... bu then i like my biscotti to be crispy and with lots of almonds

Wonderful recipe, I made a double batch with the vanilla.  I made 1/2 regular and the last 1/2 I added a teaspoon of cinnamon,. both were great...awesome recipe. Thank you, it was much easier than others I have tried in the past.

i followed this exact recipe, it was my first biscotti, it came deliciouc!!!  Thanks Mrs. H Michaelsen!!! And who says that the dough is sticky_USE spoon people!!! it is easy!!! I don't think you need to add more flour than it is says in the recipe cuase in that case it would be much heavy, in this case it is light so u can go for another biscotti and not feel like you had a big cake!

I made these according to the recipe and they were delicious!!  They tasted just like the Nonni brand I used to buy, but so much cheaper and easy to make.  I used the anise flavoring.  So glad I found this recipe; no need to change a thing.  This is the BEST recipe for biscotti!!!

These biscotti are easy but very satisfying!  Don't be afraid to make them longer, but cut them into diagonal slices to maximize the "gourmet" look.  Also, adding a bit of almond extract to the batter will make them taste even better!

I love this recipe. It is very easy and tastes great. I make a batch once a week. I have played around a bit with the sugar and flour amounts. I like to use about 1/4 cup extra flour and a little less sugar on top. I use anise. Love the flavor. I also like a little more nuts. I think I will stick with this basic recipe and just change it around, see what I come up with.

Fabulous, easy recipe.  I followed almost exactly with the exception of using less sugar on top and I also added 1 tsp. of almond extract (along with the 1 tsp. of vanilla).    I didn't find the dough too difficult to handle.  I spread it out in the general shape I wanted using a spatula and then used my wet hands to smooth it out and make it more evenly rectangular.

Best biscotti recipe I've tried yet.  Makes an excellent dunking cookie (absorbs coffee without falling apart while dunking).  After reading other reviews, I added 1 extra cup of flour and 1 extra tsp of vanilla.  Almond extract would have given it more taste than vanilla - I'll try that the next time.

This is a good recipe, easy to follow. Earlier reviews mention the viscocity problem. I was tempted to overcome that by adding flour, but decided on another tack- mini cakes instead of logs. I followed the recipe almost as written, used brown sugar, omitted essence, used 1/2 cup pistachio nuts and 1/4 cup candied ginger. After 20 minutes of baking as recommended, my test-needle came out wet- another 5 minutes 'did the trick'. The mini cakes came out well and were easily sliced in 1/2 inch slices after 10minutes of cooling. Next time,  1)I'll try yhinner slices & 2)I'll add more flavouring perhaps ginger powder and for my taste, less sugar. In general, I prefer to use whole foods, such as whole grain flour, but decided to go with the flow (except for brown sugar) this time.

Perfect! I followed the recipe exactly. The do spread, so make the log narrower and taller that you want the cookies to be. Still it's an awesome recipe. Crunchy, dry and buttery at the same time!  (the week before making this recipe I tried a recipe from "Martha" and they were nothing compare to this ones!)

This was my first time making biscotti and it was fairly easier than I thought - it just does take time, mostly if you I decided to make a double batch which I did. For my first attempt I used vanilla and almond flavoring and topped them with sliced almonds rather than more sugar. I read the reviews and noticed that many of them mentioned that the dough was too runny so I thought I would leave 1 egg out. In my opinion i think it would have been better if I had not omitted that one egg. I think that it would have helped with the crumb/texture a bit more. Of course the dough is sticky and you just need to wet your hands in order to work with it. I would recommend to lengthen the first bake a bit because if the middle isn't done then the slicing becomes a big chore to try to keep the slice from falling into two pieces. Another thing I would recommend is to not put more than one rectangle of dough per pan. When I put two to a pan they ran into each other and even though it was only a little bit this still compromised the "prettiness" of the shape. You also do not want the dough close to the edge because then it will adopt that shape as well. I do plan on making these again only this time maybe one batch and definitely one rectangle of dough to a pan. Maybe then I could re-rate it to 5 stars.
Update....after trying a couple of other biscotti recipes I have to re rate this one to less...much less impressed with this one. You do need a much thicker dough than this for good biscotti.

This was a great recipe! It would have been helpful for me to know that when you are forming the dough into rectangles before baking, the dough will be really sticky and that is ok. I skipped the sugar on the top before baking. I also melted some chocolate chips and drizzled it over the top after they were cool.

Just got done making these and I'm so excited!  I didn't change anything other than toasting my almonds. These are so good! For those that complain about the dough being sticky, water your hands while you are working with the dough. The only thing I will do different next time is not put a full 1/4 C sugar on top before baking. Makes them a bit too sweet.  After they cool I'm going to dip in chocolate.  Can't wait for coffee tomorrow morning!

If I could give this 4.5 stars...I would. I've had some darn good biscotti which is why I wanted to try to make some myself. This recipe is fantastic and easy!   I will certainly be making these again!

Turned out pretty good, but the batter/dough was pretty hard to work with for me because it was sooo sticky. It could have been due to me accidentally adding the dusting sugar into the batter, lesson learned :)

this was amazing!  I also substituted almond extract instead of vanilla/anise and I added some cinnamon and dipped the bottoms in white chocolate.  My husband took some to work and everyone commented on how wonderful they were.  Much easier than I thought it would be.  I left it batter-like and just poured it spreading it with a spatula.  Make a double batch and just do one "loaf" per cookie sheet!

This is a awesome recipe.  This is the second recipe I tried for making Biscotti, and EVERYONE loved it.  I used 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract instead of the anise, and I also added a touch of cinnamon.  In addition, I also dipped it in vanilla glaze.  This caused the cookies to soften up a little (I think because I didn't let it cool COMPLETELY), but the majority of the house perfers it that way anyway.

03/09/2010:  After making these NUMEROUS times, I decided I like the ORIGINAL way it is presented with the exception of increasing the sugar to 1 1/4 in the batter (discovered this by accident), and adding Chocolate chips.  These are ALWAYS a hit!!!!

09/18/2015: after over six years of making this recipe, I am still finding it is the BEST biscotti recipe EVER. I made it recently for my brother-in-law for a birthday gift. However I did not have any almonds or vanilla extract.  I decided to use pistachios because I wanted to keep that nutty texture in the cookie, and I just disregarded the extract.  I also did not have any chocolate chips, so I could not add the drizzle I like. So I found "Sugar Cookie Glaze" by Cyndi and used that as my drizzle. It was a definite hit.  HINT: when spreading it into the rectangles, wet hands/spatula with water to make it easier.

Had not make biscotti in quite awhile-thse were the best. My better half said he was not really impressed with biscotti until I made these. I added walmuts along with the almond extract, and they are something I will make often, not just for the holidays. Thanks Mrs.M---M McGonigle

Batter very wet.  Added 2 large T to mixture.  Still too wet.  I had to litteraly spoon it out on the baking sheet. Not much flavor. Will try other recipes or just play w/this one to give flavor...maybe more nuts, the anise option like the recipe says or more vanilla.  This was my first time for biscotti, but bake frequently.  I was disappointed  in flavor & spreading of batter, will probably drizzle w/chocolate to give fancier look/taste for holiday.  ps. my husband thought they were wonderful!

This was my first time to try making biscotti and this recipe turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly but next time I think I will try using almond flavoring to compliment the almonds. I used vanilla this time. This recipe does not have a huge yield - about 20 pieces total. I would double it for a crowd.

This was my first time making biscotti and although they turned out moderately well it was certainly a learning experience. The recipe is good about specifying a 3" cooking width for the dough. Even a 2" width would be good as the dough really spreads out while cooking. I followed a suggestion by an earlier reviewer and toasted the almonds, which was delicious! (Thanks!) I also added a Tbsp of lemon peel and a teaspoon of lemon juice for extra flavour. Although the recipe specifies that you leave the biscotti in the oven to cool I think I won't let them cool for more than 10-15 mins in the oven next time. I suppose it depends on how crisp you like your biscotti. Overall a good recipe, though. Yay!

Well, I screwed up the first time I tried this because I had a brain lapse and accidentally doubled the butter. So um.... don't do that. Unless you want a spongy cake! It tasted pretty good, actually. I snacked on it as I tried the recipe again. The logs do spread quite a bit - mine were running into each other. You may want to use two baking sheets. Once cut, I baked them about twice the time that the recipe stated, turning them and baking four times instead of twice, because they didn't seem done. This may be because I sliced them too thickly. Eventually, they turned out crunchy and perfect. I brushed one cut edge with some bittersweet chocolate that I had melted with a bit of butter. Awesome! My bf ate five in one sitting, and I've had just as many over the course of the day. A double batch really is a good idea. :)

Makes great taste treat - I used almond extract.  The list of ingredients however, should state that the milk does NOT go in the mix - it is only to be brushed on.  That is what makes the dough so sticky.  If you do put it in, though - keep going.  Mine was fine!

My first attempt to make biscotti and it worked out well.  Texture is more crumbly and cookielike than purchased biscotti, so I will be trying other versions, but this one is fine.  Baked on greased aluminum foil (reused the foil several times) so easy cleanup.

Good as a basic biscotti but its a little sweet and could use more flavor.They turned out a lot like normal biscotti but could be a bit drier.

Totally scrumptious! I added egg-replacer and white rice flour instead of eggs and all-purpose flour, and it came out great! My mom asked me to Email her the recipe since she hasn't had a biscotti in years thanks to her wheat, egg and soy allergys. Thanks a ton! Defintely a keeper!

I made this recipe and the dough was way too sticky! I too had to add extra flour and then when I baked the cookies the first time they were totally sticky and raw in the centre. This made cutting them very difficult and they didn't look cleanly cut. I would also add almond extract (about 1 Tbsp) to add some more flavour to them. Overall they ended up okay but I just found I had to make too many corrections.

Great recipe!  I did alter to keep it on the healthier side: used whole wheat flour, sugar substitute, and egg whites.  I'm sure this tastes different than the original but I really like it.  I didn't need to add additional flour.

I make biscotti every year and was looking for a good, simple recipe. This recipe was not it! Although the taste was wonderful, this recipe leaves you with the most gooey, difficult dough I have ever had with a biscotti recipe! I followed the tips of a previous review and added another cup of flour, and it was still more like cookie dough then biscotti dough! The logs would not cook all the way through, even with an increased 10 minutes of initial cook time! And then when they were cut they mushed together and it was just messy. I will not use this recipe again!

One of the first I've made that has turned out as good as it sounded.  These cookies where the perfect flavor and weren't overly dry.  I'm looking forward to the opportunity to make these again!

This is the first Biscotti receipe that I have made....it is WONDERFUL....very easy to make.  I did not put the butter and sugar before I baked it though.  After the Biscotti cooled, I poured melted espresso chocolate and sparingly on top of the cooled Biscotti...YUM!

The flavor is great, but mine (made without any recipe modifications) spread out almost 10 inches wide and from one side of the cookie sheet to the other. I make a lot of biscotti so I know you usually don't want the dough too dry, but heed your baking experience with this recipe. If it really seems too wet, add a little more flour to stop it from turning into pancakes.

the flavor on these was pretty good, but they fell apart on me when cutting. i let them cool for the recommended amount of time, so maybe they needed to bake further? also, the loaf i shaped melted into a malformed lake so the sizes were uneven. even after dipping one end in chocolate and rolling them in almonds, they weren't attractive enough for their intended gift baskets, and ended up as snack food for the family. next time, i'll cook more the first bake, and lessen the secondary baking times.

Great recipe!  This was my first attempt at Biscotti & it turned out perfect!  Yes, the dough is sticky but I was able to manage to work with it.  Must be supposed to be that way cause they turned out great!  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious! This is the first time I have made biscotti and this recipe made it so easy. The dough wasn't as thick and sticky as the Chocolate Biscotti recipe. Will definately make again and again.

Following author's suggestion I made a double batch and am glad I did. I made them last week and they are gone already. The batter/dough was a lot softer than I thought it would be even though I added extra flour. This might be due to the fact I use freshly milled, soft white wheat whole grain flour. Next time I will add a bit more and see how it goes. Oh yes, I WILL be making these again. My two granddaughters loved them and have been taking them in their lunches since I made them. Tomorrow is time for a new batch. My husband's daughter loved them and she said she doesn't even like biscotti. The texture was perfect. My oven must be a bit slower because it took longer to bake and toast than the recipe stated. Of course, I don't make anything without changing the recipe a bit and this was no exception. I used vanilla and anise extracts and the whole grain flour.  The only reason I don't give this a five-star rating is because the dough was a bit difficult to work with.

These turned out great!!!  I thought I messed it up at first because the dough was very sticky.  I just used a spreader to get it to the size I needed and put it in the oven.  They turned out perfect.  I used almond extract and left out the almonds.  My husband loved them.  The flavorings in this recipe could be changed to whatever you like.

Well.. stupid mistake on my behalf I forgot to put in the baking powder.. the biscottis came out still good.. but now i'm wondering if that missing ingredient was a BIG deal.. :) Other than that.. great recipe!

This is my first experience baking biscotti and they are super easy to make. As other reviewer said I should left the first bake a little longer. Before the first bake I put sliced almond on top and also use almond extract. They look gourmet. For sure I'm going to make this again, maybe next time drizzle them with chocolate.

This biscotti rocked!! While I was making it, I was doubtful about the outcome. The batter was all gooey, even after I added more flour. So, I just baked it anyway and it turned out beautiful. I recommend putting dried cranberries in the dough, they taste awesome. ;)

I absolutely love to bake, but this was my first time baking biscotti. They were perfect and delicious! I used almond extract and I toasted the almonds before mixing. When they were all finished I dipped the bottoms in dark chocolate. I gave some as gifts at Christmas. My neighbor, who is from an Italian family, told me that these were even better than what her sister-in-law makes. That definitely made my day! I will certainly be making these again!

I thought these were pretty good. I left out the almonds because I didn't have any and I used almond extract instead of anise or vanilla. The dough was like a sugar cookie dough and kind of sticky, so I added another 1/4 cup of flour and put in fridge for a little bit. Then I worked with it on a floured surface to make the logs(so the dough wouldn't stick to my hands.) I had never made biscotti before and they turned out great! I drizzled some with melted chocolate. I think next time I might add some cinnamon to the dough. They were really easy and didn't really take that long to make. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making biscotti and they came out very doughy. I think one less egg would have been better. Flavor is okay but they are more like bleb-scottis.

My 13 year old son made these for me as a surprise.  I came home just as the loaves came out of the oven.  They were beautiful.  They cut and crisped up wonderfully.  He used vanilla cause that is what he found and they were absolutely wonderful.  I will add these to my menu of biscotti's that I sell during the holidays!  Thanks!

First time I've ever made biscotti. This was an easy recipe to follow plus the outcome was fantastic! I used almond flavor instead anise. It's a standard in the morning with my coffee.
