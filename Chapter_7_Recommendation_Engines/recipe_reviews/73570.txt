When first made these tacos according to recipe, they where just alright.  The second time I added chicken boullin (I use Knorrs, also called "Caldo de Pollo"), a small pinch of cumin, and a dash of garlic salt and they where AWESOME.  The green salsa recipe is fantastic just as directed.  I also cut the potatoes to 3 instead of 5.  The best tacos I have made, a keeper!

First and most importantly, make it with 2-3 potatoes. 5 is WAY too much. You end up with a potato filling with only a hint of meat. Secondly, use a food processer for making the sauce. A blender is too hard to use for this thick of a sauce.

These are great! Such a nice change from regular tacos. We love the potatoes in it and the green sauce really completes the dish. We aren't big fans of corn tortillas, but these just aren't as good with flour tortillas. Gotta do the corn tortillas! :) And I learned not to heat the corn tortillas in the microwave...they broke so easily and got a weird taste; will definitely heat on the stove from now on.

Tasted great, was quick and easy to make.  The sauce is wonderful.  We added some jalapeno slices from a jar for a little extra heat, but it was great without the tinkering.  Will add some extra tomatillos next time for the tartness.  Husband really loved it.

These were fantastic; I modified the recipe, however. I only used one large potato and a pound of meat.  5 potatoes would be WAY too much. Also added comino, salt, pepper and a little chili powder to the meat.

Used 6 raw tomatillos, 2 avocados, juice of 1 lime, salt, pepper and added light sour cream to the sauce.  It really needs the lime and sour cream, in my opinion. It was fantastic.  

Be sure to warm your corn tortillas in an iron skillet.

The sauce is indeed excellent, I added lime juice for a little extra zing.  Also like other review's I cut the potatoes down to two.

These were really good. As others suggested, I cut down on the potatoes; I only used one. The tomatillo guacomole is an outstanding combination with the homey potato/onion/hamburger filling. I was too cheap to buy 3 avocados; I only used one and the ratio with the other ingredients was great. I did not use a blender for the sauce, just finely chopped everything. Really good. Thank you!

My family loves to have dishes that have tomatillo sauce in them. However, this dish was very bland. I agree with another reviewer about the amount of potato was too much. I put in just 2 medium size and it was too much. It was more like having potato tacos, but without flavor. I have made breakfast tacos with tomatillo and potatoes that had better flavor. The recipe was that horrible, I just had high expectations for this recipe.

Too many potatoes. The green sauce was wonderful. I did add one more avocado, coursely chopped to add some "chunk". I agree with a previous reviewer who said this would be easier to do with a food processor, which I currently do not have...sadly.  I did add salt to the green sauce, to taste. I did put shredded cheese on the tacos as well. We really enjoyed these tacos.

Great recipe and my family loved it.  I don't have a blender, so I diced the ingredients for the sauce instead.  It was great.

My husband is from Guatemala. We added a roasted salsa to it as well. Although we also used minced garlic in the meat mixture. That really put it over the top. Also we used Guatemalen Table cream (found in your local latino markets) and WOW!! that really made it good! Oh, what I meant by roasted salsa is, you can on your grill or over a flat skillet roast your Jalepenos or serrano peppers (we prefer serrano) your onion, and roma tomtoes. till they are pliable, and your able to mash together. add salt and lime juice to taste. if you have a molcajete it is better. Which is just a bowl found at the store. it's made from stone, and has a stone grinder. it's perfect for salsas. or you can use a masher in a bowl. but, there is another seasoning you can add and that's Caldo de res. (beef boulion) to add to the meat. just a touch. not to much. and that will also put it over the top. Also, don't microwave your tortillas. You want "authentic" taste? warm them on your flat skillet or any flat iron surface that you would like make a pancake or something. Microwave tortillas are gross, and fall apart if warmed to long. and they don't stay warm as long. Plus it's got better flavor this way. totally authentic.

These tacos are absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make this again.  I used 3 tomatillos in the sauce and a poblano pepper instead of the jalapeño.  In the filling I substituted turkey meat for the ground beef and, taking the advice of previous reviewers, added only 3 potatos which I fried for several minutes before adding the meat.  I seasoned the meat with ½ cup of chopped fresh cilantro, onion,  salt and ground black pepper.  I felt that any more flavorful seasoning (such as American taco seasoning) would take the Central American flare out of the tacos!

Really good! All it promised-- quiet flavors of the meat and potatoes with the unique zing of the green sauce. Definitely not your same old tired Mexican flavors, will certainly make again.  Ate something similar at a Yucatan Restaurant- recipe for the person looking for unique flavor experience.

It's all good here!  I think part of the problem with the potatoes is that 'large' is a subjective term.  Also, I believe some people may differ on how much meat is necessary for a serving.  We were happy with a 1 to 1 ratio.  If you'd rather have more meat add what you like, but the cooked potatoes add a nice texture.  Heating the tortillas in a skillet is a must, but takes no time at all.

I followed the advice of others and used 2 potatoes and added cumin to the meat.  They were good, a nice change of pace.  The sauce really does make this recipe.  I give our dinner last night 4 stars but I give the leftover breakfast tacos I made this morning 5 stars.  Simply add some scrambled egg, picante and cheese to the leftover meat/potatoe mixture and you have the BEST breakfast tacos ever!  I am going to use the leftover tomatillo sauce on some blackened chicken.

The green sauce was awesome and I will use it again in other meals, however, the potato beef mixture was bland and tasteless, I tried adding some garlic and cilantro but nothing really good came of that.

Glad I read reviews before trying this recipe. I used 3 medium sized russett potatoes and that seemed like enough, even could have been better with 1 less potato. Definitely add some seasoning to the meat! I used a cajun seasoning and oregano. You should probably stir the seasoning on the potato as well when cooking. The guacamole was very good, I agree and my first time using tomatillos - lovely! I added lettuce, pico de gallo salsa, sour cream and cheese ...and it was wonderful! will make again (with the changes).

This was a nice change from our plain tacos. I did only use two large potatoes like other suggested and that was the right amount, not to many. I also added 1 Tbsp taco seasoning to the meat for extra flavor.

Our family thought these tacos were awesome!  I seasoned the taco meat with salt, pepper, garlic, and cumin.  When preparing, I heat the tortilla(s) one at a time in a cast iron skillet and place  grated cheese (I use mozeralla and pepper jack)and allow it to begin to melt.  I then add the taco meat and avocado sauce.  My wife likes corn tortillas and I perfer flour.  This recipe is a favorite at our house!

These were very good. I reduced potatoes a bit - but otherwise this was really tasty. Not the best I've had - but pretty darn good. I'd make it again :)

One word - Yummy!! I did, however, make some changes to the ground beef because my son and me like our food with a lot of flavor.  I made a "sofrito" of onions, garlic, and green peppers and I sauteed that a bit before I put in the ground beef.  Then, I added some latin spices (cumin, oregano, garlic powder, etc.) to the ground beef, a bottle of beer, and half a can of tomato sauce and let that cook down.  Also, I only used three potatoes fried rather than boiled them.  It was more than enough.  I made the tomatillo sauce exactly as stated except that I used chili powder instead of jalapenos.  All in all it was a delicious dish!  Thanks for sharing!

Being hispanic, we were a little hesitant because we have tasted many variations of "tacos"......HOWEVER, we thought these were suprisingly delicious!!  I did add cumin and "caldo de pollo" to the meat and boy did my family enjoy these "TACOS"!!!  YUMMY..

My husband loved this recipe! It's a nice change from the traditional mexican tacos that I make. The only thing I changed is added cumin to the meat and only added 2 potatoes. The sauce was excellent and reminded me of guacamole.A+

I personally didn't like these. I come from a Guatemalan family and the tacos we make aren't like these at all. (the guatemalan tacos I've always had were rolled fried tacos with a red tomato sauce not green on top.)The only thing i found in common with we're the fact that potatoes were used for the tacos.

I did not care for the meat mixture at all... I can appreciate simple flavors but this was way too bland.  I think 5 large potatoes would have been way too many, I used 1 and thought that ratio was good.  I added a lot of seasoning to try to salvage it, but no luck.  The salsa/guacamole was good and that is the only reason I can give it three stars.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, but it just wasn't for me.

Added adobe seasoning to the potato mixture.  I also added a little sriracha sauce to the potato mixture as well as the green sauce since I didnt have any jalepenos.  Like others, I added lime juice.  Next time, I will add only two potatoes -too much of that ingredient.  Otherwise, very good.

My daughter and I made these for dinner. The salsa was our favorite part. Next time I will brown the potatoes before adding them to the meat, they didn't have a lot of flavor and sort of ended up mashing. I may also add garlic, salt and pepper to the mixture. I highly recommend trying this recipe. As I stated before the salsa was so good I ate it with toritlla chips the next day.

Yum! This is very good. I forgot to put the avocados in with the rest of the sauce, and thinking that it wasn't enough, I added two tomatillos and another jalapeno. It tasted great so if you want to save yourself some fat calories, go for it! The meat does taste a little bland so with the next go round, I will try using a quarter of the sauce to cook it in (the sauce is very fresh tasting and unique and I don't want to add cumin or other flavors as it would change it). Anyway, this is a great recipe!

The meat needs some seasoning (garlic, cumin, Chipotle powder etc) but the avocado sauce is absolutely phenomenal! (and it's even better with a generous splash of lime juice.) This is definitely going to be a favorite at my house. Thanks!

It is a nice change from traditonal taco meat.  It would also be yummy served like hash with some eggs.

I liked this recipe.  If you are looking for spice, this isn't it.  I had lots of avocado sause left and it didn't turn brown after a few days in the refrigerator.  I did use my food chopper as the blender didn't work for me. I added some lime juice to sause.

Watch the tomatillos, it can be overwhelming. I'm used to Avocado salsas, on the spicy side, but the tangy flavor using 4 good size tomatillos was overpowering. So, I added chopped onion, another jalapeno and jalapeno juice (from a jar), more cilantro, and blended it again. I cross my fingers on this one, and my husband liked it! The onion is good in the sauce. I cooked 2 lbs hamburger, 1 whole onion, 4 small potatoes, and seasoned well with cumin,
garlic, black pepper and some chile powder.  My men liked the meat for something different. Just know that you have to season up the meat and adjust the sauce to your palate. I'll use less tomatillos next time.

i took the advice of others and used less potatoes (only two, which made at least big tacos) and replaced the ground beef with morningstar veggie crumblers. added cumin and paprika (should've done garlic too!) to the meat/potato mix, little bland but good.

made the salsa according to recipe. the tomatillos were a little bit overpowering to me. and it made a TON of salsa. way too much for two people. i think i'll scale back on the tomatillos a lot and the avocado a little. 

good recipe though!

Well, I thought it was a 4 but my husband and son didn't like it much at all so 3 it is. Keep in mind that this is different and that will not appeal to everyone. My husband thought the beef was bland and that the dish  needed cheese. Basically, he wanted Tex/Mex, which I was specifically trying to get away from. I thought just using salt and pepper was fine for the beef, that the sauce added all the flavor the dish needed, and that the potatoes were a great touch. The only thing I would change is to use wheat tortillas. I just like them better. I know they aren't as authentic. Of course, I won't be making these again for my family so that's kind of a moot point. :=(

I have made this recipe several times. I think it is supposed to be a bit "bland."  My husband says it reminds him of the street vendor food in the Dominican Republic where he lived for a short time. They often incorporated ground meat and potatoes into their fare. The only reason I gave it a four star rating is because it is a rather time intensive recipe. I do add less potatoes than called for and watch them carefully so that they aren't over done.  I tend to season my meat generously anyway, so that wasn't a problem.  My kids liked this too...but the tomatillo sauce was a bit much for their palates so they didn't have it with theirs.

First off, the tomatillo sauce is pretty good.  But I felt that the rest of the mixture was really bland.  I had to add alot of salt (and I am not a salt girl), just to get any flavor.  I did follow some of the other suggestions, especially using only 2 potatoes.  Still, I probably won't make this again.  But my husband thought it was ok, but he likes REALLY bland food.

Wonderful recipe.  I kept the ratio of potato to meat the same since I prefer less meat.  The green sauce was wonderful with the taco, in particular paired with the corn tortilla. Only thing I added was a little cumin to the meat and potato. Will make this dish again, my family LOVED it.

These tacos were a great alternative to regular mexican tacos.  The tomatillo sauce MADE the tacos.  Although, I didn't have any cilantro :( The only thing I didn't do acording to the recipe was process the avocado in the blender. I processed the other ingredients, then added the avocado & mashed. I also added lime juice. THANKS for the recipe.

These were pretty tasty!  Per other reviews, I only used 3 small-ish potatoes and that was plenty!  I also only used 2 avocados, not 3.  But other than that it was good--and very different!

There is a fine line between "subtle flavor" and "bland."  These fall under the latter category, even with only two potatoes.

Thought it was okay, different at least.  These are much like the Taco's we got in Mexican Restraunts in El Paso, TX.  The green sauce added the flavor.  I put a little sour cream because the flavor was very strong.

I browned my potatoes after they were cooked with a little chili powder and cumin and also added the same to my meat. Very good will make again with changes. Loved the green sauce.

Okay. Added a bit more spice. Actually, I grew up in El Paso, TX and the Woolworths on the ground floor of the building I worked in (circa 1964) made these, only they rolled the meat up in a flour tortilla and called it a burrito. That's what I did, and as I said, I added more seasoning to the meat mixture and also green chiles, and no sauce whatsoever.

Sort of plain, but a simple enough recipe that I will probably make it again, with a little tweaking. I agree with previous posters, five potatoes is WAY too much.

Incredible food! As previously described by other reviews it is subtle, unique, and the sauce is fantastic with the garlic, warmth of the jalapeno, fresh cilantro, and avocado/tomatillo combo, all melded in a warm soft corn tortillo. Doesn't get any better.  Definitely one of our favorites. PS, thanks to the reviewer  for the cumin tip, it did add smokey taste to the filling.  Great recipe!

Horrible disapointment.  Taco meat was ok, but only AFTER I added my own spices.  Green sauce was inedible.  Highly advise buying a pre-made tomatillo sauce from any respectable Mexican restauraunt. Perhaps my tomatillos were bad, but Target usually has great produce, so I doubt it.

Nice and not-too-spicey.
I love the tomitillo salsa!

I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews, as written there were way to many potatos, could have used more spice, and the sauce was just like guacamole. I seriously doubt I'll make this again, there are beeter reicpes out there.

The avocado sauce was great, but the recipe called for too many potatoes.

I boiled the potatoes a little too long so it turned out more like mashed potatoes with meat mixed in, but still good! Did not serve as tacos since there is enough starch in the potatoes. Sauce is definitely a keeper!

taco mixture was okay but the sauce had zero flavor.  My husband said the same thing. Will not make again.
