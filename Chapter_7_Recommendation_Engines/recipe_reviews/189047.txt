To fix the "runniness" that some people are having, I'd suggest an Indian technique that usually works well. It's called Bhoona and is essentially a dry-frying technique. It takes a little more consistent attention because you put, say, half the water in at first, and let it cook until the water is nearly boiled away. Then you add another couple ounces of water and cook it down again, and stop adding water when the potatoes are done.   I haven't tried this dish yet, but given the comments about the runniness, I intend to make that one little modification in the cooking process when I make it tomorrow. I'll let you know how it turns out.

I love this dish. I have made this at least 5 times in the past 2 months. I recently made this for some friends and they now all keep asking me to make it again. You have to like Trini food to really appreciate this dish. as for blandness, I personally season food to my liking this way I don't end up with a bland meal. No one knows my taste buds like I do.

I really liked this recipe and can see that with all great curries you can play with it at much as possible to make infinite variations. I wanted a little less broth and a little more curry so at the end I cooked off some broth and added about another 1/2 Tablespoon of curry powder. Thanks Pixie for a wonderful recipe - next time perhaps I'll make some naan to go with it!

I had high hopes for this dish. I was disappointed. It was too watery in the end and lacked flavor. My boyfriend took a bite and said it was so bland. I even added extra curry. I ended up taking the potatoes out and mashing them, which salvaged them. We ate the shrimp seperately. Sorry but this was not good for me. I would suggest cutting down on the amount of water you add after the potatoes if you do make this. Instead of water maybe some broth should be used to give flavor.

This was pretty good; I used double the amount of potatoes and about 2/3 the amount of spices which I thought was plenty - I think adding the full amount would really overwhelm the other flavours. Overall, this tasted nice and had a good kick to it, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

I omitted the potatoes on served rice on the side instead. Very good way to use up celery and carrots!  Make sure you have a lot of tie to spend on mincing everything up though.
