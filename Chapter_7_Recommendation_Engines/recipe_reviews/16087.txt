This was delicious!!!! but... I made some changes. I doubled the chocolate chips and left out the butterscotch chips. I left out the peanuts and used 1 cup raisins and 1 cup dried cranberries. I have made this with thin pretzel sticks instead of chow mien noodles. (For passover - I made this with matzo farfelle). I made two logs and once they set (30 minutes in the freezer) I cut them into biscotti-like slices. Amazing!!!! My family loves to eat these straight from the freezer!

This recipe was outstanding.  It was easy to pop the chips in the microwave too.  When I first tried them I thought they were good, but then after each one, they seemed to get better and better...very addictive!

I had quite a bit of leftover melted milk chocolate from dipping cookies and found this great way to use it up and make another treat for my holiday gift trays. I didn't have chow mein noodles or butterscotch chips. I made individual drop cookies but I think making a log or flat tray full then cutting it into portions would be just as easy and give more uniform sizes to all the cookies. My chocolate was a little too warm though and some of the marshmallows started to melt just barely so the chocolate needs to be as cool as possible while still being melty enough to work with. Great little easy recipe, thanks for posting it.

these were good although i did make some alterations, partly from neccesity and partly from from desire. i replaced the raisin because i was out when i went to make them and i used cherries, i used cashews in place peanuts because i like them better, and i used potatoe stix in place of the chow mein noodles as i find the chow mein noodle a little too hard. these were a gr8 break room treat. i did as another suggested and made logs, put them in the freezer wrapped in foil for 45 min. then used an electric knife to make biscotti style slices. they were a hit at coffee time!! will make the next time with white chocolate!!!

This was AWFUL. I did everything just like stated in recipe and had to throw it in the trash. It wouldn't even get firm, was just all mushy and wouldn't come off the wax paper. I bake all the time and just about everything turns out for me. This was just a waste of time and money.

AWESOME!  I left out the rasins but added extra peanuts and marshmallows.  It helps to break the noodles into smaller pieces before you start mixing ingredients.  These are a huge hit at my house and they are the perfect mix of sweet and salty.  Thanks a million :)

Cook friendly and very GOOD. The butterscotch gets lost in the chocolate, and I intend to try just a butterscotch version to compare the difference.  My son,and the guys at my husbands dealership just went crazy.

This was a excellent recipe!!!  These were huge hits with my friends, family, and neighbors.  I'm not a big fan of raisins so i omited them, and I melted chocolate in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Easy and wonderful thanks so much.

A classic.  Very easy and a great (albeit messy!) activity for the kids.  I too omit the raisins and just add a little more of everything else.  Even better when the marshmallows get a little stale. (if they last that long!!)

I changed up a couple ingredients...I added coconut and I added 2 cups of trail mix instead of just peanuts.  And instead of butterscotch chips...I added a couple scoops of peanut butter.....see how the family likes them!!

I eliminated the raisins, we don't care for them, and melted the chips for 3 min. in the microwave. I used an assortment of roughly chopped nuts (cashew, pecans, almonds) to use up what I had in my pantry.  Mixed together in a big bowl and spread on a cookie sheet and put in the fridge to cool.  My mom used to make something like this, minus marshmallows & raisins , and we called them Chinese Chews.

This was a big hit!  I did alter the recipe a little bit though.  I used 24 oz of milk chocolate chips, 3 cups of peanuts, 2 cups of marshmallows, and 5 cups of chow mein noodles.  I omitted the raisins and butterscotch chips.  I thought the chocolate coverage was a little light with my modifications, but my friends really enjoyed it. Great recipe and easy to modify to your tastes, even for a cook like myself with moderate experience!  :)
