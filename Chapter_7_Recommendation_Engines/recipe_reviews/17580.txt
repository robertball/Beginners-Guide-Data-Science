This is the best sugar free frosting I have ever tasted.  I did change it a little.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and cut the milk back to 1 1/2c.  I have used both vanilla and cheesecake flavored pudding mixes and the vanilla is the best in my opinion. GREAT ON CARROT CAKE!!!

This frosting is surprisingly great! I followed the previous suggestion and used the big box of pudding (2.1 oz, I think) and reduced the milk to one cup. This made for a good, thick frosting. It was almost gummy, which helped it stick really well and not melt, but it still tasted great (not sticky)!

I have several diabetics in my family and I am always trying to create a delicious dessert for them. I have created many wonderful recipes and I don't use artificial sweeteners so they taste great but they don't always look very decadent. I made some sugar free cinnamon buns adapting one of the recipes from this website and topped it with this icing which was infact quite good. It made these cinnamon buns look just like the originals, and for once they had a sinful looking sugar free dessert. Thank you.

I have made this recipe several times, use large box of pudding, adjust the milk a little at a time to get the consistency you need for frosting. The frosting stayed on the cake, no problem, use less milk so it's thicker. Just love this. It is like chocolate mousse. Will try other sugar-free flavors in the future.

I'm giving this one just four stars because of the way it melted and puddled around the cake when it was out of the fridge for ten minutes. I had made a birthday cake and decorated the top and sides. The resulting meltdown of the frosting ruined the appearance of the whole cake. On the other hand, the frosting was easy to make and had a great flavor....just make sure you keep it really cold.

Update 9-29-11.  Used only 1.5 cups milk and vanilla sf pudding on a chocolate sf cake.  Creamy frosting did NOT slip off cake..you need to reduce milk, but be careful blending the pudding into the cream cheese because it can get lumpy so incorporate pudding slowly and blend well.  2003 review:  I used banana sugar-free pudding and put it on a 
sweet-n-low boxed chocolate cake mix.  I also added nuts, raisins, and two teaspoons of cocoa to the cake mix. We all liked it.

I was excited to find a sugar free frosting recipe for carrott cake.  I tweeted the recipe just a little. I used 1 stick of softened butter, 1 - 8oz. room temp cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 - 1.4 oz of instant vanilla pudding, completely omitting the whipped topping. Next time I may increase the cream cheese to 12 oz.  I like the buttery taste and would like more of the cream cheese flavor

This was quick and easy to make.  Most people probably have all the ingredients in their kitchen already.  You can use any kind of pudding you want (I used chocolate).  It complimented the cake recipe I used perfectly!

This is a delicious REDUCED SUGAR frosting recipe, but it is most definitely NOT sugar-free. It is much cheaper & better to use homemade whipped cream sweetened with Splenda, Stevia, or the sugar substitute of your choice instead of the non-dairy whipped topping.  That will all but eliminate the sugar from this recipe & lower the carb count.  You can also substitute soy or almond milk to reduce the amount of lactose (another form of sugar) in the recipe.

This may be tasty, but it is not sugar free.  Lite Whipped topping contains corn syrup and other sugars.  The pudding mix is sweetened with aspartame.

Very good frosting! Even my husband the diabetic sugar addict loved it! I used the big box of Sugar-Free Vanilla Pudding, 1 C milk, reduced fat cream cheese and sugar free whip topping.

My son-in-law is always doing his low carb diet thing, so in place of whipped topping, I whipped up 1 cup of heavy cream with 2 packets of Splenda and a dash of vanilla. Also cut back the milk to 1-1/2 cups so that it would hold its shape better. It was FABULOUS!! Perfect, light, silky and ethereal frosting. Put it on a black bean chocolate cake and my SIL was ecstatic!! Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting that actually works on a low carb diet (Note that it's not NO carb, but pretty darned low for a diet treat.) He wants my daughter to make it all the time for him now. Although it's not low calorie this way, it's  perfect for diabetics as well as low carb dieters.

It's so good some people like to eat it with a spoon... no cake needed :)

I omitted 1/4 cup milk using only 1 1/2 as one reviewer suggested.  My finished product with a 1.5 ounce sf ff jello pudding was easy to spread.  I put it in the fridge right away so the icing could firm up a little bit.  It made quite a bit more icing than I needed for 9" layers.  I threw the leftovers in the trash.  All in all it was quite nice tasting for a low sugar icing.  I could taste the cream cheese (I used 1/3 less fat type).  Using vanilla, which I did, I can certainly see it being good for a carrot cake.  I put mine on a sugar free Devils Food Cake.

When I made this I was trying to do it by memory and forgot to use milk and it turned out great. I used a sugar free cake mix and I used the Chocolate fudge sugar free jello pudding and the sugar free Cool whip so it was certainly sugar free. I added about 2 tablespoons of sour cream and about 2 tablespoons of splenda. I had many requests for the recipe. The consistancy was thick and creamy and would be a great consistancy for piping. With all of the flavor choices of sugar free pudding now the flavor combinations are endless. FYI Pillsbury now makes a sugar free cake mix in yellow and chocolate however the sugar free frosting in a can is discusting (but I dont like can frosting).

I give this four stars only because amazingly enough it was too sweet! I don't know how that's possible, considering it's sugar free, and I am NOT a picky person when it comes to sweets. I tried to make this as a filling for a pumpkin roll mainly because the original recipe called for 1 cup powdered sugar which sickened me calorie-wise. Well, I made this with only one cup skim milk, the big box of vanilla pudding, fat-free creamcheese, and fat-free whipped cream, and it had a very good consistency. (by the way, don't try to fold the whip cream, you have to use the electric mixer) i would recommend this as a frosting, but not for a filling in a cake or roll. If you want to use this recipe as a filling, cut the whip cream in half or so. This tasted good, but was kind of  overwhelming, however I'm sure young kids will love this and I will definitely make this again.
Also, if you use the fat-free versions of everything, its a very low-calorie treat!

I make this but with 1 block fat free cream cheese, 1-8 ounce tub whipped topping, and 1 TB sugar replacement (like splenda).  I beat it with the mixer, and frost away!!  This has a much more solid consistency and also can be left out for longer (but do make sure you refrigerate).

I made the large box of sugarfree instant chocolate pudding the day before and kept it in the fridge.. made it with 2 cups of milk. Very thick and creamy then on the day of the party I mixed it with 8 oz thawed coolwhip regular flavor and 8 oz regular cream cheese at room temp. This was for a birthday cake and I wanted it to taste as normal as possible without that terrible twang so many sugarless frostings have. I previously tried the sugarless chocolate can frosting ( horrible) and ended up cutting off the top of the cake and finding this recipe and refrosting the cake. I am Very happy with this recipe.

My husband and I are both diabetics. I am always looking for good recipes that will give us the taste of being sinfully delicious without the sugar!!  This frosting recipe is great!  I followed someones advice on here and decreased the milk to 1 cup and used a large box of sugar free pudding.  Also added the whipped topping in with a mixer instead of just folding it in.  I happened to use the cream cheese pudding and it turned out great!  Thanks to Chelsey for posting this recipe.  Gives us diabetics something to have as a treat without all the unwanted sugar!

Wow, what a great sugar-free frosting! (Especially after you've tried that nasty stuff in the can!) I used a large box of choc. pudding mix and 1 1/3 C milk. It didn't hold a swirl as much as I would've liked, so I think I'll use 1 1/2 C milk next time. But the taste is fantastic and it's so easy to make! I had leftovers, so I'm debating serving it as a mousse, or maybe freezing it to make sugar-free fudge pops. yum yum! Awesome recipe!

Following the reviewers' advice, I put less milk and used big box of vanilla flavoured pudding mix. I got the consistency I wanted to be able to pipe them. It tasted wonderful and my family, who actually hates sugar-packed frosting, loved it. I will experiment with different flavours next time.

I tried to make this frosting for a friends baby shower, I followed the suggestions and used less milk and the large pudding mix but it would never thicken up. Maybe I did something wrong but I gave up after a few hours of trying to make it work.

Yum! I used chocolate pudding (added some additional cocoa powder, vanilla & rum extracts) for the frosting on a yellow sugar free cake. It keeps best in the fridge; we had no problem with the frosting running off. Great texture & taste!

LOVED this recipe! I was getting really disgusted with all of the store-bought frostings I would buy in the store. After a while, I felt they were extremely too sweet for me plus I want to watch my sugar since Diabetes runs in my family.

Anyway, I tried this recipe with sugar-free chocolate pudding mix and the rest of the ingredients. Used regular cream cheese since the lowfat one wasn't on sale.

The recipe was really easy but I used a handmixer and my bowl wasn't very deep so it was messy and my pudding was too lumpy.. so, unfortunately my whole "frosting" was lumpy but since I used chocolate, I felt it tasted a lot like chocolate mousse. 

I'm definitely making this again with different pudding flavors. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is great! I made completely sugar free cupcakes and no one even knew the difference! The frosting would be a good pie filling.

I didn't care for this at all...I had to add a LOT of extra pudding mix to get it firm enough to pipe, then it was sticky. I made this to "tag team" with a friend who made sugar-free cupcakes, even though this ISN'T sugar-free when you use the cool-whip. No one who ate it complained though, so some may love it. I don't expect to make it again.

I was looking for a sugar-free frosting for my Uncle that's a diabetic. I made a sugar-free jello poke cake that calls for cool whip on top, but that sounded kinda boring so I used this frosting on it.  My uncle loved it.  I also made a regular version of the cake for the rest of the family and decided to use this frosting on that cake also...everyone loved it and nobody knew it was sugar-free!!  I'm huge on sweets and I can't wait to have another piece of the cake so I can lick the frosting off the fork.  Thanks for the recipe Chelsey!!!

I used the cream cheese flavored jello and this tasted like a marshmellow cream. It was great for my diabetic friends baby shower. I spread it over reduced sugar cupcakes in the shape of a diaper and decorated it as normal. It was a little thicker then most frostings, but worked better then I thought it would. It also held up when the cupcakes were out waiting to be eaten. Everyone loved it.

This frosting was really yummy, but needed a few tweaks.  I tried making it according to the recipe but it came out WAY too wet for my cupcakes - it would never stand up to a layer cake.  I ended up doubling the pudding as suggested but it was still a little thinner than I would have liked.  Next time I'll halve the whipped cream and it should be perfect.

I made this for my husband who is diabetic yesterday. It was very yummy, so much so that I enjoyed a piece myself. It was the first time my husband has been able to lick the bowl in years! I tweeked it a little & it was totally SF. I used sf chocolate cake mix. For the frosting I used one box of SF vanilla instant pudding mix (small box), 1 1/4 cups of whole milk,  regular cream cheese, & SF cool whip. This frosted the tops of TWO 9x13 cakes sufficiently. I had no problem with frosting consistency, I did not use a mixer. I also was making one for our club, they LOVED it. This will be the only SF frosting I will make in the future.

This frosting is really tasty, and you can use any flavor of jell-o which makes it fun to experiment with. The consistency is not great, though. It's a bit runny and drips off the cake if you don't refrigerate right after you frost it. I would definitely use it as a filling between layers of a cake again though. It adds a lot of yummy flavor. I would definitely use something else to frost the outside though.

Made this for several diabetics in our family and it is always a hit.  Instead of using a sugar free whipped topping,  I use unsweetened whipping cream and fold in the remaining ingredients.

I used French Vanilla sf/ff pudding and used the 1/3 fat reduced cream cheese.  Turned out very nicely on the Black Magic Cake.  Thanks for the soft, sweet frosting recipe!

I doubled the amount of pudding as others suggested.  It was difficult to get a smooth frosting. It was just a bit lumpy, but the firmness was good.  The taste was not sweet at all (to me) but sometimes that can be a good thing, especially on a sweet cake.  My mom is diabetic and this frosting was great for the low-sugar cake that I made.  Everyone enjoyed the frosting, but I think that it would be better with some Splenda added.  I gave it 3 stars because I think it needs the extra box of pudding.

The consistancy was like Chocolate Mousse, but we liked it ok.  I used chocolate pudding, skim milk, reduced fat cream cheese, and lite whipped topping. Next time,  I'll take other people's advice and adjust it for a thicker result.  I may even make it again the same way for a sugar-free Chocolate Mousse substitute!

Very Yummy! I used Fat Free Cool Whip, Fat Free Cream Cheese, and 1 3.4 oz box chocolate pudding mix. And topped it on 1 weight watchers cake made from 1 box chocolate cake mix made with 1 can diet 7up and 2 egg whites. Got great compliments on the cake, it was delicious!

This recipe is delicious, but far from sugar-free.  Cream cheese = 7g, milk = 11g (per cup), lite whipped topping = 25g.  That's 43g of sugar.  It's also got 124g of carbs.  I used about 2/3 of the recipe to ice a low carb cake, so I figure that's about 30g of sugar.  You can save carbs and sugar by using light cream cheese and almond milk.

I didn't find that this frosting had much flavour at all which I suppose could be the type of pudding I used, but regardless when I started to pipe it on my cupcakes it started to melt into a big globby mess. I literally had to scrape it all off of the ones I had done and made traditional icing instead. 
If you are just icing a cake and you HAVE to have sugar free it's worth trying, but I definitely will not be using it again.

I loved this recipie!!!! My husband is a diebetic and I love dessert, so it's hard to make stuff and have it around if he is going to eat it and get sick.. this frosting is great on pumpking bars!! only thing I did different is cut the milk back to 1 cup and I used Sugarfree/Fat Free Cheesecake Pudding mix!! tasted just like cream cheese frosting, just a lighter feel. and no guilt when eating it. Thanks for posting!!!!

Although this "frosting" had good flavor, it just slid right off of the cake. It was way too runny.

Was really good on carrot cake!  Used Lg van pudding & 1 C. sk.milk. Have been using similar version of this for nearly 20 years. (minus cr. cheese & only couple Tbs milk (type), just mix together. Never tried on layer cake always 9X13, have left unrefrigerated for several hours & never had melting  problems. The cr. cheese is a nice touch.

I made this even more healthy by using 1% milk and fat-free cream cheese.  It is very light and fluffy, almost like a mousse.  I made it with chocolate pudding mix for my teenage daughter's birthday cake and she loved it, as did the rest of the family!

I doubled everything except the milk and accidentally just mixed it all up at once instead of in the recommended order, but it turned out fantastic. Best  icing I have ever tasted, and it stuck to the cake perfectly. SO YUMMY. I also cheated and used pineapple flavored cream cheese, and it was soooo dreamy and tropical tasting! YUM! I now make this for every single birthday in the family.

Tried this yesterday but I used ONE cup of coconut almond milk in the pudding so it was very thick. (Making instant pudding with almond milk tends not to set so I backed off on the amount to start.) After blending it with the cream cheese though it was very, very thick so I added a half cup more of almond milk before folding in the Cool Whip.  I used sugar free Cool Whip, not lite/fat free and Neufchâtel cream cheese.  I mixed a sugar free chocolate cake mix with 12 oz. of Diet Coke and baked as normal. DELICIOUS CUPCAKES! One note, this frosting is very much like whipped topping so it isn't a stiff frosting and must be kept regrigerated.  So that the cupcakes didn't dry out, I placed them in a sealed Rubbermaid bin and put the frosting in a piping bag in the fridge. Whenever we wanted a cupcake we just quickly piped a little icing on just before eating.

I wished I had read the reviews before I made it. It tastes really good but was really soft. I should have done the larger box of pudding and cut down the milk

I originally wanted to try this recipe because my uncle is a diabetic. Today I made a pumpkin cupcake with this frosting for a bday party and the kids loved it! I did make minor changes to keep the frosting consistency a little thicker and less fat. I used 8oz. Philadelphia Soft Cream Cheese 1/3 fat, 2% milk, Jello's sugar free vanilla pudding, and only 4 tbsp of canned whipped cream instead (Cool Whip has high fructose corn syrup so I didn't use that). It turned out surprisingly creamy without tasting cream cheesy at all and not at all salty but more sweet probably because I used the vanilla flavored pudding. It's IMPORTANT to CHILL the frosting after making it for at least 15-20 mins. so it BECOMES THICKER and LESS RUNNY. Using my ingredients per serving is 53 calories, 2.8 fat,

I made this frosting today. I used the big box of sugar-free vanilla pudding and 1 3/4 cups of milk. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. It was thick and will go great on a cake! (especially red velvet. Yuuuuuuum!

Five stars for flavor; four stars because it's a little runny and hard to work with.  I let the milk & pudding sit for about 5 minutes while I beat the cream cheese.  I could have let the pudding thicken longer, but the recipe doesn't really say how long or how thick.  With careful persistence, I did get the cake frosted.  Then I put it into the refrigerator hoping the frosting would firm up a bit - which luckily it did.

I also followed the advice of some members on here and used the 2.1 oz box of sugar free pudding and used about 1 and 1/4 cup of light vanilla soy milk.  It turned out great!  I am using this to ice some "diet coke cupcakes" for my dad's birthday who is a diabetic, but I'll keep some at our house because they are so tasty!

This recipe is off you have to mix 2 cups of milk to make pudding that is on the directions of the pudding box.  It's not sweet.  Bottom line frosting has to be the real thing or don't make it at all.  But I have to say the pudding itself tastes good alone.

Light and creamy and delicious.  Everyone liked it. I used unsweetened soy milk instead of milk and it worked. I used chocolate pudding. The lite whipped topping I purchased did have a small amount of sugar in it.  It was the local store brand (Albertson's).

YUMMM! Made this for diabetic person and while it's different than your typical frosting (exactly what you imagine pudding & whipped cream being like), it's delicious. I made homemade whip cream because I feared the store-bought combined with the pudding would make it too sweet. I used about 1/8 c. splenda in my whipped cream and it was great!

What a great recipe, thanks for posting it!  My husband and I are both diabetics.  He thought his days of frosted cakes was over.  I made a diabetic carrot cake today and used this icing. It was sooooo good.  I did use less milk after reading the other reviews on here, about 3/4 a cup.

i cant have straight up milk so i attempted to use soy and it was like soup after it was all over. theres no way i could use this for frosting, ever.  it did, however, taste yummy and i dipped chocolate graham crackers in it. so i'll give it 4 stars despite the soupy mess i have left.

This was so YUMMY !!  A nice light frosting.  I used chocolate pudding and also let the cream cheese soften on the counter for about 30 minutes first (to make it easier to work with).  This has become a favorite.  I’ve even noticed my husband swiping a finger full with every “walk-by”.  Thank you for this recipe !

Good tasting recipe, but not totally sugar free.  The only frozen "lite" whipped topping I can find does have corn syrup which adds sugar.

Yes I made this frosting but did make adjustments. I used less milk than it calls for and I hardly used any of the cool whip or whipped topping. I wish I hdnt used any of the cool whip. It wud have been not only delicious but wdnt have just melted kinda off cake if it became room temperature.  Other than that this is the best sugar free frosting iv ever tasted. I will definitely make over as many times as I bake a sugar free cake in future!

The only change I made to the recipe was to use fat free milk. It was a hit at a party we attended. I made a carrot cake recipe made with granulated monk fruit and used this whipped cream cheese cake topping for it. Many of our friends are diabetic as are we and everyone loved the dessert. Everyone, even the friends without diabetes.

I don't usually write negative reviews.  But I also need to warn anyone who looks at this recipe it is in NO WAY sugar free.  Just because you don't add sugar doesn't mean it's not in your ingredients.  Any whipped topping has a tremendous amount of sugar as well as cream cheese.  It is wrong to mislead people with this statment.

I used large box chocolate sugar free pudding 2.1 oz., 1 cup milk,  8 oz cream cheese, small heavy whipping cream w/ 4 tsp. splenda. It tastes good, waiting for Pillsbury Sugar Free Brownies to cool so I can ice it. 

For the brownies I added 2/3 cup oil and 2 eggs (fixed many times and works for me). I add 3/4 cup pecans to brownie mix and 1/4+ cup pecans to top before baking them.

Excellent!!   I used on 4 layer carrot cake and it was a little thin or soft for that.  like the reviews said use less milk or the bigger box.  I am going to try it with chocolate  pudding soon.

I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out very thin. Not runny, but thin. The taste was more like pudding. I wish I had read the reviews and used less milk. I had so much left over after icing my one layer cake that I put the remainder in a dish and put crushed graham crackers on top for another dessert.

I used a 40gm box of vanilla sugar free instant pudding mix. 1 cup of milk, 1/3 cup of butter and 1/2 pkg of cream cheese. Didn't use the Cool Whip at all and it was great!

I thought this was just "ok" but I'm not accustomed to eating reduced-sugar food. As others suggested, I reduced the milk to 1 cup and opted for the large box of pudding (vanilla.) I used this to frost red velvet cupcakes (made with Swerve sugar substitute) and wish I would have used twice the cream cheese as this just tasted like vanilla cream filling to me. 

This recipe is NOT sugar-free as written; the light cool whip contains either corn syrup or sugar. I think you can find sugar-free whipped topping (or make your own) and if I truly needed a sugarless option this is what I would do.

Best sugar-free frosting I have ever had. Bar none. It's fluffy, smooth and creamy. I made the recipe as written. I used sugar-free chocolate pudding and topped the frosting onto a sugar-free chocolate cake. My husband, who hates sugar-free anything, loved it. This will be my standard frosting from here on out.

tastes great but did need alterations to work for a layered cake. i did a four layer checkerboard cake and needed two batches of icing for the whole thing. for the crumb layer and icing between each layer i did the recipe as it stated. it does tend to droop as it sits so i stuck it in the freezer and reformed the icing as it solidified. for the outer finished layer i only used 1-1/4cup milk and left out the whipped cream completely. that layer stay in place perfectly.

My daughter was just recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic. This icing cut the carb and sugar count considerably. I used almond milk in place of cow milk to lower carb count even more. I did as many suggested and added an extra box of pudding. This is necessary to make sure it thickened enough. Substituted the coolwhip with sugar free.

I made this as required by the recipe and it was not quite sweet enough for me (not for cake frosting!). However, I made it using 1 cup of non-fat Greek yogurt in place of milk and Walmart brand Fat Free cream cheese (which is softer than most cream cheese) and it made an excellent mousse-type concoction. The best part was that the entire recipe--which was about 4 cups) was about 900 calories, 130 Carbs, and no fat. So a 1 cup serving would only be a little over 200 calories--and that is a pretty large serving of this stuff. 

I may not recommend it as cake frosting, but I definitely recommend it as a dessert standing on it's own. It would probably be fantastic with some berries or mini chocolate chips mixed in.

Super easy and so yummy.  I don't like frosting at all and I love this recipe.  Even my kids like it.  I made it with fat free and sugar free pudding, fat free cream cheese, and sugar free cool whip.  I'm impressed. It's so fluffy and light.

I made this & it is absolutely AMAZING!! It doesn't even taste like it's sugar free, Next time I will  use less milk for thicker texture. I think this frosting is like a custard it's so good it can literally go with fresh fruit too! I baked a carrot cake & used this recipe, let's just say my family LOVES IT

I made this with my class in school, and they liked it - some more than others.  We cut down on the milk to make it thicker and the consistency was perfect.  I didn't think it was too sweet as some other reviewers thought.

this was the first sugar free cake and frosting I have EVER made. The cake was from scratch and I read the reviews from others and didn't know how to adjust the milk for the pudding so I adujusted the milk to 1 cup and it worked out GREAT!!!! Left the cake out for about 25 minutes and it didn't run. I used chocolate pudding and it wasn't the real thing, but I though it was good enough when you can't have the real thing.

The flavor of this icing is wonderful.  I did have a problem with the texture, mine was a little too runny to spread well.  I will certainly try again, since no one else has had this problem.

A wonderful frosting! I made this to go on a sugar-free cake for my mom's 50th birthday, it was a hit.  This one would even taste great on a regular cake.

Finally something really good for those of us who can't have any type of real sugar. After my Gastric Bypass I really missed occasional dessert. This was a great recipe and I even tried it in the morning on a bagel, yum!

Jon loved this frosting. It reminded him of chocolate silk pie which I do not like. The frosting is very easy to make and spreads nicely.  It's a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.
