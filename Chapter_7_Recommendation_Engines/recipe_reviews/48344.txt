I couldn't even finish two bites.  I used this recipe to make taco meat for a salad.  Even with ranch dressing, I felt like my lips were going to fall off from the heat!  I've never had that problem with the store-bought kind.  If you like really hot tacos, this is the recipes for you!

YUMMY!  I suggest putting the mix in an old plastic parmesan cheese shaker.  That way you can sprinkle on as much as you want, or scoop it out of the other side.  Plus the container holds a lot, and you can always see how much is left over.

Excellent for ground beef or turkey.  This tastes better than store bought.  Is less salty and more flavorful. I have already prepared my second batch.

Can't mess this one up! I needed a mexican seasoning for chicken that would ultimately be shredded and go into a mexican casserole, so I made this only used onion powder, garlic poder, and omitted the cumin since I didn't have any. I was very loose with the measuring and it still turned out great. I threw in a dash of cayenne for some heat and my chicken turned out delicious. Can't screw this one up, people! :)

We really enjoy this recipe. I like to add a can of diced tomatoes, corn & black beans to the meat and seasoning when I prepare it.

This was an excellent recipe.  I was in a crunch when I had already defrosted my meat and cut up the toppings for the tacos when I realized, no seasoning.  I had everything I need for this recipe in my pantry which was great.  I just added a little more salt.  I will definitely recommend to friends and family.

FANTASTIC!!! My AUSSIE kids LOVE TACOS... so that has been the request for the past week... However I discovered that I didn't have a taco seasoning pkt in my pantry so as a last minute ditch I searched 'allrecipes' in hope that I would have the ingedients n my cupboards. Well, it was a success. In fact, all of my 3 children said that it was the BEST taco meat that they had ever had. Thank you!! Definately a WINNER at our house.

This isn't bad. It isn't the greatest either. It's salty, and salt of a sort that is a waste of your allotment of salt for the day. Switch the 4 tsp salt for 3 tsp (or even 2 if you're used to a lower salt diet) of chicken bouillon (or beef bouillon, doesn't matter which, though beef is better if you're subbing turkey for beef). You can always experiment with other spices in your pantry as well -- cayenne for heat, cocoa for depth, etc. It's a good base to tweak to your own tastes! EDIT: 7/16/10: The most valuable thing about this recipe vs. the more popular "Taco Seasoning I" on this site is that *this* recipe remembers to add flour while the other does not. Flour (or cornmeal, or masa harina) helps your seasonings cook down & adhere to the meat. I use cornmeal because it also adds a good flavor, but you can use whichever. Thanks again!

Excellent recipe! I live with a Cuban family that doesn't like hot foods so I left out the cayenne pepper and instead used regular black pepper, I added minced onions, oregano, seasoned salt and for the last missing ingredient for those who wish to know is 1/4 tsp. of sugar! PERFECTO!

Very yummy. I didn't have any dried minced garlic so I used 1/4 tsp of garlic powder instead. Don't think I will go back to using package seasoning.

I didn't think this was too hot, but it was overwhelmingly spicy/salty (just not particularly hot spicy), the proportion of spice mix to beef was all wrong.  I could tell there was a problem as soon as I added the spice to the meat, the texture was all sticky and gloppy not the way it should be - at which point I felt like kicking myself for not starting with 2 tbsp and working up from there if necessary, like most other taco seasoning recipes call for.  For now, I'm giving it two stars, and one of those is purely on hope that it will taste better when the proportion of spice to beef is changed, but this time it was inedible. I have a houseful of taco lovers, but no one could eat these.

Like most others, I made this in a pinch when I had all the fixin's for tacos except the seasoning. I didn't have Oregano, or a whole cup of Chili Powder, or the patience to measure out the rest. A little of everything, plus I added some Cayenne pepper for more heat and it tastes just like the packet, if not better! Just threw a bit with some water on top of my browned ground turkey, couldn't have been easier. No way I'm going to buy those packets again.

Very good mix. I reduce the salt to half.  Basic ingredients that I always have on hand.  I just pour what I need from the jar straight into the pan.

WAY too hot for my taste.  Although it did keep me from eating too much.  I had to chase every bite down with a swig of milk to put out the fire.  Too much chili powder.

One cup of chilli powder is WAY TOO MUCH! I eat very hot food and I used a half cup of chilli powder for this recipe and felt it was too hot. Perhaps there is a lot of variance in the amount of heat in chilli powders, but I would strongly recommend starting with about 2 tbsps chilli powder and working up from there.

I reduced this recipe and had no problem with it being too hot. I admit that I added aspects of other recipes such as paprika and beef stock instead of water and we loved it! If an ingredient seems too extreme for you then it probably is! Adjust to your tolerance. A recipe is only a guide and shouldn't replace common sense. Wonderful recipe and thanks for sharing. :o)

Excellent! When reading the recipe, I had thought that there was too much chili powder, so I added it in increments and tasted after each.  I ended up with exactly what the recipe had called for!  I did cut salt in half and added a dash of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Not a fan at all as I like spicy when it comes to mexican and this is just too bland without any cayenne or chili powder.  I did find a use for it with friend of mine who can't do much spicy at all.

It is not all supposed to be used at one time! Unless you are cooking about 5lbs of taco meat. Mix in jar or container and 1/2 cup of the mix is the equivalent to 1 package of store bought! To lessen any heat try adding a 1/4 tsp of sugar. If you do not want the whole cup of chili powder USE less. We loved them, Using only 1/2 cup of chili powder mixed all ingrediants together and store in an old parm cheese container.

I agree with some reviewers that 1 cup is too darn much chili powder!  I am Mexican and love hot, however, this recipe has an overpowering chili powder taste and the rest of the ingredients don't come through.  I'll cut it down to 3/4 cup next time, that should do it.

I loved this recipe.  I tweaked it to make it a little spicier with extra cayenne, and the taste was fantastic.

This was pretty good seasoning. This makes enough to season 4 lbs. of ground meat, so I cut this down to a fourth (1 lb. meat's worth) I had to add about 1 1/4 c water then let it simmer about 12 minutes and it turned out so well that my hubby loved the taco meat! I thought it was a little too much chili powder or something, but they were still good, just not my favorite.

A great base: I upped the garlic to 3/4 tsp, the cumin to 2 tsp, and added 1 tsp of seasoning salt and it was SO close to the packets from the store. Delish!

Don't confuse CHILI POWDER with CAYENNE PEPPER or you will end up with something that is too hot and spicy to eat. Chili powder is not hot. This is a great recipe. I love knowing what's in the food I cook so I use as few packages as possible. This is so easy and the flavor is fantastic.

This Taco Seasoning is wonderful and easy to have on hand.  I always forget to get the season packets at the store, but always have these ingredients on hand!

Wow!!  Like other reviewers, I had offered my hub tacos, only to discover that I was out of packet taco seasoning.  I love this recipe, as it is so very customizable, according to a family's taste. I added more onion and garlic, but really that was my only change.  I may reduce the amount of chili powder next time, but it does have a great kick to it!  I also like the addition of the flour, which insures a thick sauce when water is added.  Thanks for a great recipe -- I will always keep this on on hand!

This was a great help I thought I had taco seasoning and had run out.  I had all the ingredients on hand and it actually tasted better then the packaged taco seasoning.  I made some and put it in a jar to use again later.  Thanks.

Sorry, but this just didn't turn out for us.  It was too spicy for my kids and my husband and I both thought it was too salty.

Reduced the chili powder to 2/3 cup and only used 1/4 cup mix for 1 lb hamburger, and it was still too spicy for the kids.

I thought this was just "okay"... It didn't seem to have much flavor to me. It definitely had the heat but just not much flavor. I ended up adding more chili powder and cumin but it still wasn't as good as the packet of taco seasoning. Maybe it's all the preservatives!

Cumin smells just like packaged taco sauce. If you use this with a little chili powder you have the same great tasted without the nasty greasy orange. You don't have to use the amounts specified. I just shake on enough to get the flavor I want. My mother doesn't like it too spicy, so it's easy to tweak it for her that way.

Even better than the packages!  I didn't have dried onion, so i used really finely minced fresh onion, and it was PERFECT.  Also added a dab more cumin, because we love it. Thanks for the recipe!! I'll never buy another packet of taco seasoning again! ;)

We really didn't care for this - it still tasted floury even though I added it to the pan and cooked it for several minutes while the meat was draining. I'll keep looking for a great taco seasoning recipe.

I coated some chicken breasts in this mixture, then baked at 375 for 25 min. I then added some mexican cheese on top and baked another 5 min. This was mmm mmmm good. I can't wait to try this in ground beef for some tacos.

I ran out of the "store" taco seasoning. I thought dinner is ruined. Then I came to this site and found your recipe. Let's just say this saved dinner. We all loved the seasoning. It's a great blend of flavors. My husband said that it made the taco tasted so much better then the other "store" seasoning I was using. 
Thanks!

I did not like this at all.  Weird, considering it's so well rated.  It was just very boring.  Maybe I forgot to add some ingredients.  Oh well, I think I'll stick to Laury's fajita seasoning.  It's really good.

I don't know what the previous reviewer meant by the seasoning being too spicy.  I thought it was too blah!  I followed the ingredients perfectly and it was just very weak.  I had to add a lot, and I mean a lot, more cumin just to make it bearable.  Next time, I;m just going to spend the extra 75 cents and buy a packet of taco mix.

Great receipe........I did not have any cumin so I had to do without it but it is still great.  I will have to try again later after I buy the cumin.  I am not sure what it adds because I have not really used it but I bet it will be even better with it.  No more store packets for me!

This had too much chili powder and not enough cumin for our tastes. I will have to add some other ingredients to be able to use this up.

This is very good.  I've made 3 batches of this seasoning over the past year or so.  We really enjoy it.  It's no more salty than a store bought brand... And it's much cheaper.  We just add a little, taste, then repeat until it suits our tastes.   We also use it as our chili seasoning most of the time.
