This recipe has the right idea, however cheddar cheese doens't go with pesto whatsoever. I used Feta cheese and found it to be much more appealing. Feta, scrambled eggs and pesto... couldn't be better... Cheddar? Never.

This was amazing. The pesto goes so well with the eggs. Instead of chedder I used parmesan. I added chopped tomatoes also. I can't wait to make again. This was the best scrambled eggs I have ever had.

I wasn't sure about the amount of cheese in the recipe, it sounded like a lot, but it was great! Instead of the oil, I used an olive oil cooking spray.

This was good, but all the oil and cheese made an oil slick.  Plus, the pesto has a lot of oil.  I cut out most of the frying oil and I used home made pesto.  A bit of a mess, but worth it.

One of my favorite restaurants serves a breakfast dish similar to this called green eggs and ham. It includes the scrambled eggs, pesto, diced ham and topped with feta cheese. Wonderful combination of flavors.

Loved the pesto and eggs together! To sneak some veggies in for my son, I cooked some onion, chopped zucchini and diced tomato in oil first. Then added the eggs, cooked until done, added pesto, and then topped with shredded parmesan cheese. He loved it and hardly noticed that he ate zucchini. Awesome!

I was pleased at how quick and easy this vegetarian dinner idea was to make. I replaced the cheddar with feta and added capers and Italian seasoning. Then I served it in folded flatbread naan topped with lettuce, avocado slices and parmesan cheese. Flavorful and hearty!

This was fabulous using the recipe as written. I was apprehensive because it didn't look that pretty at first but then after adding the cheddar cheese, it all came together. Cannot wait to make this again. I did use butter instead of vegetable oil.

I can tell this is an awesome recipe, but substituting feta for cheddar resulted in a reallllly salty plate of eggs. I will try the cheddar next time, but if you use feta, try using much lower cheese to egg ratio.

pretty good - if you love pesto. A little bit of pesto goes a long way. Definitely needs toast or some other taste as a counter-balance. (I also strongly recommend feta instead of cheddar.)

Ummm, yum.  Easy.  I used a pesto with a bit of cheese already in it and omitted the cheddar.  Watcin' the waist line.  Still yummy.

for a while i was so bored of scrambled eggs that i couldn't even think of them, but this reinvents them in a way that has totally re-ignited my interest!    a word of caution:  i used three eggs but the same amount of cheese and oil (well, butter) and it was just fine.  there's no need to add all that extra fat!

This was very tasty and I will make it again. However, it was a bit overpowering. I'm going to cut the pesto and cheese in half, leave out the salt. Otherwise, a very delicious blend of flavors!

To be honest I'm rating the concept more than the actual recipe because seasoning of eggs is such a personal preference.  Anyway, I LOVE putting pesto in my scrambled eggs.  try it!

Really good! I used a pesto mix from Tastefully Simple, and it was delicious. The only change I made was that I used Parmesan cheese instead of Cheddar, and omitted the salt. Quick, simple, and satisfying, thanks so much Sophiawade.

Yumm... so delicious. These were very moist eggs. And full of flavor! I left out the oils and used non stick spray instead. While this was fantastic as written, I think I'm going to use feta cheese next time. So good, these are a must try!

I personally like the idea of fresh parmesan instead of cheddar and next time I will cut out most of the oil and add some onion.  As far as rating it goes though...I served this to my 8, 5, and 3 year olds on top of garlic bread as a breakfast for dinner meal.  They loved it and I pleasantly listened to moans of "Mommy this is delicious!" coming from all three of them.  My very picky husband said, "I think you found a winner here." so I will definately be making it again.  It was a quick meal and everyone loved it.

All in all, not a bad recipe.  A lot of flavor from the pesto.  I did modify it, however.  I have non stick pans and don't normally use oil, so I eliminated the oil entirely.  I also used egg substitute and added the pesto to the egg mixture before cooking, as I wanted any excess oil to cook off.  It worked perfectly that way.  It's easy, quick, and delicious.  Served with toast.  Thanks!

I used olive oil instead of veg oil and used feta cheese instead of cheddar.  I tossed in a few capers for added zip.  These were really good and similar in taste to my favortite Greek omelet that my daughter makes.  I will make these often!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I came across this recipe by accident, and was intrigued so I made it immediately after reading the reviews.  I agree with molle888, pesto goes better with feta so that's what I did.  Butter in the pan, 2 eggs, feta, pepper (no salt required), and about 2 tsp of pesto. I gave 5 stars for my version, I loved it!

I used parmesan instead of cheddar, about 1/4 c for three eggs, and no salt. It was so good!!!

Quick and tasty! I used homemade pesto and put it in the pan first so I wouldn't have to add extra oil. I also used parmesan instead of cheddar, since I used parmesan in my pesto. Great flavor, and with a couple slices of bacon and wheat toast it made a delicious breakfast!

I was looking for something different and this is different. I love the robust flavor of the pesto. It's a keeper. I am adding it to my weekly menu. I doubled every think but the oil and cheese and used a nonstick skillet.

This is wonderful.  I added the pesto before cooking the eggs and eliminated the oil. My pesto already had a lot of oil in it.  The pesto added so much favor.  We all loved it.  I will be making this mini more time.

These were pretty good but I could barely taste the pesto, next time I will use a teaspoon or more. I used monterey jack instead of cheddar, and to make it healthier I used Pam instead of oil and used reduced fat pesto.

I used some leftover feta cheese and was delighted at the flavorful result.  Others have mentioned variations they've done, and I can see this recipe as a jumping off place for a lot of combinations.  The pesto is the key, and if you really like pesto you could add even more.

Yum yum! I used farm fresh eggs, homemade chunky pesto and shredded parm instead of cheddar. I used more pesto than called for. I can see that if you use a pesto that is thin (i.e. contains more oil), this could turn out a little greasy. What I had made was pretty chunky to begin with, so it didn't add an unpalatable amount of oil. Had it with whole wheat baguette, and I think it would be fabulous with some sliced fresh tomatoes as well.

These were really good! Only changes I made were that I did not use oil, just a little butter and I used mozzarella cheese because I dont think cheddar goes with pesto. Very cheesy and very yummy!

This was just ok.  I read the other reviews about the cheddar cheese being too much for the eggs but tried it anyway.  Since the cheese is scrambled with the eggs and then cooked it didn't stand out too much.  It wasn't bad but I think a different cheese would be a better match.  The eggs were kinda boring even with the pesto, I doubt this will go in rotation at my house.

This was good but I found the flavors really overwhelming and didn't care for the texture.  I made it again with a few alterations.  I added a dash of milk and just a sprinkling of cheese and a dab of pesto, a little pepper and no salt.  To me, it tasted so much better and I really enjoyed it.  I also used a quick spray of oil instead of a whole Tbsp.

I added a little milk, garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  Cooked  7 eggs in two tablespoons of butter and not oil.  Also stirred the pesto into the eggs rather than after.  It had a great quiche texture.  Very Flavourful.   I will make this often.

I tried this and it came out extraordinary. Since I didn't have cheddar cheese, I used an italian mix of Asiago, Provolone, Romano, Parmesan, Mozarella and Fontina cheeses. By far the best scrambled eggs I've ever had.

I've had pesto on many pasta dishes and pizza, but for some reason had never thought to eat it with eggs. We made the pesto from scratch because we already had a basil plant . The whole family loved it, it's very good. It's a great way to use up the basil plants growing on the patio. No need to add any salt or pepper. The cheese and pesto gave it plenty flavor. Thanks for sharing!

My first attempt at scrambled eggs and I was pleasantly surprised! Tasted like I bought it at some fancy restaurant! Added just a little mozzarella cheese and hot sauce also. Didn't even try the pesto as yet as I didn't have any at hand but can't wait to see how it turns out when I do.

I made this today and my husband loved it.  He loves anything with pesto sauce so I knew I couldn't go wrong here.  I did take the advice to skip the cheddar and went with the Parmesan.  I went light on the pesto and the cheese and of course, he said more pesto would be better.  I'll try it again using the feta.  So nice to perk up those scramble eggs!

I would've rated this with just one star but I felt it would be unjust because I didn't follow exactly as the recipe says as I wanted to double the portion. I tripled the egg (I believe the eggs here in Malaysia are much smaller), doubled the cheese (I used grated Parmesan) and put A LOT of pesto for the two of us. For me it was inedible but my husband thought it was okay and would give it 3 stars. I won't be making this again.

My two boys under 6 and I liked these....with some major reductions in measurements of cheese and oil.   For 3 servings we only did a couple teaspoon of olive oil and probably 1/4 C cheese.  Great with some whole wheat toast and bacon.

I never would've thought to put pesto and eggs together but it was delicious!!  I took the advice of others and used parmesan and feta cheese instead of cheddar.  Also, my boyfriend won't eat anything without meat so I added some ham and it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!
