Great start for a soup recipe.  If you want thicker soup, use less water and puree some of the potatos.  If you want more flavor, use stock or broth instead of some of the water and saute the onion.  If you want to add a veggie, try asparagus...it's good.  Add salt and pepper to your own taste.  If you ever want to add a little zip to a soup, try some wine (in the soup) or vinegar.

This was super easy, but it tasted terrible. It was too thin not enough corn. It had no taste.

Whom ever recipe this is, I think you should add a little more flavor to your chowder... It does not take that much longer to add a few more ingredients..

This was very easy and good, but I agree with those who rated it too bland and thin. The bland part is easy to take care of, just be creative with the spices! (I added salt and fresh ground pepper, Old Bay, and some Emeril's "bam" mix which has paprika in it.) I'd make it again because it's so easy and way better and more homemade tasting than heating up a can of soup! Next time, however, I might drain some of the water off the potatoes so it's thicker...that might do it.

This is absolutely wonderful. I have made this soup several times and vary it each time. I used leftover ham once and bacon another time and cheese a third time. My husband will eat anything I cook but he raved about this.

I am from Atlantic Canada and this is the recipe my grandmother and mother and I all use and we love it. We also add a can of niblets corn a couple of diced carrots and what really makes the difference is about a tablespoon of butter on top!It's even better the second day.

I have to agree this was a bit bland, but really not too bad, warming on a cold day and very easy to make.  In the end, I did add some thyme, sage and pepper.  For those with the "too thin" problem -- I saw this coming so I only *barely* covered the potatoes to cook them, and I mean to the point that corners of cubes were peeping through, and then stirred them often while cooking.  All the water was soaked up this way.  As someone else already said, mashing them a bit is good too.

This is missing some very important steps to be Altantic Corn Chowder.  The creamed corn is right, and Evaporated milk, just need to add more of both, everyone is different so play with it but the biggest trick is, cover the diced potatoes in just enough salted water to cover them, cook untit done.  Then stir in canned milk, creamed corn.  (add extra if you like the more the better!) Then in the mircowave or pot cook the onion in the butter, then stir the melted butter and onions on top.  S&P to taste.  Funny how just changing the way it is done makes all the difference. I sometimes add a bayleaf or other seasonings, as well as carrot, peas etc to mix it up.  if you like it thick, use a rue!  But it is really the can milk, creamed corn, with the melted butter and onions that makes it soooo good.

i actually liked it, despite the fact that i almost didn't make it because of the bad reviews. i started out sauteing the onions until they were tender, then added the potatoes and barely covered them with water. i added 3 chicken bouillon cubes and the flavor was amazing. i added the corn and milk, but it was too runny so i threw in a block of cream cheese on a whim and it thickened it up and made it super creamy and delicious. serve with some warm crusty bread and you're good to go!

I made this Chowder for a bible study group who just loved it. They don't eat meat so this was perfect. I used a veg base instead of water to cook potatoes, added shredded carrots and some extra cream and reg corn. It came out Great for the first time making it and I will use this recipe again & again.....

I thought this recipie was great. I made it for the guy i just started seeing and he loved it,  in fact i sent a huge bowl home with him since i doubled the recipie and his housemates sucked it down pretty fast. All in all its a great recipie.  I added a fair amount of pepper though but i reckon that it should have pepper anyways.

Read reviews before you start. Wanting a quick lunch I started recipe without reading reviews, when I realized there was no seasoning I went to the reviews, then started the changing process.  I drained most of the water off the potatoes and onions, I added salt & pepper, read another review and added Old Bay, read another review and added minced carrot (trying to ensure they got done) when potatoes were soft I used potato masher gently then added 2 cans creamed corn and evaporated milk. We like pepper so it got a healthly dose at the end.  Great Soup for a cold day!!

I give this 4 stars because it was a bit bland as  written.  I have made the following changes.  If I add uncooked onions to the uncooked potatoes and boil, I drain and add fresh water when almost done. Otherwise the onion taste overwhelms the chowder.  The onion should compliment the dish, not take it over.  Or I sautee the onion and add  when the potatoes are done.  Mashing the potatoes  a bit certainly helps, or you can add potato flakes to taste.  Also I use ham flavoring in  the water and Emeril's Essence.  And I use heavy cream rather than evaporated milk.  And, as many reviewers recommended,  I like carrots in this as well.  Finally, if you need to save time, use canned diced potatoes, and canned carrots which are easy to chop/dice.  And, if I have it, I  add diced ham.  What I'm trying to say here is: This is a great base recipe.  But you need to  add spices and ingredients suitable to your taste, and then you will be rewarded with true comfort food on a cold day/night.  Thanks to all reviewers who provided helpful hints. And many thanks to you, Ms Atherton.

It was delicious. So simple and so yummy. I only made one change. We are not huge onion fans, I put one shallot instead of a whole onion. Great Job!

after reading the reviews I changed the soup a little the first time... I browned the onions in a little butter, added some fresh corn, used equal parts of vegie broth and water just covering the potatoes, added green onions and salt and pepper. I ended up adding to much pepper but other than that it was good, my husband loved it.

I was looking for quick, tasty comfort food, but this was WAY too bland.  My husband, who generally will eat anything, didn't like this at all.  It's easy & it fills you up, but that's about it.

Loved this recipe!  At the last minute, my daughter called to say that she was coming over for dinner, so I threw in another can of creamed corn.  It thickened it up a little better, and was absolutely delicious.  I just emailed the recipe to my sister to try, too.

Great "starter" soup recipe. Especially for beginners like me. I did lots of tweaking, used chicken broth & water, 2 cans creamed corn, added a can of asparagus, and seasonings; onion powder, lawry's seasoning salt, salt, pepper, and topped with fresh shredded cheddar. turned out VERY well, even the little ones enjoyed it!

This was a real lifesaver for a last minute satisfying dinner!  I added an extra potato and threw in a can of clams and it was great!  Needs something to spice it up a little though.

Can't get my 9 year old to eat anything but the rest of the family loved it! I needlessly doubled it but ended up eating the rest the next couple of days. Would highly recommend it, especially on a cooler evening.

Growing up in Atlantic Canada this was a stable dish. In my family we added homogenized milk instead of canned, but everything else is pretty much the same.  I have tried other corn chowders, and don't like it as much. I guess it's all about what you are used to.

Add flour to thicken.  Add salt and pepper and the entire can of evaporated milk.  It tastes just fine.

I did like this soup, but I would change three things about it. 1. I would not add as much onion. The onion overpowered the rest of the flavor, so I'd use only half of what it says. 2. I had to add salt and pepper because it was a little bland. 3. I would have added more potatoes and corn because it seemed like there wasn't that much..

Simplicity makes this recipe tasteful, though for taste it does need a bit of salt and pepper--and by bit I mean a healthy dose.  I added an extra can of creamed corn to make it thicker and added a can of clams for extra flavor.

This was the quickest soup I have ever made. My 15 daughter is a vegetarian and she just loved it!! It was an easy way to prepare a hot, satisfying meal.
