The vanilla was just a little too sweet for me, so I added some sour cream and mustard for a little bit more tartness.

I liked this very much.  The men in my family were not so excited about it.  I'm making this the next time me and the girlfriends get together.

Delicious but a bit sweet, I think next time I will use some plain yogurt or sour cream as suggested instead of only vanilla yogurt.

This is a great healthy recipe for potato salad and I will make it again. I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used plain Greek yogurt with a dash of honey mustard and it was great.  
Next time I make it, I might add some cilantro or parsley and frozen peas. It's very versatile so add what you have and make it colorful. I'm thinking of red, yellow, orange peppers if you like that. My husband added a diced pickle to his serving. A good alternative to Mayonnaise based potato salads.

Not a huge fan as written. The vanilla was too sweet and I think plain greek yogurt would have been better but then you would have needed other seasonings such as dill. I really liked the addition of bean sprouts but this one was not great as written and needs tweaked in my opinion.

After reading the other reviews I decided to use a lemon greek yogurt instead of vanilla but it just lacks brightness.  This needs some type of vinegar or mustard, something to make it pop.
