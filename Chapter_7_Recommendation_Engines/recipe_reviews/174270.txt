I have to say first that I LOVE BLUEBERRIES!  They are my absolute favorite fruit. So of course a Blueberry Pie sounded wonderful to me.  I looked over the ingredients and decided to give this recipe a try.  I had to use frozen Bluberries instead of fresh because fresh are WAY to EXPENSIVE right now.  I thawed the berries then drained the juice that comes along with fruit being frozen.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I added a tiny bit more cinnamon (because it is a wonderful spice) and about a 1/2 c. more of the berries just because I had a little extra.  The pie smelled wonderful as it baked and when my hubby finally arrived home we tasted it. Oh dear..very very good!  My husband said the only complaint he had was it didnt have vanilla ice cream to go along with it. (I thought about that half way through the cooking process) Oh well..I will buy some today and we will enjoy the pie again tonight. But this time with some vanilla ice cream.
Thanks for the recipe Natalie--it was DELICIOUS!  What a treat.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It is perfect, so don't go changing a thing.  If you are using frozen blueberries it is very important to allow them to reach room temperature and drain off the excess liquid.  Otherwise your pie will be soupy.  Also, along the lines of frozen berries, you will need measure out more than 3 cups (you're looking at more like 4 1/2 to 5) so that when they are thawed and drained you'll end up with the 3 cups the recipe calls for.  This recipe also works very well with other berries: raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, or try a mixture of berries.  Also is perfect using the "Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust" also found on Allrecipes.com Happy Baking!!

This was easy & very tasty. I used fresh blueberries.  Due to limited time, I used refrigerated pie crusts (used glass/Pyrex pan as recommended on the box. The second time I made it, I took it to a dinner party (served it a la mode)--they loved it & wanted the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I made my own crust and skipped the lattice top - just pierced some holes in the top crust with knife.  We only had frozen blueberries so we increased the amount to 5 cups (measured when frozen).  The blueberry mixture was VERY watery and I was afraid it wouldn't set so I added one extra tablespoon of tapioca and it set beautifully! The pie was very sweet and didn't have the nice tartness blueberry pies should have so next time I will decrease the amount of sugar.  I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled sanding sugar over the top crust.  I also decreased the oven temperature by 15 degrees because it always seems to keep my crust from burning.  Everybody loved it and I would definitely recommend this recipe!  UPDATE:  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still very sweet.  Next time I will try 3/4 cup.

Ridiculously easy recipe with exceptionally tasty results.  I used frozen blueberries added extra tapioca and a bit of extra sugar...turned out great!  We even ate it warm.

This is a fantastic recipe as written. I used fresh blueberries with maybe 1/4 extra than the recipe calls for. I think tapioca works much better than flour or cornstarch, as my experience with those is that they cloud up the filling and it doesn't make for such a pretty fresh looking pie. For the pastry I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site; also very good.

I made this pie for my family. My husband loved it, but it turned out a little runnier than I expected. I guess I did not account for the juice in the blueberries.

The best blueberry pie I have ever tasted, period. My mom agrees and the rest of the family enjoyed it as well :) I used fresh blueberries ("Elliot") from our garden and "Pie Crust IV" from this site. I will make this again!

This is yummy pie, but too sweet for my taste.  I didn't feel like I really tasted the blueberries, more of the sugar.  If I tried this again, I'd use less sugar and/or more fruit.  This was my first lattice crust, it turned out great!

This pie is good but it didn't set up like i thought it would. It was a little runny but tasted good. I think i'll try it again but maybe a little less sugar.

This is the best blueberry pie I have ever made.  AND it was so easy.  I've tried many recipies which I have now tossed out.  My pies always came out too runny.  This one was perfect.  This is my only blueberry pie recipie from now on.  Thanks Natalie for Grandma's recipie.

I found it really too sweet. My four year old thought the same and wouldn't eat it. Also, to me, cinnamon goes better with apples than with blueberries. However, if I cut at least half the sugar and omit the cinnamon, I think that I would like it a lot.

This was really enjoyable.  I had leftover pie crust scraps, so I simply halved recipe and made into 2 small tarts for hubby & myself.  I didn't realize until afterwards your recipe didn't call for both a top & bottom crust, so my bad.  Filling was nice and firm - I wish I had had some ice cream or whipped topping to go along with recipe - all in all, quite good.

Made this for my dad for father's day and he said it was yummy.....one thing though, he said it was too sweet.  So, next time, I will reduce sugar to 3/4 cup.  Also had to use 6 cups of blueberries so I added the same amount of tapioca and it settled great!

This is a great tasting pie and it set up very nice.  I did use 5 cups of frozen blueberries and increased the tapioca by 1 T. as suggested by other reviews since I used frozen berries.  I loved how the pie stayed together when I removed the first piece.  I decreased the oven temp. to 350 for the last 15 min. and covered with foil to prevent overbrowning. The tapioca must be the trick.  I don't think I will ever go back to flour or cornstarch again.  Thanks Grandma!

My family loved this pie. I didn't have tapioca so I used corn starch. It was a little runny so maybe tapioca would work better. The flavor was wonderful especially with vanilla ice cream.

This pie was easy and delicious. I used the Pillsbury crusts you roll out and made the lattice top which was easier than I thought it would be. I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't think it was too sweet and I don't eat much sugar. Now that I think of it, I believe I had more blueberries than three cups...I used whatever comes in two pints, about 4 cups (so I didn't really follow the recipe exactly). But anyways, this is a GREAT recipe and it will be the only blueberry pie recipe I will make!

Great tasting pie and I love the use of the tapioca! Blueberries were frozen so I took the advice of others and used 5 cups of blueberries and a few more tbsp of tapioca. Turned out great!

This was a GREAT recipe!! As others did I increased to 5 tbs of tapioca and 5 cups of fresh blueberries (could have added another cup).  The tapioca gives it a perfect, non runny consistency.  As a preference I cut back on the sugar since my husband doesn't like really sweet things. I used 3/4 cup and it was perfect.  Like others I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust from Allrecipes. i brushed the bottom crust with butter and baked it by itself for 15 min. I also brushed the top crust with butter and let the extra butter drip into the pie.  They raved about the crust and the entire pie.  The bottom crust came out perfectly flaky.  This has become my go to recipe for blueberry pie.

Great flavor! But very watery and I'm not sure if the tapioca beads were supposed to completely dissolve.

This pie is absolutely amazing! My father has always said that his mom used to make the best blueberry pie and he hadn't had blueberry pie in decades. For his birthday this year I got on allrecipes and found this recipe. I made it and it was a success. He was so impressed with the gesture that he almost cried. He even said it was better than grandmas pie that she used to make. I did read the reviews though and added 1/4 cup less sugar and a little bit of lemon zest. Perfect! Will be making this pie again for sure! Thanks grandma.

I made 3 of these pies for a luncheon. I blinked and they were all gone. Everyone raved about the pies. Very fast, easy and delicious. I used frozen blueberries, which worked just as well as fresh.

This blueberry pie recipe is the best I've tried. The berries are not too sweet, not too tart; the consistency is not too runny, not too congealed. Perfect! I personally believe that using tapioca as a thickening agent gives much better results than flour or  cornstarch. The filling doesn't get murky or gloppy. I made two crusts rather than the lattice top. Yummy!

I'm no chef, but my pie came out wonderfully! This is a perfect recipe, simple and delicious. I recommend making your own crust with the Crisco recipe and sprinkling some cinnamon and sugar on top as a finishing touch.

I made this exactly as stated, except with frozen blueberries that I thawed and drained. I also brushed egg-white and sprinkled a little sugar on the crust before baking. My husband said it was the best piece of pie he had ever eaten!! Fantastic recipe!!

I made this exactly per recipe and was very disappointed as it was very runny and never did set up like I wanted it to. The flavor was good but that is about all that was. Will keep looking for THE recipe.

I made this one with a few modifications.  I doubled the blueberries because I was using a deeper pie dish.  I only used one cup of sugar and I didn't have tapioca, so I used corn starch to thicken it.  It was perfect.  I will use this recipe again!

I used frozen berries but added half a cup dried berries at the bottom and let them soak about an hour. It worked quite nicely to counteract the soupiness. Draining the excess juice would work fine but I cant bring myself to discard such flavorful stuff. I may try boiling it down to syrup next time.

You wont find a better simple blueberry pie recipe in my opinion.

I chose to make a double crust rather than lattice top., but other  than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It is very sweet, so I may cut the sugar  next time I make it.  Since it is blueberry picking season that will be very soon and I expect quite often.  I highly recommend vanilla ice cream on a slightly-warmed piece of this blueberry delight.

Actually this is my recipe! The difference, I add lemon zest also. Esp when it gets later in the season and the berries are not as tart. This is the pie my family  always requests! Great recipe!

This was my first try at blueberry pie and cooking with tapioca. I followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfect!  I didn't weave the pie crust I just cut slits in it. Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Easy recipe. The cinnamon is a must, in my opinion.
Made easy enough for a week day dessert with ready- made crusts. I use Marie Callendar.
Add vanilla ice cream on top and you have yourself a scrumptious treat!
Thank you Natalie!

I only used 1 cup of sugar, and then topped with melted butter and sprinkled with about 2 TBSP on top the the pie crust before putting it in the oven.  The Pie turned out good.  This recipe has to be made into pie, I couldn't use the filling for another recipe instead of caned stuff.

My grandson chose this pie because he always saw lattice pies on TV but never had one. He helped me make the pie.  We didn't have any blackberries so we used all blueberries.  I didn't put the entire 5.5 cups of blueberries because I thought it would spill over, however after it cooled the blues shrunk so we could have used the entire amount. My grandson said it's the best pie he ever tasted!

I did like this recipe...the problem is that is EXTREMELY sweet...I had 1/8 of the pie and really the overpowered sweetness made me reject it....I almost took some of the sugar off when preparing the filling but did want to try the recipe at first as is...I am a person who does no like too much sweet on something. I think that the best way to go is cut the sugar depending on the sweetness of your blueberries...I however, differ on the opting out of the cinnamon...I really think is ok in the recipe BUT it will be better with less sugar to have a good balance of sweetness and cinnamon flavor...as you can see the problem is the SUGAR in this recipe but as an overall the quickness and easiness wins so just modify it accordingly and it should be fine!

this was a good pie it was just a little to sweet, the berries i had were very sweet though, next time i will taste then decide how much sugar. We ate it after it had cooled slightly, but i have to say it was way better the next day, it held up when cut (the next day not so much from the over as to be expected)i will make this again but with less sugar
