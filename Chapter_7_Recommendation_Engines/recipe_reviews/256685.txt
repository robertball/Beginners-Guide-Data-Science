This is good. I used gluten free flour and it got too thick too fast and almost burned. I added extra soy milk , but then it got too thin.  Regardless, it was tasty and went well served over steamed cauliflower. I added a touch of ground turmeric to give it a "cheddar" color. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome! It was tasty and super-easy! I had all the ingredients on-hand! Thanks so much. I made gluten-free with a flour blend. It was great!
