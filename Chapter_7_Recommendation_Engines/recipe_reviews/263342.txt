Fabulous! I have been looking for a clone recipe  for the Tippins custard pie I used to get at Hen House and this is the best I've found. I love the custard and usually skip the crust so I just bought a crust, unrolled it and baked it with the custard. The custard part was delish! And I must say the pastry recipe looks yummy. Next time I may try it with the pastry or just see if custard cups work. I can't thank you enough for this recipe! Definitely THE keeper!

This pie is absolutely fantastic. I make custard all the time but never made it into a pie. You won't be sorry you made this.

How about, I grew up on egg custard.  My Mother made it regularly along with lemon sponge pudding.  Both also worked well as pies.

Delicious old-timey baked custard pie. Comfort food. I often use a ready made pie crust and pre-bake the crust for 10 min before adding the custard filling but either way it's good. Be sure and serve it well chilled.
