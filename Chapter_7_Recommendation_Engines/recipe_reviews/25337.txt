Great recipe.  I added 1/4 c parm, 1/2 cup fat free sour cream and 1 tbsp, garlic powder. Very fast and easier than I thought!

I used 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, a tablespoon of garlic powder, and I added 2 tablespoons of mayo.  This was excellent!

Very nice.  I made a few modifications...
I used new potatoes with thin skins.  I slit the skins with a knife and then mashed them coarsely with the skins on.  

For the sauce. Simmer 2T butter and 1T minced garlic in microwave while potatoes are cooking.  I added a little milk as well freshly grated parmesan making about 1/3 cup of sauce.  

Top with grated parmesan and baked for 30 minutes in a souffle dish. (any small casserole will do)

I cut the microwaved potatoes in half and lined the bottom of a buttered cassarole dish.  Mixed the steamed veggies with a red pepper roux, layered that on top of the potatoes. Then topped with shredded cheddar, mozz, and parm.  OMG!  Thanks for the recipe.  Took it and ran with it.

Wow, this was different and very good. We served it with fish. I followed one of the other reviewers recipes for the parmesan sauce - mayo, parmesan and garlic but I also added some milk. I also didn't have time to scoop the potato out of the skin, so I just put the broccoli and sauce over the potato halves - loved it!

The kids snarfed this up and wanted a lot more. A success! I made my own cheese sauce, as we don't have that sort of sauce in a jar in Germany. It was yummy and low fat too.

This was pretty good, though I think sounded better in theory than it actually was, to me. I used garlic alfredo sauce, not sure if that's what was mean by parmesan cheese sauce, but I'm guessing so... I made only two potatoes but used the 3 tbsp of sauce and it was a little dry. I also added shredded mozzarella to the potato/broccoli mixture. I'd make something like this again, but with tweaks.. I'm not sure I liked the sauce in the mixture.

Tasty recipe, but this required way more sauce than the recipe originally calls for.

Good but the recipe should incorporate more spices.  Kind of bland.  Not as good as expected.

I originally submitted this recipe 5 years ago and used Ragu pasta sauce but that was omitted from the online version. I am glad that so many people have enjoyed it. It was originally submitted to a veggie site but is now on many sites. Funnily enough, I haven't made it in years. Enjoy!!!!

These are the best mashed potatoes my husband has ever had.  I did not stuff potatoes, I mashed red and white baby potatoes. Excellent!

Excellent recipe and easy to make! Since there were no instructions for the cheese sauce, I substituted alfredo sauce instead and it tasted great. The only thing I might add next time is a little sour cream so it isn't so dry.

I used boxed frozen broccoli that I sauted with onion, green chilli and garlic. Omitted parmesan and added some shreeded cheddar on top. Wonderful, will surely make it again.
