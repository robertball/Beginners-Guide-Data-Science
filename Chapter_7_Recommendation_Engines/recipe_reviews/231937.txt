Made this tonight... Veganized it by using 'Follow Your Heart' Vegan cream cheese and 'Daiya' Monterrey Jack instead of cheddar. Also used corn tortillas instead of flour. Thus making this both vegan and gluten free. Left out the corn because my wife doesn't like it. Also used some roasted hatch green chile's I had in the freezer rather than canned green chiles.

The enchiladas were great, but don't hold up very well. I think it might hold up better with flour tortillas. I'll continue to use corn though to keep it gluten free. Maybe next time I'll skip putting the enchilada sauce beneath the enchiladas.

These were great!  I made my own refried beans using dried black beans and other ingredients and made my own whole wheat flour tortillas (recipes from another site).  I left out the avocado, and forgot to use the tomatoes and sour cream.  They were so filling and full of flavor.  I love how much fresh vegetables are in this recipe.  It's a bit time consuming, but it was worth it.  Next time I might make more to freeze for later.

This is my first review and I must say this recipe is definitely worth it. Although it did take me a little longer to prep and get in the oven, I was not disappointed by the outcome. Very tasty vegetarian dish. Just the right amount of seasoning and not to spicy. Will make again.

I substituted whole black beans for refried beans and corn tortillas for flour. I just microwaved the corn tortillas beforehand so they were easier to roll. Made about 10. Also, didn't have green chiles on hand, but used salsa verde in its place, el pato sauce (spicy Mexican tomato sauce) and the rest of the ingredients in the recipe. It came out wonderfully! Best enchiladas I've ever made.

The recipe was very tame and my kids thought it tasted more like a bean burrito than an enchilada and I have to agree.  I will try again but I will add diced jalapeno peppers and chili powder to the mix and probably cut the cream cheese since I don't feel a need to have such creamy enchiladas and it will make it healthier too.  I think I'll go with whole black beans instead as well.Fortunately I ran low on Cilantro and only put in half and it still came through strong so I'd suggest halving it unless you really like a lot of cilantro.

I was asked to make a vegetarian meal for a family . I made extras so we could try it at home...Oh My Goodness! This seriously is THE BEST Mexican dish I have EVER had. I could almost eat it everyday! The cream cheese is the KEY and brilliant ingredient. I went along with some of the reviews and used Half the cilantro. I didn't want to overpower the dish and the flavors were perfect. I doubled the recipe and instead of using  all refried beans; I used 1 can of refried beans and one can of organic black beans. It really was perfect...I am going to use these for my catering business...Yes; they have some prep work involved but I bet you could freeze these and make many meals out of them!

I substituted sliced jalapeno's for the chiles, and used a little more than 4oz to spice things up, everyone thought it was great!  The enchiladas are VERY filling!!

This recipe is amazing! It makes me never want to go to a Mexican restaurant for enchiladas again. For the sauce, I used 5 cloves garlic instead of 2, a whole lime instead of half, and no green chilis (bc I'm allergic). Also I used regular black beans and highly recommend it. The enchilada sauce was unbelievably tasty! Try this recipe, you will not regret it!

Everyone loved this. The only request was for a little more heat. Next time I would either use hot salsa for the sauce (used medium), or add a chipotle pepper. I used jack cheese, since I prefer it over cheddar for south-of-the-border flavor.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was wonderful! I didn't have any salsa on hand so I added 1/2C diced tomato and a heaping T of jalapeños to the food processor - turned out delicious. I'm a vegetarian and am always looking for something new to add to the dinner menu. My husband said this one needs to be on repeat!

We added 1 can of veg refried beans + 1 can of black beans. We also added 2 chipolte chilis in adobo sauce to the sauce (KEY!!!). This was fantastic! Would serve with rice and lettuce shredded to top enchiladas.

This filling is so good that I might have to make it alone as a dip sometime.  The sauce is great too with the cilantro and lime.  Next time I might add a jalapeño as well.  Flour tortillas definitely hold together better than corn, but though with corn it might be more of a casserole, it will still be delicious.

Next time I won't add the oregano. The sauce seemed a little more Italian than Mexican. Otherwise excellent recipe.

Definitely will make again! Followed the recipe, no changes! Got all the canned ingredients from the Hispanic  section and used Mexican cheese but basically  followed the recipe to the letter.

Excellent taste!  To try to make it a bit healthier  I substituted Fage yoghurt for the cream cheese , unsalted tomatoes (added my own salt) and one cup of cheddar cheese instead of two, added chili powder, and it was delicious!

Fantastic. Made my own refried beans (from a recipe on this site) and used jalapeño in lieu of chilies. Less cream cheese, more beans. Touch of tex mex seasoning. Definitely worth the work.

These are weird. Also #1 thing to remember about enchiladas... They are NOT made with flour tortillas. Would have probably tasted better had they been made with corn.

This was a really great recipe... I lowered the calorie count a bit by using light cream cheese, fat free re-fried beans and light sour cream. I also used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of green chiles to give it a bit more kick. It was great, and the leftovers just got better and better, too!

Delicious. I also used corn tortilla's and regular black beans which I broke down just a bit with an immersion blender. I added some chopped spinach to the bean mixture. I used pepper jack cheese. Next time,  I don't think I'll add the shredded cheese to the actual enchilada as filling, I think the cream cheese within the bean mixture is enough, (along with the shredded cheese on top).  If you're in a hurry, you can make enchilada's as a "pie", by layering your tortilla's on the bottom of your baking dish, then the filling, then another layer of tortilla's on top, then the topping. Saves the rolling time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It seems a little complicated but it really isn't.  Even my meat and potatoes teen son absolutely loves this dish.  I spice mine up a little with hot green chilies and my kids get so excited when they see this on the table.  Highly recommend!

Veggie recipe good for non vegetarians as well! The creaminess of the filling makes this recipe unique from the others. We used chipotle cheddar to add some spice and it definitely kicked it up a notch. We'll be making this again!

I use half refried black beans and half black beans.  Add green onions on top after baking. Really delicious. My husband eats meat (I don't) and he requests these over chicken fajitas most of the time on our Mexican food nights.

This was very good, but I wanted to make it a bit healthier, so I added sauteed vegetables atop the black bean and corn mixture.  I sauteed finely chopped cauliflower and mixed it with the black beans and corn.  I found the flavor a little bland, so I doubled the cumin and also added a tablespoon of chili powder.  When assembling the enchiladas, I topped the bean mixture with sauteed onions, peppers, jalepenos, mushrooms and zucchini, and then the cheese. I also added 2 oz of melted semi-sweet chocolate to the sauce to give it some extra roasty flavor.  It was delicious!

I added chopped zuchinni and muchrooms with the other veggies, and decreased the black beans, using about 3/4 what the recipe called for. This sauce is so much better than the canned ones you can buy!  Everyone was happy at the dinner table tonight (including my 5, 9, and 12 yr old), so I'll definitely be making again!

I loved this recipe and so did my entire family of 8. My brother won't eat vegetarian food but with this recipe he ate a lot of the enchiladas and then asked if I used chicken out beef. it was amazing that he couldn't tell it was vegetarian. I will vibe definitely adding this to my box of favorite recipes.

Easy and really delicious, I served it with curtido and the sweet cornbread (recipe from bookwurm70). 
I didn't have any corn but I don't think anyone missed it but it would have added a little more texture and sweetness. I will make sure I have it on hand for the next time.

Wow! That enchilada sauce was AMAZING. I didn't really like the texture of the burrito(refried beans with floating chuncks) , so I think next time, I will use whole black beans- and maybe skip or replace the cream cheese. The flavors were amazing and my non vegetarian boyfriend loved them(he isn't a texture person like me)

The flavor of this dish is excellent! The only change I plan to make in the future is using whole black beans instead of refried black beans, as it sometimes felt like I was just eating mush inside of a tortilla (albeit delicious mush!).

This was a delicious enchilada. I gave it four stars because I was hoping for a vegan recipe. I was surprised how wonderful it smelled cooking in the oven. The cilantro salsa gave this dish a real authentic taste. The only change I made was to use canned white sweet shoepeg corn. Next time I will try to make it vegan.

Ummm... I added diced raw sweet potatoes in with the onion/ bean mixture. ** highly recommended ** Also, the homemade enchilada sauce?!?! It's is amazing. I'm more likely to repeat that than the whole recipe. All in all, delicious enchiladas.

Made some minor changes: cooked veggies in bacon grease instead of oil, used regular black beans instead of refried (what I had on hand), totally forgot the cheddar cheese, and didn't bother with any of the toppings. The family loved it. I am positive they'll love it even more with the cheddar and refried black beans.

That was delicious!  The things I did differently were to cook the black beans from dried (after soaking them all night) in water and about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce in the slow cooker.  Then, I did not have any vegetable stock on hand so I used a little bit of tomato sauce and water as a substitute.  I also did not have the mild green chilies, so I used a couple of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce with a little milk to soften the spice.  The change to the chipotle did add a kick to the sauce which I liked but the subtleties that may have been there with the milder green chilies were lost.  I will try the mild next time as suggested in the recipe.  This would be a great thing to make ahead and freeze too. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Turned out great!!  My family loved it, even my picky daughter. I didn’t use onions (allergic) and added a can of black beans.  So yummy!  Will definitely make it again.

When I make it again I'm definitely adding olives. But this recipe was delicious even without. I made a mistake and didn't put any cheese inside each individual tortilla but I put a lot on top and it was still great. Ultimately it's a great recipe. And now I know how to make enchiladas from scratch, added bonus

These were so unbelievably delicious! I’m not usually a fan of leftovers but I ended up eating every last bit of this for 1 or 2 meals a day until it was gone. Next time I make it I’m going to attempt to make it 100% vegan and hopefully it will be just as good!...or as close as possible. Definitely making it again!

Meh. Was soggy ..the sauce itself was good. Would make the sauce to put on nachos or something. The texture of the filling was just too much like baby food.  Toni g to it. Perhaps I would use while black beans and add some more veggies for added texture

I made it per the recipe, although the only ingredient I didn't have was Cumin.  So, I just added some taco seasoning in place of that.  I'm not a vegetarian but I try to limit how much meat my family eats.  This was really delish!  I'd make it again.

I left out the cilantro and made guacamole with the avocados. This is a delicious vegetarian enchilada recipe! Even my meat loving boyfriend loved it.  I agree with other reviewers that the prep time was longer than expected. Give yourself an hour and a half to make this recipe. It’s worth the time though!

This was a very good recipe. I didn't use cilantro at all because my hubby can't stand the stuff so I just omitted. Turned out really tasty. Thank you for the recipe will keep this one on hand.

My husband and I aren't vegetarians, but this was great! I used mango salsa instead of tomato salsa because I happened to have a jar I wanted to get rid of, and it gave the dish a delicious, spicy kick.

These weee so delicious! The only thing i did different was i used corn tortillas instead of flour. I took a chance with this new receipe for a potluck and was relieved when it was a hit. I had several requests for the receipe.

I used some flour and some corn tortillas and used whole black beans from a can.  Everyone liked them but t it was New Year's Eve (we had some vegetarians there) and I didn't hear the timer go off, so they were a little overdone!  30 minutes would have been perfect!  Also, I made everything the day before but did not put the sauce and cheese on until baking them the next day.

This was AMAZING!  I made it a little healthier by reducing the cheese a bit, I used water to sauté, and I microwaved the tortillas to make them fold easier. I also used Trader Joe's roster frozen corn, some smokey chipotle salsa, and a ton of garlic  to give it a punch.

It might be really good, if you are into that.  I made it because my son & family decided to go vegetarian.  They also have kids, who don't like things to spicy.  I guess if you turned up the heat, it would be better.

Thank you for the excellent recipe!  Everything was perfect although we did not care for so much Cilantro—I’ll just tweak it next time.

I will most certainly make these again. I did make changes, only because I used what I had on hand. 
I used whole black bean instead of refried; an orange bell instead of a red; monterray jack instead of cheddar and a can of enchilada verde sauce instead of making a red sauce from scratch. 
The flavor is delicious and they are so filling. Much more than spinach or even meat enchilada's. Perfect for a meatless Monday or any day!

These were delicious! Trying to eat more plant based diet with less meat. I did use corn tortillas instead of flour.  I also made about one and a half times the sauce. We like a lot of sauce. The enchilada sauce is really good!! Never made it from scratch before! Will make these again!! Most excellent!!

*Note from my previous review* I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I also softened the corn tortillas in a frying pan with some cooking spray prior to filling/folding then. Delish!

My husband hated this recipe. The cilantro and lime in the enchilada sauce was overpowering and putting it underneath made the tortillas mushy.
Although I thought it was better tasting than my husband did, I have to agree.
Will not make again.

I doubled this recipe. The only thing I did different was I chopped the onions and red peppers in my 1cup chopper so they weren't so chunky (so the kids wouldn't complain) and I skipped the toppings at the end (I had them on hand but just didn't need them - it was so good without them!) My 11 yr said this was the best dinner I've ever made!  The red sauce was AMAZING.  Lots of ingredients but really not too difficult.  Skillet was cooking while I put all the sauce ingredients in the Ninja. Just prep your veggies and get your can goods open and throw it altogether!

As written this was a bit bland for me but it’s still a great base recipe for veg enchiladas!! Just increased the spices per my taste and added less cheese (we are trying to be healthier) and was very pleased with the results!

The enchilada sauce makes the dish, especially the cilantro! I made a few changes, I finely chopped up the raw pepper and onion in my food processor before cooking (due to others reviews of the veggies being "chunky") and I swapped out the tortillas for corn tortillas. I feel like enchiladas NEED corn tortillas because then they don't get soggy. I also used taco seasoned cheese inside the enchiladas and on top. Because I used the smaller corn tortillas, I fit close to enchiladas in the 9x13 baking dish which was plenty for 4 adults to have 2 servings + a few leftovers! Overall, the dish was a hit for guests we were hosting that weekend!

Very good! It's a lot to put together, but worth it. Since some reviewers were saying the filling needed more flavor, I put a bit of taco seasoning in it. Otherwise, I made it just as directed. It just came out of the oven and is already almost gone! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Eliminated red pepper because we don't like.  Substituted non-dairy cream cheese and sour cream (Tofutti) for a nursing mom avoiding dairy.  Made 4 with cheese and 3 without. The pan with no cheese could have used a bit more of the sauce. Other than that - very good.

Love this recipe though I didn't have cumin so I substituted a little taco seasoning instead.  It added a little zing.  I also didn't have vegetable broth so I used water....didn't notice a difference!  This will be added to my regular menu, no doubt.  Family loved it!

So yummy! Even my carnivore husband loved it. Will add to our dinner favorites.  Only modification was that I used corn tortillas instead of flour. Delish!!!

Absolutely delicious. I used pre-made green chile sauce and added cilantro to that.  I also used taco seasoning to the mixture. It was easy and delicious. A definite keeper

I made this exactly as the recipe says. All of that work and it pretty much tasted like a bean burrito. I doubt I will make it again. There were a lot  of good reviews but most of them were from people that changed things up a bit. I wish there were more reviews of the exact recipe.  When it's similar it's not so bad, but sometimes they are changed so much it's nothing like the actual recipe.  The kids did eat it. It wasn't awful, it just wouldn't be on my favorites list. I guess I'm just used to my regular enchiladas. Everyone's taste buds are different though so don't be afraid to try it because of my review. It was good for one meal.

It needs a lot more seasoning but overall it was pretty good. Definitely something I will make again.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I added about one cup of brown basmati rice to the black bean mixture and, instead of using the cilantro mixture as the sauce, I added one cup of this to the black bean mix.  I also added a can of diced jalapeños to the mix for some heat.  Very flavorful, will definitely make again!

This was pretty good. I'm always looking for vegetarian options, and I may make this again, but I would use 1/2 the cilantro and corn tortillas. I also only used 2 oz of cream cheese and it was plenty. I went ahead and used flour tortillas against my better judgement and the texture was strange for dinner and really weird and inedible for reheated left overs. The filling was good though. I did only use 1/2 cup cilantro because once I had rough chopped it, it was only 1/2 cup and I had no more. I love cilantro and I found it to be almost overpowering in the sauce. All in all, I will probably make these again, but with the changes I mentioned.

The only alterations I made were flour tortilla's (I will definitely use corn next time) and whole black beans instead of refried. Everything else was exactly per instructions including the toppings and they were delicious. Thank you!

I made these for some friends and we all LOVED them! Will be one of my favorite dishes to make for sure! I used a can of black beans drained and rinsed along with the re-fried beans and used  the shoe peg corn.Was great with fresh guacamole.

Delicious! Will definitely make again soon. Hubby thought the cilantro taste was too strong but that's just a personal preference. Will cut it in half next time.  We used low fat cream cheese and cut the amount of cheddar in half to cut some calories and I don't think this affected the flavor at all...yum. :)

This was really good! My husband rarely rates my vegetarian fare higher than a 6. This got a 9 out of 10! I used the juice of the entire lime, otherwise made as recipe instructs. Will try leftovers out on the toddlers tomorrow.
