My goodness this stuff is good and addictive. I had fragments of each of these ingredients hanging around so I whipped up a mini portion to put them to use. I did use my own measurements as written in the notes but stuck to the ratios of the ingredients. I used vegan bouillon with nutritional yeast instead of beef. The aroma alone will entice you. I put it on baked tofu and it stole the show. There isn't one particular taste that stands out. It is simply a mix of flavours that accent the chile peppers. I used scotch bonnets for the principal peppers and added a large piece of a roma tomato. I can see where this would go well with everything. Definitely a staple to have around the table. Thank you Shilo for this recipe.

I know the recipe says beef bouillon, but I actually use chicken. You can use any type of bouillon you like.

Delicious way to use end of season over abundance of habaneros and santa fe  peppers.  No dates but dried cranberries as substitute did great.  Keeping it fresh too.  Tasted so good I thought cooking might mess it up.  Will not last too long at my house.

My son is from West Africa and pepper sauce is a traditional sauce there. I left out the dates and added a little fresh ginger root. Turned out great!

Yes I will make it again /substituted a fourth of a teaspoon lemon pepper and two tbls of white vinegar instead of lemon juice. I used pitted plumbs instead of dates and used half the amount of chili peppers. I reduced the oil on my second batch to 1/3 cup of smooth olive oil

Great recipe Shiloh, thanks for posting. As you suggested this is a fun recipe to experiment with. Each time I make it I change the ingredients a bit but never stray too far from the basic hot/sweet combination. It's always been very enjoyable and gets positive comments from everyone who tastes it.

This was very tasty!! For me, as-is needed a few things. And its Feb so peppers are obviously not in season. Im sure with peppers straight out of my garden it'd be better. 

For me it needed vinegar, a few more dates and a squirt of mustard. I think roasting the peppers and onions before might be a delicious addition as well!

Outside of that I loved everything about it!!! Looking forward to dialing this in over time. This flavor would go with almost anything!

It was AMAZING. I doubled the recipe, used Santa Fe Grande peppers instead of chili peppers because I'm a wimp, and threw in a couple extra dates and an extra garlic clove or two. Used Minors Beef Base instead of beef boullion because that's what I had on hand.. It's wonderful on rice and beans, or on anything that you just want a yummy condiment. I'll make it again, maybe with a slightly hotter pepper or two thrown in.  Reminded me a bit of HP steak sauce but without the hint of vinegar.

Love the taste. I bottled and shrink wrapped 2 bottles. How long will it last if not in the fridge? Kept 2 out to eat myself lol, gifting the other 2 to fellow hot sauce lovers. And I doubled the pepper count, I like it hot!
