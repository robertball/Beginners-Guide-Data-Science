I make this all the time and usually dont have time to do it overnight, so if you are in a hurry add about 2 tablespoons of butter and microwave for 1 minute.  The addition of butter seems to hold it all together.  Also I add about a teaspoon of rosemary to it.  Wonderful recipe if you like basalmic vinegar which I love.

This IS delicious but I recommend making the seasoned Balsamic Vinegar in advance, holding back the extra virgin olive oil until ready to serve. For each 3 teaspoon serving of seasoned vinegar add 4 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil, not necessarily mixed together well.

Great recipe.  Been looking for it after I had it at a restaurant.  Its great if you add 2 to 3 tbsp of parmesan cheese in the dip as well!

I loved this recipe!!!  I had a dinner party, and I should have only served this!  Everyone ate this dip with warm bread, and were so full I had to give everyone their dinner to go.  I did not change a thing!! It was perfect!!  Make sure you let it stand in the refidgerator, the longer it sat, the better it was.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I have used this dip not just for bread, but I have mixed it in with tuna instead of mayo in sandwiches. My favourite use is to mix it in with cold wild rice with a sprinkling of feta cheese for a yummy cold rice salad.

Fab-u-Lous! I made this dip over the weekend and served it with some french bread and everyone ate it up. In the past,if I saw an oil based bread dip at the store I usually bought it to try. I won't be buying it anymore, this was the best I ever had. YUM!

THIS IS GREAT!  I have been buying the special oil and pre-made spices at a gourment store and this is WAY better. I always have this ingreidents on hand, so it a fast and easy appeitzer.  I cut the recipe in half for me and my husband to have with a fresh loaf of bread and  bottle of wine.  LOVE IT.

I wouldn't describe this as even remotely 'spicy' but it is EXTREMELY good nontheless! I agree that it really is worth letting it sit in the fridge overnight. I would be interested in adding some chopped sundried tomatoes, just like the bread dip at our favorite Italian restaurant. Thanks so much!

Way to much balsamic vinegar.  You need to roast the garlic slithly, also.  Johnny Carino's is the best and it has the roasted garlic in it.

I couldn't serve this. The vinegar was so overpowering.  The olive oil got lost.  With olive oil's price these days, I kept it to be used maybe for chicken.

I tasted bread / olive oil dip at a restaurant years ago, and have been in love with thiscombination ever since. Tried making my own oil, but somehow it just never turned out or tasted the same. This one does! So good, and just seems to soothe the soul. Then I had a big plate of spaghetti with sauce. Doesn't get much better than that!

We liked this on crusty French bread.  I was only able to make this about 4 hours ahead of time, but it was still good.  I’d like to try this with fresh herbs just to compare.  I’m thinking it will even be better.

I brought this to a dinner party last night and served it with homemade french bread. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I made it the night before and refrigerated it. Noticed that it got really thick from refrigeration, but I added a dash more of oil and let it get to room temperature and that solved the problem

Fantastic!  My new favorite snack!  I would suggest refrigerating in advance as the recipe states, but take it out of the refrig a bit before serving and let it come to room temp, otherwise it is very "sludgey" - almost too thick to pour.  Once at room temp, it is fabulous!  I am keeping leftovers (not that there was much), on the counter next to some yummy Italian bread.

Really yummy! Warning though, it is very strong flavored. If you don't like really tangy stuff, you won't like this. If you don't mind something with a little pow though, it's great! We paired it with the "Italian Herb Bread" recipe, and the flavours were wonderful together!

Perfect bread-dipping recipe. Balsamic vinegar ratio was just fine. I made mine days ago for a gift next week. The aging mellows the flavor wonderfully. It's a keeper. :-)

I mix all of the ingredients together in a sauce pan and bring them to a boil for a couple of minutes. Then once it's cooled I put it in the refrigerator overnight. It really draws out the flavors!!! Love this

Very nice.  It makes more than I thought it would--for some reason, I thought it would be a small amount, but I ended up with a bowl and a small jar.  Bf wasn't sold--he thought there was too much vinegar--but I liked it in small doses.  I think I might take a few reviewer's comments to heart and use the leftovers for tuna salad or maybe salad dressing.  I am not sure I noticed any difference between eating immediately after making versus refrigerating, but it's good.  Goes well with bread as an appetizer for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Although this was quick and easy to put together it lacked real FLAVOR. I was waiting for the "spicy" to kick in. It didn't. If you're looking for that you must add red pepper flakes.  Maybe it's just me as I prefer bold, full body  foods. I doubled all of the dry ingredients and refridgerated over night then brought to room temperature, as suggested. It was pretty to look at :) It's nothing special, unfortunately but it served it's purpose as a basic bread accompaniment. Will not make again.

This was easy to make and tasty, but there is more vinegar taste than I prefer so I would add about 1/3 more oil if I were to make this again.

Who needs butter??  This is absolutely delish! I followed the advice of others and used the microwave trick, cuz I didn't have the time to let it sit.  I also didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used some good red wine vinegar and added some balsamic glaze. I also added some finely chopped sundried tomatoes.  My family loved it more than my pesto chicken I made as the main course!

Very good! I would call this Herby bread dip rather than Spicy, but I did end up adding a few chili flakes for heat. Went great with Como bread, fresh tomatoes and basil. Thanks for the recipe!

I made half the recipe and served it with focacia bread. It was so good. If you like balsamic vinegar you'll like this. Thanks for the recipe, Janice.

While this had good taste, the amount of herbs in it looked like sludge at the bottom of the container, and overall I thought it was too much.  Even when poured on a bread plate it still seemed like too many herbs.

Out of all of the dipping oil recipes that I have tried, I like this one the best. It has a nice easy flavor without being too vinegary tasting.

The perfect companion to crusty bread, and definitely tastier than just butter! Really easy to make, too. A regular in our house.

Excellent! I didn't put in the garlic as raw garlic doesn't always agree with me. I didn't have time to let it sit overnight, but I'm sure it'll be even better tomorrow. I ate this with the NY Times No Knead Bread recipe. Amazing! :)

Would have given this 5 stars, but I used half the vinegar and added rosemary. Spectacular sauce. I made French bread for it, and the experience was other-worldly. Immediately disappeared. Will be bringing this to parties.

Ok recipe. I'm not a huge fan of oil and vinegar to begin with, but this seemed too oily to me and also to my dinner mate (who is a connoissuer of oil and vinegar). We added more vinegar to make it better.

Okay I just made this. Since my husband is at the store I asked him to buy and underbaked french bread (so i can make it nice and hot and crispy in the oven) and try this recipe. Hubby loves oil and balsamic vinegar ever since we had it at a very nice Italian restaurant on our honeymoon 3 years ago. He always asks me to buy some. The one he had at the restaurant was just simple oil and vinegar. He will love this with all the garlic and herbs. I tried doing it the way another reviewer said and added butter and microwaved it for a min. It got a little cloudy. I dont like it like that. I put it in the freezer for a few minutes and took off a weird colored stuff on top afterwards. But I tasted it while warm and i think it will be perfect when it is cold.

Followed recipe exactly and then used on turkey subs and roast beef sandwiches. Flavor is great as written. It's not "hot" spicy at all, but it does taste great as is. Excellent recipe. Thanks!

Very good.  I agree with another reviewer the oregano seemed to make it bitter.  Maybe a little rosemary instead?  I also grated the garlic so it would be very fine since my knife skills aren't the greatest.  I love this basic concept and will definately keep playing with it. UPDATE:  I made this again with rosemary (much better) and I cracked the cloves of garlic and put all of the ingredients into a squeeze bottle so I could just shake it up and squirt it onto bread without getting chunks of garlic/herbs.  It stores well in the fridge this way too.  Just not as fancy for company.

Wow this is SOOOO GOOD! I actually didn't even have any balsamic vinegar, so I just made it with the oil, and I put a little extra garlic in there. Excellent!!! This will be a regular in our home.

This is pretty good.  I may add a little less balsamic vinegar next time.  Also, it wasn't spicy, just tangy.  Thanks!

This is a preliminary review, as I ate this immediately after combining the ingredients. I'll come back after the eight hours and revise.

I would not call this "spicy", as there is no "heat", such as in capsaicin. Instead, I'd call it "super tangy".

As some others have said, there was too much vinegar for my taste. I did go against my better judgment by using this recipe that calls for mixing the oil and vinegar. 

At restaurants, I've always seen the infused oil poured into the saucer, and then the vinegar, if any, is added. The vinegar and infused oil are not stored combined in the same bottle.

I poured a tablespoon more olive oil into my saucer, but it didn't make much difference in the taste. I also added a few extra shakes of coarse Kosher salt to my saucer, but that's because I like everything salty.

However, I did eat the entire serving, which was probably enough for 2-3 people, with my rosemary bread. It was more than passable, but I won't be making it again.

I wanted to make something where I could utilize all the herbs in my raised garden bed.  So this was perfect.  I used fresh rosemary, oregano, thyme and basil.  This tasted and turned out perfect.  I wouldn't normally put olive oil in the fridge so I left this out as well and it seems to be perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  For everyone that has considered using the fresh herbs I say go for it.  The taste is wonderful.

Good.  I have been making a dip like this for a while, I usually make it right as we're about to eat it, this time I let it sit overnight, and I don't really notice a difference.  It is vinegar-y, but we love balsamic.  I also added about a teaspoon of dried rosemary.

Sorry but this one only gets 2 stars. The Balsamic vinegar was very overwhelming in this recipe. I think I was the only one in the house that dipped into it more than once. Since I used very expensive olive oil I am going to try to fix what I have left so I don't waste it. Sorry but I was really dissapointed with this recipe.

Instead of using a jar, I made this in my blender for a fast mixture that kept the spices suspended.  When I first tasted it I was like... 'yow, too much vinegar!'  I added some more olive oil and a bit more garlic and pepper.  I am using it with dinner tonight.  It has sat for an hour, and now I really like the flavors.  In fact, I'm writing this review to keep myself busy so I don't go back in the kitchen and take another taste!

Awesome dip! Made it for a dinner party we had last night & it was a big hit!! Lots of requests for the recipe. I followed the recipe & it was SOOO yummy! I let it marinate overnight & I think that really helped everything blend together & the taste was just amazing! Thanks for a wonderful recipe! We will be repeating this one for sure.

Gave it a 3 because of the strong balsamic taste. We're going to try once again with only 2T & see if that helps. You couldn't taste the flavors of the herbs because of the strong balsamic taste. Just ok as is.

What a hit for a party!  Fabulous flavors.  I made this 24 hours ahead & served it with fresh vienna bread. I did put it in the blender right before serving to make it a creamer consistancy.  This is a keeper!

Let me start by saying it was delicious! I had it with the garlic onion focaccia recipe on this site and it was to die for! I haven't been able to do dairy lately (have a new baby w/a sensitive tummy) and have been craving pizza, cheesesticks, any thing similar. This definitely filled that crave-thanks!

Since this was the first time making this I halfed the recipe because of the expense of virgin olive oil.  I didn't have the time to let it marinade in the fridge so I did as another reviewer suggested and added some butter and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds.  This helped to blend the flavours much quicker. I used balsamic vinegar but it wasn't aged.  Next time I think I'll use a little less.  I forgot to add the ground pepper; but it was still good.  I think I'd add a little red pepper flakes instead of the ground pepper.  I think this was very good and needs just a little tweaking to make it excellent.

I made this spur of the moment for dinner tonight and it was awesome, even though I didn't have time to let it sit for 8 hours.  I can imagine that it'll be even better when I follow the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this again very soon.

This is a really great & easy recipe.  It's a piece of cake to alter the recipe for however much you need.  Since other reviewers said this wasn't spicy I added about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and it was great!

This was pretty good. I made some french bread rolls to go with this and everyone really loved the vinegar/spice part but thought there was too much oil. People used the extras on top of their salads as a nice dressing.

This dip is wonderful; I didn't have any basil, but even without it it's 5 stars!  I served this with easiest foccacia. I will be making this often!

Not what I was expecting!  Look at the ratio of olive oil to vinegar.  This is just oil and vinegar dressing.

This recipe was very good, however, the balsamic vinegar was a little overpowering.  Next time I will probably cut down the amount of balsamic vinegar by 1/2.

This was good, I used fresh herbs but the Oregano made it bitter.  I think I prefer just oil & vinegar though.

I've served this recipe several times and it is fantastic!  My husband doesn't even like balsamic vinegar usually and he loved it.  It does have a balsamic taste but it is really tasty and easy to make.

Our whole family loves this! It is definitely tangy but you can just cut back on the vinegar to suit your taste. This is really good for salad dressing as well.
