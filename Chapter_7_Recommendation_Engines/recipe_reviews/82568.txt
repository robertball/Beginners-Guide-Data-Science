This is one of my favorite comfort foods. We had this growing up, only with raisins and brown sugar. Like you would with oatmeal. My kids love it, too. Try it for yourself. It's a great way to use up leftover rice from dinner last night or takeout that you just didn't get to. NOTE: This is also good with maple syrup.

With recipe found, I thought about my mother-in-law who perfected a rice and milk breakfast similar to this. Maybe my taste buds work differently than others as I found Nonei's recipe to be bland. Cloves were strong smelling in the zip-bag, but didn't add much taste to the cooked 'cereal'. Ended up adding 1 Tbsp white sugar - something was still missing, but didn't know what so left well enough alone. Printed recipe 4/6/09 and made 1/10/10. Didn't see 2 reviewers comments until I came on to put my '2 cents worth' in. If I make recipe again, I will cook rice same morning as I fix the "cereal". Rice was fluffy when cooked the night before. Refrigerating rice caused rice to be hard; it did not soften in hot milk. Instead of using microwave to heat milk and rice, I heated mixture in my double-boil pan - use it in making other hot cereals and it works great. Thanks for the opportunity of making this recipe.

So easy if you use leftover rice.  (I probably would never make rice specifically for this.)  It has a rice pudding feel but healthier for breakfast.  It was good, but next time I will try brown sugar or maple syrup to sweeten to give it an even more breakfast like taste.  Be careful using the microwave.  I should have known better-- mine spilled over the sides at a little over 4 minutes.  Next time I'll stop and stir halfway through.

I made this for my youngest son (age 5) who, like me, adores anything made with rice.  I used Jasmine.  We enjoyed this with a pat of butter added in.  FYI, if you have a newer microwave like mine with high wattage DO NOT leave it in the microwave for 5 minutes.  In my microwave liquid boils in 2 minutes.  If I left milk ccoking in there unsupervised, I would have a huge, stinky, boiled over mess in way less than 5 minutes!  The rice is already cooked, so just watch it and take it out every minute or so, until you have the consistancy you desire!  :-)

Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!! My husband's mother used to make this for him when he was little with left over rice from the night before and it was wonderful to do it again. I really like the idea of nutmeg, and was sad we didn't have any, but it still was really good. Little changes I made were: did half white sugar and half brown sugar. And while I don't think it needs it, my husband's family adds about a T of butter, while I like adding a handful of raisins. YUMMY!! :) Thanks again!

My family really likes this recipe. My great grandma served it to me when I was little. The only difference we did was serve the rice hot with cold milk. It causes and interesting mix of both hot and cold, IF you eat it quick enough before the milk warms (which I like to do).

I have never eaten this type of food before now so I don't have anything to compare it to (like  the other reviewers) I love it. I did follow advice of another reviewer and used brown sugar and rasins. But It would taste good without. The kids love it. I am glad I finally tried this.

I have been making this for years! I always have pumpkin/apple pie spice on hand, which is essentially this mix of spices. The only differences between this recipe and what I make is that I use leftover rice, a little bit of butter, and I cook it in a pan on the stove. I mash the rice a little with the back of the spoon while cooking and it incorporates the starch from the rice into the milk. You can add fruit(i like cooked apples, my nephews like raisins or pumpkin puree) to personalize it for everyone.

I just made this and it's exactly what I was looking for! I bypassed the "making the rice" step as I had 2 cup cold, cooked rice in the fridge, added 1 cup milk, microwaved (stopping and stirring regularly). I did add 1 tbsp fine rice flour (with a little milk) to thicken it (as I like a creamier consistency). The spices were perfect. Added a few craisins, too. Mmmm! I will definitely be making this again and again.

I loved the concept of this and the fact I could put it together quickly in the morning, but I found it to be very bland.  I am trying to cut back on fats and sugar, so I didn't add butter or sugar even though I am sure that would make it taste better.  I was disappointed and might make it again, but for now I won't.

I had leftover cooked rice and was looking for something easy that tasted like rice pudding. This recipe is perfect. I love that it has directions for making it in individual servings. I did use brown sugar instead of white, and added raisins to the rice and milk before I cooked it. So easy and tasty!
