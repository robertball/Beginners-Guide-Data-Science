I made this for 2 people using 2 sausages and fairly closely followed the recipe. I didn't use beer, I used a white zin. I also used less olive oil and broke up 1 Tablespoon of butter for the onion. For a thicker sauce I added 4oz. sliced, cooked white potato. To help the sweetness of the 2 (granny smith) apples (based on the other review of this recipe) I also added  4 oz. sliced, cooked sweet potato. No additional sugar was necessary.  You really can deviate at this point and spice it up with Worcestershire  sauce or Sriracha sauce or even a Teriyaki. My husband liked it and said he'd eat it again. That's really all I'm looking for. Thanks.

This is a very good German dish, something my grandmother would have liked.  The only difference I did was add a little more onion. Very easy .

Delicious, fast and easy. I tripled the recipe, putting the sliced apples, onions, 2 cans of Bavarian sauerkraut, and apple cider (sub for beer) in the crockpot to warm while I browned the brats. Cooked on high for 3 hours. Served with brown rye bread, whole grain mustard, and cucumber & sour cream side dish.  This will be an October tradition!

Delicious!  Used one apple and 1 bottle of hard apple cider for the beer because that's what I had on hand.  Two bottles seemed too much and as it turned out for me, probably could have just used a half of  bottle because I still had plenty of liquid after simmering for 1 hour.   Removed the sausage and added 2 Tbs. of brown sugar and  a pinch of salt and cranked up the heat for a few minutes to reduce to a syrup for the apple and onions.  Wow!  Yummy!  Considered adding  a dab of butter but it didn't need it.  Wished I'd had a second apple like the recipe stated. Will do next time.

The brats were tasty, but I'm not sure the apples really added anything. We enjoyed these, but next time I'll skip the apples.

My husband and I loved this recipe! Made it exactly per the recipe and it was delicious! I wasn't sure I would like the onion/apple/need combination, but it was really tasty, kind of sweet/savory. Don't think I will ever do plain brats again!

Used an apple ale instead of beer. Also, I used granny Smith apples. I waited to add them at the same time as brats. This left a little textuue instead of mush.

I used an IPA beer, so added a couple of packets of sugar to take out the bitterness. I also had a leftover baked potato, so I  sliced it up and added with the apples and onions.

I don't have beer in the house so I tried substituting beef broth.  It was okay, but next time I'll have some beer to use.  I think that would make the flavor much better.  It was good as is, but the broth overwhelmed the apple sweetness.

Yummy! Have made this twice now. Almost never have beer, so I used a can of chicken broth both times. 2nd time I added more apple and onion-and a healthy sprinkle of dried rosemary. Good alternative if you don't have beer.

I didn't love it, but I also am aware of two issues I would have done differently. First, my grocery store only had pre-cooked bratwurst - thus, there wasn't any of that added flavor for browning meat. Second, I made it with a stout beer - if I did again, I probably would pick a lighter beer.

This is so easy and so simple...it was a big hit!  I used cheddar brats, perfect idea.  Also, since I live in Belgium, I used good Belgium brown beer...really a great idea.

Not usually a fan of bratwurst but this was great!  Only change was used water instead of beer.  Topped with honey mustard and served with a green salad. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe. I made it like it said and was really good.Brats are not one of my favorite meats but using the apples and onions and beer made them not so greasy.

I made it exactly as is - and it turned out awesome! Although I did use a lot more brats then it called for (I did twelve). The whole family totally loved it!
