I really liked these and they were pretty easy to make.  I forgot to buy "real" parmesan and had to use the stuff in the can.  I think it'd be better shredding the real deal.  Don't skimp on the red pepper flakes.  Next time I will use more than the recipe call for.

I really liked it simply as an alternative way to making Brussels sprouts.  Roasting really brings out a new flavour from boiling or steaming.  I didn't smash them though.  I tried smashing one but I didn't feel it did much so I just roasted them.  Cut them in half one time.  Delicious.  My new way to eat them.
