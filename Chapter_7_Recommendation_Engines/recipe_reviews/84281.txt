A good quick recipe, but is exactly the same as Eagle Brand condensed milk recipe for 7 layer bars, just with a fancy name...

I used a 9x13 pan for  the recipe and  layered the grahams in the full bottom and on placed grahams on top of the filling that was in a similar recipe. I used the frosting recipe for the smaller batch and frosted the top layer of grahams.Covered and refrigerated.  It was perfect, It is very sweet. (I also used white sugar.)
