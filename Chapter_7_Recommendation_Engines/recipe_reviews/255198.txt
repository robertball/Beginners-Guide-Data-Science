Delicious and very fancy looking! I used the smaller blade (as opposed to the larger one in submitterâ€™s photo), and the apple juiced up a good bit and clogged the blade. I believe the larger blade would alleviate this problem I had. Word of warning to those who, like me, prefer the smaller texture.

Absolutely delishes and a refreshing change from eating apples. I substituted almond "yogurt" for my medical issues and used cashews instead of walnuts.  I will definitely be making again. Even my granddaughter wants  more !!

It was very delicious and refreshing. I didnt have any Greek yogurt or walnuts so I substituted heavy whipping cream ( about half a cup) and almonds. The family enjoyed it and so easy to make with the spiralizer. I also used a red and green apple.
