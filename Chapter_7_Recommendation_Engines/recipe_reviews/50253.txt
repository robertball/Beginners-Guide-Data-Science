WONDERFUL!  i did two things differently - one was to add more almonds.  (the lT of butter was enough to accomodate another l/4 cup of almonds), and i added sugar to the butter.  gave the almonds a caramelized taste.

I substituted spinache leaves (which were on sale) and added some left-over roasted chicken.  I am super-picky about salad dressings, and this is definitely a make-again!  I think that the secret is finding really sweet strawberries.

Great recipe. When I make it I just throw in raw almonds or pecans. Whatever nuts you have on hand. I also use spinach sometimes. Instead of sugar, I substitute Splenda, and I use a light rice vinegar for the dressing. My family loves it.

I used raw walnuts.  Loved this!  Will use again.  So awesome!  Mixed spring mix with baby spinach.

Good. The dressing was better than I originally thought (after sitting), though there is quite a bit too much. I added yellow peppers because I had some - and would definitely do add-ins again. Thanks!

My family loved this strawberry salad and requested the recipe.  I will experiment with it as others have suggested when I try it again, maybe mandarin oranges, or fresh grapes.

Really good. Not FANTASTIC, but really good! Needed to add a pinch of Kosher salt after the salad was tossed though. I may try adding some shaved parmesan next time, or maybe mandarin oranges if I prefer to stay on with the "sweet" flavor profile. Was a great way to use some of the romaine from our garden & leftover strawberries we were almost tired of!

We went to a dinner party and I was suppose to bring a green salad.  This was a hit.  Presentation was great and tasted even better.  I only put half of the recipes dressing on it but it was still a bit much for our taste.  Next time will put less.

Really enjoyed this.  Would be great with goat cheese too.  I also used Red Wine Vinegar cause I didn't have Apple cidar vinegar.

Yummy!  The dressing was a little too sweet for me with the sweetness of the strawberries but still good.  Will make again!

This is such a easy and tasty salad! I used leaf lettuce instead of romaine, and sliced almonds instead of slivered. I also didn't chill the dressing, and it turned out just fine. My family really seemed to like this salad. Thanks for sharing!

What a refreshing salad.  I made it for the first time on Mother's Day and my entire family went back for seconds.  I decided to make it using splenda, toasted almonds in butter flavored Pam, tosses it over bagged spinach salad and sprinkled some gorgonzola cheese on it.  It was so delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe, it's a great summery-feeling salad.

Though I've made the recipe as is and it is very good, I prefer to make a couple of small changes - I use more almonds and add a sprinkle of sugar while they are cooking.

I also use just spinach leaves, or mix spinach in with the romaine.

The biggest change is that I cut the strawberries into small pieces - maybe about 1/2 inch and add half of them to the dressing in the fridge the last 1/2hr-1hr that it sits in the fridge.  After tossing the salad and nuts with the dressing, I throw some of the fresh (without dressing) strawberries on top when served.

I doubled the ingredients for the dressing and used about half and half olive oil and vegetable oil. I traded out the pine nuts for walnuts and used mini romaine that was pre-washed and ready to eat. I only let the dressing sit for 3-4 hours at room temp. Took it to my friends place for dinner and it was DELICIOUS!! I will certainly be making this again.

We love this salad! It is so delicious and tasty! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added a thinly sliced red onion  and added some freshly minced garlic to the dressing. I toasted my sliced almonds in a clean wok pan. I placed the dressing in the fridge for a couple of hours so that it would thicken up. It was really good!

This is a very light salad, perfect for summer time. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, splenda instead of sugar and omitted the butter. I just toasted the almonds without butter, didn't find necessary to add any.

I made this last night for mother's day with shrimp and pasta. It was wonderful. My mom, husband and I finished it off! It was a super lite dish and so easy. I will make this weekly during these hot summer nights.

This is so easy and so good!  It's great as it is.

We have a child allergic to nuts so we substitute chow mein noodles for the nuts.  I have made it with nuts also when the kids weren't home and it was great!

Also, I like to marinade chicken tenders or breasts in Kraft's Toasted Asian Sesame marinade/dressing and then bake or grill the chicken.  I cut it into chunks and toss with the rest of the salad.

I can throw it all together in  the morning, let the dressing do it's thing in the fridge all day and then come home and spend 10 minutes grilling and have dinner on the table.  We serve with yeast rolls or garlic bread.

very good. Took it for Easter dinner and it was a hit. Difficult to gauge the amount of lettuce. I served 16 and had gotten Dole precut romaine for 16 and had enough for 32!
