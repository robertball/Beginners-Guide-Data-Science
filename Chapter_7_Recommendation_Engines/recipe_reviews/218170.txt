i was really excited about trying this recipe - having lived in senegal and loved maffe and having seen an episode of top chef with peanut butter mashed potatoes, i thought this would be scrumptious.  sadly, i was a bit disappointed.  i think the proportions are off.  what i tasted seemed to be too strongly tasting of too many ingredients.  i could taste the peanut butter and the spices too much and things weren't married.  perhaps cutting back on those ingredients and letting the stuff cook on top of the stove for a bit longer?

We used fresh sweet potatoes because we prefer fresh ingredients. We had more than the equivalent of two cans of sweet potatoes. Despite this, half a cup of peanut butter is too much, it overpowered everything else. We plan to try this recipe again but with no more than a quarter of a cup of peanut butter, more garlic, and possibly a bit of cayenne pepper.
