Mgood start - I made some changes... I baked the wings on a rack in a 425 degree oven for 25 min., then flipped them and baked for another 20. Without a rack, they will sit in the grease.  I added an extra half teaspoon of Siriracha, half teaspoon of Chinese 5 spice powder and 1/4c. Honey to the sauce.  It's sticky, and very tasty! With these revisions, it's a 5 star recipe!

Very good recipe for a quick & easy meal. I'd suggest seasoning the chicken before applying any barbeque sauce (salt & pepper at the very least) and baking the chicken for the first 10 minutes without any sauce. Mine always seems to retain their sauce coating better if I apply the sauce after its started cooking. Love the addition of hot chili sauce!

The recipe was simple and delicious. The only changes I made was to salt and pepper the chicken before adding any sauce. I also basted both sides and covered with foil and baked 1 1/2 hours (at least). I removed from oven, uncovered and baked an additional 30 minutes. My husband really enjoyed!

These were ok. My husband didnâ€™t really like the hot sauce in the bbq sauce. Will make again, but will have to modify the recipe.

Because it uses bottled BBQ sauce (not from scratch). I don't find it too exciting.

The only difference I made was I broiled them on each side for about 5 min.  I like mine a little more done.  They were delicious!
