This turns blah burgers into a gourmet meal!  My husband and I loved it.  Like other reviewers, I added some oregano and basil in addition to the thyme, and I used a bit more yogurt to make them very moist.  I also ended up using crumbled gorgonzola (a type of blue cheese) instead of the feta, which had gone AWOL. (the gorgonzola was great, but I'm sure feta would be equally good) Since the burgers were fairly thick, we cooked them on low heat on the grill.  Served with the Greek Style Potatoes (which were excellent and easy to prepare) and artichokes.  YUM!

So Freakin' Simple It's Scary! I omited the thyme and added fresh oregano for a more traditional Greek flavour.

These were easy and good. However, I'm a little bit of a numbskull when it comes to the grill. Call it a female thing. My grill was a tad too high and I flipped them too early, so unfortunately, they broke apart a little bit. However, the taste was wonderful. When you make the patties, be sure to make each pattie on the thin side, otherwise you'll end up with a gi-normous burger that takes forever to grill. I'd make these again and I'd also try other types of cheeses, too.

I used ground turkey instead of beef and a George Foreman grill. 1.25 lbs made 3 large patties. It took MAYBE 10 minutes to prepare, and that included 4 minutes of defrosting time. So simple. Pretty tasty. Love the feta. LOW CARB. Keeper.

I decided to try this recipe because of how much I like feta cheese, but I was not at all impressed. Like another reviewer said, you could hardly taste the feta inside the burger. I also thought the thyme was a bit overwhelming. I make way better hamburgers than this on a regular basis, so I will not be making this recipe again. My boyfriend said he liked it, but he was putting BBQ sauce on it!

Nice spin on the burger. I used more feta cheese, added oregano, and would serve it with garlic-flavored sides.

Very Good - Great idea. Even the two kids who don't like burgers ate these ones. They were a little hard to handle during prep and cooking because they were so thin but the flavor was defintely worth it. Will make this again.

These were very tasty, however, we could barely taste the feta cheese in the middle.  Maybe I didn't put enough in, but then I was afraid of it leaking out.  Also, I tried to make the patties as thin as I could, and in the end they were still huge burgers.  It was nice for a change, but don't know if I'll make them again.

Very good! I decreased the tyme to 1/2 tsp. and added 1 teaspoon oregano. It is also good to use a mixture of half ground beef and half ground lamb. The butcher can grind the lamb for you. Then the burgers taste a lot more like gyro meat. I too added more feta per burger just because we love it! Don't over handle the meat and only flip the burgers once to keep them moist and not tough or dry. These are great served with Greek tzatkiki sauce and fresh sliced tomato, and Greek style roasted potatoes make the perfect side dish. ( Recipes for both are on this site )

This is a nice change of pace with the feta cheese. I cheated and used pre-formed patties that I get fresh in my meat section. You could really "Greek" this one up for a superb taste sensation!

Very very good flavor combination.  The burgers were really moist and delicious.  One note of caution.  Make sure that you cook them all the way through.  We had two dishes on the grill at once and so the burgers cooked a little too fast and weren't done all th way.  A keeper!!

This was really enjoyable.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Added a little bit of allspice and onion powder.  Used earlier feedback to use oregano.  Also, had crumbled feta on hand and mixed it in with the beef mixture.   Hubby cooked it slowly on the grill.  I made jasmine rice to go with it and tzaziki sauce.  Was a wonderful mixture off the bun.  Kids enjoyed them on the buns with a variety of toppings.  This is a keeper.

I loved this - can't wait to cook them again, so quick and easy the feta in the middle is really tasty, like Joan I used a George Foreman type grill - all the extra fat just dripped away & both sides cooked at the same time.

This had a nice "cool" herby flavor. I liked the cheese in the center. These were a bit dry though and needed some sort of sauce to go with them. I  thought these were okay but my husband didn't care for them so I probably won't fix them again. This was good for something different.

It was very good. I am not a fan much of thyme or as others suggested, oregano. I substituted Greek seasoning and served it over those really thin whole grain hamburger buns with lettuce and tomatoes. It was very good and a nice change to the regular burger. I get tired of regular burgers sometimes.

We really liked this as an alternative to the same 'ol burger.  I was worried that they might taste a little too "feta-y" but cooking takes some of the tang out of the cheese.  I sprinkled a little leaf oregano on top of the burgers as they cooked on the outdoor grill. We will definitely cook these again.

This is a very gourmet way to cook hamburger patties. I thought this was great and ate it with rice and peas. I used crumbled feta cheese because I did not have slice feta cheese available in my refrigerator. Overall, this is a great dish!!

These were quite good.  I did use mostly oregano as recommended by other reviewers, but did add some thyme too.

Super easy recipe to make - refrigerate the patties for about an hour before grilling to get them to hold together better.  These grill up easy in one of those small press grills.

Used 1 tsp Marjoram and 1 tsp of Thyme & added sliced green olives with the Feta the second time around and it was a huge hit with my 14yr old son.

Very good.  My husband even liked this one.  I'm sure this will become a family favorite.

Prepared in no time and really tasty. I prepared the typical Greek Tzatziki (Garlic-cream with cucumber) with it and it was great. THANKS

These were dry and flavorless. The addition of oregano helped some, but they could have been much better.

I LOVED IT! My hard too please boyfriend told 'to do it again' which is A LOT coming from him!! :-)) Absolutely 5 stars and a BIG THANK YOU Marlies for charing this delicious recipe!      I followed the recipe with two minor changes: 1. I added 2 Tablespoons Yogurt as was suggested by one other comment. Definitely a must for moist bifteki. And 2. I added 2 teaspoons oregano. Turned out excellent!!! I also have two tips: 1. Use aluminum foil to cover the bifteki while frying in the pan if you don't have a lit. It's what I did. And 2. 15 Minutes are enough!! OVERALL I have to say I was surprised how well the feta kept inside of the bifteki and everything just worked out beautifully!! :-) I made Greek potatoes to go with the bifteki and broccoli salad. Yummmm!

Not your plain old cheeseburger! This one we have made more than a few times! Pairs great with allrecipes.com's "Good for you Greek Salad" and "Greek Tzatziki". We love this recipe!

This is so delicious!  I also added oregeno and basil, and a little less thyme.  I also added extra yogurt to give it extra moisture.  Rather than a traditional burger, I used the Pillsbury french bread rolls as the bun... so good!!

This was just ok for me. I have a burger left, so tomorrow I will probably put some pepperjack, lettuce, tomato and onion on it and eat it that way.  Not bad, just not great.

This was good, but I think it was a little heavy on the thyme. Next time I will be a little lighter-handed. Still worth trying!

I sprinkled some oregano into the ground beef mixture and the feta cheese. They turned out juicy and delicious. I had no problems with them falling apart. We used mayo, sliced tomato, and sliced cucumber as toppings.
