I added asparagus to the vegetable mix and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I also cooked the vegetables with the garlic in olive oil in a frying pan. I used campanelle pasta and used two cans of cannelloni beans. I also used some 4s salt or season salt which gave a bit more kick. All in all it was a delicious meal and I will definitely be making it again. My entire family loved it.

Picky kids loved this, especially with cheese on top. It does need more salt/seasoning, to taste. Following other comments that this was too dry, I added an additional 1/3 cup of chicken broth, but found that the veggies wilted a bit more than I wanted. Next time I will try just sticking with the recipe. Easy midweek dinner!

I made the recipe as it was written and enjoyed it very much.  However, my husband did not like it at all.

Made this recipe as is and LOVED it! I was surprised because I thought it would be bland, but it really wasn't. My toddler ate it (well, not so much the broccoli :-D) and my husband said he would like to have it again. Plus, it was easy and fast!

I made it with extra Broccoli and Cauliflower and even my meat loving husband loved it and asked for more!!!   I used sharp cheddar rather than Parmesan simply because I didn't have any Parmesan in the fridge, it worked very well.

Not something I'll make again.  As others have mentioned,  there wasn't enough "sauce," and the dish was extremely bland.

Yum, great starter recipe! I modified for my taste - cooked raw shrimp with the broccoli and garlic, seasoned with 1 tsp Old Bay and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper, used water instead of broth, frozen peas and corn instead of cauliflower, threw the grated cheese in with everything else to make a thicker sauce. Quick easy and tasty, great weeknight dinner

I tweaked the recipe a bit based on other reviews. To make more of a sauce, I used the whole 14.5 oz. can of vegetable broth with about a half cup of heavy cream. I added flour/water paste to thicken.

It didn't have enough sauce.  Too dry.  Won't make it again.

I wasn't crazy about this - I thought it was bland. It could have used some additional seasoning - maybe lemon pepper? I also added about a cup of additional broth so it wasn't too dry. On the bright side, my six year old liked this, so maybe I will make it again.
