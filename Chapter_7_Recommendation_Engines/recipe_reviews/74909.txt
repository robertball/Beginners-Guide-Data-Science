This would rate 5 stars if it weren't for the fact the cooking time was off. 
This was a very tasty blend of ingredients, and was attractive to serve, but at 20 minutes the zucchini all but turned to mush. What a shame. I  would suggest checking this after 10 minutes, then adding a minute or two as needed until your desired degree of tenderness. Twenty minutes, I believe, would be way too overcooked for anyone. It lost both color as well as flavor, and the mushy texture is unappealing.

This one's gotten rave reviews from all my friends.  I also cut the olive oil in half, and add a bit more sesame seeds.  I find it works best to coat  the zucchini in oil, then sprinkle on the other ingredients and mix.

I added a can of black beans and a can of chickpeas to the recipe to make it a main dish instead of a side dish.  I doubled everything except for the zucchini and it turned out great.  The beans and zucchini were coated with a flavourful, crisp coating that my husband and I both enjoyed.

I really liked this, but feel the cooking time is off. I cooked mine at 375 for 10 minutes and 5 minutes on broil. They were perfect and absolutely delicious! The cayenne lends a nice bite. For a special touch, sprinkle extra parmesan after pulling out of oven.
Thank you for the recipe!

the zucchini was flavorful and easy to make. i used 2 zucchinis and the oil was a little much, so i'd cut back a lot on the oil next time.

Very Tasty!  I took the advice of others and reduced the olive oil, thank goodness because I thought it was too much even reduced!  I have made it several times and am using more sesame oil instead for the flavor and adding more cayenne for the kick.  The kids balk sometimes, but us grown ups love it!

Great idea!  My kids loved this but I did make some changes.  Instead of olive oil, I used two tablespoons of low cal Italian dressing to save on fat and calories.  My kids do not like sesame seeds so I left them out.  I baked them in a deeper dish instead of in one layer and, of course, that takes longer.  My kids loved it and so did I -- I will make this one again.  Thanks!

As someone who is really not fond of zucchini, I must say this was a very nice side dish.  I only used 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and the next time I make this recipe, I'll try using olive oil cooking spray instead.

The sesame oil flavor was delicious. I didn't measure anything and I must admit that I'm a sucker for pan-fried zucchini, so after baking it for about 10 minutes or so, I dumped into a hot frying pan for a few minutes. I don't think this recipe will serve 4.

I have had this recipe saved for some time, but only today got around to making it.  All I can say is wow! Fpr once I made practically no changes except that I sauteed it on the stovetop, not wanting to heat up the oven on a hot summer day.  I toasted the sesame seeds in the oil until very lightly browned and then added the rest of the ingredients except the cheese. I also used Jamie Oliver's Szechuan Pepper Herb Mix which I love rather than rather elderly cayenne powder.  The secret is in cooking the zucchini until just tender and then adding the Parmesan. Served with braised pork chops.  There was barely enough for two of us, so my husband was left with a scant spoonful (his fault for not coming to eat when it was ready).  This will definitely be a favorite all summer long, with the mounds of zucchini our garden produces :)  T

Good, but could have used a bit more flavour. Next time I'd replace some of the olive oil with some more sesame oil. Also, I wouldn't cook for 20 mins. Mine was perfect after 12 minutes.

WOW, this is GOOD! I doubled the recipe, but used only 3 TBS of the olive oil. I will try cutting it even more next time.  I agree with other reviewers that you only need to bake it for 10 min; maybe could have even got away with eight min. I love how quick and easy this dish is too.
**Made this again and accidentally forgot the cheese, it was still delish and nobody even noticed!

This was very good.  The only criticism I have with this recipe is the cooking time - way too long.  Even though I cut my zucchini into larger chunks, they were overcooked in 15 minutes.  I did cut the oil and parmesan in half, but kept everything else the same, well... except the number of servings - two of us polished off the whole thing without a problem.  Obviously we liked it, and I will definitely make it again.  Next time I think I'll bake this for 10 minutes and slip it under the broiler to give it a little more color.

Honestly, if someone offered me a plate of zucchini or a piece of cardboard, I would have to think about it; I am just not a fan of the veggie.  This recipe has changed my mind forever about that! I used less oil and only baked it for about ten minutes and then ran it under the broiler to brown it up a bit.  This is so good that I doubt very much that one medium zucchini would feed four people as the recipe states.

I used four small zucchinis sliced 1/2 inch. I did use about 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and about two tablespoons of sesame seeds, less olive oil and added some fresh chopped basil for extra flavoring. I baked on my stoneware baking pan at 415 since I was baking some chicken also. They browned up nicely in 20 minutes, and were the perfect amount of tenderness, not mushy at all. Very easy and great tasting, the little bits of crunchy cheese and sesame seeds were fantastic.

Loved the flavor and ease of this recipe.  I cooked ours for only 12 min and like some other reviewers thought they were still a bit too soft; however, I did have them sliced into 1/2" slices.    Would cook for 8 mins and then perhaps broil the tops to brown next time?  Overall an easy, flavorful recipe--thanks!

This was great, but I based on other reviews, I, too tweaked the ingredient amounts.  I used 5 zucchini, 1 Tbl. olive oil, just a pinch of cayenne (personal preference), and kept the other ingredients the same.  I baked at 350 on an ungreased cookie sheet for 12 minutes.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I give this 4 stars because of needed modifications.  The oil should be halved.  I made it as stated and it was WAY too much.  I also only cooked for 10 minutes and then broiled under high until golden brown.

Good, but too salty. I will change from garlic salt to garlic powder next time, or 50/50 them. Also, the cayenned pepper was warm (which I like). I didn't think that much would be warm, but my children did.

Not bad!  My husband was not expecting the mysterious veggie on his plate to be spicy, we both enjoyed that!  I cut the zuc pieces a bit large to make sure I didn't end up with green mush.  Never cooked with sesame oil before- I am going to try this recipie next time with more of it and less olive oil.   My favorite recipie for zucchini?  No, but a nice alternative.

These were quite good and easy. Cooked for about 12 mins. on 375 oven, then turned the broiler on for about 3 mins. I am always looking for new , easy ways yo make zucchini.

Kind of bland in my opinion. When I reheated the leftovers in the oven the next day I added another few tablespoons of parmesan cheese and that helped.

Made this with dinner tonight.  Thought it was very good. Mixed Zuchhini with crookneck squash for a good mix.

I decided to try a different way to cook zucchini. My husband still doesn't care for them :-( I reduced the amount of olive oil and cayenne pepper. I baked them 10 minutes and then broiled about 5 minutes. They cooked just right and had a very appetizing smell. Thanks!

I was not happy with the way these turned out. I doubled the recipe because I had 2 zucchini. They shrunk so much it only turned into 3 servings even with a doubled recipe. They were too salty and half of them stuck to the pan. I didn't spray the tray because the recipe didn't say to do so. I figured the oil in the recipe would prevent sticking. Did not help. I didn't like them but my mom and sister did.

I loved this! But of coarse, I love zucchini! I did some changes--I used 2 zucchini's and I'm glad I did!I didn't have any olive oil or sesame oil so I used the same measurements in Italian dressing and a herb and garlic dressing. The rest stayed the same. This would be great with any main dish. Yes

I can't even tell you how much we love this recipe; I think it is my favorite on this site!  We usually make waaaay more than the recipe calls for, tripling the oil/season mixture and using about 6 zuchs.  I use my slicer to slice the zuch into thin round slices and we spread it out thin on a round pizza sheet. After it bakes for 20 mins I put on the broiler and brown it up.  The thin slices get crispy and delicious!  We never get tired of eating this dish.  I think I could eat it every day!  I would rate this at 10 stars if that were possible.

The flavor was good but these were mushy and had a horrible texture.  The cooking time is way off.  Would not make again.

Great ingredients and flavors- bad directions!  If you cook these at 375 for 20 mins you will have SOGGY zucchini!  I would recommend 375 for 10 mins and a few mins under the broiler to get it browned.  Overall, a good recipe!  I'll definitely make it again, with the above adjustments.

This dish was excellent even without the sesame seeds (I didn't have any on hand).  I also substitued garlic pepper seasoning for the garlic and cayenne pepper.  It was just the right mix of spices.  Next time will try reducing the amount of olive oil a bit.  Definitely will make again.

This recipe was so-so.  Not great, not terrible.  While I did like the sesame oil and seeds, the only flavor I could taste was the cayenne.  If I make this recipe again, I will cut the cayenne.

Great way to make zucchini!  I used five zucchini so upped the other ingredients too.  Was able to spread it all out in a single layer on a large cookie sheet.  One zucchini is nowhere near enough for my family!

What a great combination of flavors. I am not creative and I dont know how to combine spices that work together and that is why I come to this website. I had just picked a zucchini from my garden this morning and looked at this webpage and this recipe jumped out at me. I threw in a handful of cherry tomatoes from my garden also. It made for a nice little lunch. It was so good and left my wanting more. Hurry up garden, produce me some more zucchini and cherry tomatoes.

WAY good!! Just watch cooking time. I don't like my zucchini limp. Sliced into rounds and cooked about 10 minutes or less, quick broil at end to brown tops. Really my favorite zucchini now, and so quick!

Really really excellent side dish- I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil, I didn't add cayenne (Kids) and I used a touch more oil- when I got it on the baking pan I sprayed some oil on it using the oil pump from pampered chef- can't stand PAM, sorry, but tastes like plastic. anyways this was very good and I will make this again!

I am looking for a crispy zucchini which this is not. I would make it again because it does have a good flavor. The only time I made it my changes were: 1/4" slices of zucchini, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 450 oven, bake 10 minutes, and broiled to try to make crisp. Perhaps the 400 oven for 20 minutes as the recipe says (rather that the reviewer's suggestions that I used) is the better choice.

So good! I did what other reviewers suggested and used way less olive oil.  I used about a tablespoon, but I think next time I'll use a bit less.   Also like other reviewers, I baked at 375 for 10 minutes, then broiled to give it a nice crisp top.  Yum! I stuck all ingredients in a small Tupperware and shook it around to get everything coated nicely.

This was good!  I had to cook it at 400 for about 20 minutes but maybe my pieces were a bit big.  I did need to use all the oil called for but I think my zucchini was larger than "medium" and I added sweet onion slices too since we love onions.  I did sprinkle a little salt since my I didn't have garlic salt just garlic powder.  A nice light summer dish!

We served this at our wedding and everyone raved! I reduced the amount of cayenne to appease all tastes. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the serving size is way off.  I had to use almost 15 pounds of zucchini (more than the adjusted recipe called for) for 40 people and still didn't have enough.

I liked the flavor, but did not care for the sesame seeds. The texture of the seeds really took away from the dish. I will make again, but just omit the seeds.
Thanks!

I was surprised how good these are.  They did turn out to be a little more mushy that I was hoping for.

This is really good!  I did cut the olive oil to 1 Tbsp. and used yellow summer squash instead of zucchini. Mine cooked in about 15 minutes.  Great flavor!

Absolutely awesome!! I did cut down on the oil and instead of red pepper I used 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning.  I followed the cooking suggestions of another reviewer and baked at 450 for 10 minutes with 1 to 2 minutes under the broiler.  I usually have lots of zucchini to give away but after I found this recipe I don't think I will be giving away as much!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this on the recommendation of a Cooking Friend, and it was great! I did use 5 small zucchini instead of one and kept the measurements the same for the rest of the ingredients; for us the amounts were perfect. I baked at 425 until brown & crisp. We loved the cayenne & the sesame oil additions.

This recipe has a nice blend of flavours.  It tastes nice with the zucchini (fresh from my garden;) ) I added fresh garlic (2 cloves)instead of garlic salt and reduced the baking time by only 5 min.  THX.

I used only the sesame oil, for flavor, and it was more than enough. 20 minutes seemed to long for me. It was too soft for me. I like mine more on the crisp side. Maybe stir-frying would work better.

My husband thought the cayenne taste just overwhelmed the flavor in this recipe.  If I ever made it again, I'd use only one Tbsp. oil & reduce the amount of cayenne.

OK, I admit to changing the directions,,, I couldn't see how 2 tb of oil would make something thin enough to toss and coat after adding all the other ingredients. So I mixed the oils, brushed the slices and tossed all the other items and sprinkled on top...
the zucchini was oily and unpleasant feeling. A little too much cayenne when made this way. Won't try again, I like just plain grilled zucchini w/a little seasoning sprinkled on, no oil and healthier.

This is absolutely fantastic.  It's my go to side vegetable now.  Like another reviewer said the cooking time was off. Cook only 10-11 mins, so it's not mushy.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I doubled the batch and am so glad because this was delicious! Did not alter at all, but did broil for a few minutes at the end of the cook time to get that delicious crunch.

I used 2 zucchini and put it on the grill in a veggie pan on a hot summer day.   I will make this again, but will add the Parmesan just before they are done to keep some cheesy flavor.  I used half the olive oil and 1/4 t garlic powder in place of the garlic salt.

My husband and I ate it all up. Did as other reviewers suggested and only cooked for 12 minutes. I think ten would have been good. Next time might cut back on the cayenne  (personal preference ). Great recipe! This is definitely going to be a regular .

Very good!  We like zing in our dishes, but the cayenne was overwhelming.  Will reduce it or use different spice next time. Would consider broiling a short time to crisp up or bake at higher heat.

When I first looked at this recipe  I thought the ingredient combinations seemed very weird. But, since I had all the ingredients, I thought what the heck - give it a try! So glad I did. Somehow the Asian and Italian oils and ingredients meld together to make a wonderful , crunchy vegetable dish.
Honestly, I don't understand the comment from " Most helpful positive review" on cooking 20 minutes at 400 degrees coming out mushy. I've made this several times and that never happened.

I've made this many times, with and without the sesame seeds and Parmesan, and using varying amounts of cayenne. It's delicious any way you make it. I think the sesame oil and garlic salt are the two keys to the dish's special flavor. I also usually halve the olive oil, as it turns out a bit oily for me when made as written.

I made this recipe over some spaghetti for a main dish instead of a side. Just a few changes: 2 zucchini, 1 1/2 times the oils and seasonings, no sesame seeds (we didn't have any), and freshly grated Romano cheese (again, we were out of parm). The cooking time and temp was perfect since the recipe was doubled. We also sautéed up some garlic in olive oil and tossed it with the pasta before topping it with the zucchini. Very yummy. :)

Sesame Parmesan Zucchini Haiku: "Way too much oil. Baking time was too long too. Squishy and greasy." So sad that our zucchini turned out to be an oily smoosh; guess I should've read the reviews about reducing oil and reducing either the temperature or the baking time. I prefer my veggies a little on the al dente side, but these zucchini slices were just way too mooshy for me altogether. I'd make again w/ all of the recommended edits.

Added to much oil, should have read the reviews. Added Cajun and baked at 400 for 15 then broiled for 4. Finished it off with frying a little and can't stop eating them.

This recipe was okay - I ate it but my husband wouldn't because it calls for too much oil. The seasoning is excellent, love the sesame seeds. Make sure you reduce the amount of oil in half.

This recipe was easy and delicious, and the flavor is a perfect complement for almost any type of grilled food.  I used 2 smallish zucchinis, and perhaps could have reduced the olive oil a bit, but the recipe is truly just fine as written.  (The liquid on the cookie sheet after baking is water from the zucchini, not exess oil.) We will definitely be making this dish again!

Did enjoy this and my husband really liked it, too. I did halve the oil, but otherwise followed the recipe. I really liked the Parmesan and sesame seeds combo. I usually love spicy, but in this case didn't much like the addition of cayenne. Maybe sesame and cayenne OR Parmesan would be more to my taste. Thanks for a great recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. The sesame and parmesan just didn't work well together.

This truly is a delightful dish.  Because I'm a Healthnut, I prefer to deminish salt intake & cut calories.  As a result, for this recipe, I cut the Garlic Salt and the Cheese in half.  In addition, I prefer my veggies on the 'crunchy side', so I only bake these for 6 to 8 minutes, and then broil them for 2 minutes for an extra added crunch.  I suggest that you mix the ingredients (except the zucchini) first, and then fold in the zucchini.  Lastly, many women know that 'hot spices' increase 'hot flashes', therefore, I only use a 'DASH' of cayenne pepper in this, and that is plenty.  All our guests (kids too) love the way I fix these.  Enjoy!  They are healthy and delicious!

I was so proud of myself for branching out with this recipe.  I have never been interested in eating zucchini, but I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  As a non-zucchini eater, I totally give this 5 stars.  I loved it, and will cook it again soon.

I used 3 zucchinis  and tripled the rest but did not use the cayenne pepper. Cooked for 10 minutes at 400 then broiled at the end for 5 minutes. Could not stop eating them. Might make smaller pieces next time as some one else suggested.

I'm not sure what went wrong - I used double the zucchini and all the same ingredients the same, but it was so spicy it was nearly inedible (and we like spicy food).  Might try it again, minus the cayenne - not sure what happened!

I thought this had great potential.  I used 6-7 smaller zucchini squash so I was not sure if this equalled 1 medium zucchini.  The rest of the ingredients/measurements I followed almost exactly, but I only added @1 Tbsp olive oil and I used lots of sesame seeds.  Next time will omit entirely and use only sesame oil.  I cooked for @15 minutes then broiled until golden brown.  Was surprised how well the flavors blended.  Will definitely make again!!!!!

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used only one tablespoon of oil and baked it 10 to 12 minutes, and it came out perfect. My husband even commented on it and snapped up the leftovers the next day!

This is really wonderful!  I followed others' advice and baked for only 12 minutes instead of the 20 minutes called for in the recipe.  I also doubled the recipe and it served 5.  A big hit!

I loved this so much that I couldn't wait to make it again.  Everyone loved it both times.  I am not "a cook" and it was so easy.  My only caution would be that if you are going to increase the recipe as I did the second time, use less oil.

This is by far the best zucchini I've ever had. It was the perfect blend of spices. I did use less olive oil and cut my zucchini into 1/4" slices. Then I baked for 10 minutes instead of 20. They came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So so good...

I really liked this recipe. The flavor is awesome. I also did not use as much olive oil. However, my zucchini was mushy in the middle. Maybe I cut the chunks to big. I baked at 450 for 10 minutes then broiled on high for about 3 minutes. Will make again.

I use 2 zucchinis, 4 tbsp. parm cheese, and the rest according to the original recipe.  I found the original recipe had too much olive oil, so this is what works for me.

Fantastic! This zucchini came out so good. I used only 1 Tbsp of olive oil and increaded the sesame oil to 1 Tbsp. Really nice combination of flavors.

Very flavorful and it definitely has some kick to it. I used two zucchini and baked at 350 for 15 minutes. After reading other reviews, I did cut the oil in half and it was plenty, even with two zucchini. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I am thrilled to find a new zucchini recipe.  I doubled the recipe and baked it at 400* on a baking stone. First for the 10 min. that other reviews talked about needing to do, then had to add the additional 10 min to finish cooking and they were slighting browned,l'dente and delicious.  I'm not sure if the difference was the doubling or the stone or that ovens heat differently.

Sadly, this didn't turn out as hoped, despite having read the reviews regarding mushy/soggy issues and adjusting the ingredients accordingly.  It turned out fairly tasteless.  Too many sesame seeds, too much oil, and wrong cooking times/temps - I don't think I'll be making this again, but thank you for letting me try it.

So easy and so yummy!  I didn't have the sesame oil, so I just didn't use any, I also didn't use a full 2T of olive oil, closer to 1.  I didn't think that it would work after I dumped all the ingredients into the bowl and ended up with a paste of sorts. I threw in the zucchini and mixed it up and was surprised that the paste stuck to the zucchini.  It did have a little bit of a kick to it, I'm a whimp, so next time I think I'll do less cayenne pepper.  My 3 year old and 1 year old loved it, I loved the sesame flavor!  Thanks for the recipe, I'm always bored with zucchini.

The only thing I would change is to reduce the garlic salt or use garlic powder instead. With the parm, it was a tad too salty for us. Other than that, we cannot wait to make again!!

The flavor of this was really good but baking in the oven didn't give me the parmesan cheese crust that I was hoping for.  Ended up finishing them in the skillet so next time I think I'll just cook the zucchini that way.  And probably won't add the sesame seeds next time either - I didn't think that they added that much.  It was the combination of the sesame oil, garlic, and parmesan cheese that made it so good.

This gets five stars with the revisions on oil amount and cooking time.  I minimized the spice, too, since we're not up for spicy food.  It was great!

Love these!  I used half the amount of cayenne pepper and there was plenty of kick.  Next time I make these I'm going to flip them over half way through.  One side was crunchier than the other.

This was ok, I think the recipe calls for way too much oil.  I thought it would end up kind of crunchy but it was just really soggy and oily.  The flavor was good though.

Nice flavor.  After reading reviews, I just watched the cooking time as I thought 20 minutes was way too long also.  I broiled the last minute or two and they came out perfect.  I would cut the oil down next time as I thought it was a little too much.  Hubby really enjoyed!

My husband and I thought this was great and he doesn't much care for zucchini.  Instead of the garlic salt I used minced garlic.  I tried the bag suggestion and I didn't care for it, it left to much of the ingredients behind.  I also added more Parmesean.

This recipe was very good. The only reason i didn't rate it a five was because of my own stupidity. The recipe was great but it really needs paired with a good red meat. I had it with almond rice and mango skewers (from this site) And it was too spicy! I love spicey food. But next time i think i will cut the cayenne pepper in half. But it was a great recipe!

This was a great recipe.  It might have been a little too oily so next time i will cut down on at least the olive oil.  I loved teh sesame and parmesean combination.  I will definitely be making this one again!!!

VERY good!  I may have added a bit too much cayenne (my husband's eyes nearly jumped out of his head) but after he adjusted to the heat, he loved it too.

I wanted the zucchini to stay really crisp so I stir fried the zucchini with all the ingredients except the parmesian cheese instead of baking.  Once done I added the parmesian and served.  My husband and I both liked it and we normally don't like veggies.  Next time I would cut back on the amount of olive oil.

Very tasty. 3 out of 4 family members commented on how good it was. I only cooked it for about 10-12 minutes and that was plenty. That kept it from getting mushy. Thanks!

I left out the cayenne (don't really care for spicy vegetables) and I sprinkled some shredded romano on top, which browned beautifully.  If you like this recipe, you've GOT to try it with asparagus.  YUM!!

I really like the cayenne/sesame mix - I thought it would taste too Asian with the sesame oil, but it didn't at all.  There were "too oily" complaints, so I just added more zucchini (4 instead of 1 zuc) and an onion (based on an earlier reviewer), so it was perfect amount of coating for all the veggies.  Will be making again.  I bet this would be great to cook on the grill too!

I tried the ziploc bag toss recommendation, and I think it's a great way to save a mixing bowl from the dishwasher.  Just make sure you leave out the sesame seeds because they stick to the inside of the bag.  I had to sprinkle more on top once I put the zucchini on the pan.  I altered the quantities of oil and spices as well as the baking time to suit my tastes, and I really liked this recipe.

My boyfriend loved this recipe! I like my zucchini to be a little bit firmer, so I cooked it for about 12 minutes. I sprinkled it with paprika before putting it in the oven to give the appearance of browning. It was awesome! Thanks Kathy!

I really liked this recipe.  My husband scarffed this one down and he doesn't even like zucchini.  As with other reviews, it did seem a little oily.  Will for sure make this one again except with a little less oil next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent!  I used 2 small zucchini, 2 small yellow squash and 1/4 large sweet onion cut into wedges.  The cayenne was perhaps a little zippier than I would have preferred but husband loved it!  Will definitely make again!

My kids loved this recipe and they aren't real big on zucchini.  I made it as a side with my Thanksgiving Dinner for something alittle different.  We felt that this recipe had a hint of an oriental taste to it which gave the meal a nice twist.  I will definitley do this one again.

This was tasty, but if I had made this with only one zucchini it would have been far too greasy. I made it with 5 and it was even still a little oily. I used fresh parmesan cheese and it tasted yummy with the zucchini.
