I added 1tsp vodka (actually strawberry vodka I had on hand) and just muddled the strawberries. Flavor is awesome. Just work on consistency. Fresh made was a bit too runny. Frozen was a bit flaky or hard, but still yummy!

I made it with 12 strawberries, 1 tsp. Vodka and a couple of drops of strawberry extract. It came out amazing. This will be my go-to strawberry recipe from now on.

The finished product was sub-par;  the recipe should have detailed how to better dissolve the sweetener into the liquid (with an electric mixer).  

There are much more detailed recipes on "how to" out there.

The taste was wonderful but, even though I followed the recipe exactly, the Swerve did not dissolve so the final product was grainy.
