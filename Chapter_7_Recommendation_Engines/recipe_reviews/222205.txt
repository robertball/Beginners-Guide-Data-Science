So, I did a a few subs on this. I think I made it more like Pasta Faxanadu! Instead of an anchovy filet (because, let's face it, yuck!) I used an Italian turkey sausage, and to avoid wasting most of a can of tomato paste (I had nothing else planned to use it in) I threw in a whole can instead of just a teaspoon. Vavoom! It was AWESOME! I made my own beans in the crockpot with some chopped red onion added in. AWESOME!!!

Loved it.  Easy and quick.  Anchovy paste and tomato paste both come in a squeeze tube and last forever.  Don't leave the anchovy; it gives a small nutty taste not fishy at all.  No one knows it's in there.  To add additional protein I cooked some ground turkey and threw it in. My German ancestors taught me to always have some kind of soup on hand at all times--not canned--and no one would go hungry.

Instead of opening a can of anchovies for this recipe, I used anchovy paste, so there was no waste.  It was deelish!

This is one of my favorite soups because it's so quick & easy!  I usually make 2 or 3 times the recipe because it is SO good on a cold night--or anytime!  Thanks, Chef John!  You're awesome!  Btw, I get anchovy paste & it keeps forever; it really adds a nice flavor!

Have not tried yet, but have a comment.  Like others, when I buy tomato paste of anchovy filets, I use a bit, then have to toss the rest when it dries out or spoils.  Try anchovy and tomato pastes that come in tubes.

I added everything but the anchovy fillet, this was super easy to make and I already had the ingredients on hand! Don't forget the red pepper flakes and Parmigiano cheese!

great go to recipe.  I like a more brothy soup so I cooked my pasta in boiling water then added to the finished soup.  Also, I didn't have anchovy on hand so used a small clove of garlic and used some left over marinara sauce instead of paste.

placed 3 cloves minced garlic in oil & sauteed and then 
I used 3 tblsp of tomato paste- instead of 1 tsp
I used a little over a tsp of anchovy past - not chopped anchovies
I used small Bertolli dry tortellini
I put red peper flakes in the soup - but it would have made a good garnish
It was getting kind of thick so I added about another cup of chicken borth at the end

I usually enjoy recipes by Chef John, but that dry tortellini was just disgusting. It's a shame really, because the rest of the dish had merit.

I was wanting white bean soup and came upon this recipe.  It was perfect because I had some frozen tortellini to use up (although they were spinach) and I had fresh spinach.  The soup fit the bill as a quick dinner but I don't think I'll make it again.  I'm not a fan of oregano but wanted to make the recipe as stated.  I'm not downgrading it for that.  I feel like the soup as is is just missing something.

I made this pasta Fazoolander soup and my husband and I loved it.  I did make some changes by adding  onions and carrots sliced very thin. Also, added extra spinach since it wilts.  
This is a wonder dish when you have to whip up something quick and easy.  From beginning to end it took 40 mins.

Great healthy supper along with a green quinoa salad. I had no anchovies, used leftover chicken instead. Otherwise made it as described. Delicious!

I made the soup without the anchovy paste. I used carrot, onion and celery into the pot w the olive oil for flavor, along with a bit of garlic. I also used one entire small can of tomato paste.  This along with the chicken broth and added basil turns the base of the soup into a 
Tomato Basil Tortellini Soup. Fabulous!!

I made this without the anchovy, and I added in some chopped tomato left over from another recipe along with the beans and tortellini. It was delicious and took less time to make than any other soup I have made. Very quick and easy. I would suggest doubling or tripling the recipe as you will definitely want more. The red pepper flakes give it a kick without being too much, and parmesan is good on most anything.

Very pleased w/ how my adjustments turned out. I had recently made a great seafood broth and used a lot of that w/ some unsalted chicken stock. I love celery/carrot/onion in soup and used refrigerated RANA cheese tortellini's. Garlic usually goes into many of my recipes and this was no exception. I also added a 1lb bag of TJ's Turkey Meatballs for added protein. Another lunch (or 3 after doubling recipe) for my 98 yo Dad.

I made this recipe as written except for using just a bit more tomato paste and anchovy, and it was great! It's so quick, easy, and delicious that I think this will become one of my go-to weeknight recipes.

I LOVE this soup, more importantly so did my husband. I did not use the anchovy, I did use the whole can of tomato paste, the whole bag of spinach (uncut) . I also tossed in ground turkey cooked with onions, garlic , pepper and adobo (from another recpie I was cooking) ,   and some Mrs Dash garlic and herb. It was filling and perfect for the cold night!

I love the name!  "Fazoolander".  I have to say, this is very creative.  I love the dry tortellini but they must be thoroughly cooked.  Next time, I will add some tiny meatballs too.  I like someone's suggestion for anchovy and tomato paste in the tube.  Good thinking!

This soup is so delicious, and filling! I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 tin of anchovies and used some of the anchovy oil. They dissolve into the sauce and add a lovely richness. DOn't be afraid to use them! You won't taste " fishy" at all. I also added some onions and garlic. Cooked everything in the crock pot except the tortellini and spinach.  I used fresh tortellini, threw it in and turned the crock pot to warm. When they were done I threw in the spinach and turned the crock pot off. Perfect!

Perfect weeknight recipe. I use anchovy paste instead of filet and rip the spinach with my hands. Don't even need a knife, but it still tastes fresh and satisfying.

Simple and tasty. I did add about 1/4 of a chopped red pepper because I had it in the fridge and wanted to use it. Otherwise,  no changes were made. The fact that it was a fast soup is also a bonus. I will make it again this winter.

Made this yesterday for the first time when we went to visit my father in law.  Since he's Italian and a big meat-eater I used keilbasa, browning it in the olive oil (the small local market didn't have anchovies!) and used 1/2 can of tomato paste.  It was a big hit, and especially nice on a very cold and snowy day (got down to -3!).  I will definitely make it again, I'd like to try it as written and also with some other minor changes.  Really good!  Even if the name is a little strange, Chef John...!

I read the other reviews and made these additions to the original one . I browned 1# of hot Italian sausage to a doubled recipe. I added  the whole 6oz can of tomato paste, the anchovy paste, minced garlic to taste(about 4-5 cloves) and a tbs of Italian seasoning blend . I omited the hot pepper flakes as the sausage added plenty of heat.  I  used 18 oz of fresh three cheese tortallini.  The whole family  gave it the thumbs up.

I agree with another rater that this was missing something. It  was great with the modifications I made, but I added things to satisfy my own picky tastebuds. Without the mods, it had a bland, empty taste. It needs more fat, more sweetness, and more salt.

This soup was really good! I made it for my friend while I was at her house. We ended up using black beans instead of white, added some cayenne pepper and garlic, and left out the anchovy - but we still ended up with a rich, hearty soup that was pretty easy to make. My friend said she would definitely eat it if I made it again... So I'm guessing she gives it 5 stars too.

I found that the ratio of liquid to the pasta was way too low.  I added at least another cup.  Perhaps the pasta I used contributed to the low rating I gave this recipe but on the whole it didn't thrill me.

If you buy tomato paste or anchovies for this and then don't know what to do with the leftovers, put them into plastic zip-lock bags and freeze the leftovers.  Then you can break off what you need, let it thaw and use it, and pop the rest back into the freezer.

I made this without the anchovy and with the addition of an extra cup of chicken broth and it was delicious. I also subbed Asiago cheese since we didn't have parm on hand and it was still great. This is a really easy recipe and although it is the middle of summer, didn't seem wrong for the season. This is a great, cheap meal that is still filling.

We loved this recipe. I took the advice of others and added Hot Italian sausage and the whole can of tomato paste. I had fresh oregano and basil that I added and wow, my husband made yum, yum sounds the whole time!
