Great, simple recipe.  I'm from the Buffalo area, and you can't have chicken wings without blue cheese.  So many of the recipes are just ranch, which is so wrong.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and added about 1/4 cup of crumbly blue cheese as well.  I have also used the canned chicken breast as a quick & easy substitute - comes out great.  I used a 12.5 oz can on the 1/2 recipe.  I've made it for 2 parties, and guest have completely devoured both times.

Like Christina, I've made many versions of this. My husband wanted one with a  more predominant "blue cheese" flavor so I chose to do this one. For me, it was overwhelming BUT I'm giving it 5 stars on his behalf, as he said it was his favorite and he thought the blue cheese taste was perfect in it. Next time I'll make it half and half, omitting that out of mine and putting it all in his. :D Thanks for the recipe!

Simple and delicious!  There are so many versions of this, and we haven't came across one yet that we didn't like.I halved the recipe, and topped the dip with more cheddar before baking. The family loved this~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
