This was wonderful! I can across the recipe while searching for recipes using grated ginger since I had just harvested some from the garden. My budget didn't allow me to add Cardamom or grapeseed oil (subbed EVOO) and I forgot the ground cloves, but it was wonderful and I'll make this one again!

I wondered if I would like this, after I took a look at the spices.  I tried it anyway, because I love ginger, and wow, this brings it!  Very pungent spices really zing up this dish.  I found myself sampling one slice, and then another, until I had "sampled" almost a full serving!  Beware though, I used only 4 large sweet potatoes, and they were more than a single layer in a sheet pan.  This recipe could definitely use a weight amount for the sweet potatoes, so use your judgment, or be ready to do two pans.
