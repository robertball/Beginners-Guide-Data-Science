Now that I've been making these muffins once a week for a few months, I figure I better update this review... First off, the recipe is easily adaptable to personal tastes or sudden lack of ingredients. Second, it tastes absolutely wonderful! (if you couldn't already tell from how often I make them...)

Changes I made: used whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the bananas because I utterly despise bananas, 1/2 cup of brown sugar somewhat packed, 1 cup of milk with vinegar, left out the oil, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp all spice, 1/2 cup of oatmeal, mixed frozen berries and Craisins. 

Things to note: The type of flour you use is very important. I learned this after buying some awful whole wheat white flour from Trader Joe's. It made my muffins all dry and tough. As soon as I went back to the whole wheat flour from Fresh and Easy, they were all nice and soft and moist again. If you're going to use dried fruit, remember they tend to suck up some of that moisture, and if you use frozen fruit, they tend to add moisture (It also make your muffins look a funny swamp green if you mix leaky red and blue berries into the wet batter. Better mix it into the dry stuff first if you don't want it to look gross.)

These are my absolute most FAVOURITE muffins! I ate 3 yesterday :) I do make some substitutions though, to *hopefully* make them a little healthier:

Only whole wheat flour (therefore 1.5 cups), 1/2 c brown sugar instead of 3/4 c white sugar, wheat bran instead of oat bran (it's all I had), pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference), applesauce instead of oil, and lemon juice/skim milk instead of buttermilk (put 1 Tablespoon lemon juice in a cup measure, fill the cup with skim milk - voila!)

I also add: 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg (YUM!) and 1/2 cup raspberries (in addition to the 1 cup blueberries). The raspberries make it SOOOO delicious!  I rip each one in 2 or 3 pieces to spread 'em out and prevent the muffins from falling apart.

I use this as my "healthy muffin base" now - and can't wait to try all sorts of additions.  Maybe next time it will be strawberries and apples?  Or raisins and carrots?  Maybe banana and chocolate chips? Blackberries and coconut???  The possibilities are endless!  (Although I would probably cut the blackberries into smaller pieces, like the raspberries).

For those who found the recipe dry.... try more applesauce?
Happy Muffining!

I enjoy baked goods and this is among my favorites especially because of its health value. But I will note that I changed a few things according to what was available to me and maybe better.

Changes: 
1) instead of all-purpose flour, I used whole wheat pastry flour
2)instead of just regular blueberries, I used wild dried blueberries and dried cranberries, waiting until the batter was in the muffin cups to add them -one small spoon of blueberries and one small spoon of cranberries (the amounts each covered a half of the batter's surface in the cup) -and then mixed the berries and batter in the cups (I used a chopstick for this) 
3) instead of using white granulated sugar, I used packed brown sugar in about the same amount as the granulated sugar, if not a little bit more. I did this to continue the theme of healthy ingredients and earthy flavor. 

The result was an EXCELLENT muffin that in my opinion is better than some found in restaurants. The muffins are sweet, fairly light for a wheat-laden muffin and has berry in every bite.

This is the best muffin recipe ever! I'm a baker and sell these at the cafe all the time. Replacing the banana for pumpkin and the blueberries for chocolate chips also turned out freaking awesome!!!

The picture doesn't do these muffins justice - mine turned out more like bakery muffins.  I increased the wheat flour to 1 cup and the quick oats to 3/4 cup in place of the germ and oatbran.  I also replaced half the milk w/ light sour cream.  I used large, frozen wild blueberries and didn't have a problem w/ the muffins turning green, which one reviewer mentioned.  My husband was eating these for every meal until they were gone and I am now sworn to make them again!  SO GOOD. * I made them again...  This time I omitted the nuts and added one apple, finely chopped.  Turned out great!

These muffins are awesome.  I didn't know what Wheat Germ or Oat Bran was or where to find it - didn't know if I had to go to a specialty health food place or not.  I found them at Kroger's in the hot cereal area.  These are not items I would normally have on hand...so I'm sure there are others out there asking 'what's Wheat Germ"  It's in a bottle and Oat Bran is a hot cereal in a box.  

These muffins are awesome!  Very moist.  I tasted more banana than blueberry in it.  I replaced the oil with applesauce...replacing it with the same amount asked for.  That's all I did.  Next time I would use 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg just for it to be a tad healthier.  Definately put the nuts in if you have them. 

GREAT RECIPE!!!

Amazing! I am so impressed with this recipe. I was afraid they would come out dry and "healthy" tasting but they are really moist and flavorful. I made a few changes based on preference and what I had on hand: (1) I subbed applesauce for the bananas, flax meal for the wheat germ, and oats for the oat bran. (2) I added a little more than a 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. (3) I used almost 2 cups of frozen mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries) and chopped them up a bit to make them distribute more evenly. These are SOOO yummy, I will certainly be making these again soon! Thanks for an awesome, healthy recipe!!

Yum!  The only changes I made were using strawberries (frozen, chopped) instead of the blueberries (what I had on hand) and applesauce instead of the banana.  Oh, and I made buttermilk by using 1/4t. lemon juice with the milk (I didn't have any bananas or buttermilk).  I used 1/3 c. applesauce for a half recipe and would probably reduce is just a bit next time.  These muffins are extremely moist - not chewy like the typical "healthy" muffins :)  Awesome and pretty easy to make, and what a wonderful way to use all the healthy stuff I keep on hand!  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!

Really great muffin recipe. As I am always looking for a way to use overripe bananas, this was a nice change from the usual banana bread. I have made this recipe multiple times.
Being an ultra health nut, I used all wheat flour, about 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the 3/4 white sugar, and 1 tbsp applesauce instead of the vegetable oil. I have also tried raspberries instead of blueberries, which are a nice taste addition, but loose their form more than the blueberries. Since these muffins are extra moist, I found I had to bake them about 10 minutes more than the recipe calls for.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would. This is the best muffin recipe ever. It's healthy, nutritious, filling, AND DELICIOUS!!! I didn't have oat bran so I used milled flaxseed instead. I used 2 small banana's, splenda in lieu of sugar and apple sauce in place of the oil. LOVE IT!!!!

Instead of white sugar, I use a raw sugar & sucralose 1/2 c raw & 1/4 c sucralose, grind old fashioned oats and make a flour and use only 1/4 c of A/P flour and the rest white whole wheat and oat flour to get your 1-1/2 cups, use applesauce & 1 tsp coconut oil instead of veg. oil. The taste is phenomenal.

I used cinnamon roll instant oatmeal and splenda. Those were the only changes I made. I did wisk together the dry ingredients, then gently stirred in the wet ingredients and the fruit. I did let the batter set for a bit before scooping it into my greased muffin tins. I didn't want them to come out tough. The smell of these in the oven was incredible. I was worried when they came out flat, but the end result was a dense muffin that also came out fluffy. I didn't try any but my family loved them. In fact, they ate almost the whole darn batch in one day. I'll make these again. NOTE: Using the 1/4 c. measuring cup is the perfect measurement to make a good muffin that won't overflow. For me, this made 18 regular sized muffins.

WOW! These are, without a doubt, the best tasting (healthy) muffins I've ever tasted! I'm a health nut myself so I switched a few of the ingredients. Seeing as the banana I used was quite large and very ripe, I omitted the sugar and added 1/4 cup of honey and the muffins were still perfectly sweet; I could have even left out the honey, but at the same time I'm glad I kept that little bit in. I used all whole wheat flour, used rice milk instead of the buttermilk, and added 1/3 of a cup of shredded coconut, which gave it some really great added texture. I will absolutely be making these again with my modifications. Thank you so much for the recipe! AMAZING!

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Very good muffins. I thought a little too moist because as the days went by I can best describe them as mushy. Still tasted great though. I made them today with no bananas and substituted skim milk for buttermilk. I like the substance of them much better. Plus, fewer calories! They are not dry at all.

This recipe is a great base to start from, to make them even healthier, I omitted the oil and replaced with a 1/2 cup applesauce, you don't need the banana if you use applesauce. I also used all whole wheat flour and no white flour, omitted salt and used cracked wheat in place of wheat germ (as I didn't have any).  I used wild blueberries that were fresh picked and also threw in about 1/3 cup fresh wild raspberries too (toss the berries in with the dry mixture before adding wet ingredients to eliminate "staining" of the batter). With the above modifications, these turned into an awesome tasting muffin that you can feel good about eating! Next time I will sub ground flax for the wheat germ....yum! Happy Baking!

Such a great recipe and so versatile! I am not a cupcake or muffin baker, but this recipe was a breeze.  I forgot the wheat germ on my first attempt and they turned out fine.  I took this initial batch on a camping trip with my bf's family.  They're still acclimating themselves to my healthier/vegetarian cooking style and a bit hesitant at times to try my fare.  I can proudly say they gobbled them up!  His mother took the leftovers home and asked for the recipe too :) I used cranberries and pecans the second time around and they were just as wonderful.  I plan on using different nut & fruit combinations each time.  I freeze a batch at a time, thaw 1 or 2 overnight, pop them in the microwave in the AM and enjoy my relatively guilt free breakfast.

These are the best blueberry muffins I have ever had. And I am like Mikey, I hate everything.
I added two tablespoons of flax seeds for the health benefits and added the whole carton of fresh blueberries. I don't find American style health foods to be very appetizing nor tasty. It is kind of like eating cardboard with shredded wheat added as the topping.
The two of us have snarfed down the muffins in almost 2 days.  These are GREAT.  
This is a moist muffin that is irresistible.  
This recipe made 12 regular muffins, 24 mini muffins and two mini bunt cakes.

These are delicious!  I made these exactly as stated except for the whole wheat flour I used white whole wheat flour.  They took longer to bake than the recipe calls for--about 22 minutes--but that could be because my buttermilk and egg were cold from the fridge.  These are easy to mix with a spatula.  Now I'm off to the store for another banana so I can make more of these!

Yum, yum, yum & yum. My family gets so excited when I make these. They are much richer and way more dense than a typical "cake-like" muffin. Crazy-healthy and crazy-good. So much so, I don't feel a bit guilty about the pat of butter I slap in top! ha. Thanks, Zopooh, for a healthy recipe my kids always much like little maniacs. :)

A-. Very good recipe. Made some modifications in order to make it even more healthy: 1. no buttermilk, used 1 cup of skim milk w/ 1 T of lemon juice. 2. used only whole wheat flour. 3. used only fresh blueberries 4. no oil. Used 3/4 cup of apple sauce as a replacement for oil and mashed banana. Result? Turned out awesome. Very flavourful and very moist. Must use fresh blueberries- if not, won't come out as the right texture. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe that contains so many "good" healthy ingredients and yet is very low fat and still manages to stay so moist and lovely.  I found it when searching for a recipe for blueberries and was very impressed!  This will be a recipe I use over and over again.  I made this recipe exactly as stated but I am certain it would work with other diced fruit equally as well.

I love this recipe! They are so good and perfect for the morging! I don't have to feel bad about eating them either because they are pretty healthy. I did make modifactions that Chickadee suggested. Used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (instead of using white flour and wheat flour), I used 1% milk with 1 Tblsp lemon juice (instead of buttermilk). First add 1 Tblsp lemon juice to measuring cup then fill the rest of the cup with milk. I also added 1 Tblsp applesauce (intead of oil) but next time I'm going to try 2 Tblsp applesauce to add more moisture. I also added rasberries as suggested, and it was amazing!!! I will be making these often!

A. Maz. Ing.  I LOVE these!  My whole family does!  My husband's first reaction was "These taste even better than the ones at (a five-star hotel)!"  Which up until now had been his favorite muffins of all time.  

I used only whole wheat flour, which I sifted a little first.  Then I used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. Stevia powder in place of the 3/4 c. white sugar.  Didn't have oat bran so I used wheat bran instead.  Didn't have quick cooking oats, so I measured nearly double the amount of regular oats into my food chopper and chopped them down to the recommended amount.  I omitted the nuts, used 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce in place of the bananas (as suggested by previous reviews), added a tsp. of lemon peel zest, and threw in an extra handful of fresh blueberries.  I've made these twice now, once with frozen blueberries and once with fresh. The fresh were hands-down the better (frozen lacked flavor).

I also made my own little topping of chopped pecans mixed with a little bit of brown sugar and melted butter and added it to the tops of the muffins before baking It was a really nice addition and made them look prettier, too.

I'm trying to lose a little weight and trying to eat healthier and originally I stopped baking entirely because I often had to "test" some things that just weren't good for me. But I've lost about 5 punds so far and I'm trying to adjust to find a "happy medium" of the two (because I really enjoy baking). and I have to say: THESE MUFFINS ARE AWESOME! I made a couple changes around what I had in my pantry, but over all they were great. (1) I used all purpose flour entirely instead of whole wheat (2) I used brown sugar instead of white and brought it down to 1/2 cup (3) I used almonds instead of walnuts (4) I used Crystal Lite Orange Juice instead of buttermilk (5) I used egg whites instead of the whole egg (6) and I used canola oil instead of vegetable. I also added some spices like cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and alspice. best part about this recipe? I only had to "test" one because all the fiber satisfied me instantly!! I LOVE IT. I'm SOOO gonna use this recipe in the future, I'll never be tempted by a brownie again! :DD

These are awesome! I completely omitted the blueberries and used all bananas. I used three bananas total. I left the recipe exactly as it is otherwise. I froze them and I take one out each night to go with hubbies breakfast every morning. Thanks for sharing!

We loved these!  Only substitutions I made were egg substitute (egg beater's) and I thinned some soy sour cream with soy milk for the buttermilk.  The oil was subbed with liquid lecithin.  I topped with Fruit Pie Crumb Topping from this site.  Thanks ZOPOOH - these were a hit!

I just made these and they are delicious! I used wheat bran as I didn't have wheat germ, and I didn't have buttermilk so I used that other suggestion of skim milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice. I will make these again, and again! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe....I know it's a keeper when even my hubby loved them :)

Yum!  The oats and wheat germ along with the ww flour make these muffins more hefty than other blueberry muffins, and I like that heft.  More filling than regular muffins!  These are easy and very delicious.  I think, however, that I won't fill them as high next time--they don't puff up, but sort of remain flat, so I had to scrape part of the tops off the muffin tin.  Otherwise, very good.  had to bake an additional 10-15 mins.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are so moist and yummy! I feel like its a meal in itself!
I made a few changes: used dried cranberries instead of blueberries, slivered almonds, all whole wheat flour, halfed the sugar and added 2tbsp of honey and they were plenty sweet.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's delicious, but keep in mind that I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand. I substituted flax meal for the wheat germ and used wheat bran instead of oat bran. I also used soy milk with some lemon juice rather than buttermilk, and I doubled the blueberries. I would suggest NOT doubling the blueberries, although 1.5 cups would probably be good; mine had too many and you can't taste the delicious muffin part enough. I used a just-ripe banana, and the taste was not at all overpowering. It also took me 20 minutes to bake them. But overall they are absolutely delicious muffins and I will most definitely make them again. I think this is my keeper blueberry muffin recipe.

When I want a healthy blueberry muffin this will be it.  These are nice and moist and with extra nuts and blueberries added you get some in every bite.  I think adding some grated lemon peel or more vanilla would make this muffin better.  Thanks for sharing, ZOPOOH.

This recipe is such a great find!  I have been making these with m leftover bananas for about a year now-  my kids beg for them from time to time.  So versatile, I switch things up each time I make them.  I use all whole wheat flour now and brown sugar instead of white.  More oats and flour may be subbed if you don't have oat bran and wheat germ.  My kids don't care for walnuts, we don't miss them.  I use applesauce instead of oil and an extra banana.  Try a handful of mini chocolate chips instead of blueberries, or chopped apple and cinnamon...  I could go on and on.  Also, I keep frozen blueberries on hand and use these most of the time, no need to thaw.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Super moist! I followed some of the recommendations including all whole wheat flour, 1/2c brown sugar in place of white, applesauce in place of oil, and I used almond milk with lemon juice in place of buttermilk. I probably could have reduced the milk a little bit because these are crazy moist, but they baked well.

I took some creative liberties (but within reason): added approx. 1/2 cup shredded/minced carrots, used 1 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose, did not use nuts, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg as suggested by "sinsofangels", used flax meal instead of wheat germ, broiwn sugar instead of white, applesauce instead of oil. Hubby would like oil instead because they stuck to the paper liners. Taste was great and healthy. Might try adding white choc. chips next time.

Exceptional! Wonderful taste, texture and combination of ingredients. In that some post noted too much banana flavor I use half of a large banana and find the amount perfect, adds enough moisture but not an overpowering banana flavor. I also sub out the white sugar and used 1/2 c. of brown sugar instead. The first time I made this recipe I used commerical frozen blueberries and the muffins took on a greenish color. Now I use my own berries that are frozen and add them last to the dry ingredients right before mixing in the mixed wet ingredients. They are beautiful! I make this recipe often. Thanks for sharing!

I loved these muffins. The only thing I changed was to substitute yogurt for the buttermilk. I froze any muffins that we didn't eat the first day. Then whenever we wanted one, we'd just pop it in the microwave for a bit and it would taste freshly baked. Yum!

Very yummy!  I added two teaspoons of flax seed to add to its health value.  My 4 year old loved them.  I will definitely be keeping this in my recipe box.  Very easy to make and so worth having a healthy version of a breakfast favorite.  Update: These freeze and reheat in the microwave very well.  They don't keep as long as other muffins.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because even after all the changes I made it was still amazing. I appreciate how forgiving & flexible it is & that alone makes it a keeper. After reading through the other suggestions I substituted brown sugar for all white, one can pumpkin for banana, applesauce for oil, wheat bran for oat bran, flax seed meal for wheat germ, & chocolate chips for blueberries. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon & 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also only used Eagle Mills All-Purpose Ultragrain Flour because I that's what I had on hand. They took 20-22 minutes to bake. Next time I will try with coconut oil, and make sure to have whole wheat flour on hand. Yummy!

I only make recipes with 5 stars and have loved all of them.  However if your looking for really healthy and dont care about the taste these are fine, but if you want a good blueberry muffin try the struesel topped blueberry muffin recipe, that one was the best muffin ever and they were all gone the day I made them.

Delicious, but I did make a few changes.  I used all whole wheat flour.  Cut the sugar to 1/2 c and used only brown.  Used 1/2 c oats since I didn't have the oat bran.  Used fresh strawberries instead of blueberries (was out of blueberries).  Used applesauce instead of the banana (hate bananas).  I also did not have buttermilk, so I used 1T vinegar with skim milk to make 1c total.  These were very good and not so dense and dry like most lower fat/healthier recipes are.  I will definately make these again! Also, if you use my adjustments to the recipe, these are 3.5 points each on weight watchers for anyone interested.

Really good healthy muffin recipe. I didn't have wheat germ so I used ground flax instead. I also used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. Didn't have buttermilk on hand(who does?) so I used 1 t of lemon juice with the milk. I didn't use the nuts.  The top comes out golden crispy and chewy and the inside moist and soft. This is the perfect breakfast muffin. I plan on freezing them and taking them to work. Next time I may add an extra banana for some added natural sweetness.

The muffins were horrible! I substituted skim milk for the buttermilk, wheat bran for the oat bran, and applesauce for the oil. The muffins came out dry and bland tasting. I don't know if any of the substitutions made a difference, but I will not make these again.

These are SO good! Up until this point I had not created an allrecipes account, but these are so good that I just had to so that I could rate these wonderful muffins! I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and they turned out SO delicious!!!

These are tasty and pretty healthy for a blueberry muffin.  I used all wheat flour and no white, I didn't have quick oats so I doubled the wheat bran which I substituted for oat bran and I used Splenda instead of sugar to cut even more calories.  They turned out moist but substantial which is good because I'm using these as a filling afternoon snack to help me through my diet. :) One other thing, I'm going to try to put this delicately, with all this fiber these babies have 'cleansing' powers!

I just wanted to say I noticed some had complained of an overwhelming taste of banana. The degree of banana flavor depends on the ripeness of the banana if you want alot use a really ripe banana, less use one thats less ripe. Of course you can also substitute apple sauce for the banana with little tast difference.

I made these muffins today after a long hiatus.  To support clean eating, I replaced the white sugar with 1/4 cup Sucanat (mixed in dry) + 1/4 cup honey (mixed in wet) + 1/4 cup chopped dates.  

They were great!

Delicious!  Used ground flax instead of wheat germ and they came out wonderfully!  Omitted the granola topping.  Great treat for a lady in the first trimester -- gentle on the stomach and much tastier than crackers!

I made this recipe for a number of moms, because it contains quite a few lactogenic ingredients. Everyone loved them, kids included. I made the following substitutions: one-half cup of honey and no sugar, all-bran instead of oatbran because I was out of oatbran, and I added ground flaxseed. Two of these make a great breakfast that you can eat on the go, or while tending to small children.

Wow! A blueberry muffin recipe I can feel good about eating!  These muffins were so filling and tasted wonderful.  The bananas and berries sweeten the muffins so well, I might reduce the sugar next time.  I didn't have any oat bran, so I put an extra 1/8 cup of wheat germ and oats (regular, I didn't have quick cooking).  I also used olive oil instead of veggie.   I did have to cook the muffins about 20 min.  They were worth the wait.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  We really enjoyed it.

These were delicious and made me feel less guilty than eating a regular muffin.  I made changes based on what I had.  I used a multi-grain baking mix in place of the wheat flour and 1/2 a cup of oat flour in place of the oat bran and whole oats.  Skipped the wheat germ and used ground flax seed instead.  I used a tablespoon of nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the oil, and 2% milk instead of buttermilk.  Skipped the nuts altogether.  Even with all the changes the muffins were moist and delicious.  Will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This turned out great! I subbed fat free blueberry  greek yogurt for the buttermilk, and cinnamon applesauce for the banana. I accidentally poured in double the vanilla but didn't notice an overly vanilla flavor. It was sweet but not too sweet and did not need butter. I had to keep it in the oven for an extra 5 minutes, which resulted in the edges crisping up, which made it even better!

I made these muffins for breakfast this morning and they were a big hit.  Also filling - kids gobbled them up but then could only eat one (they also had egg & smoothie).  Delicious!!  Usually I try to make a recipe exactly according to directions before rating, but this recipe is very flexible so I wanted to share how adaptable it is.  The few ingredient changes I made were accepted cooking substitutions, nothing very unusual.  I didn't have wheat germ so I doubled the oat bran.  I mixed vinegar with skim milk to make buttermilk substitute.  No nuts because I didn't have any.  And I added a tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients. 
The cooking changes I made were based on previous muffin baking experience.  I think the recipe's instructions would be fine, perhaps just not as pretty of a muffin.  Specifically, I mixed wet with dry before adding blueberries.  Also dredged berries in flour before gently stirring into batter.  (This technique keeps the berries from sinking to the bottom of the muffin and from discoloring the batter.). Then I let the batter sit for 8-10 minutes to allow the baking powder to work.  (Used the time to clean up the kitchen).  All in all, the recipe's ingredient combination and proportions were perfect and definitely a keeper!

Very tasty recipe.  I did use white whole wheat flour for the whole 1 1/2 cups and they did not turn out tough. I used 1/2 cup evaporated cane sugar instead of white and added a bit more wheat germ and oat bran to account for some of a dry ingredient (the sugar) being removed. I also used pecans instead of walnuts--my husband especially noticed this and said really, really preferred the pecans.

Muffins are sweet without being overly so.  Overall, a keeper recipe!

I rarely review, but I felt like I needed to for this recipe.  These muffins are absolutely wonderful!!  I am always hesitant to make healthy pastry items as they always turn out to have an odd texture and lackluster taste.  Not so with these.  My mother in law even asked for the recipe and my husband loves them.  I would definitely recommend these.

I am going to give this a five star because I think had I used blueberries like it called for it would have been perfect. I used dried cranberries I think they have a lot more sugar contant. Hint if using dried cranberries cut back on sugar. Also added 1/2 teaspoon cinammon maybe will used 3/4 teaspoon next time

Sugar free version:  These came out great!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar replacement and 1/4 cup white sugar replacement and an extra 1/2 cup of 2% milk.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. .  Regular, old-fashioned, long cooking oats were all we had available to use and worked just as well, contributing just a little extra fiber.  The extra milk is needed as sugar replacements don't melt the way regular sugar does.  Baked products come out hard and dry without adding more liquid.  I also let the batter rest for about 10 minutes before baking to let the extra milk absorb into the batter a little more.  The muffins came out moist and flavorful.  My husband rates this recipe 5 stars and he is a gourmet cook!  We'll be having these again!

Substantial, delicious and versatile.  Bakes up great  as is, but you can easiily make substitiutions as well.  Freezes well for a ready-to-go breakfast.  I sometimes omit blueberries, double the bananas, add some mini chocolate chips and bake them as mini-muffins for a healthier dessert choice for my family.  Delicious with cinnamon added to the batter as well.

I love this recipe! I have used it as the base with many fantastic variations.

Try adding a shredded carrot.

For the holidays, I substituted half a can of pumpkin for the banana, half Splenda half brown sugar instead of white sugar, diced apple in place of the blueberries, and a good dose of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.  Delicious!

Thank you so much!

I expected to love these based on all the great reviews, but I was disappointed. They just didn't have much flavor at all. If I were to make them again I'd definitely add cinnamon or allspice...or something!

These are very, very good for a "healthy" muffin...i followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted the white sugar for a 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar.  I didn't have any oat bran so I replaced it with quick cooking oats.  I didn't have any wheat germ so i replaced that with flax seed meal.  I also used 1 T vinegar w/ 1 cup skim milk since i don't normally have buttermilk on hand.  I followed the recipe w/ the exception of the above-mentioned substitutions.  The muffins came out very moist and tasty...Next time I will put the oats in my food processor so they have a more "flour-like" consistency (personal preference)on a side note, they did have a strong banana taste (which I like, but if i used this recipe for a base for other muffins I would replace the banana with applesauce.  Next time I will also add nutmeg and cinnamon as other reviewers have suggested.  I will use this recipe as a base for all future muffins...I think it's a great recipe!

Great muffin! I too tweaked it to make it more healthy for my family. I used all whole wheat (ground super fine), used right at 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of white, 1 cup ground oats (no oat bran or wheat germ) and used applesauce instead of oil (which is a bit trivial, but oh well). Oh, and I added a pinch more baking powder and soda for  the denser ingredients. They rose beautifully and tasted fantastic. I will definitely make these again!

LOVED this!  I substituted honey for the sugar (same measurement) and used all whole wheat flour.  The only thing I'd change is to take out the banana.  It made it taste like a banana nut muffin with blueberries, rather than a blueberry muffin.  I, too, think this recipe is a great base for other healthy muffins - I'd like to try an apple cinnamon muffin next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I know some of you are very opinionated about reviewing recipes that you've changed up a bit;  But sometimes it's just necessary.  So here's what I did after reading some other reviews:
I used only whole wheat flour, only brown sugar, what bran instead of oat bran, applesauce instead of banana and oil, and milk + vinegar (because I didn't have buttermilk on hand).  

My only complaint is that they are mostly flat on top after baking.  Maybe it's just a fluke.  This is the first time I've made them.  The flavor is fantastically earthy, though!  I love em.  And they're so much healthier than any other average muffin or sweet bread.

Super Yummy!  Another kid (and adult) hit!  And very lo-cal with these modifications:  used all whole wheat flour, brown sugar, wheat bran instead of oat bran, about 1 1/2 Tbsp ground flax instead of wheat germ (didn't have any), added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, omitted the nuts, 1 extra banana for 3X the recipe, skim milk with lemon juice(1Tbsp per cup) (for the buttermilk), liquid egg whites, and 1/3 cup apple sauce instead of oil.........okay, so that's a lot of modifications.  But this was a great base recipe!  

Tripled the recipe, made 96 mini muffins.....figured out all the ingredients and it worked out to 53 calories per mini muffin!  And oh, they are so tasty!!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this delicious recipe, ZOPOOH!  I made some changes because of our dietary needs but I have been trying for a couple of years to find a good cake or muffin recipe that has no fat or sugar in it, and the base of this recipe has let me FINALLY achieve that.    Here are the changes I made:  I used all whole white wheat flour for all the flour in the recipe, 1/2 c splenda instead of sugar, a heaping 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce in place of the banana & oil, 1 T vinegar in lactose-free milk (to sour it) instead of buttermilk, 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg, and omitted the nuts.  That may sound like a lot of changes, but they are all simple substitutions and resulted in a muffin that is not rubbery or tough--just delicious, healthy & satisfying.  I am so THRILLED and so is my family!

Delicious!!!!  I omitted the wheat germ, oat bran & banana because I didn't have it

My variation: 1 c. wheat flour, 3/4 c. oats, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. granulated, 1 tsp. soda, 1 tsp. powder, salt,  1/2 c. applesauce or 1 banana, 1 c. buttermilk, 1 egg, 1 TB oil or applesauce, 1 tsp. vanilla.
I've made a few dozen with varieties of: apples, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, & walnuts.  All were YUMMY!!

I made exactly as directed.  I wouldn't recommend filling these to the top - they spread out too much.  I also wouldn't reduce the sugar as others suggested.  It's not terribly sweet as it is, and white sugar helps it rise (which it needs).  Overall, a healthy alternative muffin.  Definitely not what you expect from blueberry muffins.

Absolutely delicious! Tried some more oat flakes and oat bran, as we like the taste, replaced oat with musli, also added some chocolate, tried them with different nuts, dried fruit, fruit from preserve and so on. Always great. So, feel free to experiment

I thought these muffins were great and I love all the healthy ingredients. I left the nuts out and I added a little cinnamon other than that I followed the recipe exactly.This is one I would make again.

Just made these and they were absolutely delicious!  I used grapeseed oil, powdered buttermilk and omitted the nuts.  Also, for those on weight watchers, I plugged the ingredients into the recipe builder and it was 2 points (I think this had to do with the lack of nuts and the use of powdered buttermilk).  Will be making again!

Delicious, moist, healthy muffins.  I didn't have wheat germ, so I substituted equal parts oat bran/oats.  I'm not a big fan of bananas, but the mashed banana gives the muffins sweetness with just a hint of banana flavor, and is not at all overpowering.  I used frozen blueberries, which added a few minutes to the cooking time.

I didnt have wholewheat so I used breadflour instead.  Nor did I have any wheat germ, so I used a cooked cereal product made with wheat germ, soya grits & selected wheat products.  I filled the muffin wells to the top & baked 25 mins.  They raised beautifully, were soft, nutty & delicious.  They freeze well for individual treats or quick take-away snacks.  5 Stars!!!

These were great! I left out the nuts (I have a baby under 1 year) and added more blueberries and used whole wheat pastry flour. Thank you so much for a healthy muffin I can offer my kids!!!

Very good for a healthy muffin with such heavy ingredients! I wanted a bit more of the fruit flavor to shine through; I think a tart berry would work better than blueberries - cranberries, or cherries for example. The blueberries tend to get lost in the nutty flavor of the wheat/wheat germ/bran/nuts. Some grated carrot would work well in here, too.

I'm happy to add my 5 Stars to this recipe! Usually anything with oatmeal or bananas gets the thumbs down at my house. Not these muffins!  They vanished in less than 24 hours. Very subtle "healthy" flavoring and big blueberry taste.  Thanks for this keeper!

Cook 18 minutes.  More than that makes the berries burst and ooze.

Moist and tasty. They rose way nicer then I thought they would. The only change was spelt flour instead of W.W., a little less sugar and a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. I also use only soya so added a tbs. vinegar to that for the buttermilk substitute.
I have a whole book on using banana, prune, applesauce ect. for butter or fat replacement.

These are wonderful!  I didn't have oat bran, so I just left it out and it was still great.  I made nine larger muffins instead of 12 and baked a little longer. I love these!  I have also made without blueberries and they make a great banana muffin also.

These are fantastic!! The banana adds a wonderful sweetness. My daughter, who doesn't like bananas, gobbled it up. The only change I made was half milk / half sour cream. The muffins were very moist, full of flavor and healthy. This is a keeper!!

Overall, good recipe.  I made two batches.  
Batch 1: I followed recipe, omitted the Oat bran b/c I couldn't find it.  Great taste. The banana may of taken too much of the flavoring of the blueberries.  I might omitt the bananas next time to be more of a blueberry taste.

Batch 2: I used Splenda instead of the real sugar. I used soy milk instead of the butter milk.  I didn't have oatbran and I added a 1/4 more of blueberries.  I muffins came out more dense (probably b/c of the splenda). Still good and less sweet as the others muffins.  The hubby "A-OKed" it on both.  He liked the texture of the regular muffins but the less sweetness of the Splenda muffins.

I did not find this to be as spectacular as others. My husband who is quite used to my experiments in healthier cooking only ate 1/2 of one muffin- thats about as low of a review as you can get with him. I gave the recipe 3 stars because they do make a suitable breakfast and aren't gross, they just aren't as good as I was expecting.

4 21 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/86894/health-nut-blueberry-muffins/ ... These aren't the prettiest muffins, but they taste good.  I soaked the oats & wheat germ in the wet ingredients (to hide).  I also used frozen berries.  'Don't know if either of those is responsible for it, but most of mine had a dimple.  It's nice they don't scream "healthy" either.  'Glad I tried & I'll probably make again, but decrease sugar to 1/3 to 1/2c.  :)  Next day: Very moist tops.  I'll add more oats & less sugar next time. 4/2016  'Tried with 1/3c sugar; try 1/2 next time.  :)  'Not unsweet, but could use a bit more.  Maybe a shot of honey.

These were delicious! - but I changed the recipe a bit.  I didn't have quick oats, so I added more oat bran and I didn't have a banana, so I added applesauce.  I also used brown sugar and white wheat.  They were perfectly moist and didn't have that overly "healthy" taste to them.

Wonderful! I've made these since 2012! I make four batches (uses 1 quart buttermilk) -- two exactly as the recipe is written, one with 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the banana (for the non-banana guy) and no nuts, and one with applesauce sub again with added apples cut up into the batter and pecans instead of walnuts. Add a whole nut to top of muffin before baking to identify.

Once I didn't have AP flour and used Self Rising and they turned out not as flat (from extra baking powder) and tasted the same. IF you use the Self Rising flour, you can fill the muffin cups heaping (rounded) as they do not rise a lot and the batter is really fluffy. If you use the AP flour, this will make them spread over the edge, so stick with the recipe directions of filling to the top.

I use frozen blueberries as I make these year round. One reviewer said the muffins were not sweet enough - I would think that depended on your fruit. Need a REALLY ripe banana (black speckled one) and sweet blueberries. The wild blueberries are not always sweet and add extra grit. If you get frozen blueberries, feel the bag, you want the large ones which are generally pretty sweet. Stir frozen blueberries into flour to coat them, when adding liquid do not overmix or turns batter blue. Large ones sink so reserve a few for top before baking.

Real buttermilk is key. Tried with the powdered kind and made a taste difference, not bad, but not as good as the real thing! Pint size is perfect for two batches. Freeze well!

Awesome recipe! to make them a little healthier...use all whole wheat flour, substitute the 3/4 cup of white sugar for 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and leave out the salt. You don't know the difference. Also if you are looking for the oat bran or wheat germ, look down the health food isle of almost any supermarket, Red Mill is a popular brand and you can get all kind of goodies.

I whipped these up to use up some blueberries and they were great.
I didn't have oat bran and I added 2 tbsp light brown sugar and some cinnamon.

Would definitely make again.

These were really good. I used "all bran," frozen mixed berries, and flax seed... so totally just added whatever seemed right and they still turned out really good. I did have to cook them for closer to 25 minutes though.

Awesome muffin!  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so used a small container of lowfat vanilla yoghurt & 1/2 cup of almond milk.  Also used splenda sugar blend, rather than plain sugar.  Tasted great & probably cut a few calories as well!

I made this for my daughters school project and I must say it is healthy and delicious.  Her classmate and teacher love it.  I added one banana and it tasted good.

Love it!!! These taste so good its hard to beleive they are under 200 calories!  There is a lot of sugar in it though... maybe I would put in half the amount of splenda next time instead... and  I would change the oil for apple sauce.

Wow!  These are the best blueberry muffins I have ever had...no joke.  I wanted a healthy morning muffin for the kids and this is exactly what I was looking for.  I use buttermilk powder, so I boiled my cup of water for buttermilk and added in the oat and wheat bran, as well as oats with 3tbs buttermilk powder so they could soak in the hot water and soften. Then I mixed in other ingredients.  These made 12 good size muffins and they took me 25 minutes to bake at 350.  Thank you for posting!!!

These muffins were amazingly delicious! They were moist and sweet, by far the best muffins I've ever made. My roommates almost ate the entire first batch despite the fact that they are healthy! I did follow some tips by other reviewers. I substituted the oil for apple sauce, I added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of using any white sugar.

Not bad - lots of healthy grains and blueberries.  But, not that great - think I will keep looking.

This is a wonderful healthy muffin! Very moist and tasty. I've tried many recipes for a healthy muffin and they usually end up rubbery, dry, or gritty. these were none of the above. I like cinnamon in my muffins, so I added a teaspoon. I didn't have oat bran, so I substituted ground flax seed meal. Delicious!

My 12 yr. old made these for her Grandma to take to work with her for a healthy breakfast. Everybody loved them! Even picky Pops loved them. Grandma doesn't know if she can save the rest for the work week. :)

these are delicious, I did some minor changes like others did, I didn't have oat bran, so I put ground flax seed, instead of a mashed banana, I used unsweetened apple sauce, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of almond extract, and the zest of an orange, I divided the batter into 3 bowls, on one added crushed walnuts, on the 2nd one added 4 diced strawberries, on the 3rd I added chocolate chips, for the different taste buds in my family, my favorites was the one with the walnuts!! ZOPOOH this is an amazing recipe thanks for posting!!

This was a great healthy bb muffin recipe but I took it a couple of steps further to make it a little more low fat. Substituted the white flour w/gluten free all purpose flour (add about 10 minsto baking time), the buttermilk for almond milk, the vegetable oil for olive oil and left out the walnuts.

I love these! The banana adds a really nice flavor that is more just moist...I couldn't even taste the banana. I think I also used more oats, not having wheat germ on hand. They work well with raspberries too. I always top my muffins with raw sugar and more oats. They looked great, and tasted great too! A definite keeper!

I love this muffin recipe. I usually use more bananas for extra moist muffins. I also add a couple tbsps of ground flax just because. Love, love, love this recipe!

Wow - what a great recipe! And very versatile, too!

I didn't have oat bran so substituted almond flour. Didn't have blueberries, but did have fresh chopped strawberries so threw them in along with a handful of white chocolate chips. They just came out of the oven and I had to try one, they smelled so good! Delicious. I'll definitely make these again.

This is a very good healthy muffin recipe.  I was hoping for a little more powerful flavor, but all the ingredients just mildly blend together.  I'd like to try this recipe with diced dates in place of the blueberries.

I really love these muffins!  They're fantastic as written, but they are also easily adaptable (for example, applesauce for the banana, other fruit for the blueberries).  I make a batch on Sunday and have them for snacks at work all week long!  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy.  Great as is and easy to alter if desired.   The second time I subbed 1/2 c. applesauce for the banana & oil per other reviews and increased sugar to 1 c. (bcs applesc was unsweetened), used all whole wheat flour and all brown sugar, added strawberries with the bb.  So yummy - going back for my 3rd right now!

Really light and fluffy.  I left out the walnuts and added the nutmeg and cinnamon.  I also used apple sauce.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar!!  Great advice about the frozen blueberries (I rinsed them to thaw, put them in with the dry stuff first and cooked the muffins for an extra 7 minutes)

Five star blueberry muffins. Made the recipe exactly as written, except used pecans instead of walnuts, and loved it. Lots of muffins are just cupcakes, or else turn out dry. These were moist, but sturdy and nutty tasting from the wheat germ and oat bran. It's local blueberry season right now so the fantastic blueberries just made the muffins better, but I think I'll do what another reviewer suggested and try them when other fruit when blueberry season is over. Thanks for the great muffins!

Wonderful!  It's such a great basic recipe that you can tweak to your own delight by what you have on hand.  I didn't have any blueberries and used strawberries, used brown sugar instead of white, pecans vs. walnuts, threw in a handful of dried cranberries.  Kitchen smelled great while baking!

Good muffin recipe. I made a couple changes to fit my lifestyle. Added 3 1/2 oz of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. I don't like my muffins too sweet and I also exchanged the 1 Tbl oil for 1 Tbl coconut oil and 1 Tbl melted butter. Great healthly breakfast!

I thought the pictures of these muffins looked a little strange ... not that great.  But, I just made them and they are wonderful.  I substituted wheat bran for oat bran b/c I didnt have any & kefir instead of buttermilk.  I think next time I will make them with a little less sugar to make them a tad healthier, but they are great as is!

I will admit that I dident follow this recipe to a tea, but I did like it. I used some greek yogert, and I dident have any whole wheat flour or oat bran so I had to make due. Overall these turned out nice. Moist, and not too sweet. A good place to start if you are looking for a healthy muffin.

great taste and nice domed tops. I used all whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, omitted nuts, my muffins baked in 20 minutes, will definitely make again.

Great recipe! After reading other reviews, I omitted the all-purpose flour and used 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. I used half sugar half Splenda, and they still were fluffly and browned. I didn't have any blueberries on hand, so I used frozen strawberries that I rinsed and mashed. I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg. The best muffins I've ever had. The children ate them up. Thanks for sharing!

Really, really good w/a few modifications, similar to those already posted:  All whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil (1C for double recipe), Egg Beaters instead of egg, brown sugar instead of white, added allspice and nutmeg as well.  Oh, and I ran out of vanilla extract, so I used almond instead.  Didn't notice a difference.  Kids don't like nuts, so I omitted them, but would probably enjoy them with a little added texture.

This recipe is awesome!  I did make some minor changes because I wanted them to be even higher in fiber.  I used 1 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour, wheat bran instead of oat, added 1/4 c ground flax seed, increased buttermilk by 1/4 c, ommitted the banana,and increased sugar to a whole cup.  They are outstanding.  Freeze beautifully and heat in the microwave for about 45 seconds.  I make big ones and they are a whole breakfast.

Delicious! I often try to make healthier alternatives to family favorites and rarely get a good response from the masses. These muffins were an exception. They are wonderful and I agree with others that you can easily subsitute ingredients in and out as needed. I also agree that the photo does not do the muffins justice.

Very good. I used whole wheat white flour, ground flax seed instead of oat bran, added an extra banana and omitted the oil and decreased the sugar by 1/4 of a cup. Pretty awesome muffin. Very sweet and got the big muffin top. It took longer than 18 minutes to cook, but i did a double batch.

A "stick to your ribs" kind of muffin.  Delicious and healthy.  I make the following changes based on earlier reviews and my own preferences.  1 C. whole wheat flour and 1/2 C. all-purpose flour.  I also eliminate the veg. oil.  It really doesn't need it!  I get 12 muffins out of it.

This tastes amazing. I healthed these up a bit more. Replaced the oil with apple sauce. Replaced the germs with nopalina and used both brown sugar and about 1/4th of a cup of white sugar. I also used the whole pint of blueberries instead of just a cup. This is a very moist recipe. However, please note that if you use nopalina and are not used to it, it may be a bit more fiber than your body is used to tollerating so eat with caution.

These were very good. I made some changes, but still felt it deserved 5 stars because it is easily adaptable to your own tastes. I used applesauce instead of banana because that's what I had on hand, and I used Splenda. I'll probably add some brown sugar or molasses next time. But will surely be making again.

I was expecting these to be really good, but no luck. The only descriptive word I can come up with is 'pasty', both in texture and flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter, right down to the real buttermilk called for, so I can't fault any changes I may have made. The flavor was blah and there was just too much moisture and not enough 'substance'.

Really loved this recipe!  Followed the recipe as is and they turned out looking just like their picture.  I might try using whole wheat flour only next time just to make it even healthier!

These muffins are wonderful!  Easy to change to the ingredients that you have on hand.  I even added raspberries, and strawberries when I only had half the amount of blueberries. Very simple recipe with great results.

I'm not sure what the hype is about. Yes, these muffins are healthy. They are also completely bland, even with the addition of cinnamon and allspice. They taste more like bran muffins than anything else, and they are very dense. They need more sugar, more oil, and more leavening. But if you're a person who values health over flavor, this could be the muffin for you!

This is a really yummy recipe. I didn't have oat bran, so I just used 1/2 cup of oats. I did use frozen blueberries and it turned the muffins greenish-blue, so I would use fresh ones next time.

This is a very good recipe, and the muffins came out with a great texture.  I used half a cup of brown sugar (unpacked), for the white sugar, and 1% milk with lime juice for the buttermilk.  Next time, I will follow other reviewers suggestions and add some spice, and also cut down or omit the baking soda.  I only got 10 muffins out of this, instead of 12, and they took more than 15 mins. to be fully cooked inside.  I had no problem using frozen berries, when mixed in with the dry ingredients.  Thanks for a tasty, healthy recipe, will definitely make again and again.

Good muffins!  I successfully adapted the recipe to our tastes and what we had on hand.  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flours (no white), agave nectar instead of sugar, wheat bran instead of oat, unsweetened applesauce instead of banana, pecans instead of walnuts, and flax meal instead of oil.  Good taste and texture.  I will make these again!

Awesome!  Just what I was searching for!  A way to use up ripe bananas and include blueberries.  Plus, they are healthy but don't taste "healthy."  I did leave out the oat bran because I didn't have any. And I left out the nuts because of personal preference.  A great recipe!!!

No oat bran or wheat germ on hand, doubled quick oats. No buttermilk on hand, poured 1 Tbl vinegar into liquid measuring cup and added milk up to 1 Cup (let stand 5 minutes). Only had 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, so used 3 very ripe, small bananas (hence the search for this recipe).  Very moist and delicious!  My two year old loved it.  Will try with the oat bran and wheat germ next time.

These are a very good, healthy muffin.  I used milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk but otherwise no substitutions.  I will make these again as a quick healthy breakfast.

Fantastic! I didn't have a ripe banana so I subbed my homemade baked applesauce. Used skim milk w/vinegar, a mix of splenda, sugar & brown sugar. Really tasty breakfast!
Update to my 2008 review in 2016 (my husband was diagnosed with diabetes in 08 so I was using artificial sweeteners, we've since stopped doing that) - I followed the recipe closer this time. I used what I had - wheat bran for the oat bran and a mix of flax/chia for the wheat germ. Used pecans. I didn't have the full 3/4 cup of sugar but you can't tell. Delicious breakfast!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! The kids all loved these muffins, and I didn't have to feel so guilty about serving them for breakfast since they have a lot of wholesome ingredients. The only things I changed were to use unsweetened applesauce instead of banana, and substituted some additional whole wheat flour for the oat bran since I didn't have any. I also didn't add the vanilla or walnuts. The muffins turned out moist and flavorful and made everyone happy. Although the kids didn't seem to think so, I did think they were a little on the sweet side, which would be easy to change. I also used this recipe without blueberries and replaced part of the sugar with honey to make some awesome honey-wheat muffins. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I did not like these muffins at all. They were dry, had NO flavor, they never browned on top like other muffins.For all the ingredients in these muffuins I thought they would be wonderful.

I used oat bran flour..not sure if that is the same as oat bran or not.  Also, I had no walnuts, so I left them out.  Otherwise, you would never guess this is a healthier alternative to regular muffins.  They come out nice and moist.

These turned out wonderful! Everyone at church gobbled them up when I brought them for breakfast.  I made them just as the recipe called for except I used applesauce in place of the banana (I'm not a big banana fan) and they were still yummy. Thanks for a great muffin recipe!

Wow! I keep trying different recipes for healthy muffins and this is the best! I used a bit more than 1 cup of frozen blueberries. I also substituted 3/4 cup strawberry yogurt and 1/4 cup milk for the buttermilk. Don't overmix, just gently stir with a rubber spatula.

Man, what did I do wrong?? I was soo excited for these from all the good reviews, but the family and I didn't care for them. I decreased the sugar down to 1/2 cup as others suggested (used brown sugar), and used all spelt flour, so that could've been part of it. But I usually use spelt in everything and LOVE it. They were hardly sweet tasting too. I see good potential in this recipe. I might play around with it a little more, but definately not happy  with the first batch :( I'm still giving them 4 stars even though we tossed the batch because I didn't follow the recipe to a T.

These muffins were delicious. However I made some substitutions to make them even healthier.  I used all whole wheat flour, splenda, low fat plain yogurt, and an extra cup of blueberries.  They were light and moist. They don't get any healthier than this!

I made the following changes to the recipe: skim milk instead of buttermilk, raw sugar instead of white and extra blueberries.  The muffins came out fantastic!  
They don't have that stereotypical "bran" taste at all.  They're moist and light, and perfectly sweet.  This is a great treat for health conscious adults and picky kids alike! :)

Made these last week with blueberries.  Didn't have oat bran so I increased the quick cooking oats and wheat germ to 1/3 cup each.  By far the best tasting heathy muffin ever.  This morning I made them with cranberries.  Wonderful!

I'm giving five stars to a great tasting recipe that is also healthy.  A marvelous recipe to have on hand.  I did things by the book except tried Splenda in lieu of sugar, regular oats instead of quick, frozen/thawed blueberries instead of fresh, and an equal amount of applesauce instead of oil.  Was received well by most, except a couple of finicky people who didn't like the discoloration from the blueberry juice.  The non-judgmental folks who tried them all thought they were delicious!  Thank you.

Absolutely the best muffins I've ever eaten! Moist, light and packed full of flavor! I substituted dried blueberries for fresh as another cook posted but otherwise stuck with the recipe as written. I won't be losing this recipe!

I used 1/2 cup oatmeal (didn't have oat bran), left out the banana (only because I didn't have any handy), forgot to add the veg oil, and used sliced almonds (because I had them), and probably added just a few more blueberries, and we've been eating them all week (one at a time, they ARE filling!). I'll be doing this again soon!!

Amazingly good!  They do taste healthy, but the banana adds a natural sweetness, and they stay moist and are filling.  I had to subsitute about 1/4 c. ground flax seed for wheat germ, and doubled the oats in place of oat bran, and they still turned out great.  I'll definitly make them again.  They were just what I was looking for.  Thanks!

Excellent muffins!  Great flavor and hearty texture.  Due to milk and nut allergies in the family, I made a few substitutions:  2 T. ground flax in place of the walnuts, and 1 T. lemon juice and enough soy milk to equal 1 cup instead of the buttermilk.  I didn't have oat bran on hand so I used an extra 1/4 cup of oatmeal instead.  I baked these in a mini muffin pan and they came out perfectly.  We enjoyed these as a much healthier and tastier alternative to traditional blueberry muffins!

This recipe is so fantastic and healthy, i will certainly make it over and over again.  I put in 1 c. whole wheat flour and only 1/2 c. white flour, plus added flax (a couple Tbsp.) and more blueberries.  Also, for those people who can't find Oat bran--it's usually in the cereal aisle.

These are GREAT!  My husband couldn't even tell that they were healthy.  I know I'll be using this as the base recipe for many alternatives... The only thing I didn't have on-hand was buttermilk so I took other reviewers' suggestions and did half light sour cream and half milk.  Next time I'll try to use honey or agave as a sugar alternative.  Thanks!!!

I loved these!  Did make a few changes, though.  Used King Arthur light whole wheat flour, half splenda for the sugar, old-fashioned oats , wild blueberries, and 1/4 C Canola oil, and omitted the nuts.  Made 17 muffin tops which I baked at 350 for 10 mins.  Makes an excellent breakfast!

Oh yum!  My family really enjoyed these.  They aren't really like any muffin I've had before - the hint of banana with the blueberries is divine!  Who'd have thought!  Didn't change a thing and they turned out moist, tender and delicious.  You can hardly notice the bran, oats and germ - the picky family didn't notice.  Points for being relatively low in fat and calories too.  Overall, a good recipe.  I'll be keeping this one.

Healthy and great-tasting!  I doubled the recipe, and substituted ground flax seed for the wheat germ because I didn't have any.  I had to bake the muffins for about 22 minutes (perhaps because I 2x the recipe?)and they turned out beautifully. My husband and kids love them!  I'd definitely make them again.

I only have one complaint and it's all my fault. I used Irish oat instead of oatmeal, as that was all I had. I tried soaking the oats in the buttermilk for 30 minutes but that did not help. They were a bit crunchy. I generally use applesauce instead of oil, and cut the sugar in 1/2 but this recipe called for such a small amount of both that I did not bother. The only other change I made was to omit nuts (my kids don't like them) and I used over 2 cups of blueberries...made for 12 HUGE muffins. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll make sure I have oatmeal.

I needed more buttermilk so I added some  and then some more I was shocked at how dry it was.  I made my first batch and on the second I added some applesauce and cinnamon - wow.

Really moist and not too heavy even though it's described as a hearty texture.  They rise well, but don't really brown on top.  Tasted great with minor healthier substitutions: wheat flour, splenda, unsweetened applesauce (for the oil).  94 calories, 1.1g fat, 19.4g carbs, 5.6g fiber, 2.7g sugar

Love these muffins! So amazing! I sometimes substitute the Buttermilk for Almond milk and they are just as good.

Although they were moist, which I was very happy about, I did find them a little bland and they were lacking in sweetness (and I don't like a lot of sweetness in my desserts). To remedy this, I made a glaze with 1 cup of powdered sugar, a pinch of salt and about a 1/4 cup of maple syrup or so to get to a spreadable consistency. I think the next time I will also add some cinnamon and increase vanilla and perhaps add some honey as I would prefer my muffins without a glaze. I will make this again but with some modifications as it is a moist muffin.

These are very good! I have already made them twice.  The first time I made it I didn't have a banana so I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and it still turned out great.  These are healthy without being too dense or too dry.  I am sure I will make them again.

I didn't have wheat germ so replaced with more oat bran and they came out very dense & you could taste that they were healthy.

Loved this recipe. I did not have oat bran, so I just doubled the oats.  Added an 1/2 cup more of blueberries and 1/2 banana. Left out the oil & nuts (I don't like nuts). And used half brown sugar & half white sugar. My daughter thought they looked green, but that did not stop her from eating them.  She really liked them.

I did learn today they do not keep very long. (I had made a double batch) Only my one daughter & I were eating them.  So after a few days, the muffin today was not good at all!!  Next time I'll put them in the fridge in an air tight container.

Will be making them again!!

I followed someone else's suggestion to replace the wheat germ and oat bran by using 3/4 c quick oats and 1 cup whole wheat flour, since I didn't have wheat germ and oat bran. It came out fine. This muffin has a 'heartier' feel, not fluffy like traditional muffins, but still very tasty.

These were very good and healthy for a quick breakfast meal.  I got the calories to about 110 per muffin. Used EVOO instead of veg oil and left out nuts and added extra banana.  Very moist. PS don't leave them out on counter for too long they will go sour by the end of the week.

The kids loved them.  I used applesauce instead of banana, raisin bran (minus the raisins)instead of the bran, and whole wheat pastry flour (for the ww flour) based on what I had.  I added a little extra blueberries and they turned out great.

I thought these were good. Although, they dont look much like the photo. If they are made as 12, as suggested, they are quite huge. This may be the first muffin I have made with only 1 tablespoon of oil and no added butter. I liked the large pieces of blueberries and added walnuts. Only change I made was using extra quick oats for the oar bran, wheat bran for the wheat germ, half brown and half white sugar, and white whole wheat for regular whole wheat. They took 27 minutes to bake and 20 minutes to cool before popping out of the pan. I baked them in my Cuisinart pan sprayed lighty with PAM spray. My only issue was the base of the muffin had this odd spongey, wet, yet chewy texture. I have never had that before in a muffin. There is so much other stuff going on flavor or texture wise that it is not too bad. Either way, they will work great for breakfast or in lunches.

Family loved these! Husband said it was the best muffin recipe yet. Used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of white sugar. Instead of buttermilk I used 1/2 c. 1% milk and 1/2 c. heavy cream. Used 1/2 c. of flax & 1/2 c. rolled oats instead of the wheat germ/bran. Used partially thawed frozen berries and it was perfect. Upped the chopped walnut content a bit. Next time will add some cinnamon and nutmeg.

These are delicious and healthy. They are a real muffin, not a cake-like muffin. My boyfriend loves them, probably more than he loves me, and gets me to make double batches all the time. I generally use frozen mixed berries (minus the strawberries) but any kind of berry works really well. The walnuts add so much to the recipe so I don't recommend skipping out on them!
Quick, easy, and consistent to make. One of my favorite recipes.

The batter smelled so delicious, as soon as the muffins were in the oven, I licked the mixing bowl clean!

I only made a couple changes, and it turned out fine:

1. in place of buttermilk, Fannie Farmer suggests 1 cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice :)
2. instead of oat bran and wheat germ, I added an extra 1/4 cup of each type of flower
3. used 1 cup of frozen blackberries in place of blueberries
4. added an extra teaspoon of vanilla
5. added a teaspoon of cinnamon

They were super filling, 2 was enough for breakfast, and they tasted amazing :) the only issue I have with the recipe is that they needed to be cooked ALOT longer than 15 minutes, but maybe it is just my oven?

I used coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil, pecans rather than walnuts, and next time will try a different fruit - strawberry or apple, probably - instead of the banana.  I used fresh blueberries.  Nice texture and flavour.

These were much better that I expected.  Very moist!  The only thing I changed was adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix.  Difficult to believe that they are healthy (or at least healthier than regular blueberry muffins)!

These muffins were a little dense but very tasty. I also made my own buttermilk with a tablespoon of lemon and 1% milk. 

I added a full pint of fresh blueberries and omitted the nuts. I added a pinch of nutmeg and some cinnamon as well. I'll be making these again.

This is my new "go-to" muffin recipe!  After making these, I won't use any other recipe.  I had to modify it since I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand and didn't want to go to the store.  

First of all, I added 1 large granny smith apple, peeled and grated into the batter just because.  They kind of cooked away, but the flavor was great.  I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ, so I increased the oatmeal to 1/2 cup from 1/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon to the batter and made a streusel topping by combining 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup brown sugar, along with a dash of cinnamon and sprinkled all the muffins on top before baking.  it took about 5 additional minutes to cook.  The best!

The best AND most beautiful-looking healthy muffin.  I have looked for that "perfect" healthy muffin recipe forever.   I used 1/2 c. Oat bran, no wheat germ.  I used OG non-GMO canola oil, it's only 1 T!   I used 21/2 T unsw applesauce too.  I used a little less than 1/2 c. raw sugar and even the non-health nuts LOVED them.  I also used whole grain oats (not quick-cooking) put them in processor until just like finer, quick-cooking oats.  I processed the walnuts as well till minced and I think that really does wonderful things to the texture.  Yum yum.

I liked it but thought it was a bit bland.  My husband and two boys all ate the entire muffin pan within the day so I think they liked it more than I.  I'd make it again but would possibly add some lemon zest or something else to add a bit more flavor.

These are AMAZING! I made with brown sugar instead of white, wheat bran instead of oat bran (didn't have oat bran), applesauce instead of oil (heaping table spoon), 3 or 4 baby bananas, sour cream instead of buttermilk (didn't have milk or buttermilk), and added frozen raspberries, chia seeds and flax seeds. Cooked for about 17  mins.  They were fantastic - thanks so much!

Great muffin! Great as is, but better with 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 white, and I used cranberries the last time. I think any frozen berry will do!

I bumped mine up & made them taste great & they were fluffy.  Make it 1 tbsp vanilla extract & 1 tbsp baking powder. Also I added 2 more eggs,  1 c oats total so they were like bakery muffins.

These are pretty good. I chose this recipe to help me use up some things I had around, but I am surprised by the flavor in such a healthy muffin. I replaced the white sugar with brown, and added cinnamon, nutmeg and extra blueberries. definately a lot tastier than I expected and very moist from the added brown sugar and blueberries. My berries were frozen and I just added them to the dry ingredients right out of the freezer, then stirred in the wet ingredients, no colors bled at all.

I didn't have any wheat germ, so I added 1/8 cup more oats and 1/8 cup more oat bran.  Instead of the 3/4 cup white sugar, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar (packed).  I omitted the nuts, and instead of a banana (cause I had none) I added 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also just added a bit of vinegar to the milk instead of buttermilk and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I hadn't realized I was out of eggs until I had already started making these so I just added a bit of water to the mix.  I also used saskatoons instead of blueberries.  I guess as I am writing this I am realizing how much I did change the recipe. ( i usually don't leave reviews when I've made so many drastic changes).  But if you are looking for a versatile recipe....HERE IT IS!  They turned out great.

These muffins are amazing! It took me a while to find the oat bran in the grocery store (organic food aisle in Kroger btw), but the muffins were simple to make, healthy, and delicious.

These turned out very good....Next time I will probably try using honey (as someone else had pointed out) and more nuts - for me, the more nuts the better.  BTW - the bluish color did not throw me nor my husband off...expected my husband to be a bit leary!

These were great! I didn't have oat bran, so I used flax instead.  I also used frozen berries, so I put a little more oats in.  I think I would use at least 1/2 brown sugar next time and some cinnamon for a little more depth of flavor. They don't sell buttermilk here in Puerto Rico, so I mixed 2 Tablespoons of vinegar in with my milk. I also used large eggs. This is a great way to use up bananas too!

It came out wonderfully! I made a few changes, however. I used all whole wheat flour and instead of including oat bran and wheat germ, I used 3/4 cup of quick cooking oats. I don't like walnuts and so I used finely chopped peanuts (although, next time, I think I'll exclude nuts entirely). 

I also used vinegar and milk instead of buttermilk and maple syrup because I couldn't find my vanilla extract.

In any case, it came out very soft and delicious. I fully intend to experiment with this recipe. Definitely 5 stars!

Wow! I will make these again and again and again. I used all whole wheat flour and added some protein powder. Also used skim milk instead of buttermilk since didn't have any on hand. Delicious! These are going to be made in regular rotation at my house :) Family loved them.

I don't often write a review but need to Share how good this one is!  I have tried many healthy muffin recipes and my and hub and I like this one best.  I can't believe how light and fluffy they are.  I actually used flaxseed meal instead of the bran because I didn't have bran, and skim milk with a tbs of lemon juice instead of buttermilk.  Those were the only subs.  So yummy!

Like so many others have said, these are amazing! Per the previous reviewer's suggestions, I substituted 1/2 apple sauce instead of the bananas, and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I also omitted the oil and used soy milk instead of buttermilk. Finally, I didn't have oat bran, so I substituted ground flax. I was skeptical that the instructions didn't say to grease the pan or anything, but these easily slid out once cooled. They are the perfect combination of soft and chewy! This one is definitely a keeper. :)

I used all "all-purpose" flour and substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar for the 3/4 cup white sugar.  I also used 1/4 cup ground flaxseed in place of the wheat germ.  I replaced the oil with apple sauce.  Tasty and healthy muffin for under 200 calories.

Love this recipe just the way it is. I even sneak in an extra banana just because I love banana's and need the potasium, just approx 4 mins to cook time. My husband loves them also. I freeze them and take out to thaw the night before we are in a hurry to get out of the house in the morning. We are retired now but these would make a great lunch box treat.

These muffins were delightful! I made the following changes: omitted the banana (didn't have one), used 1/2 cup of cooking oats and omitted oat bran (didn't have it) and also omitted walnuts (due to allergies).  The muffins were great - I received many compliments on them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good!  I will make these often because they are much healthier than most recipes, and I feel better serving them to my kids.  These are best warm with butter.

I made both with and without walnuts.  SO GOOD!!  I also made some with chocolate chips, no blueberries.  Also delicious!  Will be making again for sure.  It's nice to have a somewhat healthy muffin recipe.

I have made these so many times I have lost count. They are a good wholesome muffin. I use only whole wheat flour and brown sugar. I use 1 tsp. vietnamese cinnamon and grind a little fresh nutmeg in. I also add about 1/4 cup of grape nut cereal. I also use whatever fruit I have on hand which is usually raspberries fresh or frozen.

Bar none the BEST muffins I've ever made.  Delicious.  The recipe is so easy and so forgiving you can substitute ingredients and it still comes out great.  Didn't have oat bran, so I added more quick oats.  As others have suggested I substituted apple sauce for oil.  I doubled the blueberries to 2 cups and added extra nuts.  YUM!

This is the best healthy muffin recipe ever! As per other reviewers I changed quite a few things: all whole wheat flour (1 1/2C), 1/2C splenda (12 packets of the fiber enriched one), 1/8C brown sugar, wheat v. oat bran, no wheat germ so used 1/2C oats, used almonds v. walnuts, 1C fresh blueberries with 1/4C craisins, used light vanilla soymilk with 1tsp lemon juice, 1/3C egg beaters v. eggs, added 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1/4tsp nutmeg, 1/3C applesauce and 1/2 a banana no oil, and sprinkled sugar in the raw on top before baking for 19mins (it made 13 muffins). SO healthy and tasty even my picky non health nut husband liked them. I can't wait to try this base with banana nut and apple cinnamon muffins.

Only change I made was adding 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce to it.... Really made them moist.
I was going to give it 4 stars personally, but my wife and mother absolutely flipped out over these saying it was the best muffins they ever ate.  Both ask me to make them all the time.

Awesome!  Didn't fill up lined cups all the way because it would have overflowed (about 1/2-3/4 of the way full)  Still yummy even with half the sugar and more of the healthy stuff added.  Great alternative to regular blueberry muffin!

I made these yesterday, and was awfully impressed - especially considering that it wasn't until the muffins were in the oven that I realized I forgot the egg and the vanilla!!  I used a number of the substitutions noted by others (omitting banana, and oil with applesauce), using brwn sugar, and milk with lemon (instd of buttermilk) raspberries instead of blueberres.... I felt like I was eating CAKE - they tasted decadent - the only downside to this recipe, is that my labrador thought they smelled so good, that he decided to counter -surf and make off with about 7 muffins... That little monkey... now I am looking for recipes that include "black lab" hahaha.

Excellent.  Made a few modifications per other reviewers.  Everyone scarfed them up.

My 6 year old grand daughter wanted to make breakfast for her blueberry loving, health conscious Mom for Mother's Day.  I made them exactly as written and they were fabulous! Moist, flavourful with great texture. We love muffins and fruit together so I made a batch the next day for our breakfast with the addition of 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Either way I have to say they are up there in the top 3 muffin recipes I have tried.

I have been making these muffins about once a month for a couple of years. Such a great recipe! I sometimes add cranberries or even semi-sweet chocolate pieces.

Love these and so does the entire family.  I've tried them with different fruit and they are just as good.  Did not change a thing they're perfect.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

As written, these are 4 solid stars.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to give them a bit more flavour and another star.  Any fruit works in these (cranberry/blueberry mix is my personal fav), just add about 2 cups.  They don't taste healthy which is a good thing in my books.  They are moist and flavourful and this is my muffin recipe for DH's lunch.

Awesome muffins! I didn't have oat bran so I used Bob's 10 grain cereal. I also added some flax and some orange zest. I used two eggs instead of one because the cereal needed extra moisture and rising power. Not sure if the longer baking time was due to the cereal or the large muffin tin or probably both but they baked for about 25 min.

Followed the recipe exactly and I think it's a great breakfast muffin. Hearty, healthy, and not super sweet like the ones at the market. I'll make them again.

These are SO good and filled with good things!  Could probably use even less sugar.  I bake them a little longer than the recipe says - about 20 minutes or so.

Easy to make muffins!  I made just like the recipe calls, my kids liked them and didn't realize it was something that is actually good for them.  Next time I may use applesauce in place of the oil as suggested.  Loved the suggestions of other fruits, pumpkin and chocolate chip sound good, it may be my next attempt.  Thanks ZOPOOH for the recipe!

My favorite muffin recipe ever!  Have made these so many times in the last few months.  We substitute different fruits for the blueberries sometimes.  And add a teaspoon of cinnamon.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! I wanted a muffin that was healthy yet still yummy and one that my 16 month old would enjoy, and these were a definate hit - will make them over and over again - the only thing i did differently was use 2% milk as i didn't have any buttermilk on hand, they turned out great and very easy to make!i would suggest these muffins to everyone you won't be sorry!

These tasted good and I was impressed with the overall "healthiness" factor. What I was disappointed in was the consistency of the muffins-- I think you add too much liquid to the batter. Next time I might consider adding less milk.

Really good healthy muffin! I altered the recipe to make it healthier, used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white. I used all whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of oatmeal.

I love these muffins! I used all whole wheat flour, and replaced half the white sugar with brown.  You can probably get away with a little less too - they were plenty sweet. I'll be making these again soon.

These are sooo good. I used ground almond and flax seed mill instead of wheat germ and oat bran because that's what I had on hand. I also skipped the banana and sub with apple sauce. They came out moist, not too sweet like a lot of muffins are.   My best friend's 7 year old ate them too! (She normally doesn't like sweets, cake, fruit and won't touch them.) Will definitely make these again. I don't feel guilty eating these.

Yum! Didn't have oat bran, so I doubled the wheat germ. Added about half a cup of extra blueberries and left out the walnuts (personal preference). Otherwise, stuck to the recipe. Everyone loves them!

I doubled the recipe and added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves. I also subbed the buttermilk for regular milk since I rarely have buttermilk on hand. Added in 1/2 a cup of flax seed. With those changes, this was a tasty recipe. My kids loved them.

Very yummy!  I made these almost exactly as directed (left out walnuts as I didn't have any) and instead of using the oil, I used about 3 TBSPS of unsweetened applesauce and added a tsp of a spice mix I have (cloves, cin, ginger, nutmeg).  I was able to get 14 muffins which tasted great and are healthy too, double plus in my books!  Next time I will add extra blueberries as I just barely had a cup!

I made these using everyone's suggested changes and they weren't very good.  I would have given them 2 stars, and they did turn out a gross green color.  I decided to make them again because I really wanted them to turn out well (and I bought a whole box of oat bran that I need to use up.) This time I followed the suggested recipe with a few small changes: applesauce instead of a banana (since my boyfriend ate the last one) and strawberries instead of blueberries (because I used them all in the first batch). This time they were fantastic!  I love them. I think I'll try to make some changes one at time, like all whole wheat flour or brown sugar instead of white.  But the original recipe is really good.

These were excellent for a "health" muffin!  Thank you for the recipe.  I added alot of fresh blueberries because I LOVE them.  Omitted the oat bran and upped the oats.  Added some cinnamon.

These were awesome! I used a half stick of melted butter in place of the oil and banana. I left out the oat bran and nuts. I added about 1/4 cup skim milk because the batter was pretty thick. This is now my favorite blueberry muffin recipe!

All wheat flour, 1/2 cup oats (no oat bran), 1/2 cup brown sugar (no white), and 1 1/2 bananas were the changes I made.  My 4 year old is on his third!!

The flavor of these muffins was just ok. I will probably make again but will sub brown sugar for the white,add way more blueberries, and I think it would make a better loaf then a muffin. They were however super moist and healthy for a morning snack!

Delicious, healthy muffin recipe. I doubled the recipe and followed the advice of other reviewers and used applesauce instead of oil, and brown sugar instead of white. This is a recipe I will make more often, next week they may be raspberry, or apple muffins.  I omitted the nuts in half the batter so that my granddaughter could take some to school (because of the nut free policy at most schools these days).

These were a big hit at our house, even though they are "healthy" muffins. I also ommitted the oil, substituted 1/2 Cup applesauce and no banana. Adding cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice was perfect. We will make them again and again! I made a struessel topping using butter substitute, brown sugar, oats, chopped walnuts, flour and cinnamon and put it on just prior to baking. Fantastic!

SO DELICIOUS!  Naturally, I made modifications based on other reviews.  1/2cup brown sugar instead of white sugar.  1/2cup applesauce instead of the banana and oil.  Added 1/2tsp Nutmeg and 1tsp Cinnamon.  I used probably 1.5 cups of blueberries, because I had so many.  OMG these are so amazing.  The double batch I made will be lucky to last two days.  And such a cheap breakfast item... each muffin came to 13 cents each NOT including the fruit (that was free, so I couldn't estimate).

This is an awsome recepie! I just made it and my family ate half of the batch already. I did some subs as I didn't have wheat germ or oat bran I put in flax meal and I grinded some quick oats into flour like texture. Didn't matter, the muffins came out moist and fluffy. I'll make these again and again. I'll try other flavours too as suggested.

Yummy! So moist, delicious, and healthy! I used 1/2 c. regular oats because I didn't have oat bran or quick oats and they turned out great. This is my favorite blueberry muffin by far!

These were awesome!  I don't like nuts, and I didn't have oat bran so I replaced both of those ingredients with granola.  I also added extra blueberries and an extra mashed banana.  Turned out awesome!  We ate them in less than 12 hours!

These are a great muffin. I read the reviews and made some changes as suggested.  I added the applesauce instead of the banana, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Added the oil as suggested in the recipe,as this made for a more tender muffin. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and substituted wheat bran for the wheat germ.  Very satisfied with these changes and will make often.

These were great, but with a few changes. 1) As per others' recommendations, I used 1/2 cup applesauce in the place of banana and 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the place of the white sugar 2) I used an extra 1/4 cup of ground-up oats in the place of the wheat germ because I didn't have any 3) I omitted the walnuts 4) I used all whole wheat flour  They were delicious, but BEWARE I ended up have to bake them for at least 20 minutes or else they were still mushy on the inside.

I made a few changes - 1/2 C br. sugar instead of 3/4 white, T of applesauce in place of oil, didn't have oat bran on hand so used wheat bran instead, and used 1 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 C white flour. Most of these changes make this recipe just a tad healthier than it already is, and they turned out delicious! I might like them a little sweeter, so I might stick to the 3/4 C sugar instead of the 1/2 C br. sugar I tried this time around.

Wow. These were so good. So soft and moist. I try to avoid sugar for my kids, so I substituted with honey--so healthy! I will definitely be making these again.

Very good recipe.  I added sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds cranberries and raisins.  I have made these a couple of times and always use what I have on hand.  I also use Splenda, egg replacement and no salt. They still taste great.

Amazing!  I love these muffins, and the reviews were very helpful.  Everyone who has tried them has asked for the "secret" recipe! Healthy - and actually filling. It's also been fun altering them, you really can't mess them up (and I can mess up anything).  Thanks for the great recipe!

these are great! i've been on the lookout for a tasty go-to muffin recipe and i think i've found it. got the ingredients mixed up and ready for the muffin cups in about ten minutes flat. muffins baked up gorgeously, nice and high. very moist, tender, and otherwise delicious. i added nearly a cup more blueberries and subbed applesauce for the banana, but that was it. great recipe!

So good, much better than another low-fat banana muffin recipe I have used in the past. I will use this recipe from now on. I put in 2 bananas and yogurt instead of buttermilk because that is what I had, still great tasting!

These muffins turned out fabulously!  I had to make some changes since I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ.  Instead, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup quick oats.  I also substituted unsweetened applesauce for the banana based on other reviews (a little more than 1/4 cup), and 1/2 cup brown sugar plus 1/4 cup splenda in place of the white sugar.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/2 cup fat-free milk plus 1/2 cup low-fat sour cream.  And to top it off, I used dark chocolate chips instead of blueberries!  (Hey, I saved enough calories elsewhere, right?)  I baked them for 17 minutes, and they were GREAT!  Moist and soft - way better than any of the other healthy muffin recipes I've tried!

I LOVE these muffins!  I have to eat a high fiber diet and that's originally why I tried them.  Boy am I glad I did!  I get to have my blueberry muffin without all of the guilt! I add 1 1/2 to 2 cups of blueberries, because I like blueberries in every bite.

Super yummy!! I didn't have any oat bran and I used honey instead of sugar. These muffins are great and I don't feel guilty eating them. I was watching them bake in the oven and I was scared they were going to overflow ad make a mess, but that didn't happen. Will make over and over again.

These are pretty good! I'm not a big fan of banana so I think they would taste better for me if I used applesauce. I didn't have any oat bran so I used 1/4 cup of flax seed. Also I didn't have blueberries so I used raspberries and used applesauce instead of oil. Also didn't have buttermilk so I used 1Tbs vinegar and enough milk to make a cup. Making all the changes that I did they still turned out good. Even my 2 year old liked them and she doesn't like much!

These muffins are delicious! I couldn't find oat bran, so I doubled the oats and "made" buttermilk by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to a cup of milk. Everyone in my family raved about these! I made a triple batch the second time around and they froze well. This will be a staple for us!

I just made a double batch of these on faith. Well, glad I did because the kids are gobbling them up. I'm always looking for healthier versions of traditional foods that my kids will eat. Well, this totally scores! I used frozen blueberries and it worked great. Thanks for sharing!

These muffins are SO yummy!  I did change a few things to make them even more healthy - added applesauce instead of oil and replaced all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  I also used whole oats in place of the oat bran, since I didn't have oat bran, and ran the oats through the food processor.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will be making this one over and over again.

Fabulous!  I replaced white sugar with brown sugar and used applesauce in place of banana.  I also used all whole wheat flour.  Got lots of compliments from my family, neighbors and co-workers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I made these with the only substitution being brown sugar for the white. I still used 3/4 cup, but didn't pack it. Definitely a keeper!

Here's how I modified it: No oat bran, no oil, no buttermilk, and no banana. I halved the recipe (to see how they would come out) and substituted some of the items above: another 1/8 cup of Quaker quick oats (didn't have any oat bran), 1/4 cup Mott's Original applesauce and 1% milk (for banana and buttermilk). I also used an egg white instead of a whole egg, 1/4 cup of white and 1/4 cup light brown sugar instead of just using all white sugar, and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon (to the applesauce). The modifications were mostly for taste (I don't like bananas or buttermilk).

I had to cook these for 22 minutes at 350 in a Caphalon muffin pan. I always find that when using Caphalon, things need to cook a bit longer. They came out perfect, and they taste and look great. They look better than the picture!

For diet purposes I calculated my modifications (using thedailyplate.com):
191 calories, 4g fat, 1mg cholesterol, 194 mg sodium, 34g carbs, 20g sugar, 3g fiber (to make them more healthy I would next time add more fiber), and 5g fat per muffin.

I had to make some substitutions, so I hate giving a rating, but I didn't have oatbran. I threw in some flax seed and upped the oatmeal - it is definitely a dense batter. I used cupcake cups for half the batch, and they are very difficult to get out of the cups - half the muffin sticks to the paper. The high moisture is nice (I was short some blueberries and threw in some chopped strawberries, so that had an effect too), and the flavour is really good. I'd like to make them again with honey and the right amount of bluberries (no strawberries!)

Fabulous!  I make these all the time with a few adjustments and they are AWESOME!!  I use brown sugar instead of white and use 1/2 cup - they don't need all that sugar.  I use ground flax seed instead of wheat germ because I don't usually have wheat germ on hand.  These are good with regular milk but even better if you have the buttermilk!  You could even substitute some applesauce for the oil if you want to reduce the fat further.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just what I was looking for! A sweet and moist blueberry muffin without all of the guilt. 

I used fresh blueberries from the warehouse store. I did not have buttermilk, so I substituted half and half with a squeeze of lemon juice and lemon zest. I did not taste the banana, which I was worried about, and in fact, might try cutting the sugar back a little bit next time if both my banana and my blueberries are ripe and sweet. 

As an experiment, I added a spoonful of cream cheese and several raspberries to the center of a few. It was a real treat! Next time I will experiment with adding flax seed and other nuts for added texture and nutrition.

Update: I could definately taste the bananas the second day and the muffins did not keep well.

I did not care for these at all.  They were too heavy and mealy, not enjoyable.  Maybe I'm just not used to bran style muffins.

These were awesome! They're not going to taste like your regular bakery blueberry muffin but they're fabulous nonetheless. I used ground flaxseed instead of oat bran because that's what I had on hand. Also used 2 mashed bananas per one reviewer's suggestion, and thought it really added moisture. My muffins tasted like banana oat muffins with blueberries! I used frozen blueberries coated in flour and they came out perfectly. Will definitely make again!

These really are the best muffins ever, and the fact that they are good for you makes this one a 10+++ recipe.  I've made these muffins 4 times in less than 2 weeks because I can't stop eating them and I don't need to because these are good for you!
I follow the recipe except I use brown sugar instead of white, and add two bananas instead of 1.  Because blueberries aren't in season I add frozen.  For those who want to eliminate the grey-looking muffins, I coat the blueberries liberally in flour before adding them to the batter.  This helps the grey colour somewhat.

wonderful!
i easily doubled the recipe and went with some alterations other reviewers commented on.  i substituted brown sugar instead of white, used only whole wheat flour, and added fresh raspberries to the blueberry portion.  since i doubled it, i needed two bananas but only had one, so i added a 1/2 cup of applesauce, which made me think to leave out the oil.  accidentally, i did not put in the oat bran, but i will try and remember next time.  w/ all these substitutions & deletions, is it possible to have a horrible combination for muffins?  i haven't found one yet!  these things were so flavorful & delicious!  good thing they're chocked full of healthy nutrients, 'cause they don't last long in my house!

These are some of my favorite muffins to make, but with so many ingredients take a little more time than I often have.  I don't use nuts, used all whole wheat flour, mashed a strawberry instead of a banana, did the 1 T lemon juice to milk trick for the buttermilk.

Really good. This is a very very filling muffin. I used dried cranberries and currants instead of blueberries. I liked it because when I eat muffins I do not like that they normally are so sweet it is almost like eating cake. These are sweet yet not like eating spongecake. I used sugar in the raw instead of what sugar. I live at 7,000+ elevation and sometimes undercook things by accident. It happened with the muffins a little mushy on the inside but very delicious.

A very good muffin, made even better by the fact that it's also pretty darn healthy!  Based on the earlier suggestions, I made my own modifications.  I doubled the recipe and ended up making almost 30 muffins (they were a little on the small side).

Since cranberries are currently in season, I substituted them for the blueberries.  I omitted the oat bran and instead substituted approximately the same amount of all purpose flour. For the doubled recipe, I added 1/2 cup Splenda and 1 cup brown sugar. I also added 2 t cinnamon, 1 t nutmeg and 1 t allspice.

They baked up moist, weren't too sweet, and were not as heavy as I expected, considering the amount of wheat flour.

Truly a recipe that can be modified fairly extensively and STILL come out great!  I'll definitely be making these again!

Excellent recipe!  Just what I was looking for.  I did make some changes out of necessity, but the basic list ingredients are fantastic.  Since I only had 3/4 cup of buttermilk, I added some sour cream to make up the rest, I used applesauce in place of mashed bananas, because I was out and also doubled up on the wheat germ again b/c I didn't have oat bran, but it still came out perfectly.  The muffin is light and moist and not too sweet.  Fantastic as a quick breakfast on the go! Thanks!

I have made these every time I have a ripe banana sitting around.  Love Love this recipe and so do my husband and children.  I usually do 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup white flour.  I also have made them with a cup of plain or vanilla yogurt in place of the buttermilk and they are fabulous. (Just stir in a little milk if the batter seems too thick).  I also tried them with 1 cup of canned pumpkin and 1/2 cup mini choc. chips instead of blueberries and banana per another reviewers comments and they were fabulous.  LOVE this recipe!

So once again, another yummy muffin recipe from the AllRecipes bank!  These muffins were so flavorful!  I used whole white flour, used 1/2 c ground oats as I didn't have oat flour, and 1/4 c ground flax seed for the wheat germ.  Omitted the walnuts, and didn't have a banana so I used a single-serving cup of vanilla yogurt.  I also used canned skim milk for the buttermilk.  I think the yogurt added some extra moisture, so they took an additional 10 minutes to cook.  But they are the best!  Can't wait to see what my kids think of them in the morning for breakfast!

This recipe is awesome. Everyone in my family enjoys these. I bake them for about 7 minutes longer than the recipe calls for and they turn out perfect. Today I made them with a not-so-healthy streusel topping - 1/4 c butter, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Sprinkle on top of muffins right before you bake them.

These were very good!  However, I tried to make mini muffins out of them, and they kind of fell apart in the pan, so I would suggest NOT makinig mini muffins.  I still had some batter left over from that, so I put it in a loaf pan.  The blueberries kind of sunk to the bottom, but it still tasted great.  The blueberries that I used were really big, so that may have caused the problems.  On the most part though, these were great.  My little sister and her friend helped make them, and they both thought they were delicious!

I've made it twice now.  The first time, I did it as directed except I didn't have any bananas, so I omitted them.  The muffins turned out still well with a nice light golden color, but perhaps not as sweet as it could have been.  However, I think the blueberries in the muffin make up for it.  

The second time, I had just a teensy bit of buttermilk left and some blueberry low-fat yogurt.  This time, I had my bananas so I threw them all in, replacing the 1 cup of buttermilk with about 2 tablespoons of buttermilk and  6 oz. of blueberry yogurt.  I was worried I didn't have enough to substitute for a whole cup of buttermilk so I threw another tablespoon of 1% milk.  This time my muffins turned out sweeter ( I suspect it was due to the banana and perhaps the yogurt).  However, the muffins had slight darker blue tinge throughout and were very moist.  Almost too moist in my opinion, so I think I should have baked it more or find ways to reduce the water content.  Maybe omit the banana next time; use real buttermilk - or milk substitute, and add more sweetner (perhaps honey?) to create a firmer, but retaining the same level of sweetness type of muffin.  I'll try with my next batch.

Finally, I think fresh blueberries makes a huge difference in this recipe.  I've never had fresh blueberries before in my muffins (I've always used the ones out of the can included with those muffin mix boxes).  Fresh ones are definitely plumper and provide more berry flavor per bite.  :)

I took the advice of others and used brown sugar instead of white. I didn't have any wheat germ, so increased the oatmeal instead. I love them, very tasty. My two year old doesn't like the blueberries in the muffin, so next time I'll do one batch without.

A very tasty recipe.  I did not have any whole wheat flour and substitute regular white flour with no problems.  Also did not have wheat germ, so used 1/2 c. oat bran and left out wheat germ.  Still tasty, firm and excellent.

Amazing! I substituted  apple sauce for the oil, and used bananas instead of blueberries since it was what I had on hand. They turned out so moist and delicious! This is definitely a keeper!

True story of a college student cook.  I didn't have oat bran, eggs, blueberries, buttermilk, or bananas, so I substituted flax, dried cranberries, yogurt, milk, and applesauce, ran to the store to buy eggs.  I ran out of time to bake these before class, so I heated my oven up to 350, baked for three minutes before turning my oven off and leaving the muffins to bake in the residual heat.  When I came back from class, my apartment smelled heavenly and the muffins tasted wonderful!

These are really good, the health aspect of this does not comprimise the taste.  I have a program to do a calorie count on recipes and each muffin has about 170 calories in it. I am lactose intolerant and so I used soy milk instead and no one could tell the difference.

Great recipe! Not too sweet. Used an extra banana and dried blueberries instead of fresh. Very tasty. Also good without blueberries and nuts. Recipe doubles well.

Delicious! I substituted fresh cranberries for the blueberries, almonds for the walnuts, flax seed for wheat germ (couldn't find it), plain lowfat yogurt for buttermilk, and applesauce for the banana. These muffins have a good texture.

These are DELICIOUS and you feel like you are eating something nutritious. Didn't have oats so I used honey almond granola, also used less banana and sugar. Still great. Next time I'll try swapping prune/applesauce baby food for the oil. (Works fine in my oatmeal raisin cookie recipe). Couldn't find oat bran ... used wheat bran. Good, healthy recipe ... hope there are some left for breakfast!

Of course i changed it up for my chocolate loving husband and subbed c.chips for blueberries - a big hit I added a cinnamin sugar-oatmeal topping.  They were very good, very moist and lasted for days.  Who could ask for more - thanks for the recipe, a keeper in my house!

I really liked these muffins.  Not too sweet, but hardly drab.  Used 1-1/2 cups blueberries, no nuts, apple sauce instead of banana and "vanilla, butter and nut" extract, which is wonderful for baking, instead of plain vanilla extract.  I'll definately make again.

I made these for my diabetic father-in-law, but he only got two!  My husband, mother, and an elderly friend got into them and I only have three left!  Super recipe, great fiber.  I made these per the recipe (only changing Splenda for sugar) and only one person could taste banana.  A must have for a high-fiber low sugar diet!!

Pretty tasty, I especially liked the hearty, nutty flavor of these muffins. I only give them 4 instead of 5 stars because, lets face it, decadantly calorie filled muffins taste just a bit more delicious. Still, good recipe.

I'm always on the look out for healthy recipes that I can feel good about giving my one year old, but that my husband will still eat.  This definately is a keeper.  I didn't have the bran so I used milled flax seed and they came out great.  My bananas were kind of small so I used two and the result was moist and delicious. I also only used 1/2 cup sugar and they were sweet enough. Great recipe!

This were yummy.  I followed a previous suggestion and substituted flax meal for wheat germ.  I used toasted almond slices since that is what I had on hand. Soy milk instead of milk and I sprinkled the top with granola and a couple banana chips.   They really looked wholesome and delicious. thanks

I will give this a four, not a five because the banana had an overwhelming flavor. My son who will eat even my worst muffin attempts wouldn't eat this because of the banana flavor. 
It was great otherwise . Light, fluffy, moist and tasty. It would make a great loaf as well. It was healthy which is a great bonus.

I had to make a few substitutions due to lack of ingredients and being too lazy to go to the store. I did 1/2 cup quick steel cut oats and 1/2 cup of high fiber Trader Joe’s cereal. I had no oat bran and no wheat germ.  I added the TJs cereal to the wet ingredients so that it would soften out its shape. I had no buttermilk so I did 3/4 cup half and half + 1/4 cup water + 1 tbsp lemon juice. Also added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I would probably do only 1/2 cup sugar next time as I found these a tad sweet. Turned out very tasty though!

Delicious! I was looking for recipes to use extra whole wheat flour and wheat germ. This is a keeper! I used mini chocolate chips instead of blueberries as I had them on hand. Skipped the banana and used milk instead of buttermilk. Added the vanilla, cinnamon & nutmeg per other reviews. Will be trying other varieties soon. Thank you!

We have enjoyed playing around with this recipe.  The first time, I made a lot of the 'healthful' substitutions others suggested such as only using wheat flour, replacing oil with applesauce, replacing white sugar with brown, etc. My husband and I thought they were fine, but my grand-daughter was put off by the texture and color.  i guess she was expecting something like the out-of-the-bag mini muffins. My next batch followed the original recipe more closely and used 2/3 of the sugar suggested. With some additional expectation setting, this batch of muffins was much easier for the grandkids to eat.  This will likely become my go-to muffin recipe. I am planning another batch this weekend!

Loved these! Used all Whole wheat flour instead of half and half, less sugar, flaxseed meal instead of wheat germ and regular 2% milk instead of buttermilk. I am going to try no sugar next time and see how they taste!

These are delish!  I substituted a container of Greek yogurt mixed with milk for the buttermilk, used all whole wheat flour,  and unprocessed wheat bran instead of oat bran, added some flax seed, cut the sugar a bit and added a half teaspoon of cinnamon.  Also I baked these for an extra 8 or so minutes because I made them so big.

Absolutely the perfect combination of blueberries, bananas, and walnuts. I cut the sugar down a bit ... used 1/2 cup. My muffins needed closer to 25 minutes in the oven... maybe because I used frozen blueberries and banana. Muffins freeze well. Will be making these again!

I made these and they rocked.  I did substitute almond flour for whole wheat and I did not have any cornstarch.  I also used almond milk with a little lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. I added chia instead of wheat germ.  I used 2 bananas.  My family loves them- I will make again!

Yes, I made changes because I didn’t have several of your ingredients.  I added more oats and bran cereal and no wheat germ.  Also, I couldn’t add a banana because I didn’t have one.  Skipped the walnuts because I plan on giving one or two to a 17 month old and don’t want him choking on nuts.  The blue berry-bran muffins look just like your pictures and taste fine.  Sure do hope they freeze well.  Plan to make them again!

Excellent muffins! I didn't change a thing except they required longer to bake and overflowed a little. Next time I won't fill to the top as the recipe said. Very moist and delicious.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!!!! These are so good, especially when they are so warm! The blueberries are so juicey!! After trying the first one I couldn't stop and ended up eating three!! I do think they are sweet enough that some of the added sugar could be cut down. I am definitely going to try and cut it back. The banana adds such a great flavor and I love the nuts! The texture is INCREDIBLE!!  I used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. Only issues are that bake time seemed off. I had to bake them for like 23 mins. Could be my oven though. Also, I filled them to the top of the cupcake foil cups and this wasn't a good idea as they over flowed making them look bad. I think filling 3/4 of the way is more appropriate when using the cupcake cups. It might of fit had I not used them. Great recipe! THANKS!! :)

Made a double batch. Had 5 small bananas that needed to be used ASAP. Used them all. I did not have enough blueberries.  I picked some fresh goji berries and added them in.  Hubby ate two right away-hot! Said they are good!  The banana flavor needs to ripen.  I am sure by tomorrow they will have more banana flavor. Made 12 muffins and two bread loaves, which needed to cook a little longer.

I've been collecting healthy recipes and tried this one.  I love, love, love these muffins!  I cut down on the sugar to 1/2 cup of  brown sugar loosely spooned into measuring cup (cutting down on my sugar). I've actually made this about 6 times, and played around using some  different ingredients.  One thing you need to be sure of is to NOT cook for too long.  I take out before it browns.  I got one batch slightly browned and it wasn't nearly as moist.  I've substituted the oat bran with ground flax seed,  you can make your own oat bran by simply putting the oats in a blender.  I like to use a little more banana than just one, I use 2 smaller bananas. This is one you can play around with according to what you have on hand.  As soon as I run out, I immediately make a new batch, keep in refrigerator ( hidden from my husband, I know that sounds bad, ha!). One other thing I changed to make it better for my healthier way of eating, is that instead of using 1 1/2 of white flour, I use 3/4 cup unbleached flour, and 3/4 cup almond flour.  It's a healthy, yummy and easy snack or quick breakfast.
A couple more things I've done ... I like using Almond extract instead of vanilla, just because I love the flavor.  Another is, after reading other reviews, I remember having the issue of the batter turning a wierd color due to using the frozen blueberries which bleed into the batter.  I fixed that by not stirring the blueberries with the batter.  Instead I spoon a small amount of batter, then

We really enjoyed these and they were so moist!  I did change some things....I used flax seeds because that is what I had on hand, I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce/no banana or oil and I only had a bag of frozen mixed berries...also I used only brown sugar 1/2 cup packed but next time I will use 3/4 cup... and last of all I used only whole wheat flour! Thank you for this wonderful healthy muffin that we can enjoy with no guilt!! I am looking forward to changing it up  with some other fruits!

Excellent recipe! And very forgiving to substitutes and additions. I make them often and they always turn out well! I use frozen or fresh berries, soy milk or skimmed milk (buttermilk is hard to get here) and varied nuts and types of meal/flour.

I didn't have the blueberries, so I made them exactly like the recipe calls for, but without those.  It was my first time baking something from scratch and the recipe was easy to follow.  It was pretty quick and the final product was very good, but left a bitter aftertaste when finished.  I don't know if the missing blueberries caused that, but I may try a bit more baking soda next time to see if it helps.  All in all, they are pretty good and my kid loved them.  I will try them again with the blueberries and update my review afterward.

I had to make a few alterations because I didn't have wheat germ or oat bran. I increased the oats to compensate for the oat bran, and I used some cracked wheat cereal instead of the wheat germ, but I cooked it first to soften it up. That may have increased the liquid a little, but it also added to the moistness of the muffins. I also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.

I used pecans instead of walnuts and orange extract instead of vanilla, because I love the combination of blueberry and orange flavors. And then I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar before baking them. That made a nice crispy, slightly sweet coating on top! Yummy!

Good muffin recipe. Everyone like them. Only change I made was reducing  the sugar by 75% (personal taste). Will make again, thanks for the recipe.

It's blueberry season and I needed a recipe to use up some blueberries.  These had such great flavor!  I did reduce the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup, and my oat bran was expired so I added an extra 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour.  I plan on making these again this week, this time with the oat bran.

Great healthier option for muffins.  Used walnuts but will try almonds next time.  Only small change was using an orange infused EVOO in place of vegetable oil.  Everyone loved these and no one guessed they were "healthy".

This is a fantastic recipe! I freeze berries when in season so this is way to use them. I used blackberries and replaced the bran with raisin brain crushed up and coconut oil along with following other suggestions.

I made buttermilk with 1 T of vinegar to 1 cup milk.....and then I combined the wheat germ, oat bran and oatmeal and just put in 3/4 cut of instant oats.   I don't keep that other stuff in the house anyway.   They turned out great

This recipe was delicious! The only thing I changed was adding extra blueberries. Otherwise I made the recipe as is and it was a hit with the whole family. Adding the walnuts the recipe recommended was a nice touch. I will definitely make again.

I made these for my toddler and just left out the sugar. She loves them! I put two cups of berries in them. I also started playing with recipe by adding chopped spinach and grated zucchini in them and she still loves them. I will try adding grated carrots next time as well.

Thanks for a great recipe, great base and changes still produce a delicious muffin. 1st time I swapped out the Wheat germ with oats (did not have any) but followed everything else. 2nd time, used raisins instead of blueberries (had none),  apple instead of bananas (Mom does not like) and all whole wheat flour, oats and ground flax seeds, reduced sugar (personal preference) and  sprinkled sunflower seeds on the top. Still had a wonderful soft muffin. Will be making again, often.

I used mashed pears since out of banana, and only 1/2 cup of cane sugar and it was plenty sweet for me.  I'd cut back on the soda a little. I could taste it mildly. Love the fluffy texture of these though. Really yummy.

Delicious. Love  that it has only 1 tbsp of oil!
I added about 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed, an extra half cup of blueberries, and used natural yogurt (with no thickeners) instead of buttermilk.

Great base recipe. Agree with other reviewers that say you can make modifications by keeping the wet to dry ratio. My husband is diabetic, so I used Splenda granulated instead of sugar. I also didn't have the exact ingredients, so I did 1 c flour,  1/4 c flax seed meal, 1/4 wheat germ, 1/2 c oat flour (blended rolled oats), and 1/4 quick cook oats. I also didn't have carrots, and my husband hates bananas, so I did 1 c of unsweetened apple sauce, and no carrots or nuts. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. I added 1/2 large dark chocolate chips to 1/2 the batter, and 1/2 c blueberries to the other. 

The tops of mine did not look very dark when they were done, probably because of the splenda versus real sugar. I baked them for about 18 minutes, rotating halfway through. Then let them cool in the pan for about 5 minutes. Before moving them to a rack to finish cooling. I also used muffin liners. It made 12 standard size muffins, plus 1 large one. I filled my tins about 3/4 full.

I'm thinking to reduce the Splenda to maybe 1/2 c and reduce the apple sauce by 1/2 and add shredded zucchini next time!

They were very moist and soft, but next time I would add 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon. However, if you spread a little butter and honey over them as is they are sweet enough. I actually spread some pumpkin butter over them and that really completed the flavors well.

Took advice of others and made a couple changes. I didn't have wheat germ, so I added 2T oat bran and 2T oats. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Final change was adding only 1/2 C sugar. Next Time, I'll use just 1/4 C sugar. Love these muffins, will make again!

10/26/2015 UPDATE:  I made these today, using the same changes I mentioned earlier, except I backed the sugar down to 1/4 C.  They're super tasty and I don't miss the extra sugar. Next time, I'll use even less. The blueberries are plenty sweet for me, the sugar addict.

10/30/2015 UPDATE:  I think I have my muffins down finally. Today, I used only whole wheat flour and 1/4 C brown sugar (not packed). They are perfect for me and Husband, the guy who hates blueberries.

12/1/2015 UPDATE: Used wheat germ, hated the muffins. Won't use it again. Also, when using Temp-tations muffin pans, bake for 26 minutes, as cups are smaller than typical muffin tins.

Surprisingly good for such a healthy muffin! The only change I made was using white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Next time I will add lemon zest and juice.

I had some ripe bananas to use up so I made this recipe with  frozen blueberries.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  It turned out great and since I only filled the muffin cups about 3/4 high, I ended up with 18 muffins in my batch.

I wished I could give this 4.5 stars. They are very good but not 5 stars. Followed all directions as is, except I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon as some reviewers suggested. They are very good but are very low fat. I strongly dislike greasy commercial muffins but these were a little too low fat, they were just about perfect  topped with a small amount of butter/marg.

I was missing many ingredients and they were still good. I had only white flour and sugar and 1percent milk. I did add some nutmeg and my son and mom loved them. I used 1cup of oatmeal because I didn't have wheat germ or bran.

I made these muffins for my mom. She absolutely loved them, as did I. I am supposed to be on a diet but I couldn't resist! I did make a few changes, though. I used ground almonds instead of the bran and I used applesauce instead of the banana. Thank you for a wonderful recipe:) !

I made this recipe gluten free and my whole family--two adults, four kids-- loves it!
Here are the gluten free substitutions I use:
For both white and whole wheat flour -- g-free all purpose flour blend*
For 1/4 C oat bran -- 1/4 C flax
For 1/4 C wheat germ -- 1/4 C almond flour

Also, if you make your own Greek yogurt, you often have a bunch of whey sitting around. I have used it as a substitution for the buttermilk and it tastes great with fewer fat calories and added protein.

*everyone has their favorite g-free flour blends. Mine is 1 1/4 C white sorghum flour, 1 1/4 C white rice flour, 1/2 C tapioca flour, and 2 tsp xanthan gum.

These are definitely "healthy tasting" muffins.  Not sweet at all.  They're dense and flavorful but I can imagine if you don't make adjustments like I did and add some spices (I used cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice) they would be very bland.  I left out the banana, added ? c. coconut, substituted extra oats (used regular not quick cooking) and whole wheat flour for the bran and wheat germ.  I also used applesauce instead of oil and didn't have buttermilk on hand so used about ¾ c. plain yogurt and another ½ c. They're low in sugars and high in fiber.  I added an additional ¼ c. or so of walnuts and those and the fresh blueberries I used really make the flavor stand out.

A good healthy fibre rich muffin. Made a few changes though - used all whole wheat flour, 2 bananas, brown sugar, I cup milk with a tbsp of lemon instead of buttermilk. I was happy with the results. Will definitely make these again.

I really wanted to like them.   I found both this recipe and another called "Low-Fat Blueberry Bran Muffins" at the same time in my search for a more nutritional muffin.  I made them both within days of each other and there was no comparison.   These are dry, flavorless and have that roughage texture.    And they only get drier as the days go on so I still have 6 sitting on the counter with no takers.   The other recipe's muffins were gone in a flash, so I'm afraid the print out for this one is going straight to the recycle bin.

AWESOME!! As so many others have stated this recipe is VERY amenable to variation!  I used banana and strawberries ...yum yum! I used all wheat pastry flour, 1/2 brown sugar- 1/2 Splenda (no white sugar), strawberry applesauce for the oil, and 2 Egg Beaters in place of whole egg, 2 packs bananas and cream instant oatmeal in place of oatmeal and oat bran (didn't have). Used slivered almonds for walnuts (personal choice).. Also added almond extract, cinnamon, nutmeg.  INCREDIBLE!!  Hubby even likes them!
Can't wait to try other flavor combos!

Blueberry muffins were a Christmas morning tradition when I was growing up, but until this recipe, I had not found one I wanted to make my own. We really liked these! Didn't have oat bran, so I used wheat bran instead. Since DH is diabetic, I substituted stevia blend for the sugar. Also, my banana was a bit small, so I used about 1/2 cup applesauce, omitting the oil, and these were fabulous! However, other than substituting the stevia blend for sugar, I think these would be fabulous as written.

Very nice texture and taste. Instead of a whole cup of blueberries, I added maybe 2/3 c. blueberries and made up the rest (to 1 c.) with dried cranberries and a few currants.

I made this recipe exactly as it is, and it's become one of our favorites.  Moist and delicious.  I've also made this recipe with an extra cup of berries, chopped raspberries and strawberries, which is how I make it now.  Delicious!  Easy base to experiment with!

Very happy with these. I made only minor changes - using 1 cup WW flour and 1/2 cup AP flour, ground flaxseed instead of oat bran (which I didn't have), a little brown sugar and stevia blend in place of white sugar, and I omitted the nuts. I ended up using about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries, simply because I needed to use them or lose them. I will continue to play...

These muffins were surprisingly good! They came out really moist, which was especially surprising with only 1 T. of oil! Ours did spread a bit onto the pan, so I'd recommend adding a little more of the dry ingredients and/or baking at a higher temperature next time so the outside bakes quickly enough that they hold their shape while they rise. 

By the way, if your muffins turn green, it's because your blueberries' juice got into the muffin ingredients, and blue+yellow=green. It's not the recipe's fault; it's science. (If your kids eat enough blueberries, their, um, issue will turn green, too.)

I agreed with several, that these don't taste "heathly"...just yummy! The only subs I made were brown sugar for white and flax meal for oat flour. Great to keep on hand for breakfast on the go!

This was great.  We do love fluffy blueberry muffins made with white flour and a streusel topping, but I wanted a healthier everyday muffin for my family.  Followed the recipe pretty close but I did use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white.  I also increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups.  This is definitely our new blueberry muffin recipe.

these were okay for a muffin recipe. For how healthy they were they were good. I doubled it, used all whole wheat flour, left out the oil, used a third of the sugar, added an extra banana and did two cups of oats but left out the wheat germ and oat bran, and mixed two tablespoons of lemon juice with two cups of skim milk for buttermilk. The texture shocked me, it was perfect, well, not fabulous but definitely the best I've seen for such a low fat recipe. But the taste was really not great, it was extremely bland even though I added a little extra vanilla. Definitely some lemon zest would help, but even that I'm not sure would be enough. Maybe some spices? It also definitely needed more salt. When I put a little bit of salted butter on them it was yummy, but that really defeats the purpose of a healthy muffin recipe. So amazing texture for what you get but bad flavour, much improved by salt or extra flavourings.

loved this recipe. the only changes I made were that I used oat flour in place of the wheat, omitted the oat bran and used 1/2 c oats instead, substituted 1/2 c honey for the sugar. Turned out lovely. not overly sweet this way-- but nutritious and wonderful for supper or breakfast. will definitely make again.

Delicious!! I omitted the wheat germ and oat bran (b/c I didn't have them on hand), doubled the wheat flour, used 1 cup of milk with lemon juice (sub for buttermilk); and like user sinsofangels, left out the oil, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp all spice. They looked and tasted great!! I will be making these again!

These turned out great, and I'm not much of a baker! They had a good balance between moisture and the crisp top I like in a muffin. I made a few substitutions:
1. I used only whole wheat flour, since I was out of white.
2. Left out the wheat bran, since I also didn't have it.
3. Whole milk instead of buttermilk.

Next time I might add some cinnamon. Awesome with coffee for my afternoon fika.

Love blueberries but I didn't have milk and banana on hand. Instead used half cup vanilla yogurt, one and quarter cups applesauce and fourth cup honey in place of sugar and oil, added fourth cup ground flax seed instead of wheat germ to flour and oat mixture with one tsp cinnamon. Used two egg whites. Healthy muffins aren't supposed to be super sweet but this one came out just right. Used everything else called for. This recipe can be tweaked easily to satisfy.  A great basic healthy muffin. will bake again.

I love this recipe!  After trying this recipe and finding that we liked it, I combined flour through walnuts (all the dry ingredients--I used 1/2 cup dried blueberries since fresh weren't available) and put them in quart-sized zip lock bags then taped the remaining ingredients list and directions to the outside.  It didn't take long to assemble 6 of these handy mixes.  This makes it super simple to bake a batch of these muffins when I'm too busy to bake.  The only changes I made were to use brown sugar rather than white, replace the vegetable oil with applesauce, and substitute 3/4 cup plain yogurt plus 1/4 cup skim milk for the buttermilk.  I use this recipe regularly.  Perfect for sending out the door with my teenager who insists he doesn't eat breakfast.  He eats these!

A really nice muffin, but a bit sweet.  I think I will cut the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.  Used dried blueberries because I cannot get fresh or frozen where I live.  Also had to use all rolled oats in place of the wheat germ, etc.  Served them warm on Christmas morning and they were actually better a few hours later.  Also used pecans (preference) and felt the nuts really added to the taste/texture. (Kept the rest of the recipe the same.)  A definite keeper. Plan to try them today with dried cherries & almonds. Update: The second time I made these, the banana was riper and a bit bigger than the first attempt.  I would recommend using a small to med banana that is not overly ripe or else these taste like banana muffins with fruit bits.  Half-cup sugar was fine, however.

These are my husband's favorite muffins of all time! Extremely healthy without tasting like it.  I substitute egg whites for the eggs, applesauce for the oil, and 1/2 cup (or less) Blue Agave syrup for the sugar.  I brush warm honey on the tops after they are out of the oven.  They freeze beautifully.

Amazing muffins! I added the spices that the most helpful reviewer suggested. Look forward to making them again... I used frozen blueberries, and if you don't want your batter turning blue, add the berries after all the ingredients are mixed. I put my in when I was mixing all the ingredient together and it turned my batter purple. :P

This is a very, very, very good muffin - moist, not too sweet but sweet enough, substantial but not too heavy.  I have been looking for a very long time to replace a healthy blueberry muffin recipe that I accidentally threw away and this one is great.  It's easy to substitute ingredients and I don't feel like I am giving up anything by eating this healthier choice.  I also love the tip of adding the blueberries to the dry ingredients, eliminating the "bleeding" that happens when adding blueberries to the wet batter.  I didn't have oat bran so I added more oats and ground flax seed.

I absolutely love these muffins! The only change I've made is to use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (and that's mostly because I'm lazy and don't own a 3/4 cup measure).

I followed the recipe but replaced the banana with 1/2 cup of apple sauce (I didn't have any ripe ones to use).  I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  The muffins came out great.  They were moist and not dry.  I did have to bake them for 20 minutes before they were done.  I will keep making this, they tasted great.

Yummy! I had some red huckleberries that I had picked and didn't know what to do with. They are very moist even with just the little oil. I used 1/2 cup thick oats for the oat bran and quick cooking oats and ground flax seed for the wheat germ and toasted hazelnuts for the walnuts. I think if you use this basic recipe and modify somewhat, you are still going to come out with a winner. I might try a little less sugar next time because of personal preference, but am definitely keeping this recipe. Thanks for submitting! :)

These are good... no doubt, but I wouldn't call this a 5 star recipe. I made them 6 days ago and there are still 2 left (in our house, that says a lot). On the upside, they keep very well in the refrigerator. I will probably make these again as lunch snacks for my kids.

Wow!  These are the best.  Made as is the first time.  Too sweet for me and I wasn't fond of the banana.  Have been using 1/2 pint of my home canned rhubard instead and only a scant 1/2 cup sugar along with cinammon, allspice and nutmeg.  Can't stop eating them.  Last night I used 1 cup of mashed canned nectarines with juice as I made them at my BFs place and forgot the rhubard - still awesome.

These are great because they are so easily to modify. I've made these with both saskatoon berries and frozen blueberries. I use wheat bran instead of germ and 1/2 cup of apple sauce since my mom's allergic to bananas. I also add my own topping of oats, flax seed, and brown sugar. Last time I actually forgot to put the oats in the muffins and they still turned out great!

I made some pretty drastic substitutions and made this recipe into one that was wheat-free, dairy-free and sugar-free. The muffins still turned out light, moist and delicious! I used spelt flour for the full amount of flour, and added a bit extra because of the extra moist ingredient (honey). Instead of wheat germ I used extra oats (1/2 cup total). Honey replaced the sugar and I used 1/3 a cup - the muffins were not sweet at all, I might add a bit more honey next time. Mix the honey in with the banana/egg/milk etc mixture. Instead of buttermilk I used about 3/4 a cup canned coconut milk and added water to bring it to a full cup. Again, the results were great. I'll definitely make these again.

. This recipe ROCKS! I used all whole wheat flour, Splenda,  ground flax in place of wheat germ, no egg, 1 tsp cinnamon, skipped the blueberries and added 3 ripe lg banana's, I had no milk so I had to use half and half non soured, and a small handfull of mini chocolate chips. I made them into mini muffins 24alt and one small loaf. These came out moist and delicious my two year old devoured them. Thanx for posting I can't wait to experiment more.

I was skeptical, especially since I had only Whole Wheat Graham Flour and substituted Ground Flax Seed for Oat Bran; however, I sprinkled a little Turbinado Sugar on top and the kids ate them up.  My pickiest eater asked for a second one!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This was a disappointment after reading the rave reviews. It is not the quality muffin I am used to. Calorie Count rates it a B- for nutrition, the same as my canola muffins and the texture, density and moisture is not as good.

2nd Attempt:
I wanted to love this recipe, so I made it again this morning.  It  was like night and day!  I love it with the changes I made:  I increased the whole wheat flour  to 1.5 cups and decreased the white flour to .5 cup, subbed .5 cup applesauce for the banana and eliminated the oil, used strawberries (I was out of blueberries), added 1 tsp. cinnamon, and as before, subbed flax for wheat germ, and soymilk for buttermilk.  Baked for 20 min.  They were perfect and tasted amazing!

1st Attempt:
I was disappointed :((  I used regular oats for quick cooking, ground flax for wheat germ, and soymilk for buttermilk.  Everything else was the same.  They were a soggy mess in the middle.  I baked them for an additional 15 min. (!) with no improvement in the texture.  I'm thinking eliminating the banana might help??

First of all, these muffins are amazing! But since I didn't have some of the ingredients listen I modified the recipe, and created my own DELICIOUS version. Instead of the wheat germ and oat bran, I just used oats, and I substituted the walnuts for hazelnuts. What made my muffins extra delicious and healthy is Whey Protein Powder in vanilla ice cream flavor, which was my substitution for the vanilla extract. These muffins are yummy and VERY filling, perfect for a good breakfast.

When making these, I misread the recipe so had a few more walnuts than called for, but they were fantabulous.  I did follow other reviewers comments and used only oatmeal (old-fashioned-but chopped finer in a mini chopper) and oatbran (it's what I had in my pantry).  Since there are only 2 of us in the house, I froze them and can now nuke one for a guiltless coffee pastry when my husband simply must make that stop at the donut shop.

Great muffins!  I didn't have an wheat germ, so I doubled the oat bran.  I was also out of whole wheat flour, so I used white.  :(    They were delicious and I can't wait to try them using the correct ingrediants!

VERY GOOD!  I doubled this recipe and used 1 cup each white whole wheat flour, whole wheat flour, and oat flour.  I used applesauce instead of banana (didn't have any) and 1/2 raw sugar and 1/2 agave instead of white sugar.  Also added some flax meal.  These still turned our moist and DELICIOUS!!  Also froze very well.  FIVE STARS!

If your looking for a dense, unsweet muffin then this is for you. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the buttermilk which I substituted with milk w/ lemon in it. This muffin was very heavy and was lacking in sweetness, even for my health nut Dad!! I would not make these muffins again.

Super Yummy!!!  My family loved these muffins.  I left out the wheat germ because they didn't sell it at Trader Joe's (where I went to buy all of the ingredients), and I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil because of the health benefits.  FYI, you can use coconut oil in place of vegetable, canola, safflower oil, and it has a very mild flavor, you won't taste a difference.

I, too, made some changes to make them even healthier. I took other reviewers advice and used skim milk w/ 1 Tbsp of lemon juice in place of buttermilk and splenda in place of the sugar. I also substituted applesauce (about 3/4 cup) for the banana and oil (just due to the fact that I am not a fan of bananas). I also made one batch with some cinnamon chips and it turned out GREAT! So good I've made them several times.

I love this muffin recipe. Of course I adjusted mine as well. I used all Whole Wheat White Flour; 3/4 cup splenda; 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend; applesauce instead of bananas; 1/2 cups oats - omitted bran & oil. I made them a bit smaller with 12 regular size muffins and the remaining batter, I made mini muffins for the kids. They loved them and so do I!

Not impressed.  They came out dry and bland, even after adding 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I don't think I'll make these again, and I'm even a "health nut" myself!

Absolutely Awesome. Tossed in a few extra blueberries (favorite fruit, why not?) for good measure. Crunchy texture, juicy berries-I feel healthier already!

My son started to love blueberries for the first time after eating these!  I made the recipe as stated, but omitted the walnuts, and used vinegar to sour some milk, instead of buttermilk.  Everyone loved them at home, and at my son's school!

I just made this muffins and they were fantastic. My nine year old loved them! I did not have some of the ingredients so I took the advice of others and made a few changes. Instead of the oat bran, I increased the oats to 1/2 C. I omitted the nuts, used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c light sour cream, two egg whites, and applesauce instead of the oil. I used frozen wild blueberries ( thawed and drained) and three single serve packets of craisins. What a wonderful wholesome breakfast! I really wanted more than one, but the WW points were 4, so I had to be satisfied with only one. I highly recommend this recipe!

These are very excellent. I also went with applesauce instead of bananas, and add ground flax seed in place of the oil! I will be making these very often. Actually I am making another batch just to take to work!

Very good muffins! I only had all-purpose flour and half n' half so I substituted. I also used two ripe bananas instead of one cause I needed to use them. They tasted great and I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Taste Great! And they are very filling too. One change that I would suggest is adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the matter and sprinkling cinnamon-sugar on the tops when they are half done baking. Mmmmm... Thanks ZOPOOH for the great recipe!

I make these all the time.  I used different fruit in every batch.  I love using bananas and almonds together.  Also have tried cranberry almond and apple raisin.  Always great.  I do use applesauce instead of mashed bananas and also all quick oats, as I had no oat bran.  Turns out perfect every time!

Great recipe! It's so easy to make and super yummy. My hubby who doesn't like whole wheat loved these! And it's great for my 13 month old daughter too - she loved them. The only addition I made was to add some cinnamon. I can't wait to try it with raspberries too! Thanks for sharing it.

First I need to apologize for making some alterations. In doing so, I am doing something others do that often annoys me. I don’t usually rate & review a recipe when I alter but I want to share since I like these so much!   I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ so I replaced them with quick oats using a total of 3/4 cup that I ground up in my Magic Bullet ®.   I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown & added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I didn’t have a banana. I used 1 cup of small frozen blueberries and 1/2 cup of frozen cherries and mixed them with the dry ingredients after the dry ingredients were blended well.  I didn’t have enough walnuts so I just used what I had probably 1/8 cup.  These are great! I’m going to make them again with the same alterations because I like them so much. They have just the right amount of sweetness and flavor and are healthier that regular blueberry muffins. Thanks Zopooh for submitting this recipe!

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have buttermilk, so I subbed 1/2 c. milk + 1/2 tsp. white vinegar + 1/2 c. plain yogurt. I also increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups. I made mini muffins - approximately 38 mini muffins. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very nice recipe. However, I did make a few subs. The 3/4 cup sugar seemed a bit much, so I reduced it to 1/3 cup (I prefer my muffins not to taste like cake). To truly make this recipe even healthier, you may wish to sub the sugar with xylitol. This natural sugar sub is excellent for those who have issues with regular sugar or sugar alternatives like splenda.  Subbed out the buttermilk with plain unsweetened organic yogurt, and olive oil for the veg oil. I eliminated the vanilla and walnuts, and added a pinch of cloves.

I made three batches of these muffins yesterday and my husband said, "these are the best muffins I have ever had, don't give any away"! I took a few hints from the reviews and added raspberries and used pecans. Will defnitely makes again and again.   Sue H

Made some changes!  Used 1/4 cup cracked wheat (soaked) instead of oat bran;1/2 cup sunflower seeds (soaked) instead of nuts;1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk instead of buttermilk.  Very close to the Tim Hortons blueberry multi-grain!

Really good muffin.  I followed the recipe for the most part - subbed the white sugar for 1/2 cup brown and some of the white flour for whole wheat.  They were very tasty and I will be making them again soon!

These are SO tasty!  I modified based on what I had on hand- and they were so good- and I made them very WW friendly- I also froze some of them so I can pop them in my daughter's bag in the morning so she can have a healthy breakfast!  I used way more blueberries than the recipe called for- but I love them!  I couldnt' help it!  (for the record, I used 3/4 c of oatmeal because I didn't have wheat germ or bran- I used 2 egg whites- applesauce instead of oil- I put some cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter and cooked them about 25-28 minutes because they were very moist!)

These were easy to make and taste really good. They aren't too dense and heavy like many "healthy" muffin recipes. I used a really ripe banana, so the banana flavor dominated the blueberries. Might try canned pumpkin or applesause next time for a milder flavor.

Very good, I use a mix of blueberries and raspberries (fresh when in season) and they turn out great every time! Definitely cut the sugar back, I usually do about 1/3 cup packed brown sugar and they are sweet enough, especially if you have very ripe bananas.

Love the recipe. The only change I made was to bake the muffins for 22 minutes. Any less time and they would be underbaked.

Love this one! Husband loves it, son loves it, I love it... couldn't ask for anything more!! I followed some suggestions of 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar, and replaced oil for applesauce. Turns out great. Wheat germ was in the hot cereal aisle. Took me forever to find it!

I tried this with 1/2 cup pumpkin and dark chocolate chips. I cooked it for about 50 minutes in a loaf pan. The pumpkin flavor did not come through at all. Will have to try it with the banana. Either way, it definitely needs some spices. I used two egg whites instead of the egg and will add some hemp protein powder next time. And will switch out the regular sugar for brown sugar. Surprisingly moist considering how much whole grain and fiber is in there.

I have to say that I never like the people that change a recipe a LOT and then review it but that's what I did and I LOVED it!! Changes I made: -Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 white -Used 1/2 brown sugar instead of the 3/4 cup white -Didn't have oat bran or wheat germ so ground up quick cooking oats in the food processor to make a heaping 1/4 cup as a substituion for both -Didn't have buttermilk so made my own sour milk using 1 T vinegar and skim milk to total 1 cup -Didn't want the rest of my pint of blueberries to go to waste so used a heaping cup in the batter and then sprinkled the remaining ones on top. -Didn't have a banana so used a 4 ounce container of natural cinnamon applesauce.  GEESH!! That's a ton of changes and they still came out AMAZING!! Loved the walnuts, love that they're not sugary sweet, love the nice chewy texture! And knowing that everything in there is a LOT better than most muffins is totally a bonus. Hubby said print this one and keep it safe!! Thank you for a great recipe!!  Hmmm, wonder how they'd taste with raspberries...

I thought these needed a lot more flavor. I didn't add the walnuts (I'm sorry but WALNUTS? in a blueberry muffin? no thanks!) I think next time I make these some cinnamon or grated lemon rind will be in order. Because this time aorund, the bluberries in them were the only things that made the muffins worth eating.

These are WONDERFUL!!!  I have tried 2 other healthy blueberry muffin recipes on this site, and loved both of them, but I must say this is my absolute favorite.  I couldn't find oat bran so I used wheat bran, followed suggestions and used brown sugar instead of white, and used extra light olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Made a double batch and they were gone within a week!  I agree with other reviewers that the walnuts are equivalent to icing on the cake, and I don't think I'll ever make these without them.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Dense, filling muffin is only about 150 calories when Splenda is substituted for the white sugar. I incorporated a bunch of suggestions from other reviews including increasing the whole wheat flour ratio, using applesauce in place of the banana, adding chopped applies in place of nuts and adding the spices. YUM! I will make these again in the fall using the pumpkin / apple suggestion.   Thanks to all for the base recipe and suggestions!

I have made this twice already and love it! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar and omitted bran since I didn't have any.  My search for a healthy muffin recipe has ended!  I baked these in mini muffin pans for 13 minutes.

I double the batch each time, and put them in big storage bags and put em in the freezer. As a poor college kid,I love being able to eat something so healthy every morning for so little money (this is a way cheap recipe).  I just pop em in the microwave for 50-70 seconds and they are BEAUTIFUL!!!! I've tried so many different variations too! My favorite was pumpkin and choco chips!

These were fantastic!  We made a few minor changes: used Egg Beaters for the egg to cut fat and cholesterol, used a 50/50 combination of brown sugar and demarara sugar because we try not to used refined sugar in anything, and pecans instead of walnuts because it's what we had on hand.  Will make again!

Very good, not even too healthy tasting.  I liked them a lot partially because they are so healthy. If you are going for healthy and tasty these are the muffins for you.  If you just want the best tasting muffins ever try the blueberry cream muffin recipe on this site!  Those are to die for!  I always add extra blueberries to all of my muffin recipes.

These muffins were pretty good, but you could definitely tell they were healthy. They were really dense. I made a batch following the recipe and one with pumpkin for the banana.

fabulous healthy muffins that don't have that funny rubbery texture that some low fat muffins have.  you can easily serve them to your kids and they will love them without knowing how healthy they are.  I substituted pecans for walnuts because of allergies but great flavour.  the nuts are the best part! very moist

I made these last night after reading all the amazing reviews. My boyfriend loves blueberries so I thought this would be great. He did love them. I sort of expected more but I also put way too many blueberries in them for my taste. But he loved that I put extra in there. the texture was great. I didn't use whole wheat flour I had to just use regular flour. I will probably make these again because my boyfriend loved them, just maybe less blueberries.

Made these last night and they wer excellent.  Just what I was looking for to have with my green tea in the morning.  Like others, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1/4 splenda in place of the white sugar.  I also added some chopped strawberries.  I think next time I will add 2 cups of berries.  Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins were so delicious!  To cut down on the calories even yet, I used fat-free plain yogurt instead of the buttermilk and substituted EggBeaters for the egg.  I'll be making these again and again!

I make this recipe frequently. They have turned out wonderfully every time. One time I made them and realized that I didn't have a banana so I substituted 2 medium sized apples-shredded and they were as tasty as always.

Very, very good--or at least they were good 10 minutes after baking.  We'll see if they hold up for a couple of days.  I doubled the blueberries--I like my muffins that way.  They were moist and delicious.  Thank you for this recipe.

[Months later]  Still loving it.

It was pretty good for a Healthy muffin.  I enjoyed them and they weren't hard to make.  I will make it again for sure.  I forgot the nuts the first time but when I make them again I will remember them.

Fantastic!  Tastes delicious.  I didn't have blueberries, so I used frozen mixed berries instead, and it came out great!  Good texture and even my wife (who does not like healthy food at all) liked them!

Healthy, tasty, and very moist  .... I omitted the bran and wheat germ b/c I didn't have on hand but I doubled the oats.  I only use soymilk so to get that "buttermilk" quality I just added one tablespoon of vinegar to curdle the milk.  Everything else remained the same.  I will make again and freeze some for a later date.

These are fantastic!  I used ww pastry flour and all-purpose flour, used flax meal instead of wheat germ, subbed 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin for banana, and left out the nuts. I brought the milk and egg up to room temp before adding. I think I forgot the vanilla, but its absence was not a detraction. Not nearly as decadant as "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" which I also made today, but who wants to die for their food?  Not me.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These muffins will definetly be a staple in my home!! I subbed applesauce for the oil and cut the sugar a tad, and they were delicious! With the 2 main unhealthy ingredients made healthier, these muffins offer a very nutritious beginning to your day!!

These were a HUGE hit with everyone I know!  Best part is, I stick a few in the freezer and stick them in the microwave for a quick, healthy breakfast.  Also, there are TONS of alterations you can try, like using raisins or dried cranberries instead of the blueberries.

Great recipe, even though I didn't follow it precisely.

I used 2 mashed bananas, because they really needed to go, and regular rolled oats. I also substituted 1 c skim milk plus 1 T lemon juice for the buttermilk, as I did not have any on hand. I also added about 1/4 T ground nutmeg, which goes wonderfully with blueberries and bananas. I also reduced the sugar a bit, since I had the 2 very ripe bananas in there.

Muffins came out very moist and tender. Very tasty. Kept well in the fridge for about 4 days (when they were gone).

This is a fantastic recipe.  It's a bit of work finding the necessary ingredients, but the result is a sweet, tasty, muffin that is healthy but doesn't taste like it's a "healthy" recipe.  I've made this a few times now, with fresh blueberries in season and it's been superb.

My husband loved these! He requested me to make these twice in once week! He told me they were the best dessert I have made so far and I bake at least once a week. We treat them like dessert at my house. I added extra blueberries as well. They 24 minutes to bake however. It may have been b/c I used frozen blueberries and lowered the temperature to 325 degrees since I used black muffin tins. Sprinkle a little cinnamon and sugar on top before baking them and they come out with a sweet crunchy crown on them.I didn't have any wheat germ, but they still turned out delicious!

This is the lightest & fluffiest healthy muffin I've ever tasted!  I made a couple of substitutions as I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar; doubled the wheat germ and removed the oat bran.  I didn't have any blueberries... so I cut up an apply and tossed it in the recipe along with raisins.  I tossed the extra muffins in the freezer and plan to have them as an on-the-go-breakfast.

Very good & healthy.  Did use whole milk and lemon juice for buttermilk (needed to use up).  Sprinkled sugar on top.

Wow... who'd image that something so good for you could taste so great!  I've tasted these as printed - amazing - and with ground flaxseed meal subbed for the wheat germ - equally delicious and so, so, so good for you.  I'll be making a double batch to keep in the freezer for quick, healthy breakfasts.  I also topped it with a tiny bit of brown sugar/butter/oat/cinnamon/nutmeg struesal.  YUM!

This is the best healthy blueberry muffin recipe ever!

I added the 2 tbl sp. milled flax seed as someone suggested and it turned out great.

These are very good muffins and very healthy too.  I did make a few changes to rid the recipe of refined ingredients- I replaced the all purpose flour with whole wheat, the white sugar with some honey and brown sugar.  I didn't have oat bran, so I replaced it with ground flax seeds.  I also added a handful more of blueberry.  Very delicious!  Thank you!

This recipe is delicious - even people who are not "health nuts" will enjoy this because it just tastes good - nice flavor and texture and it's adaptable to whatever you have on hand.  I subbed wheat germ for ground flax seeds, used half white/half spelt flour, and I soaked my oats in the liquid ingredients while I did everything else to soften them and sifted the flour, and they were airy and soft but moist. Yum!

These were very healthy. In the end, I added ground flax seed, and halved the amount of sugar. The frozen berries turned the batter purple. They were good for the first day or two, but got sticky and the texture was not very pleasant. If I made these again, I would use no oil and fresh blueberries.

What an excellent healthy muffin.  I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white. It came out so moist and light.  I didn't have blueberries so subbed with chopped peaches.  They were great!

Was not my favorite, but I did try the applesauce vs oil.  I might try again with the oil and see if it makes a difference.

These weren't very sweet, but great as a healthy breakfast muffin and nice topped with some butter. I used all whole wheat flour. Instead of oat bran and oats I used a 5-grain instant cereal. Also used half brown sugar and half white sugar and added a tsp. cinnamon. Used half ground flax seeds and half chopped walnuts. I used frozen blueberries, but next time I'll try fresh.

I was expecting to love this recipe, with all the yummy-sounding ingredients and good reviews.  In the end I was a little disappointed.  The flavor was okay, but the texture seemed somehow off.  I think it has major potential, but so far it isn't the best recipe I've found for healthier baked treats.

I've made these several times following the recipe, which are delicious.  But when I didn't have blueberries I made them into banana nut muffins, which are even better!  I use all whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white, all quick oatmeal instead of oat bran and oatmeal, and 2 mashed bananas.  You do have to fill the muffin cups up all the way, which makes for a nice, slightly crispy muffin top.  (They've never spilled over on me in the oven.)  I have to cook mine for 20 minutes.  They're a wonderful, healthful breakfast muffin that my whole family loves.

They were/are pretty good as far as taste. What I don't like is the next day the batter in the middle seemed to go soggy. That was upsetting. I actually didn't put the berries in the mix. I scooped the batter into the cups, and next placed a couple berries into each batter-filled cup. I used Whole Foods frozen mixed berries.  Fresh blueberries are too expensive right now. I can't say they are the best muffins that I have ever had, but I like them enough to make them again.

This muffins were great! I omitted the nuts and added an extra banana.  I also used 2/3 cup brown sugar.  These muffins were tasty, moist, and very healthy.  They did turn out kind of greenish, but I think that's because I used an electric mixer to mix the blueberries with the flour.  Anyways I will definitely make these again.

These muffins are the best! And bonus - not a lot of fat in them. I used Oat Bran cereal cause I didn't have oat bran - and still turned out great. I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour. The wheat germ added such a nice texture to them!

Everyone loved these!  I improvised a lot, based on what I had, and they still came out perfectly.  Used wheat germ, flaxseed (which I partially crushed myself), some brown sugar, left out rolled oats, only had skim milk.  But the guys at work gobbled them up!

I made this last night and it turned out great! 
I didn't have milk or buttermilk, so I put some soymilk and I added 1 Teaspn of vinegar as suggested by other review ( I don't know if this work for soymilk, but I gave it a shot) I also didn't have oat bran, so i put in some all bran ( crushed) and I put flaxseed instead of wheat germ. I also suggest using a really ripe banana. It gives great taste :) 
 This recipe is really versatile, so you can play with it a lot.

VERY tasty.  But mine came out purple...I'm not sure  what I'm doing wrong, I use organic frozen blueberries and my blueberry muffins always turn out purple/blue. The  blueberrys were nicely suspended, however..  I would not fill to the top of the cup as the recipe stipulates, mine ran over.  Also, I had to bake mine about 2X as long as the recipe stipulated.  The taste is worth it, I just wish I could get mine to look like the pictures!  These will still work for  my daughter's Waldorf preschool birthday celebration...Might scare off some kids because  of the color, however.  I hope THEIR parents have trouble making normal looking blueberry muffins also (so the kids will be used to  the weird hue)!  :)

While I thought this was really yummy for a healthy muffin, I had wanted to send them to my son's preschool class for snack.  I think they migh tbe a little too "healthy" and dense for them.  best healthy muffin I've ever made.

These muffins are so good.  And healthy too!  Even my super picky toddler will eat them.  That's how I know the recipe is a winner.  This is my go to muffin recipe.  I do substitute a little, based on what I have on hand.  I used the white and whole wheat flour as directed, but then I use 1/2 C oats and 1/4 C ground flax seeds in place of the other grain ingredients and they are super yummy.

Hands down, the most moist blueberry batter (after baking)---so unusual for a "healthy" muffin.  I took advice from one of the other reviewers to drop the previously frozen berries in flour for better color.  Will definately make this again.

Delicious! The muffins were great and moist and unbelievably yummy  :)  I didn't have oat bran, so I put 1/2 cup of oats and I skipped the nuts.  Thaks you so very much.

I really enjoyed these muffins! They had a great flavour and they were very moist. I've eaten one for breakfast every day this week! I also had the same problem as another reviewer, the juice from the frozen blueberries ran through the mixture so they turned out green. Despite the color, they were awesome! I'll probably try them again.

Absolutely delicious! I substituted apple sauce for the banana and omitted the walnut. Other than that, followed the recipe to a tee and it was just wonderful! Very very good recipe! Thank you.

They came out very soggy and turned bad very quickly, but we did like the taste of them.  I will try again and hope for better results.  My husband liked them and has asked for them again.

Very bran/wheat germ tasting when first removed from oven - mellows as it cools.  The bananas and blueberries do not add enough flavor.

These were pretty good - better than I anticipated.  I wasn't sure about the banana and blueberry, but it actually works pretty well.  Just don't expect it to taste like a sweet, light blueberry muffin you'd buy.  They're heartier, but still pretty light.  I'm embarassed to admit that I forgot to add the oatmeal until after they were in the oven, but they still ended up working just fine.  Overall:  great healthy blueberry muffin recipe, but not a substitute for the real thing.

I was disappointed in these muffins after reading all the excellent reviews.  They were okay, but I really did not care for the banana with the blueberries.  My kids and husband wouldn't touch them either. I did forget to add the wheat germ, but I can't imagine it made that much difference.

I halved the recipe to make six muffins. I didnt have enough batter to fill them to the top though, but they came out tasting very good..and thats what counts!! :) I didnt use any egg (as halving the recipe required 1/2 an egg) but added a little more banana instead. I used muffin cups and they did stick onto the cups a little. But overall, a wonderful tasting muffin which I will make again and this time I'll make 12 instead of just 6!

Wonderful! I skipped the one egg and used a 1/4 cup of unsweetened soy yogurt instead, which always makes muffins super moist.

Very good, and very forgiving. I put them in the oven and then started making something else, discovered I was out of an ingredient for the other dish and went to the store, forgetting all about the muffins in the oven. When I got back, there was the muffin smell! They were great. I have no idea how long I cooked them, though. Thanks very much for a great recipe. (Iwouldn't recommend the forget about it method of cooking, though.)

These muffins are AMAZING!  The second time I made these (in the same week) I used raspberries instead and they were still equally as delicious.  With this I added a bit more sugar to balance the sour taste from the berries- also I then added a bit of whole milk to balance the additional dry ingredients due to the increased sugar.  I think any berry you chose would go great with this recipe!

This is a great recipe. I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce (in place of the banana) and substituted brown sugar for white sugar. I also used 1/4 cup of ground flax and doubled the oats, I did not use the wheat germ or oat bran. I also double the berries! These are perfectly sweet and very filling!

I was not able to follow the recipe exactly, though mine turned out delicious! I was only able to use all-purpose flour, and for the oat bran I used whole raw oats. I didn't have any blueberries either, so I used a cup of craisins instead. This recipe is easy to alter, and turned out great!

Great muffins.  I didn't have any oatbran, so I doubled the oats.  I also substituted ground flaxseed for the wheat germ.  I used brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and would have used ww flour instead of white flour if I hadn't run out of that too!
I would suggest that if you can't eat all of these within a couple days, you freeze them.  They did go slimy and moldy after about 4 days (-this, in my opinion, is actually a good thing.  Unprocessed/un-preserved food shouldn't last indefinitely!)

Excellent recipe that yields moist and flavourful muffins. I omitted the walnuts, but might put them in next time for some more crunch - I'm definitely making another batch of these! They make the perfect breakfast or snacktime treat, without the guilt.

I sprinkled sugar crystals on top and only made one substitution, 1/2 C. applesauce for the banana.  The muffins were good, but a little heavy. I prefer a lighter muffin, but these are much more nutritious than a regular muffin. I would make again for  to have for a  quick breakfast on the go.

These were delicious. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I also used milk + 1T lemon juice to make the full cup. I also used applesauce in place of the oil. The only other change I made was at the end of the prep when I had everything mixed but the blueberries. I filled each muffin cup halfway with the batter, tossed a small handful of blueberries in, then topped each one with more batter and stirred. I would actually do this with the walnuts next time, too. My husbands first response was, "These taste really healthy but they're awesome. Hey, I think I only got 1 nut in the whole muffin." Will be making them again very soon!

these muffins were delicious!  After the first few days they got kind of slimy, but they were still great!

I used frozen blueberries and the batter turned a gross gray blue color.  They don't have much flavor...its more like a plain muffin.

I used all whole wheat flour and substituted brown sugar for the white. These are good healthy muffins. My daughter's friend was over and heard we were having blueberry muffins and is probably used to the junk food kind with fake fruit, but she ate it as well (I thought it was funny). Thanks for the recipe. The bottoms of my muffins are a bit soggy. It may be because I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the veg oil.

I doubled the recipe which made 20 large muffins. I substituted fresh cranberries for blueberries and used wheat bran rather than wheat germ. They turned out delicious.

This is a great muffin. The flavor and texture are very similar to the blueberry bran muffins at Trader Joe's. I left out the banana and used  strawberries instead. Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup, as the muffin was very sweet. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I replaced about 2 tbsp of the sugar with brown sugar; added a dash of cinnamon; and omitted walnuts. The oats, oat bran, and wheat germ do not make a heavy muffin at all. The buttermilk helps make the muffin nice and light.

Phenomenal!  These are   so soft and fall-apart moist!  I didn't have oat bran, so I threw in a 1/4 cup of milled flax seed instead, and a tablespoon of lemon juice (for the blueberries).  I also whipped up 4oz of fat free cream cheese with a about a tbl of powdered sugar, a tbl of lemon juice and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to make a frosting . . . and they are decadently delicious!  I'm just hoping I can keep some hidden away from the kids until the hubby gets home to try them!  Thanks!

I followed recipe exactly - except I had to use frozen blueberries.  The one's in the store didn't look so great.  I thought these were very good.  I'll make them again but maybe put a little bit more sugar in them - and try with fresh blueberries.

Followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great! Very moist, and the nuts added a nice crunchiness.  Just the right amount of sugar, and very easy to put together.

I found the Oat to make it a bit heavy.  And it did not turn out sweet enough.  I guess more sugar and no oat next time.

Wow!! Best healthy muffin I ever tasted.  I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a way to use up some pears that my mother had given me from her garden.  As I had a lot of pears that I needed to use up before they went bad, I made two double batches (each one made 18 as I filled them very full).  The only changes that I made were to omit the walnuts as my son is allergic to them and I used one banana and one Motts Fruitsations Unsweetened Country Berry (apple, raspberry, strawberry and blueberry fruit blend)snack container and of course, used pear instead of blueberry.  I will definitely make these again and am passing on the recipe to my mother who is also always on the lookout for a good healthy muffin recipe.

Next time I will definitely double the recipe!! Very good not to mention a lot healthier than the usual b.b. muffin. I didn't have wheat germ so I added extra quick cooking oats. As per anotther review I substituted sour cream for half the milk (I only had Lactaid in the fridge so I used that instaed of the buttermilk. Don't you love a good recipe you can tweak a little!!!)

These muffins were soooo good! I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ so I added a cup more of oats. They were still delicious. Not everyone in my house likes blueberries so next time I am going to make them with chopped apples. I had to put them in a plastic baggie and put them in the freezer so I wouldn't eat anymore. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! I will make these often.

These muffins are okay, but not something I would make again. I think I am used to this type of taste (nutty taste, less sweet) in a denser muffin or bread, and it's throwing me off to have a light-textured muffin with this taste.

Fantastic.  These types of muffins have a tendancy to come out dry--not these.  Easy to freeze and take on the run.  I will probably experiment with getting some flax meal in here too....

Wow! I used wheat bran in place of the oat bran and a frozen banana otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  These are great! I much prefer this type of blueberry muffin to the cake-like variety. I'm always looking to use whole wheat flour in recipes but don't like to sacrifice taste.  This recipe is the best of both worlds!

Yum! I didn't have any oat bran on hand, so I used milled flax seed instead. It was great! Also, I didn't have a banana to mash, so I used lowfat blueberry yogurt instead. I sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking, and these turned out great! Thanks for the great recipe.

For a healthy treat it is quite delicious. I had to bake for just over 20 min. I think because I used frozen blueberries and a stone muffin tray.

WONDERFUL recipe! I was a little doubtful they were going to be as good as everyone was saying...what w/ all that healthy stuff in them! But I was happily surprised to find them really really good! I made them for snack time at my kids preschool - so they will be getting something healthy & yummy. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe! I will definitely be making these often for me & my kids.

FYI I didn't have any bananas so I copied someone else's idea & substituted a plastic container of applesauce.

These muffins are SO GOOD. I had to bake them for about 20 minutes before they were done in the middle, but they tasted great and had such a nice texture to them. I didn't add the walnuts but everything else I kept the same, and will certainly keep making these.

Wonderful muffin recipe.  I am not a big banana fan, so to make sure these stayed moist, I substituted 1 cup of unsweet. applesauce in place of the banana.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar (cup for cup) and added a 1/2 cup extra blueberries.  These muffins were so good, my husband and kids snatched them up and they are not huge blueberry fans.  My batch made 24 minis and 6 regular muffins.  I suggest you use muffin liners sprayed with non-stick cooking spray because they are so moist.  So healthy and so yummy, this one is DEFINITELY a keeper.  Enjoy!!

These are so tasty and quick to whip together.  My picky DH who generally snubs healthy foods loved these!  Sometimes I make these with raspberries for a change.  I make the batter at night and bake these fresh within a couple of days so they are warm from the oven.  My son also loved these.

Excellent, healthy muffins.  My baby is eating these; it's a great way to get him his grains!
My changes: I only had "normal" oat flakes, so I soaked them in the liquid mix while preparing the rest.  I didn't have wheat germ so I substituted spelt flakes (which I soaked with the oat flakes).  I didn't have oat bran so I substituted spelt bran.  On a whim, I used walnut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Finally, since these were also for a toddler, I used ground walnuts.
These turned out great, the oat flakes weren't too crunchy or raw, they blended in just fine.  I'd use oat bran next time, just because I think it's a great taste.  This is a keeper!

These tasted delicious, mine just didn't look pretty. A major part of the problem is that I used frozen wild blueberries which turned the batter a gray-ish color. That, along with the rough texture of the batter, turned off two out of three of my kids. I was amazed at how flavorful these tasted, considering all those whole grains. May try again with fresh berries.
