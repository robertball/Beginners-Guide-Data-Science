I double the amount of consome, and add basil, thyme, a pinch of rosemary, and a good deal of capers.  Great stuff!

This is my recipe and I feel compelled to add a few words here.  When totally different herbs, spices, vinegars and oils are used rather than what I submitted, it no longer resembles the original dish and is certainly no longer French.  I'm sorry so many felt they had to change it.  ChristyJ

This is a fairly quick and easy potato salid, altho the kids like a potato salid with a little more zip. This is great for an adult meal.

Delicious!  I made half of the recipe and used 1/2 cup of chopped Vidalia Onions instead of the Green Onions (it was what I had on hand); however, it turned out great. Would make again.

I only needed about 1/2 of the dressing for my 9 medium red potatoes.  I did not really care for this.

I thought this was a nice change from the usual potato salad. I added more seasonings plus some dillweed. Thanks!

A "not bad" adaptation of the classic.  I preferred to peel and slice the potatoes into 1/4" slices before cooking, preferred olive oil over vegetable oil, white wine vinegar over tarragon vinegar and chicken broth over the beef consomme.  I used all ingredients to taste - in amounts that looked right for the amount of potatoes I used.  I used russet potatoes which are NOT the best choice for a recipe like this, but it's what I had on hand.  A red potato, new potato or Yukon Gold is what's needed here and it would be good to specify that in the recipe.  Best served at room temperature.

We entertain outdoors a lot in the summer, and this has become one of our dishes that people look forward to. My husband absolutely prefers this over the mayonnaise and egg-laden version. It's extremely easy to make, we use small red potatoes or sometimes multi-colored fingerlings to jazz it up. Because it has no mayonnaise you don't have to worry about it sitting outside for a few hours. I typically make it with vegetable stock rather than the beef consomme so that it is truly vegetarian. Yum!

This was very good, with a few changes. I used wine vinegar and fresh tarragon, left out the consomme, added vidalia onion and roasted red pepper and a bit of dijon mustard. Delicious!

I made this several times when we members of a CSA to use up rocket, since I didn't know what else to do with it.  I loved the exotic flavor it has, very continental. The mustard and vinegar blend perfectly with the rocket. If you're looking for a different potato salad, this is a great one to try.

I've been making a variation on this for over 30 years from a Julia Child recipe. It's a refreshing change from a heavy mayonnaise-based salad; the flavor of potato really comes through, and it stands up well on a picnic or potluck table. Red or Yukon Gold potatoes are a must. I've always used chicken broth (1/2 cup for 3 pounds potatoes), a good olive oil, cider vinegar (I cannot abide tarragon), and I prefer a mild white or sweet onion. I've sometimes added  things such as hard-cooked eggs, olives, dill pickle, pimiento, celery, or crumbled bacon: whatever suits your fancy! Best at room temperature.

Lovely, delicate flavors, delicious. I did not have tarragon vinegar so used white vinegar with dried tarragon.

I made this yesterday and it turned out pretty well. I didn't change the recipe but I did have to use dried parsley instead of fresh.  I think I missed out on a big flavor hit.  Despite that,  the dressing was very flavorful but I have to agree with the other reviewers that the oil component needs to be reduced. It would also be helpful to have a rough weight on the potatoes. I used red potatoes and it might be useful to recommend using waxy potatoes versus russets.   This is a good recipe and I completely agree with rating the recipe as it appears instead of adding tweaks and additions and then rating that version. ChristyJ, if you have anymore French inspired recipes, please continue to post. Thanks.

Back in 1985, we lived near the Summerhill "5 Thieves" market (mid town Toronto ON). Our favorite potato salad was very close to this one. I loved the dressing. I was surprised by the beef broth ingredient - surprisingly, it works and makes for a delicious addition to this dressing. The recipe is perfect except I wanted to replicate the Oliffe Butcher's famed potato salad. I added artichokes, red, green and yellow peppers, black olives and red onion. Delicious!

This is one of my favorites. I serve it with grilled lime, tarragon chicken thighs. It’s one recipe that will elevate you to rockstar status with guests. More often than not I end up sending both recipes home.

This was delicious with bratwurst on the grill. I didn't have tarragon vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and added thyme from my garden.  We ate it while still a bit warm so I can only imagine how good it will be tomorrow.

Sorry, this was not my favorite.  Way too much oil for my taste.  I like the German style (with vinegar) but this was too oily for me.

I made this 2 nights ago, sticking to the recipe as best I could, being there was no specified potato type, so I used what most have on hand, the russet. Of course I did not have the tarragon vinegar specified (as most home cooks do not)  so I tried my own hand at using dried tarragon and letting it sort of steep in the white vinegar I did have on hand for a few. Outside of that, I did not make any changes. It was very tasty and a nice change, but I will not make this over my standard potato salad.

I think this could be a truly good salad, but needs a bit of help.  It does not state what kind of potatoes, and how large?  Potatoes come in a massive variety of types and sizes.  I had 3 small new potatoes to use up, so I reduced the amount on everything by 2/3's.  Still too much dressing.  And I tasted the dressing before using, and it needed something, so I added a small amount of dijon mustard.  Exactly what was needed.  I will definitely be trying this again, with some tweaking.

Great suggestion to use vegetable stock rather than beef consume.  Nice vegetarian salad!
