Great use of leftover mashed potatoes. I added a clove of grated garlic, some diced cooked turkey breast and, after the initial 2 cups of milk, I added vegetable stock since my mashed potatoes were quite stiff. So easy and delicious, thanks for the recipe!

I just made this but first sautéed onions and celery, added milk and mashed potatoes and garlic powder and Skipped using cheese. I did put it in the blender because the potatoes were lumpy, then back to the pan and added the ham. It was quite thick so I added chicken broth to thin it a bit. It’s a very good recipe, uses up leftovers and is very quick. It would be an excellent weeknight throw together if you have the ingredients to use up. I think it will be even better tomorrow- yum!

This is a great way to repurpose leftover mashed potatoes and is easily customizable to ingredients on hand.  I made with 1C leftover beef stock & 1C milk and used leftover beef in place of ham.  I added some leftover corn and used a mac and cheese blend shredded cheese.  Ridiculously easy and a great way to use leftovers...this would work w/most any protein.  THANKS for the recipe!

Made this recipe for my parents, and they loved it. I added mushrooms and seasoned it with garlic salt and onion powder, it was the bomb.

Tastes great. Will definitely make again. Used leftover mashed (3 cups) and 1 cup leftover boiled potatoes with leftover ham and cheese from Christmas dinner and snacks.

I had a lot of ham and mashed potatoes left from Easter dinner and this was a great recipe to use up some of them.  I softened some finely chopped onions and added them. I also added a bit of garlic powder.  Delicious!

I used bacon instead of ham, half and half instead of milk and added garlic powder to the mashed potatoes.  I took it to a family party and received several requests for the recipe.  A definite hit.
(P.S.  There wasn't anything left over to take home).

Had some leftover mashed potatoes and vegetables. This seemed like a great idea. I only had about 2 cups of potatoes so I chopped up leftover broccoli and cauliflower and added to it. Added some chicken bouillon, garlic and spices. Then mixed with  an immersion blender to make into a thick creamy soup.  Delicious!!

This is great on its own for a quick lunch or dinner, or as a base for something more sophisticated!  Next time, I will cook some celery & onions in butter, then add the milk & potatoes. From there, the possibilities are endless!  Ham & cheese, chicken & cooked broccoli, asparagus, corn & bacon,.... whatever makes you happy!

Delish!  I had a ton of mashed potatoes left over from Christmas dinner, so I was looking for a way to use them up.  This soup was perfect!  My entire family loved it!  I served it with crusty bread, and it was the best dinner for a cold winter evening.  Thank you!

Quick!  I added dried celery and onions and simmered a little longer until done.  Great way to use leftover mashed potatoes and ham and short on time.
