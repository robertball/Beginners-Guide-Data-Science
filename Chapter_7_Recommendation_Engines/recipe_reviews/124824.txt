Everyone seemed to be a little disappointed about how "cake-like" this recipe turned out, so I made a few adjustments: I used 3 eggs instead of 4, brown sugar instead of white, 1/2 tsp of baking soda instead of 1 tsp, and added a few shakes of ground cloves and nutmeg (I couldn't resist!!). I baked for 28 mins in a 9x13 pan. They are just now cooling on my counter and I took a smidgen from the corner - VERY moist, dense, and SOOOO tasty. I can't WAIT to put the cream cheese icing on top!!

They are kind of cake-like, but I didn't think of that as a bad thing. I thought these bars had the perfect balance of pumpkin, spices, and sugar.

YUM!  I also made some modifications to lower the glycemic value of this recipe.  I did 1/2 of the amount of sugar with brown, and 1/2 white- next time I might try substituting some honey.  I used applesauce in place of the oil, and whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose.   To make them more like "bars" instead of cake I used only 1 tsp. baking powder and 3 eggs.   They turned out so well and are delicioius!  This will be my new substitute for the time-consuming pumpkin log I usually make around the holidays.  I might even add some walnuts on top of the icing next time.

These were great!  Everyone that tried them loved them. Just be sure to refrigerate them or, they'll get too soft.  Brenda, thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very easy, and I do not recommend the 9x13 pan.  I used that size and the middle isn't done, but the outsides are... And the outsides taste really good!  Next time I'll use the pan size recommended.  There WILL be a next time!

These were good. Be ready for something that resembles a cake though, with a yummy creamcheese frosting. The cake was not overly sweet, it was more of a spice flavor. Some people looooved these bars, and I thought they were pretty good.

We all thought these were great. My 15yr. old son ate half the pan, and he usually is fussy. Love the frosting, might add a bit more frosting next time. We like frosting. Make them, you can't go wrong, and easy to make. Almost forgot, mine were done in 22min, good thing I looked early. Enjoy!

These are really moist and yummy!  I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the cake mix, plus I sprinkled some ground cloves on top of the bars after they had been frosted in order to make them a little spicier.

5 stars with the following changes: Like other reviewers, I cut baking powder and soda in half, used only 3 eggs, only 1 cup of sugar, and increased pumpkin- I used 2 1/4 cup because that is how much puree I got from my sugar pumpkin.  They are so yummy and moist! Still kind of cake like, but I love it!  The frosting was perfect as is, IMO. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made my usual subsitutions (ground flax seed for eggs-but for 3 eggs, not 4 as recipe states, all applesauce and no oil.) I also used less sugar, added fresh grated nutmeg, and some cloves.  I made my own frosting recipe using 8 oz of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, I don't think the 3 oz package called for would have made enough frosting. This makes a lot of bars...enough to eat, give some away and freeze some! I COULD NOT STOP eating them, they are soooo good!

I have made these bars twice.  Both times in a round angel food cake pan.  The first time I was just using up some leftover pumpkin.  With less pumpkin, these came out very moist and almost uncooked like, but delicious.  The best way to put it, is that these were pumpkin pie without the crust.  The second time I made them, they came out cake like.  Varying the measurements helped create the different consistencies.  I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar, both times I made this.  Overall a great recipe :)

I just loved this recipe.  My oven runs a little hot so I baked it for 25 mnutes instead of 30. Man they were perfect. AND after they cooled, they remained light and fluffy, but moist and delicious as well.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose but that is just cause I am a health nut.  They are still great. Thanks for a winning recipe.

This was yummy!  I used fresh pumpkin instead of the canned and I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 oil instead of the 1 cup of oil. It turned out fabulous! However, next time, I will use some cloves and or pumpkin pie spice to give it a little extra. The frosting is the perfect compliment! Not too sweet and not to cream cheesy. I am bring it to a pot luck at work tomorrow and I know it is going to be a hit!

This recipe was very tasty.  These are definitely more like cake and are very moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved them.  The only thing I would caution is that you must like pumpkin because these have a strong pumpkin flavor.  If you like pumpkin, you will love these.

These are delicious as cake!!!  followed recipe for the "bars" exactly.  They just won't hold up to being eaten out of the hand like a bar.  For the frosting I used a 7oz pkg of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and all the powdered sugar I had left(which was about 2 cups)  did not add milk.  came out great, not too sweet.  Will be making again, my boys loved it too.

I personally love these being "cake-like".  My kids just call it pumpkin cake.  We all love it!  I add a touch of nutmeg and cloves and add more cream cheese than called for (are there really any 3 oz. packages of cream cheese?).  Delicious!

Amazing with freshly baked pumpkin. The key is to use fresh pumpkin! I make them as cup cakes and use cream cheese frosting. They were a huge hit and I've made them at least 5 times in the last month. I use high fiber pastry flour and a high quality organic oil, or a healthier option.

Good! Very tasty and pumpkin-y! I used a 10x15 glass pan and baked it for 35 minutes and the middle still didn't get done. My hubby didn't mind, but I would prefer a completely baked cake! I'll just bake it longer next time. I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe because we like a truer cream cheese taste. Overall, very good!

More like a cake, than the bar I was looking for but they were still really good.  My 3 year old loved these.  The frosting recipe is good too.  I'll make them again, but probably when I'm looking for a pumpkin spice cake, not a bar type cookie.

This recipe was so delicious and ever so moist! Although maybe it was too moist... Instead of bars, they just came out to be a cake, which I didn't mind, because everyone was craving it and every bite just melts in your mouth. I would make this pumpkin desert everyday if I had the ingredients right in my kitchen.

Very delicious, and not hard! I'm a beginner when it comes to baking and cooking, and it was still a huge success with my friends! This will be a keeper for sure.

Delicious - but more like a cake than bars - as others have said - I will follow the adjustments someone else listed to make these more bar-like.

Awesome!!  yes, more like a cake, but I think they could pass for bars if cut up.

I use a very similar pumpkin bar recipe and it is fantastic!  I agree it's more cake-like than bar-like but it is still very moist and flavorful.  The only things I do differently are with the frosting: I use 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/4, and no milk.  Rave reviews and no leftovers every time!

My family and I loved this recipe!  It came out more like cake than bars, but that may be due to baking it in a 9 x 13 inch pan.  The cake itself was moist and delicious, and the icing was PERFECT!!!

These were delicious. I agree with everyone else though it was more like a cake than a bar. I made them once and served them at two differnt gatherings. Everyone loved them.

Okay, so the kids came home from school before Thanksgiving and were raving about pumpkin bars they had in the cafeteria at school and they told me I would love them.  They described, I did some searching and found this recipe! So so so so yummy!  The only tweak I made was in the frosting.  I only had Mexican vanilla on hand (kind of cinnamon-y), so I used that and added one large orange's worth of zest. Will definitely use again!

excellent recipe!  I ended up adding considerably more cinnamon and same ground ginger to it though as I don't care for frosting.  It turned out to be a very moist delicious cake.  The next time I make it I will cut the baking powder in half so that it will come out more bar-like.

Just one simple change - I made 24 cupcakes from this recipe instead of bars and baked them for 20 minutes.  Perfect!

My family and I really loved this recipe! I chose to use applesauce instead of oil, and it turned out amazingly moist and flavorful. My husband is extremely picky, but even he loved this. Thank you for submitting this Brenda! Good job.

These were excellent.  They only reason I don't give a 5 star is because while the frosting was really good, I didn't think there was enough for the whole pan--it just make a very thin layer.  I like LOTS of frosting.  I ended up making another half batch of frosting.  Next time I will just double the amount of frosting.  But this recipe is really good--and EASY!  THANK YOU!

Wow, these things are addictive like crack...not that I would know personally...

I was going for a denser version, and after reading some of the other reviews decided to drop one of the eggs (3 total), but I left the baking powder & soda measurements alone. I also used pumpkin spice instead of just the ground cinnamon. My last tweak (pun not intended) was to substitute 2/3 cup of sugar with brown sugar. I do not own a pan in the dimensions on the recipe, so I used a 1/4 sheet pan and it was perfect. Also, I lined the pan with parchment paper, with a couple inches sticking out of both sides. That way, I could just lift it up out of the pan so that it could cool and then be frosted. It made cutting/serving very easy. The bars were remarkably moist and the exact density I wanted. I'm a fiend for the pumpkin bars at a local bakery, but I actually liked these better! I will definitely be making these again, but perhaps I'll double the recipe and use my 1/2 sheet pan instead...
