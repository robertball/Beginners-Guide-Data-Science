I made two changes. 1. I used olive oil instead of coconut oil. 2. I forgot black beans and realized too late. Great recipe! Good taste. The only thing that I wasnâ€™t a huge fan of was the quinoa got a bit over cooked on top and is a bit crunchy. It might also be because I used shredded cheese instead of slices.
