Yum!! I couldn't find the cook and serve butterscotch pudding at my grocery store so I just added a package of instant butterscotch pudding to the yellow/butter cake mix. I also used both butterscotch and chocolate chips on the cake. This one is a keeper.

I really needed a cake in a hurry and had no time to go to the store so I tinkered with this recipe with what I had on hand.  I was shy a quarter cup of milk so I made it up with vanilla Coffeemate creamer.  I only had instant vanilla pudding so I mixed it with the milk and creamer, added the cake mix, and went from there.   I didn't have butterscotch chips, but I did have mini chocolate chips, so there went my third deviation from the recipe. You can see the trend here, right?  If this all hadn't worked out just fine I wouldn't be doing a review because it's one of my pet peeves when people say, "oh, I only changed a few things and I can't figure out why the recipe didn't turn out right."  This happily seems to be a flexible and forgiving recipe - my favorite kind. Everyone liked the result and we had it with (maybe you could see this coming) the last third of a carton of vanilla ice cream and the bottom of a jar of chocolate ice cream topping.

I ate the hugest piece of this... and since I used fat-free milk and sugar-free instant pudding, I can refuse guilt! It was best warm from the oven. The butterscotch chips (I only used half the bag) were inside instead of on top and they made the cake gooey and great.

I would have never guessed that so few ingredients and a boxed cake mix could make something so delicious and moist.  I brought these for my daughter's friends at school and they loved them and so did some of their parents.  A great recipe for all ages.

This recipe was very sweet and had a real artifical flavor and texture. It was easy to prepare, maybe too easy. Not something I would make again.
