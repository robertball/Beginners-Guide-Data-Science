Easy t o make and healthy.  As described the recipe doesn’t pack a flavor punch.  But I really liked the pineapple, cucumber and pepper garnish.  I’ll try this again and mess about to amp up the flavor. Maybe salmon?

This was super delicious!  I would have never thought to poach Halibut. I have always bbq'd or baked . Poaching the Halibut in Swanson Broth added wonderful flavor. The pineapple salsa was amazing it added a wonderful freshness to the dish . I served two sides the Garlic seasoned vegetables also prepared with Swanson and Uncle Bens Garden rice. My family loved it and I was very proud of my meal. Thank you Swanson!! #AllstarsSwanson & #WhyICook
