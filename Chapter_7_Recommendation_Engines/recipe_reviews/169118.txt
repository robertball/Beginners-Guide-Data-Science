A great low-fat clam chowder. BEWARE: WAY TOO MUCH dill, onion, pepper & salt. We substitue more-easily-obtained ingredients: Canned minced clams for fresh, fresh potatoes (fingerlings or cut-up baking potatoes). Reduced dill to two teaspoons vs three tablespoons called for in the recipe, onion to one vs two, black pepper to two teaspoons vs two tablespoons, salt less then 1/2 teas vs 1 teas. I didn't think I even liked dill, but now I try to find recipes WITH dill. This chowder disappears quickly, so make a double batch. With excellent flavors and easy prep, it's a regular in our house. (I try to use organic celery because celery is usually at the top of the "Dirty Dozen.")

This was really good!!! I made it tonight and we really enjoyed it and I used canned clams..  I added garlic with the onions and celery and omitted the dill as I'm not a fan of dill. Quick and easy with items you always have on hand. Great recipe thanks!!

I've made this twice now and this is a really good "quick & easy" recipe.  My only substitution was canned clams for the shucked clams (3 cans).  I'm sure it would be even better with freshly shucked clams.  The first time I made it, since I love spicy food, I used all of the pepper called for in the recipe, even though I knew it was a lot.  It was too hot for my wife to enjoy, although she said the flavor was great.  The next time I made it, I only used 1T black pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I omitted the cayenne.  She loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I think this must require fresh clams as directed but others used canned so I gave it a shot.  Not at all like the Rhode Island clam chowder I remember from living in CT.  Bland and off in flavor.

I have to say as I was looking through all the clam chowder recipes, I didn't think I would find a clear chowder recipe, but then I found this Rhode Island recipe and I knew it would be clear since we also live in Rhode Island. My husband and his brother went out and got quahogs tonight so I will be making this recipe the right way!!

I made this for my roommate last night and will admit it was my first foray into seafood/chowders. It was super easy to make and VERY tasty. The cayenne/tabasco adds a subtle kick to it. I couldn't get fingerling potatoes so I used red russet ones- diced with the skins on and threw them in the pot with the clams in step 1. They cooked up fine.

Wow, this had great flavor and was so easy! I used canned clams, fresh potatoes, and veg broth (only 2 cups because I ran out of room in the pot). I also used half the dill, and I didn't measure the black pepper. This recipe is easy to adjust to your tastes, and great for when you want a quick, gourmet-tasting meal.

We really enjoyed this recipe with modifications:  per other reviewers I reduced the onion, dill, and black pepper.  I used half of a very large onion and added a diced carrot when sauteeing with the onion.  I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried dill and 1 tablespoon black pepper.  I subbed cubed red potatoes for the canned potatoes and used two cans of clams, but would use freshly shucked next time.

Loved this chowder.  I live in RI and this is as good as any restaurant chowder.  I decreased the dill to 2 tsps, used 1 onion, canned clams and fresh potatoes.  I licked my bowl!

Excellent, I made the following changes to make it easier: fried garlic (I assume the omission of garlic was a typo! ha) and onions together in the sauce pan then added a 3lb can of chopped sea clams in juice (instead of 1lb clams and 3 cups of juice).  After that came to a boil I added the rest of the ingredients.  I used 5 celery stalks, added 3 carrots, and only used 1/2 tsp of dill.  Amazing flavor, amazingly easy.  Made again in a crockpot - perfection!

I tried this recipe and it is good, but for my taste way too  much dill.  I am a midwest girl so maybe that is the dif in taste.  Good though..may want to cut dill in half the first time and add next time according to taste. I used canned clams for this as fresh are expensive in my area.

Too much pepper for my taste, but will make again with less.  Very nice alternative to cream clam chowder.

I tried this earlier in the summer due to it's simplicity, the flavor was fantastic! However, I did omit the salt and cut the dill and the black pepper to 1 TBS each, it was still a little too hot (and I love hot food).  Just made it again and dropped the pepper to 1 tsp.  Much better!  I used fresh potatoes both times and canned clams the 2nd time.  I love the flavor of this chowder. It is a keeper! Thanks.
To those who reviewed and said they added cream to it....you want a recipe for New England Clam chowder, the beauty of the RI style is the clear broth!

needed acidity.  I ended up adding 1 chopped tomato and a good squirt of ketchup.  It ended up being ok but I would not make it again.

This is an excellent recipe. I used fresh clams but next time will double the amount of clams. I did not use cayenne or hot sauce but added a little red pepper flakes. We love onions so I used one large vidalia. I liked using the canned potatoes because they added to the ease of this dish.

Great basic recipe with a few tweaks.In place of the chicken stock use water and clam base. But be careful as a little base adds a tremendous amount of clam flavor.I also add thyme in place of the dill.And,the more clams the better!I live here in Rhode Island and this chowder ranks up there with the best of them!My family say's even better! Serve with clam cakes....you must dip!

I have never had Rhode Island clam chowder. I had a lot of chicken stock that I had made and needed to use it up. This worked great. I used a 3lb can of clams that had 3cp of juice in it. I had some leftover bacon grease. I fried my onions, celery, garlic and small cubed russet potatoes w skins in the grease for added flavor. I added all of the seasonings as was listed and added a 1/4cp of white sine. This soup is delicious. I will definitely do this again.

Very nice soup, savory, and tasty but somewhat light and refreshing. If you love miso you may appreciate this one.

I love New England Clam Chowder but can't bring myself to make it at home without cringing at the amounts of creme and butter.

I have two kids who do love soup so I omitted salt, pepper, Cayenne and hot sauce. Those I put on the table and allow the adults to adjust as needed.The canned clams have a LOT of salt already, adults might want to resist the urge to oversalt as well.

Used three stalks of celery, 4 bay leaves, tablespoon of dried thyme. I found thyme to be mentioned several times in other versions of this recipe and I favor thyme in almost all saucy, coupy dishes. Forgot to add parsley too. No dill

Very good soup with the perfect ratio of solids to soup, small amount of richness visible from top. Potatos are soft and fall aparty, clams firm and slightly chewy, celery and onion transluscent and disappears on tongue. Soup itself is slightly briney but has the freshness of the celery to clean up any yucky taste.

We love seafood and have been looking at making a Rhode Island Clam Chowder for some time. Finally did it and this was an awesome choice. We absolutely love this recipe. It can easily be changed up to a seafood stew with squid rings ans shrimp. This is now a favorite in our house!

Super delicious.  Flavor is bold and not muted by dairy.  I'm not lactose intolerant -but really prefer this style.  I substituted the clams with Rock Fish I caught in the summer.

I'm a RI native.  When I was young, my mom would go to the local fish market and get fresh clams or quauhogs to make chowder.  If we were at the beach in the summer, often times we would would walk into the water and collect quauhogs, under our feet, a low tide. 

I now live in NM, and finding clams, other than chopped clams in a can, is all but impossible.  I made this, at the request of a friend, and the reviews were off the charts!  For all the soups and chowder I've made, this one took the prize!  This is just about how I remember my mom's; maybe better!  ;)

I made this last night and it was wonderful.  I used less onion (1 lg)and celery (1/2 stalk) and added chopped kale and garlic (2)

This is a keeper at our house.  Much less calories than traditional clam chowder.

Great recipe but took the advice of some of the other reviewers. I used canned clams in place of fresh, only used 1 tablespoon of dill (just the right amount),  used better then bouillon (2tbs) & 4 c water, reduced the black pepper to 1/2 tsp, & 1 tsp salt.  I don't like spicy food so I omitted the other peppers/hot sauce. Tasted a lot like the Eastern Shore Clam Chowder I had.  I think next time I'll cut down on the salt, tasted a bit too salty for me.  This is a keeper with the changes.  Thanks for posting!

That there is a good bowl of soup.

Heed the other reviews and be careful how much dill and black pepper you add. I went with teaspoons vice tablespoons and it worked out fine. I also added a pinch of Old Bay Seasoning and about 1/4 tsp of dried roasted garlic. Absolutely fantastic, and I usually LOATHE dill. Great stuff!

Everyone loved it, my daughter waited to long to come inside to eat and it was all gone.
She wasn't happy about it.
