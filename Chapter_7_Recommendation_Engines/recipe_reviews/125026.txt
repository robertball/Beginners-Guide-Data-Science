This recipe is awesome!  I couldn't find unseasoned croutons so I bought 2 loaves of bread, 1 wheat and 1 autumn grain.  Toasted the bread slices in a 350 degree oven 5 - 7 minutes then cut the slices up. I also used 1/3 lb of Italian sausage and 1/3 pound of sage sausage in lieu of the 1/2 pound italian sausage. I made and baked the stuffing the night before Thanksgiving.  On Thanksgiving I added more stock on top of the stuffing, covered it and put it in the oven next to the turkey during the last 30 minutes. My fussy hubby kept telling me over and over that it was the best stuffing he ever ate.  Thanks Ken!

This is my Southern Dressin' Recipe except it's missing the pan of cornbread.  I like mine made like a moist cake in a 9 X 13 casserole.  And I usually go ahead and use a whole lb of sausage.  We look forward to this every year!

Instead of store-bought breadcrumbs, I had several partial loaves of bread in our freezer which I cut into cubes and dried in the oven.  Other than using a full tablespoon of poultry seasoning and a little extra black pepper, I followed the recipe as written.  This was the best stuffing I’ve ever made.  In other words, it’s a keeper!

We made this last night to accompany bone-in pork chops with a mustard vermouth pan sauce and kale with pine nuts. It made an excellent combination. We used a variety of bread cubes that had been left overs and frozen. Put them in a 200 degree oven for about 30 minutes and they were perfect. Did use a little more chicken stock, just because we all like our dressing more moist. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Just fantastic - I made a few changes to give it an earthier tone to accompany the turkey:  half wild mushrooms, half cultivated.  Plus substituted sunflower bread for the croutons - broke the bread into bits and dried in the oven first.  Also added thyme and sage as seasoning.  A perfect turkey side dish!

Loved this recipe!  Have tried bread stuffing casseroles in the past that were just too dry.  Used Bob Evans savory sage sausage and it worked great.

Very good stuffing. We actually put some in the turkey and cooked the rest of it just in a dish, it was great both ways.

I wanted a quick stuffing to go with an impromto meal. I tried this recipe but found it too salty. However, for quick and easy it has points.

My family has been making this recipe for over 40 years.  Italian sausage and mushrooms MAKE the dish.  I've never heard of anyone else making stuffing this way.  Great minds think alike.

I threw in over a half cup of finely chopped carrot, I used a homemade poultry seasoning and homemade chicken stock. My husband said this stuffing was one of the best he's ever had. I have to agree with him. We both went back for seconds. This may be my new stuffing recipe.

A homerun at Thanksgiving! I increased the recipe to serve 12 people. I couldn't find unseasoned bread cubes so I just bought the seasoned kind and scaled down the added seasonings accordingly. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner raved over this stuffing! I did have to use two whole cartons of chicken stock (totaling 8 cups) in order to moisten the bread enough. So easy to put together and then end result was great! My father texted me the next day and said I should quit nursing school and open up a restaurant because of this stuffing recipe!

Excellent Thanksgiving side dish.  I only gave it 4 stars because the ingredients of 2 1/2 cups of broth is misleading.  It should say "approximately", then I would have paid attention to "add enough broth to moisten".  It turned out a bit soggy.  The taste was great though. This is the first time I've ever made a home made stuffing that wasn't all meat and potatoes.  I put a little into a small casserole just so I could taste it.  It is outstanding.  My daughter tried it and said "OMG it's SO good!  No, wait...it's BEYOND good, it's EXCELLENT!"...she finished the bowl.

This recipe rocks! I ended up using seasoned croutons(already had them on hand) and skipped on any other seasonings. Rave reviews from everyone - just a great combination of flavors for an outstanding side dish!

This was excellent!  I doubled it and used about two tablespoons fresh chopped sage instead of the poultry seasoning for a more traditional taste.  Thanks for sharing!

I usually make plain old stuffing at Thanksgiving just for tradition sake. But I selected this recipe last time, using savory sage sausage as a few others recommended, and now I have been asked to make it for family gathering since Thanksgiving. It is very moist and has a compelte flavor (you don't need to eat it with a bite of turkey or chicken for good flavor).

Very yummy and so easy! I might go without the sausage next time because I just really enjoy the veggies and bread.  I didn't need as much broth as was called for. I just added it little by little until it was moist.

I cooked my very first thanksgiving last year and this was the answer to my prayers.  No one in my picky family liked the idea of stuffing in any way.  It was completely gone before anyone went for seconds.  Even my picky friends loved this recipe,,, i did have to mince the onion and celery, and omit the mushrooms because my husband is allergic but I bet they would be good as the recipe says too.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

Very good recipe! Tried this last Thanksgiving to give family and friends something in addition to traditional stuffing ... huge success. I doubled the amount of sausage (sweet Italian) and mushrooms.  A new Thanksgiving & Christmas tradition in my house.

This was an absolutely amazing recipe! I have made it about four times now (I get requests all the time), and I love how delicious it is. I use stuffing flavored croutons, instead of unseasoned, and I think it definitely adds much to the flavour.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  I thought it was great!   My wife didn't like it, as she prefers the traditional stuffing instead. Still good, though.

This recipe, although I didn't follow it to the letter, turned out to be the best guideline ever.  We loved it, it turned out to be quite a winner over here!  Many thanks Ken, for posting it.

This stuffing is welcomed on our dinner table through out the year and a family favorite on Thanksgiving.  I was looking for a flavorful, easy recipe to replace bland box stuffings and have definitely found it in this recipe.  I made it following directions to the letter, again substituting sage sausage for the Italian and another time using sage and onion seasoned bread crumbs instead of unseasoned and have never been disappointed. This is a wonderful recipe that always gets rave reviews.

This is my new favorite stuffing recipe.  Everyone loved this.  I added apples to mine and used sage sausage, other than that followed it to a "T".  Thanks!

This was wonderful stuffing. I am use to making the traditional cornbread "Southern" stuffing, but this was wonderful. I used a whole lb. of sausage. Also, I cheated and did not use bread, I used onion and sage stuffing mix (2 bags). I mixed with chicken stock and spooned some of the turkey drippings on top after I had put it in the pan. I will make this again!

Excellent!! I am asked for the recipe every time I make it. I delete the salt as the sausage has enough for taste and I use organic chicken broth.  If you can't find the Italian sausage in bulk, you can remove the skins off Italian sausage links. I shred a loaf of French bread into small pieces and spread out over a baking sheet to dry out overnight to use for the cubes. This is a very moist and flavorful stuffing.

Love this recipe ~ I am asked to make it for every Thanksgiving. The only thing I do differently is I buy seasoned bread cubes so I don't need to use the poultry seasoning. Try it, it's easy and oh so good!  Enjoy!

The consistency and flavor were amazing.  Not too moist and not too dry :)  I used sage sausage and "beer can" chicken seasoning and it turned out great! I have tried many recipes from this site and this is the ONLY one I HAD to review.  I am not a fan of either stuffing or un-stuffing as the texture does not appeal to me...but THIS recipe is FANTASTIC.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was the first dish to go! My husband AND picky daughter keep asking when I am going to make more.  Thanks Ken :)

I just made this for our Thanksgiving dinner today.  My husband does not like dressing and he LOVED this one! It was easy to make and absolutely wonderful! I used Bob Evans Savory Sage sausage, other than that I followed the exact ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper and I will use it again and again.  Thank you!!!

For my money this is the best accompaniment for the perfect roast turkey. My mother-in-law shared this exact recipe (though I've never asked her where she got it from) with my husband over 15 years ago so it's obviously been out there for a while. To my mind, if it's still out there and enjoyed it must be a winner to have remained unchanged after all these years hey? If you're on the fence, definitely worth giving it a go.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years and everbody loves it. I can't find unseasoned croutons, so I just buy regular ones and do not add salt before trying it. Also, I use reduced sodium chicken broth and this might take care of the salt intake.

This recipe was the perfect cure for my stuffin cravin. I made some changes though: I used leftover chicken breast cut into cubes instead of sausage, add twice the amount of onions, added more seasoning salt, and used half white onions and half brown onions.   I made my own croutons with sourdough bread. If you use bakery-type bread instead of packaged bread, you might want to trim off the crust, since those bits were too hard for my tastes in the final dish.

Good but I was expecting more bold flavors.  This needed something else, can't put my finger on it.  I like the hardiness of it and overall, everyone ate it.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone had seconds. Made as listed. Excellent and even my picky brother in law who was bummed his mom didn't make the stuffing went back for thirds!

Delish! Replaced the Italian sausage with chicken apple sausage since we had a non-pork eater. It was the hit of Thanksgiving!

This was so delicious, I'm making it again tonight for dinner.  Mine  came out a little wet, but it didn't bother me at all.  Thanks for the recipe -- it was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was THE BEST I have ever had! The only thing I left out were the mushrooms because my son doesn't like them, but everyone raved about it. I stuffed my turkey with it and it was so moist and delicious. I even ate it cold and it was great the next day! Will be my stuffing that I use from no on.

Perfect for a simple, basic stuffing (or "unstuffing")!  This year was my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner, so I wanted an easy, traditional stuffing recipe - and this is great.  Don't worry about measuring the ingredients - just throw it all in and it will turn out great.

Thank you Ken for the recipe. Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I will use and share this recipe many times over the years to come, no doubt.
I did use Jimmy Deans Hot sausage and it was great.     David  Largo, Fl.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I made the dish early in the day and just popped it in the oven after the turkey came out of the oven.  It was a hit.  Very flavorful.  The only thing I did different was I used 1 LB of the sausage and I used sage flavored stuffing croutons.

I, like others, couldn't find unseasoned croutons, so I bought a loaf of whole grain bread, cut into cubes, and toasted.  This recipe was so scrumptious and delicious, and was very easy to make.

This was a huge hit.  I made it in a large crock pot and doubled the recipe. I also added one granny smith apple.  My son who doesn't like stuffing, loved this.  I'll be making this next year for sure!   Fast Forward 11 yrs.  This is a family favorite. I still add an apple plus I use Jimmy Dean's Hot Sausage.
