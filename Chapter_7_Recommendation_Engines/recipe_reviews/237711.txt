FAN FLIPPIN TASTIC! ! I used the oven, low n slow-300 degrees for 4-5 hrs. 2 bottles of beer n some bay leaves, left this beef incredibly tender! The meat is very versatile,  use it for casseroles, tamales, tequitos, even shredded beef burgers. As far as the salt issue, I just sprinkled the beef liberally with salt n pepper, not nearly 1/4 cup and it was perfectly fine. I did not marinate this at all. We ate this for dinner of course and can't wait to make Machaca in the morning with it!!

With the mixed reviews, I was hesitant to make this recipe. After cutting off most of the fat, I did have about 2 lbs of meat remaining. I cut the salt (used flake sea salt), cumin, and garlic by half but kept the water and onion the same since I had appointments that day. I didn't find it salty at all. With onions, cilantro, limes, and Corn Tortillas (from AR) this recipe was really good.

I bought cheek meat on sale not knowing what recipe I would even use it for. I found this recipe and although I found some others that used chuck roast instead, I wanted to try and make Barbacoa authentically. I reduced the salt by a tablespoon (we still really like salt, although I think I could have used the directed amount and it would have been fine) as per other reviews and used more Cumin to make up the difference. Marinated for 12 hours or so. We made tacos with it, topped with some Mexican blend cheese, salsa, and sour cream. It was awesome! My husband said it needs to be a weekly dish (great for me because I get to use the slow cooker) and after smelling the leftovers he brought for lunch, his co-workers asked me to make more for them next time since it's usually only available at a few restaurants here in Texas. I'd never even heard of this dish before, but so happy I stumbled across it. Set it and forget it prep.

I love making this dish. I try to make it on a regular basis. My family is of Hispanic origin and we got tired of having to go out to eat this dish.

This turned out excellent. Tasted just like the authentic Barbacoa my Mother in law got for us on Sundays. Will definitely make again.

So few ingredients and few steps and yet a very delicious meal. Didn't have 3# so had to modify proportions a bit. It was so tender and flavorful. Definitely going to be repeated.

Was so easy and straightforward.  I did find the beef cheek way too salty for us. I will definitely use this recipe again but reduce the salt. Other than that it reminded me of the taco places back home in Texas. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I love this recipe for cooking cheek meat my 1st time cooking this type of meat which I got from SAMS for $2.89 for the whole 4 lb pack they made a mistake in the pricing (my gain).  I followed the recipe exactly and I added more salt and let it cook for 8 hours did not have to add anymore water. This was great ?? and I will be cooking it many more times. My family loves it. Thank you for this wonderful recipe I give it 10 stars??.

I put the seasonings and onions and garlic into the foil packet and let it sit in the fridge overnight. In the morning I put it in the crock pot with the water and cooked on high for 7 and a half hours. I should have put the potatoes in to soak up the grease like another member suggested . It was delish, but very greasy. My cat and 2 dogs loved the gelatinous bits. My other family members said that they liked it but they did not get seconds. That's okay,  more for me.

Barbacoa is hard to find in Virginia. This recipe reminded me of my childhood days in Chihuahua. I substituted the cheek meat for tongue. It has more meat and less fat. I also added bay leaves and used less salt. The flavor was super delicious

I can say that the recipe is good with just salt and garlic salt. Barbacoa has a distinct flavor which is acquired by the slow cooking process. A family secret youall might find useful is use potatoes. You slice  3 potatoes in 1/4 inch slices and place as a bed and on top before you wrap in foil. Slow cook in high, not low for 12. When done and before you shred remove and discard the potatoes. They will be saturated with excess fat. Trust me you'll love it.

Will definitely not be making this again. I could not get past the "gelantinous slide". I used beef cheek.  I had to throw it out after a few bites.

Okay WAY too much salt. Even my salt fiend boyfriend thinks it way too salty. Can't even taste the pepper or cumin through the salt. It's all you can taste is just salt.

Cooking method wise the beef cheeks are tender and beautiful and done to a turn but as it is written (right now as I write this, the recipe calls for 1/4 CUP of salt) If this much salt is needed for some chemical react, maybe add some lime juice to cut the salt? if not I strongly suggest cutting the salt WAY back.

You seriously can't taste anything but salt. 

I served it with some homemade frijoles a little queso and some homemade tortillas so there is other food for dinner. But the salt content and the sodium per serving (see below) is just WAY off the charts.

And I am not even trying to be mean here, but I seriously think you maybe want to discuss your salt tolerance and sodium levels with your family physician. One serving is 96% of your RDA of sodium? 

Again the wrap and steam in the slow cooker worked well the meat looks beautiful and over all it SMELLS fantastic. It just doesn't tates the way it smells.
