Wow, really good, and it's actually a potato curry. VERY spicy but worth every bite! Didn't have (and couldn't find) black lentils, so left them out. Asafoetida powder is 1/2 onion powder, 1/2 garlic powder. Used regular flour for chickpea flour, and crushed red pepper for the whole, dried ones, and cumin powder and mustard powder for the seeds. Came out great!
