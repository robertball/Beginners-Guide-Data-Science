We made these fries for when we had a guest over and paired them with a marinated steak. It was absolutely delicious and everyone really liked them. Very easy to make and we will definitely make them again sometime!

Nice healthy version of "Fries side dish". But wait, if there ARE any leftovers. Top your salads, rice dishes with these. Also throw them in the blender with your Gazpacho veggies. Healthy, Healthy

LOVED THESE! Nice and simple, but very flavorful. I've had sweet potato fries before, but I liked these even better. They don't really crisp up like a regular potato would, obviously, but we were able to pick them up easily and eat them. The whole family really, REALLY enjoyed these, and as a plus they are better for ya...a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

THANK YOU!! this is so yummy, to the point of addictive. I cut 2 slices of squash and I might eat the whole tray alone!! my cutting was far from even, that being said, the thin ones are better than the thinker cut pieces. I got a little heavy handed with the salt, and I added garlic powder! I will definitely be making these often! Great side for 0 WW points!

Super easy and delicious.
I used a chipotle olive oil and just a little salt and pepper.

Liked the flavor.  Did have to cook for much longer 45 minutes.  Was very hard to peel and cut.  Maybe warming the squash a bit before cutting?
