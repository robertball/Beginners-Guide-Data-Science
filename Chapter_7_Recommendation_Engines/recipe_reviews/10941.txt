There is an easier way to prepare these.  Divide the chocolate and orange dough into two balls, wrap and chill well.  Form each ball into a log about 8 - 10 inches long.  Slice each log lengthwise with a sharp knife.  Reassemble the four half logs into two whole logs, each one half orange, half chocolate.  Wrap and chill well.  When ready to bake, just unwrap the log and slice evenly.  This saves so much time and is not as messy.  It also gives a nice clean "half and half" look to the cookie.

I love this recipe! It gets very addicting and does turn into a comfort food. The cookie has more of a cake like texture. I prefer swirling the chocolate and orange together like in Simone's picture. It balances the cookies out as oppose to Mallinda's picture. When it is only half + half the cookie tastes incomplete. So remember mix + swirl! (Take a small amount of the orange dough and then a small amount of the chocolate dough and roll it inyour hands!)

After dividing the dough in half I added 1/3 cup cocoa powder to the chocolate side instead of the melted chocolate and then refirgerated both. After they were hardened, I rolled out both sections of dough and then stacked them on each other and then rolled into a log and refrigerated. After the log was cold I cut it into slices and baked the cookies that way. Makes a very pretty cookie.

This recipe was very easy to make. I followed the advice of another poster and floured my hands. With that, I was good to go! I didn't have to add more flour to the recipe, I didn't have to chill, just floured my hands.

I also rolled some of the dough individually (didn't mix them together) to make some orange cookies and some chocolate cookies. They were great! So perfectly round, my friends were amazed at the presentation and flavor! Great recipe, will use again!

I made these cookies a second time, but instead of the dark chocolate/orange combination, I did a white chocolate/strawberry combo (substituded white chocolate, and instead of orange zest I put in a few tablespoons of strawberry jam and a few drops of red food coloring). Due to the liquidity of the jam, I did have to add about a half a cup more flour, and this time I refrigerated the dough. They turned out great, I loved that flavor combination!

Something is wrong with the proportions in this recipe; I'd like to try it with an additional cup of flour.  The dough was sticky and hard to work with; I had to chill it before rolling the cookies just so it didn't stick to everything.  They're a bit cake-like.  The orange was nice and orange-y, I added orange extract; the chocolate was just OK.
Overall, these required a lot of work; not worth it for  a) a marginal cookie and b) a low-yielding recipe.

These cookies were amazing! My husband and daughter ate them up! I followed the others advice and added a bit more flour, used cocoa powder, and divided them into two logs (which I refrigerated), and they came out wonderful! Very easy to make.

Everyone that tried these cookies absolutely LOVED them. I doubled the recipe, so it made a lot. I used fresh orange peel ground in the food processor. These cookies are GREAT!

Delicious.  I added about 1/4 cup extra flour so the dough was stiffer.  I don't like flat cookies.  They came out perfect.  Not dry.  To make the orange flavored part look "orange" I added about two drop of red food color and maybe six drops of yellow.  They looked really pretty.  I also topped them with chocolate by melting about 3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips in the microwave.  I ended up putting a large drop of chocolate on the top and then took the back of the spoon to spread it a little.  Added to the richness of the cookie and also took the presentation up a notch.  I'll definitely make these again.

Excellent!!!  I rolled each half into a log and joined them together as suggested.  I wrapped it in plastic, put it in the fridge and sliced to bake. Very pretty, very tasty and I'll definitely make them again.

These were delicious, but not entirely worth all the effort to make the half and halfs. I think a better option may be to make the cookie entirely orange flavored and then dip half in melted chocolate once it has cooled.

This is an attractive tea cookie that is easy to make. I used a cookie scoop and cut the dough balls in half. Putting half chocolate and orange scoop together produced a perfect looking cookie. Thanks for the post.

I agree with the above revew which said flour is less. With ty e first batch, the cookies were very crumbly and thin. I added some more flour (4 tbsp) and then they were ok. but the flavor is fantastic. 5 stars to flavor.

I love this cookie! It has more of a cake like texture. The chocolate and orange work so well together! I prefer mixing the two doughs together rather than sticking them together. Marblize it!

i too refrigerated the dough and laminated the two flavors/colors...but even with refrigeration it was a mushy disaster...needs much more flour...i will probably experiment with this and it will be a good cokie but as weritten it is marginal at best...they spread like mad in the oven as well...good idea...poor execution

YYUUUMMM!!! I was a bit nervous to make these at first, but they are awsome! I did play with the recipe a bit though. First, I used half white and half whole wheat flour. Also, I used the zest of a whole orange (a pretty big one). I also added a splash of orange juice to the orange part of the dough and added a bit more flour to make it stiffer. I used cocoa powder for the chocolate part to. I couldnt be happier with the way they turned out!!!

Delish. I made pinwheel cookies like shown in one of the photos by rolling out each type of dough into sheets, stacking them, then rolling into a log. Chill the log for ~1 hour in the fridge, and then it'll be super easy to cut into centimeter-thick cookies before baking!
Adding a tad more flour (or using lots of flour if rolling them out) helps for working with the dough.

I really liked these.  Chilling the dough was important for the chocolate half. Both the chocolate and the orange portions make excellent cookies all by themselves. I tried out the chocolate dought to make cookie cutter cookies and it handled beautifully as a roll out dough.  This one is a keeper.

Great cookie!  I made eight Christmas cookies this year & this was the favorite.  However, I made the entire cookie orange -- adding two tablespoons of orange zest and orange extract to the dough -- and dipped half the cookie in melted semi-sweet chocolate.  Not only did the cookie taste great, it looked great too.

I followed Cindy's suggestion and made logs and sliced the cookies that way to bake them. Easier said than done because this dough is quite sticky. I refrigerated it in the balls for a few hours, then let them warm up a little before forming the logs. Good taste, but the orange seemed to overwhelm the chocolate. My boyfriend gave these 'the nod', so they have to be pretty good. Thanks!

I didn't think that adding the little bit of orange zest would do anything for flavor, but boy was I wrong! The cookie tastes more orange then chocolate. It came out very yummy and was pretty easy to make too. I tried this recipe as a tester, and I'm for sure going to add it to this years cookie give-a-ways. I can't wait for Christmas!

Sensational cookies.  The flavor is delicate (I added extra orange zest), but everyone was so impressed with the unique combination.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding extra zest) and found them very easy to make.  I rolled tons of separate little balls from each falvor of dough and then stuck the two colors together.

What a great recipe!  Really pretty and really tasty!  They kind of look like a marble cake cookie.  They looked great on my cookie trays.

I loved these cookies! After reading the reviews, I decided to blend the two mixtures into one, and make the dough more manageable by using 3/4-1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (instead of the suggested unsweetened choc), since i wanted to get a dough that I could cut with cookie-cutters. The chocolate taste was a bit strong so perhaps next time I'll use less cocoa powder and more flour to make the dough manageable. I also think I used more than the suggested amount of orange zest simply because I love the taste. I will make this one again! (:

This cookie is very tasty --- I used a whole orange for the zest.  Next time I will double the recipe!

Very good thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I doubled to make for a bake sale. I took the advice and refrigerated dough after dividing into two. Then I rolled the two together into a log(need no flour).They looked and tasted great. Perfect cookie for summer treat. My kids loved it and I told them they would be charged for eating them! Thank you!

Goodness gracious, I love these cookies. So does my entire family- its all I am ever asked to make now. Getting them to look perfect took a few tries, but once I got the feel of it, my cookies began looking great. The flavor is a great mix, I can not recommend these cookies enough.

i find it very wierd that i did not care for these cookies at all. im sure there was something on my end that i did wrong, eventhough i followed the recipe perfectly. cookies came out more like a cake than a crunchy or chewy cookie.

Tasty, interesting presentation with the color mix, fairly easy/quick to make.  When the "swirl" method just didn't work for me as hoped, I reverted to the "pinch and ball" making route and it was no big deal; didn't even need to flour my hands.  Had to bake for a good 11 min. and then some.  Next time, I'll probably punch up the orange flavor a bit with some extract added.  Also may try using semi-sweet choc. and other flavor combos with choc., such as lemon or banana.

I just made these delicious cookies for the first time today - and they are just great!  Cakey texture, good balance between the orange and chocolate...just all around good.  I made orange sugar, and dipped the orange side in that, and the chocolate side in melted semi-sweet chocolate.  They look so pretty.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  They pass the taste test of my extremely picky husband.  

When forming the cookies, I split the dough (each flavour) into two, then made a long log of each one, joining the two colours together.  I sliced off 1 inch, rolled it into a ball (with floured hands so the dough doesn't stick).

I also baked for 11 minutes rather than the 8-10 as suggested.  I took them out when the edges started to brown.

GREAT RECIPE!!!

I had the same problem as a previous reviewer - way too sticky to work with easily.  I refrained from adding more flour, because I didn't want to take away from the flavor of the cookie, so I just floured my hands after every 2 or so cookies as I rolled the dough into balls.  The flavor was great.  I might not divide the dough next time and just combine the chocolate and the orange flavors, but the dual color cookie is cool, too.  Oh, and they were extremely cakey.

I agree with other reviewers that these are not worth the trouble. The dough is sticky and if you want them to look remotely cute, it's a lot of work for a cookie that is merely "meh." If you are going to make these freeze the dough into a log or logs and cut them into slices.

Made these a couple years ago and remembered a mild flavor so tried again.  Used penzeys orange peel and added almond extract to orange side.  Agree both needed maybe a quarter cup flour, less on orange side, but more on chocolate if using melted chocolate.  Did not chill and would recommend an hour in fridge to lessen spread.  I did marbling and halves for fun.  Flavor is still great, a nice change from rich chocolate.

Added a tsp of orange extract to the orange batter and a tsp of cinnamon to the chocolate batter. Sprinkled orange zest on top of cookies before baking and added 1 dark chocolate chip to each cookie as soon abs they came out of oven. 
Was very good.  Baked for 12 mins.

I like to bake with my young kids so I'm always looking for easy recipes. This is easy enough with a bit of changes for convenience after reading the reviews: 1.  I peeled tangerine and scraped off the white part. 2. I used cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate 3. I used additional (about 1/4 cup) flour. 4. I used brown sugar just because I don't buy white sugar.
It still turned out soft cookies but they are tasty.  Mostly, I think this recipe has great potential in terms of (easy) design and   ingredients.  Would definitely make it again.

I made all of the recommended changes--more flour, cocoa, rolled for spiral, orange extract, and doubled recipe.  
It required refrigeration after each step. The cookies tasted meh.  Will not make again.

I wish I'd read the reviews before trying this out... the dough was very sticky, I ended up adding about half a cup more of flour AND refrigerating, but they still turned out a bit flat and smooshy around the edges. Will try it again with the log idea that one of the other reviewers suggested, because the flavours were great - I didn't have orange so used grapefruit rind for the zest.

I followed one suggestion to use cocoa powder instead of chocolate, and added about 1/4 cup more flour as the dough was super sticky.  I made a rectangle out of the chocolate dough, placed a rectangle of orange dough on top and rolled them together (no easy fete!), then refridgerated them.  When harder, I sliced the dough so they would come out looking like the picture.  They were dry and bland when baked.  I have no idea how to fix that.  Nice idea, but definitely not worth the effort unless someone can fix the recipe once and for all.

I have made these cookies several times - both as written and with an extra 1/2 cup or so of flour (in a doubled recipe).  Though I like the looks of the extra flour version (more puffy), to  me they turned out too flour-y tasting.  Also, the extra flour took out the almost-fudgy quality of the chocolate side when made as written.  Regarding how to form the balls - I was skeptical of the "logs" approach, but am a convert.  It was easy, fast, and kept my fingers cleaner (cleaning up the flour from the counter is easy).

Mine turned out looking just like Mallinda's photo...and the flavor is out of this world.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour and chilled the dough for 30 minutes before rolling into balls.  These were easy to make and yielded me 36 cookies.  Will make these every year at Christmas!!!

Well, these are terrific. I too made 4  logs as soon as they were mixed, two of each, then fitting them together half orange and half chocolate, then chilling, then slicing. Easy as pie!

I like the chocolate/orange combination and decided to try these.  I spooned half of each kind of dough into a 1" scoop in an attempt to keep the colors separate, and that turned out pretty well.  The taste was good, but not outstanding.  I thought the finished cookies looked like they needed some kind of embellishment to give them some pizzaz, but I didn't know what--powdered sugar?  Icing?  Sprinkles?  A dip in chocolate?  In spite of being two-colored, they looked kind of boring on a plate.

I made these cookies exactly as directed.  I  have no complaints about anything.  They came out perfectly and were delicious.  I love the texture...crispy edges and soft insides.

My only suggestion would be to double this recipe.  There were not enough cookies remaining for others after my husband and I started tasting them.  :-)

Delicious! We loved the zingy flavour that the orange adds to the chocolate..My friends and I gobbled these down over the course of a sleepover..then we made some more!

Yummy!!  Made them for my work's Christmas party, and they disappeared in minutes!

Due to lack of time, I didn't separate the dough (combined the orange zest and chocolate together in dough), but they were still very good!

I first got this recipe from cookierecipe.com  for Christmas '98 so this was the third year I made them. They are great, not too sweet. Chocolate and orange is my mom's favorite!
