Making "Hello Dolly" bars has also been a family tradition of ours. My mom got the recipe (in 1950's) from one of her sisters. Basically the same....graham cracker/butter crust baked for 10 minutes. Then layer in this order...over hot crust 1 cup semi sweet choc chips, 1 cup butterscotch chips, 1 cup coconut, 1 cup chopped walnuts TOPPED by drizzling an entire can of condensed milk then back in the oven approx 25 min. The "key" to this is to cover the pan with aluminum foil immediately after removing from oven, and let cool overnight with foil still on.

I toss the butter in the 9x13 pan while the oven is preheating to melt, evenly sprinkle the  graham cracker crumbs over the melted butter, add the remaining ingredients and then evenly pour the can sweetened condensed milk over the entire pan.

These are quick, easy, sweet and tasty - which is exactly what I was looking for when my son told me at 7 p.m. that he needed to bring a food item for his Spanish class the next day! I had all of the ingredients for this on-hand, and threw these together in no time at all. My Mom used to make these, except the condensed milk was just drizzled on top (not on the bottom crust). I actually really liked this method better, as the bottom crust gets kind of chewy and toffee-like, rather than crumbly like my Mom's did.

Delicious!  You can play around with the toppings to suit your tastes.  I like dark chocolate, coconut, and almonds.  Next time I make these, which will be soon since they're so easy, I'll include the white chocolate chips as well. Perfect for parties.

These are perfect, I use actual graham wafers and chop them up in the food processor, one sleeve works. I also use one cup of white chocolate chips, but that is the only change

This is an excellent recipe and received rave reviews. I had to add a little more graham wafer crumbs(maybe 1/4 cup) to the 1/2 cup of melted butter as  it seemed too moist with just 1 1/2 cups of the crumbs. Otherwise it was a keeper

Oh my word! So addictive! I used butterscotch chips instead of white chocolate. Will definitely make again. I'll try white chocolate chips next time.

I made this exactly like the recipe says. I didn't like the bottom portion, it was making so much of a mess. It had too much chocolate chips for my taste. I was like eating straight up sugar with a crumbly graham cracker crust falling all over the place.
