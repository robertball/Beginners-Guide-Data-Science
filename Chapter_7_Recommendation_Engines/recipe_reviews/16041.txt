Excellent!! I only used 1/2 c. butter(1 stick). Thought that 1c. would be too greasy. Loved the flavor of this pie. Just like a gooey toll house cookie in a pie crust. We served with ice cream. Texture and flavors were perfect. Will make again! Thanks Betty for a yummy treat!

I'm really on the fence about this pie! I used 1/2 c. of butter like the other reviewers said and I can't imagine needing anymore than that. One one hand this pie really did taste like a gooey cookie but on the other hand if I wanted that i'd be better off just making cookies. Although the flavor was good the pie crust seemed to clash with the cookie flavor. Also, it doesn't look that good, for those of you that care about apperance.

I would say it was almost embarassing how easy this was to make.  I cut back the butter, using only 1/2 cup and that was plenty rich enough.  This pie is a great make ahead option, you can cut the slices and nuke them for 30 seconds to get that warm tollhouse pie, this stuff isn't anywhere as good cold.  The walnuts were a great effect, definitely will stay in my repertoire.

The taste was excellent but I had to cook it for way more time than it said - baked for an extra 20 min and then let it sit in the warm oven for 30 min more.

Cut the butter by half makes keeps this delicious but way less greasy and loose.

Served this twice at coffee hour for our church - and sold several at the church's holiday sale!

This is wonderful!  *I'm always asked to bring this pie for any function.  I did cut the butter to 1/2 cup as the 1 cup was too greasy.  Easy and quick don't even need a mixer for this one.

This pie is one of my FAVORITE pies to make for special events or if I have a sweet tooth. I usually add a 1/4 cup of cocunut shavings to mine which I love. I also use more chocolate chips if I have a major sweet tooth. I also use a full cup to 1 and 1/4 cup butter in mine and half melted and half softened butter. I am going to try not using as much butter and see how it turns out. Overall EVERYONE I make this for loves it, including myself

A HUGE hit! Like eating a large, gooey chocolate chip cookie, only better!  I brought this dessert to a dinner and EVERYONE had seconds.  (I only used 1/2 cup of butter).

This is very, very rich, but ohh so good. A tiny sliver is all you need to get your chocolate fix. I used the recipe as it was written, but I saw later where it was tried with half the butter and it was just as good. I plan to do that the next time I make this pie.

Followed previous reviewer's advice and halved the butter. Also, almost doubled the nuts and omitted 1/4-1/3 of the chips, based on what I had on hand. Wish I had reduced the sugar, this is entirely too sweet even with ice cream on the side. It is a tasty pie, no one in my home complained, like others said it's like a cookie. Some reviewers mentioned how unattractive their pie was, I thought mine was somewhat presentable (I might be bias). I will make again with several adjustments.

Not too bad. I called this Derby Pie growing up. Its really sweet, but good. Served it with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with some chocolate syrup. Pretty much just like i remembered it. My son just told me that he really liked the pie. Didn't give it a 5 because i think it could have been a little bit better. I used 1 stick plus 3 tbsp butter. seemed fine.

I used the 1/2 cup of butter like many others had suggested, it was plenty, and added a splash of vanilla.  Also cooked it an extra 12 minutes.  We served it only a few minutes after it came out of the oven and it too soft, it was the texture of uncooked cookie dough on the bottom and crispy like a meringue on top.  Now that is has cooled overnight, the texture is perfect.  It also cuts much better when it has completely cooled.

Followed suggestions to add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and used only 1/2 cup butter. Although it tasted alright, mine certainly did not come out looking like the picture. Quite unappetizing appearance. The chocolate chips took on the consistency as expected and, when set, seemed like an inexpensive dessert. Confident kids will love it.

Just what I was looking for. I used only 1/2 C. of butter and added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/4 C. of coconut. It was excellent. I did cover the entire pie with foil with 15 minutes of cooking time left so the top was not too brown.  I loved this pie!!!
