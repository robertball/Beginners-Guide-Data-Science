This makes for some very good chicken. However, the next time that I make it, I'm going to put the chicken on a rack which has been placed on a cookie sheet so it doesn't sit in it's own juices and the coating will be crunchy on both sides.

We LOVED our chicken like this! I made just enough of the crumb miture to coat my chicken (I used skinless thighs). I did add some seasoned salt, parsly and pepper to the crumbs as well. Before baking, I sprayed them with non-stick spray and sprinkled on some paprika for color. These came out crispy, and flavorful. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Why limit yourself to chicken! I've used this with no fry pork chops and large baked (white) fish fillets as well. For the fish I coat with some sour cream with a splash of lemon juice stirred in. Tried it just yesterday with pork chops coated with a painting of undiluted cream of mushroom soup. THANK YOU for taking the boring out of breading!

My "choosey eating" granddaughter begs me to make this.  She calls it "Flake Chichen".  I make it using a combination of 1 tablespoon butter and 2 tablespoons milk (add more of each as desired).  I melt the butter in the milk in the microwave.  I don't use the sesame seeds.  Dip chicken pieces in butter/milk then in the flakes.  Pour remaining milk/butter over the chicken and top with the remaining flakes.  I use chicken tenders and bake at at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  As I said, my granddaughter lovees it.  My grandson prefers the chicken dipped in stuffing mix and prepared the same way.

I added a good amount of Johnny's seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper to the coating ingredients. I chose to use chicken legs in this recipe. I wanted the chicken to remain crisp, I laid the chicken on wire racks (like what you would use for cookies) inside my deep broiler pan. This way, the fat would drip down into the pan through the racks and not make the bottom of the chicken goopy. This chicken turned out nicely--no leftovers. I'd use the coating again but I think that I'd season up the coating just a touch more and change to a different "dip" instead of milk next time. It's a great base. I would have never thought to use that combination of ingredients for a chicken coating before--it's very inventive and wonderful for a cook wanting to use on hand ingredients.

Simple yet delish! Thanks for sharing....BTW, Fanny Haddock - I think the "refrigerate for up to 4 months" means you don't have to use right away if you don't want to. I don't think anyone would actually keep it in the fridge this long :)

I used Bran Flakes, non fat Parmesan cheese, salt free seasoning and either used 1/2 % milk or the non-stick spray on the skin free chicken. The rest I of the ingredients I kept the same. Placed foil on the bottom of baking dish and sprayed the foil with non-stick spray. I also used parsley sprinkled on top of chicken coating for color. We are both on special diets for different reasons but this recipe with changes fit nicely into our diets. Thank you for the recipe. We have had it for family and friends and everyone loved it even the grandchildren, who are hard to please.

We really did not like this. We did not like the taste of the coating and the chicken had little taste. Just our opinion.

Great recipe! I only had boneless/skinless chicken in the fridge, so used about 3 lbs of that, cut up into about 3-4" square pieces, and found that 1 c. of the coating was more than enough. Cooking was around 25-30 mins for boneless

This was a great recipe.  It was super-easy, healthy and tasty.  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and cut them into chicken-tender-sized pieces and made chicken nuggets.  I would add a little bit of season salt next time to give it a little more flavor.

This makes a really good, crunchy coating. I felt it needed more seasoning, though, so I added some garlic powder, salt and pepper. Also, I substituted grated Romano cheese for the Parm because that was what I had on hand.

This turned out pretty good.  The only reason it wasn't my favorite was because I tried to do something different.  We used buttermilk instead of regular milk (because we had some leftover) and it just left that bitter buttermilk taste.  So I'm sure this recipe would be wonderful if I didn't try to do different things.

This was really good. I had planned to make it for family and wound up with extra guests. Everyone raved about how good it was. I will make this again. Next time I will crush the cornflakes more though so they coat better.

This is for Fanny Haddock ,  Fanny, the recipe is for a mix that may be used as needed.  Probably will even last longer if frozen.  I freeze my crumb mixtures and therefore have them ready at a moments notice.

I mixed McCormick's Old Bay Seasoning in, instead of the sesame seeds and paprika. It was GREAT! A Spicy kick and crunchy! We use this seasoning alot in Maryland for our crabs and seafood as well.

At least half the coating fell off during cooking.  These were ok, not bad, not good - but I wouldn't make this again.

This dish was super simple and tasty. My kids loved it and it`s a great alternativefor chicken fingers as my son is gluten intolerant. I did these on chicken breasts and will cut them into chicken fingers next time I make them. I recommend putting them on a rack in the pan though as the bottoms were a little soggy.

I have a ton of chicken recipes but figured I would try this. I thought it might be a bit bland (no salt either) and in my opinion and my families, it was. It wasn't bad, but not worth making again.

Wonderful. I was recently put on a low sodium, low cal, low cholesterol, diet. This gives me another option for chicken. I did lower the Parmesan a bit but it was still excellent and very crunchy. By the way, I used egg substitute for the wet wash, it worked very well. Great recipe.

This was actually very good.  My husband loved it!  Did need a bit more seasoning, however.  It tasted even better the next day.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  I used boneless, skinless chicken to lighten it up and it was still tasty.  Both my girls (3 & 1) and my husband enjoyed so I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used a como of rice crispies and panko.

it is just saying that it will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 months after you make it. You can use it right away after making it.

I think the crumb mixture can be prepared ahead of time, and kept in the fridge for up to 4 months.  That way you don't have to mix it up fresh each time...
