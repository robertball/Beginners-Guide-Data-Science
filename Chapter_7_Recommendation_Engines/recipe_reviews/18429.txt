I was very disappointed with this recipe because while making the crust I found that there is an ingredient missing.  The recipe needs something to hold the crust together.  As it stands the crust is VERY dry.  The recipe for FRUIT PIZZA I worked out better for me . . .

I make this all the time, however, I take the easy route and use the sugar cookie dough from the store. We love it with banana, kiwi, strawberries and sometimes mandarin oranges. Get creative!

I followed other suggestions and used Pillsbury Sugar Cookie dough. I also forgot to add the cool whip, and it was STILL excellent.

I used kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, and mandarin oranges for my fruit topping.  It was very, very good!  This recipe is easy to make, has an excellent taste, and an impressive presentation!

I wanted to bring a fruit pizza to a BBQ, but all the recipes on AR either call for store bought dough or require minimal ingredients for the crust like this one (hence four stars).  So for the crust I used "Soft Sugar Cookies V" from this site (halved the recipe).  LOVED IT!  Otherwise for the cream cheese frosting I used what this recipe called for.  It was perfect!  Topped with Strawberries, Kiwi, and Blueberries.  Will definitely make again!

Great dessert, after reading reviews about the crust, I put in 3c flour, 1/2c b. sugar, 1/4c icing sugar, 1 1/4c butter, for the sauce I used 1 pkg cream cheesemixed well with 1 jar marshmallow topping-used peaches, nectarines and strawberries, then mixed 1 cup yogurt with 2T strawberry jam to glaze over the top. Family loved it, crust stayed crunchy until the next day-made in jelly role pan

I made this recipe for a Fourth of July lunch at my job.  The crust was very dry, and I could hardly cut through it.  However, it tasted pretty good.  I have to say that it made for a very interesting party.  Pictures available upon request!

We used refrigerated sugar cookie dough, only used 1 package cream cheese, 8 oz whipped topping, 1/2 c powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla. Put in pizza pan. Was good, and kids had fun making this.

I modified the crust recipe, based on prior reviews, by adding 1/4 cup milk and an egg, increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup and cutting back the flour to 3 1/2 cups.  Add the flour gradually and mix with your hands until it is no longer sticky and can be easily spread into pan.  It came out great.  With these changes, it's a definite keeper.  I brought it to a cookout and it vanished in no time, while all the other desserts were hardly touched.

I made this exactly to the instructions and although I was skeptical because the dough was so dry before baking, it turned out really yummy. The cream cheese filling and fruit serve to moisten the dry baked dough and make it a great combination.  I actually made this recipe using the Pillsbury premade sugar cookie dough as well and brought both to a party and every liked the fruit pizza made from scratch versus the premade cookie dough.  The cookie dough was too mushy and soggy.

I used this mainly for the filling part.  I used refridgerated sugar cookie dough and used a cookie sheet. I used 1 1/2 rolls of dough.  I used lowfat cream cheese, and low fat cool whip.  Nobody knew the difference.  Very easy, and very good.

Didn't make the crust, used sugar cookie dough as others suggested. Not impressed with the filling. I mixed everything exactly as the recipe specifies, I ended up with something that tasted like cool whip. If I would have known that, I could have skipped some steps and just slopped some cool whip on the top. Think it could have been better with a smaller (8oz) container.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  For ease and a less sweet crust I use the roll out crescent roll dough.  If I want to get extra fancy at the Holidays I cut crescent roll dough in to "pinwheel slices".  On a cookie sheet construct the slices in the shape of a Christmas tree.  Frost with the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture.  Lightly sprinkle with green sugar.  Then decorate with fruit!

The taste was excellent and it looked great, but mine came out mushy once it started to settle. I think I'll try to cook the cookie longer. Great recipe and goes over great at parties!

I used Pillsbury sugar cookie dough and rolled it out and cut into a rectangle on a piece of tin foil on a cookie sheet(easy removal of cookie). I let it get light/medium brown in the oven, and cut into serving-sized squares before hardened. After it cooled, I mixed Cool Whip and some vanilla extract with an 8oz block of softened cream cheese and spread that on the giant cookie. Allrecipes was down, so I had to improvise a bit with the topping, but it was still good. I made a square of blueberries, and then alternated the red stripes with strawberries, raspberries, and maraschino cherries(stems plucked out). The only thing I'd do differently besides the topping next time would be to make it the day I was serving. It got a little bit soggy overnight, but still went over big at our family 4th of July celebration!

The dough was thick, but after reading previous reviews complaining of dryness, I deducted 1/2 cup flour and added one egg. It seemed to do the trick!

The crust is not right on this recipe.  If you are going for a drier crust, I would suggest a toasted graham cracker version.  This one leaves you with a mouth full of four-like crumbs.  Topping is good though.

This recipe did not work for me. The crust seems incomplete. Yea I just wasted 4 cups of flour, sugar and butter! I didn't even try the topping, who knows if they missed an ingredient for that! My advice, DON'T USE THIS RECIPE!

Pretty good.  The dough was a little dry, but the cream cheese and fruit was wonderful.  Next time I'll try the sugar cookie shortcut.

I love fruit pizza! I make the "sauce" from cream cheese and strawberry jelly. Just mix the two and spread it on. It's GREAT! I'm making it tonight and trying strawberry flavored cream cheese. I'm crossing my fingers that it turns out YUMMY!!

This is wonderful!!!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. The crust was out of this world good. I wasn't sure how "dry" the crust dough should be, and ended up adding all of the 4 cups flour and had a crumbling crust. I added more butter to help moisten the dough and then spread it out in the pan. After adding 3 c. of flour, proceed very slowly with additional flour until dough is dry and not crumbly. I also added extra cream cheese-2 pkg cream cheese, 1-8ox. container of Cool whip, and 4 tsp. vanilla. I used kiwi, strawberry, blueberries and it was so pretty!

I thought the crust would be terrible from the consistency and reviews but it wasn't bad once everything together, it's a good base that's not too sweet. This makes a big pizza and I had to push the dough into a pan to clump together. You might want to melt the butter first. In the topping I added two ripe bananas so I cut the cream cheese to one package. It was really tasty and fruity. It was a hit at the BBQ

This is a terrible recipe! Tried to make the crust but like the other 1 star review there are some missing ingredients. The crust is way too dry. Had to modify on the fly.

I added eggs to the crust, although it's still very dry! when i make it again I think I'll use sugar cookie for the crust. the recipe is easy to do, and you can dress it up with any kind of fruit! overall I give it 2 stars!

Yes...the crust recipe probably doesn't need to be as rich as a sugar cookie or shortbread, but this is still dry and unappealing after baking.  I'm not going to waste the toppings on it.

Fun, tasty, attractive dessert! I added some lemon juice and zest to the cookie "crust."  Also, I'm in a country that doesn't have frozen whipped topping, so I made sweetened whipped cream, instead, and then beat in cream cheese. It was great.

I think this is a great recipe!!! I've made it for a few parties and rarely is there any left over!!  If I am short on time I make it using premade sugar cookie dough from the grocery store.  It saves lots of time and is nice and soft!!  Yummy!

I love this recipe. I use premade cookie dough and bake it though to save time. People ask for the recipe everytime I make it.
