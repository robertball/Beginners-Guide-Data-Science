Excellent recipe, I did make some changes (just for personal taste). I don't associate green peppers with tacos, so I omit those and put in black olives (sliced). I prefer Hidden valley Ranch, and I used the one with bacon flavor.
Instead of beef, I use chicken (healthier), and I usually make this recipe after having one of those already made at the grocery store chickens, I use all the chicken that is left after dinner and throw it in the salad.
There are many different ways to do this salad, it's a perfect base recipe!

YUM! I did make some lighter/healthier substitutions. I used fresh gound turkey instead of beef, low sodium taco seasoning, 2% Mexican cheese (not Cheddar), 1 cup (not 1/2 c.) light Catalina dressing, and baked tortilla chips. I also added 1 can sliced jalapenos(drained), 1 can sliced black olives (drained), 1 can black beans (rinsed and drained), and a spritz of lime. This light and healthy dish was packed with plenty of flavor and nutrition. Definitely a keeper!

This was so delicious!  My husband and I tried different salad dressings and they worked great.  The slight warmth of the ground beef and noodles mixed with the cool flavor of the lettuce and tomatoes made this dish delightful!

I made this tonight as a test to see if i wanted to make it for a potluck at work next week. Was great! I did make some changes, i added sliced black olives, used ranch dressing instead of catalina, and about Â½ cup salsa. We also crushed up some nacho doritos right before we ate and mixed it in. Was great!! Will definately made again & again. Thanks so much! This is a keeper!!?

This pasta salad was delicious!  I also added olives.  I would recommend cubing the cheese as the shredded cheese clumped together.  This salad was tasty and delicious.

This recipe was awesome!! I'd give it six stars if I could. I took it to a family fish fry, doubled the recipe and it was gone in a flash. I used Kraft Sundried Tomato and Oregano dressing(not fond of Catlina) and Tex Mex cheese instead of cheddar.

I used whole wheat elbow macaroni, homemade taco seasoning sans salt, omitted the lettuce, and I used 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I didn't have any Catalina salad dressing on hand and was disappointed with the recipes I found using too much sugar or ketchup as a base so I mixed 3/4 cup of homemade salsa and 3/4 cup fat free sour cream with the taco seasoning stirred in as the dressing. Everyone loved it, even me who had a small taste. Next time, I'll make sure to have shredded lettuce on hand to add in. Maybe add some olives. I served this with homemade cornbread which was a great throw-together dinner on a warmish day and quite filling for my three boys. NOTE: My husband thought this was even better the next day.

All these years of making a pasta salad it never occurred to me to make a Mexican version. I really wanted a cold version since it was a hot night, and so instead of beef we used some leftover roisterer chicken, red and yellow bell pepper instead of green. Also chopped some black olives and avocado. I did spice it up a bit with cumin and a dash red pepper flakes. We used ranch dressing since the dish had tomatoes in it and it complimented very well, kind of cooled down the spicy with each bite. I really don't know if I'd try with the hamburger, don't like warm salads, but with chicken it will be a summer meal made often in my house. Thanks for the idea!

This is freakin' amazing! I just got done making it for a banquet we're having at my school. I omitted the green peppers and onions though. I'm not a huge fan of either. Instead of onions, I put in a tablespoon of onion powder. Delicious! :)

I like to make a single serving of this for myself for lunch if we have leftover taco meat from the night before.  Insead of chopping an onion, green pepper and tomato just for this one salad I cheat and use salsa.

It may not be the most refined meal you will ever eat, but it sure is good!  I cooked the onions with the ground beef so they weren't crunchy.  This is SO GOOD... made it twice in one week.  :)

This was ok, my husband really likes tacos and I don't so I thought I'd try this as something that we both may like. I thought the dressing was pointless, and that to me, taco's and pasta should never mix.

Delicious! I did not use green pepper simply because I had none. I used romaine for the lettuce and substituted a jar of salsa for the tomato and catalina dressing. We will definitely be using this recipe this summer!

Nice change from ordinary macaroni salad.  Probably won't make it too often but it's good if your looking for something different.

This is great! I made more for leftovers by cooking 1lb pasta (whole wheat rotini) and 4c lettuce and 1c Catalina, and used two packages of taco seasoning (homemade). I cooked the onion & pepper with the ground beef (raw peppers bother me & DH, raw onion bothers SS) and I added minced garlic to the mix. Everything else I used the quantities stated in the recipe - it was a good change, everything seemed enough for quantities.  I cubed a block of sharp cheddar to mix in rather than using shredded cheddar, we prefer it that way in salads. We will definitely have this again!

I tried to lighten this recipe as much as possible by using Ronzoni whole wheat rotini pasta, 1/2 lb. ground chuck and 1/2 lb. ground turkey, 2% cheddar cheese, and fat-free Catalina dressing.  We enjoyed it.

This recipe is awesome! I added a can of black beans ( drained and rinsed) and used Ranch dressing instead of Catalina. Also served with crushed tortilla chips on top. Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing this :)

A big hit at dinner last night!  I used ranch dressing because I had it, and I let people add what they wanted after I mixed the pasta and meat (and veggie meat in a different dish for me:).  Everyone loved it, and I just had it for lunch today, even better cold!  (we couldn't wait for it to cool yesterday)

This recipe was a very good recipe. It was a very simple recipe, we made it in our grade 10 foods class. Although a very tasty recipe, there are a few things that we suggest using. Instead of using the salad dressing we added salsa for a better texture and spice, we cooked the veggies as a stirfry to get more flavour. Overall this was a fun, easy, and great tasting salad and would recommend trying this.

Delicious!!! I omitted the lettuce as this dish will be only for me and many leftover meals so I did not want the lettuce to get soggy and spoil the dish later on. I also used twice the amount of the catalina dressing which I loved, and had never used before. I also cooked the onions with the beef. def gonna make again!

Wanted a new change for a picnic salad, this was perfect...with some modifications! I made a mistake and bought green onions but figured they would still be great with the salad! I also could not see using green peppers or raw onions so I just used the green onions. I added ranch and crushed doritos and mixed together. Everyone had some on their plate!  Thanks, Gert for the idea!

Very good salad.  I made my own personal salad.  I put the tortilla chips on the bottom and layered the lettuce on top.  I mixed the ground beef, pasta, tomatoes, and green peppers together and sprinkled my cheese on top.  I omitted the dressing and added sour cream and salsa.  Delicious!!!!  Will definitely make again.

Very good.  I like that it has the lettuce in it instead of all pasta.  Went over well both at church (turned vegan for fasting with no cheese and subbed black beans for the ground beef) and as written for family.  Also good with doritos instead of the tortilla chips.

Excellent recipe... I used ground turkey and not the whole packet of taco seasoning.
Tastes great heated up too. I'd like to try a vegetarian option next.

This is absolutley amazing!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and make extra if you are making this for a party because it disappears fast and it is an excellent snack to have in the fridge.

This was actually pretty good. I was a little worried about how the dressing would taste, but it turned out really good. I used a low fat french dressing, left out the green peppers and added a spoon full of sour cream. This is a quick dinner with ingredients that are usually on hand.

absolutely fantabulous!!!!! i tweaked it for sure but i loved the basic idea and just went with it.  i added black beans and roasted corn, and subbed taco sauce for the catalina dressing - great way to cut calories and fat, plus it has more of that southwest flavor to it.  i could eat this every night for dinner.  we crumbled tortilla chips on top, but in the future i will try making homemade tortilla bowls and serving the salad in them.  yummm!

I have made this recipe a few times.  Overall it is only a three but with a few of my own changes, I have made it a 5 (IMO).  I used VE Pueblo Bean Dip mix instead of the pkg of taco seasoning, used tri-color spiral pasta, left out the lettuce, used Kraft Mexican Cheddar, added celery & cucumber (for the kids), used green onion or red  (less harsh tasting than a yellow onion), used French Dressing.  Served with Doritos Zesty Nacho, sour cream and Salsa on the side.  It gets devoured and is even better the next day

This recipe knocked my socks off!  I really loved it.  I made it exactly as written.  This is a salad that is a meal. My kids all liked it and I served it at a potluck and everyone there thought it was really good.  One word of advice, the lettuce gets soggy so if you are planning to have leftovers (like I always do...makes for a great lunch!) maybe leave the lettuce out on the side and add it to each serving for extra freshness.

This recipe was pretty good although I added a little more dressing to the mix because it seemed a little dry.  Otherwise it was gone before I knew it!  :)

This was really tasty made as written.  It makes a lot and is even better the next day.  I don't know about it being a main dish though, to me it was more of a side dish.  I plan to bring this to the next potluck/get-together I attend.  Might use less onion and throw in some jalapeno peppers.

YUM! I had to use more dressing than called for (I used Catalina, b/c I had it here), and served the corn chips on top instead of mixing them in b/c I didn't want them to get mushy. I served this warm b/c hubby requested it that way and I really wasn't sure if this was supposed to be warm or cold, so... A very nice change from the usual and one that I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fantastic! I made this salad three times - once with leftover rotiserrie chicken and twice with ground beef. Both ways were delicious! The third try was definately the best! I made a few changes to suit my family's tastes - grape tomatoes in place of cherry. My kids (and hubby) don't care for the crunch of onions, so I fooled them by using green onions and then onion and garlic powder/salt. I used red and yellow bell peppers instead of green. Ranch in place of Catalina. I added lime tortilla chips in the salad and on the side as well as squeezing lime juice over the salad (just a smidge). I also added cooked and drained sweet corn and some cilantro to the mix.

Pretty good.  Hard to eat the left over (which there were a lot of) becasue of the ground beef being mixed in and I prefer that part warm but the lettuce does not taste good reheated.

Wowzer! This is excellent! I have to eat GF, so I substituted rice pasta, and added thin tortilla strips to the mix. We've eaten it plain, and with the Catalina dressing. I prefer the Catalina. It gives it such a different flavor than you're expecting with a taco dish.  This is a PERFECT take to a party, unique  kind of dish!  Yummy!!

One of my husbands favorite meals is tacos and I saved this recipe because I thought it would be a nice change to regular old tacos.  I was skeptical because of the catalina dressing, however this was so good!!!  I left out the green peppers(personal preference) and I used scallions instead of onion. I also added black olives.  Excellent recipe!!

This was tasty. I like the concept behind this.. taco.. salad.. AND pasta! Some of my favorites! But the lettuce got weird and droopy, somewhat chewy too. I'd make it again though :) The DH liked it and it was low-fat.. I'll get over the chewy lettuce!

I made this for my family, even doubled the recipe and there was none left!!! definitely will make again.

Made some alterations (1 full bag of cheese), used sour cream, and instead of using salad dressing I put in a jar of salsa!

This is a very good taco salad. I completely omited the salad dressing as I think it tastes better without. Adding the dressing would distract from the taste of the taco seasoning. Yum!

Delicious and easy recipe!  I made this recipe, exactly as written (I used the Taco Bell taco seasoning), and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it!  A nice change of pace from the traditional potato and macaroni salads.

Very tasty as a lunch, or side dish for dinner.  Great with chopped baby spinach instead of lettuce.  I also skipped the onion and green pepper, I don't associate those with taco's either.  The french dressing is a nice touch.  Easy and I would make it again anytime.

It wasn't bad-it just didn't really do it for me (or the rest of my family.) Nobody went back for seconds. We love Taco Salad and we love Pasta salad-but those are things enjoyed best on their own. If you are known for serving great pasta salads (and I am) skip this. If you don't both you and your guests will be left disappointed.

Added black beans and corn.  Left the rest of the recipe the same.  Really good and makes tasty leftovers to fill a tortilla burrito-style!

I too made changes.  I used a mixture of Pace salsa and mayo instead of the Catalina.  I added a tablespoon of El Paso taco mix to the salsa mixture and it was very good.  Cubed the cheese as another review said. My version though had only a quarter pound of taco meat and slight also on the lettuce.  Took it to the family reunion and listened to everyone remarking on how good it was.

I made this yesterday for my daughter's first birthday party. Everyone loved it. I did a few things different I didn't add the green pepper at all. Second I put the tomatoes, onions, and olives on the side so they could be added as liked. I also put some sour cream on the side. I also used Nacho Cheese Doritos. I will definalty make this again.

I brought this to a cookout and got mixed reviews.  The bowl did not empty, but those who did try it liked it--I think for some they couldn't see the connection between taco's and pasta salad.  My husband liked it, so that is what is important.  From previous reviews, I used lime juice, black olives, black beans, salsa and green onions.  Will try again next summer..thanks Gert.

This is a great recipe! My husband gave me many compliments and it satisfied his appetite as well. Most salads don't. I did add black beans, olives and green chilis. I used a chipotle taco seasoning that was very tasty and a little spicy. we don't use Catalina dressing so I did use ranch dressing and salsa. It was delicious!

This recipe was awesome and easy to make.  I made it with my grade 10 class and it was probably the most constructive thing I had done that day.   Yeah, the recipe was great, try it out and share it with your friends.

This recipe reminds me of the taco salad we get from the deli--which is what I was looking for. Makes a huge amount! (I didn't realize it until everything was mixed together.) I didn't use green pepper since I don't associate that with tacos, but I did add a can of sliced black olives. I used catalina dressing--when mixed together, the catalina taste is certainly not overwhelming. (I can't imagine it with ranch??) This recipe is a keeper!

A dinner we thoroughly enjoyed.  We enjoy this dinner with the pasta and the meat warm.  I mixed the lettuce and the warm pasta together and next added the veggies, warm meat, cheese, taco chips and 'Sweet and Spicy French Dressing' from AR, in that order.  This is a nice twist on a regular taco salad with having the pasta included.  We also had 'Deviled Eggs' from AR with dinner.

This was not very good. It was kind of a strange mix of warm and cold that just didn't work for my palate. I may try it again some other time, with some alterations of course.

Lends itself to lots of teaking, but great as written.  I used left over turkey breast, bacon catalina dressing, green onions, black olives, pimentos, tomatoes, green peppers.  Finish with shredded cheese, crushed tostitoes and guacamole.

I didn't have shredded cheese so I used feta.  I also didn't have lettuce but will use next time.  I opted for more taco seasoning and bypassing the dressing.  And, I added a can of green chilies. Yummy!

This recipe was great!  I subbed a squirt of Italian dressing because I didn't have catalina.  Resist the urge to dump in two packets of taco seasoning...I did and it overpowered a bit.  If I had followed the recipe and only used one, it would have been even better.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

This was a nice new twist on an old favorite.  I followed the directions as far as the ingredients and mixed them as directed.  I served with extra lettuce, red onion, tomato, cheese and green pepper.  We also served sour cream and crushed Doritos on top.  This is a nice, easy meal for a summer evening and a real kid pleaser :o)  I would definitely make this again.  I plan on adding some black beans or kidney beans.

Very good, approved by the kids! I used salsa to speed up preparation instead of tomatoes, peppers and onions. I layered it as well, salad mix, taco and pasta mix, ranch dressing, shredded cheese then broken tortilla chips. Used ranch instead of catalina personal preference.

This is a great recipe.  So delicious.  I followed the recipe with the only exception being that I used a yellow pepper instead of a green pepper.  It was a hit at a work potluck and I can't wait to make it again for my family.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so so yummy! I took this to work (no picture)for my lunch today and it was so good. I had leftover buttered corkscrew pasta from the other day and leftover ground beef from tacos last night, so I put those together in a tupperware dish, and in another tupperware dish I put shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and cheese. When it was time for lunch I microwaved the beef and pasta then mixed in the toppings and poured in a little of the dressing put the lid back on and shook away. Made a great and filling lunch. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is delicious, don't change a thing! I served the chips & lettuce on the side. I used this on a Mexican buffet I made for a family dinner, next time I will definitely double the recipe.

This was pretty good although I will change it next time I make it. Add more beef, less pasta and I used Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch...it paired great with the salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family love this.  I usually keep the chips (usually fritos) out of it and we put them in our indiviual bowls.  We then take leftovers to work/school the next day with little baggies of chips.  It is wonderful to see my nine year old get excited about a salad.

This was a good recipe. Forgot the chips at first,  once added it changed the meal to be even better. I also cooked the onions down with the meat. When I make again I will probably leave the bell pepper out, not a big fan.

Made it at home on a trial run following it exactly as written. The flavor was only OK and the combination of lettuce and pasta was weird. Overall it had a messy appearance. I made it a second time and added Franks hot sauce to the meat, eliminated the lettuce, and used ranch instead of catalina. The flavor was much better. I tried to layer the ingredients to make more attractive: meat/pasta mixture, ranch dressing, tomatoes, cheese, green onion, and pepper and added black olive. I thought it looked much better that way. I still ended up bringing alot of it back home with me. I won't be making this again.

YUM!  This was a great, easy recipe! We substituted the Spicy Ranch suggested by another reviewer, and I ommitted the green pepper.  In the future, I will also add black beans.  Good the next day, too!

Teenage daughter, husband, and I rate this recipe as OK.  It was a preview- trial recipe, deciding if I would make this for the BUNCO girls.  Conclusion: OK for a quick family supper, but I would not fix for "the girls".

I started off trying to find a recipe my husband could make.  Ladies, this worked!  He doubled the hamburger to make it "dinner worthy" as he put it.  He also added 1 jar of salsa instead of the tomatoes.  Very yummy!

we made this in our grade 10 foods class. we took out the onions, cherry tomatoes, lettuce and green peppers. the only ingredients we used were the pasta, taco mix, beef, and salsa. it was really good everyone in our group loved it.we took out most of the vegetables because not everyone in our group liked them but it was still great and we will definatly make it agian.

I thought this recipe was great. It was extremely tasty and left you many opportunities to add or leave out certain ingredients to make it appealing to your personal tastes. I suggest that instead of using the Catalina dressing, to use salsa. It gives it more flavour and overall tastes much better.  Experiment with it and add what you eat in your tacos.
this was extreme, carvis fo life

Delicious!  I used ranch, because I thought I would have better odds of my son eating it.  Either way would be great! thank you!  Also, I used Taco Season (I) from this site as I had no taco seasoning packets at home.

This was great. I used lighter ingredients and whole wheat pasta. The pasta got a little bit grainy, but otherwise it was really good. I even took it to work for lunch two days in a row.

I think this is a good base recipe that will allow you to make it your own.  I omitted the pasta.  I usually throw the leftover taco meat on a salad and I saw no reason to fatten up the salad with the pasta.  I also left out the green peppers, added olives & subbed ground turkey.  Was fabulous and will make again and again!  Will try w/some of the other suggestions (i.e., chicken, bacon ranch dressing, etc.).

I had just received my Wildtree taco seasoning, then went looking for a recipe so I could use it and had to try this one. I did however experiment as I had a good bit of ground beef to use:  for one salad I sauteed the onion and pepper, then used Catalina and the other I left both raw and served with Jalapeno Ranch. I liked both equally. Sorry, I made the variation, but I have trouble eating raw peppers and the Jalapeno Ranch needed to be used before it expired. Next time, I will definitely use spiral pasta, it's a prettier presentation as opposed to the mezza rigatoni, I used. Also to the toppings, I might add pinto beans and black olives. Thank you Gert for sharing your recipe, was so happy to use my new seasoning!

Fabulous recipe! My husband asks for this constantly! I mostly stick to the recipe, substituting a combo of spicy ranch dressing and salsa for the Catalina. I also added a little fresh cilantro for some zing. Makes fantastic leftovers, even if the lettuce gets a little soggy. My husband and I love bell peppers... I noticed a lot of reviews left them out. Personal preference. We couldn't do without!

I'm giving this 5 stars- not that I actually got to taste it, but by the reaction of the volleyball players who ate it before I got to taste it!  All gone in minutes.  Thanks for sharing.  Next time I will grab a taste if they will let me:)

Suppper easy and tasty! I used Barilla Plus Penne noodles, and didnt use green peppers, not a huge fan in taco stuff. Also added some extra onions, and use sour cream and salsa on the side! Great salad!

VERY VERY TASTY!!!  The only thing I changed was used sour ranch instead of catalina dressing.  My husband had thirds & usually don't go back for seconds.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and hearty.  I like the composition of these 2 great salads bc the pasta gives it such substance and taste and doesn't wilt like a traditional taco salad after it sits after awhile (then seemingly ruined / perished).  Good stuff!

This was really really good.  The family has been asking for this again and it hasn't been that long since we've had it!  I know a lot of reviewers say they went with a Ranch dressing instead, but I think the Catalina added a really nice flavor to it and made it unique to other standard taco-like dishes.  I also added a small can of sliced black olives.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy meal to make and very good. Its nothing fancy but something kids and adults will enjoy. I liked using the dressing it asked for. I never had it before but it went nicely with the other flavors. I also used half the amount of dressing and used turkey instead of beef.

My family loved this just the way it is posted.  I have two people that can't eat onions so I just put them on the side for those who like it to put on the salad.  I also put some sour cream on the side as a topping.  Thanks for sharing

There really isn't much that can be done to improve this! I was worried about the dressing being too sweet, but it was not a problem. Next time I will sautee the onions with the beef. I made alot for a picnic yesterday, but half of it was gone before the picnic! To compensate, I broke up a bag of tortilla chips and mixed them in as well making it something like a taco salad. Rave reviews all around and no leftovers!

This was an excellent twist on tacos or on a pasta salad, whichever way you look at it.  I used ground chicken, fat-free Catalina dressing, added olives after reading the other reviews, used a whole small yellow pepper which was nearly 1 cup instead of the 1/2 cup green pepper and used slightly less cheese and only 2 cups of shredded lettuce (that's all that came in 1 bag).  It was EXCELLENT and unique.  I made for my parents and they loved it.  I think I enjoy this more than regular tacos.  Will definitely make again.  Yum!

Hubby and kids loved this.  I put in black olives instead of the green peppers and salsa instead of the salad dressing.   Chips I used were lime flavoured tortilla chips.   It's a keeper.

A nice hearty meal. Used a box of spiral 'n cheese macaroni for this recipe. Cooked the pasta separately and then added the pasta and powdered cheese to the meat mixture along with a spoonful of crushed garlic and a can of kidney beans. I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I omitted the Catalina dressing and lettuce, just had a salad on the side.

wonderful and super easy.  I altered by adding a can of drained and rinsed light kidney beans, sliced black olives, and used western dressing. I also left out the lettuce and added crushed up doritos. We took this to a scout picnic and it was the first dish emptied.

I have been making this recipe for years - but I've always used French dressing IPO Catalina...I like the Catalina better!! (adds sweet to the spice!) Great recipe and has always been a huge success...provided it gets served b4 everything gets soggy!

I made this for dinner for my husband and 14 year old son - the only chnage I made was to use Spicy Ranch Dressing instead of the Catalina dressing.  They both loved it and had two huge helpings.  I will definitely make it again!

This Recipe was great! I thought I read in the recipe to use taco mix in the meat which I did.  It was too late after I realize that it didn't say anything like that.  I thought I was going to regret mixing mild seasoning in my meat. Guess what?  IT WAS AWESOME!!!!  My husband, 7 and my 3 year old loved this pasta.  The next day my husband called me from work and said, that he really enjoyed his taco salad. I gave it a 3 stars because I didn't follow the directions because I use the taco mild mix by accident. Therefore,  I do rate it 5 using the mild taco mix. YUMMY!  Thanks.

This was absolutely delicious! I used green onions (scallions) instead of regular, and I also used a combination of green, red, and yellow bell pepper for color. I served this with sour cream and salsa on the side. Everyone raved about it! Thanks for the recipe!

This was AWESOME! I made a few changes but it was gone in a flash. AND, it was better the longer it sat around! The changes I made are as follows: I used the Tex-Mex cheese, green onions instead of regular onion, omitted the green pepper, and I used Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch dressing instead of the Catalina. This was great! Thanks! I'll be keeping this one!

We made this salad in our grade 10 foods class. We took out the cherry tomatoes. We used more pasta than the recipe called for and used a little less dressing. We also cooked the onions with the meat, which brought out the flavour. If we made it again, we'd deffinitely add salsa. The tortilla chips were awesome in it. Good recipe :)

Our grade 10 foods class just recently made the Taco Pasta Salad. It as an excellent recipe that was easy to make. It would be interesting to use a different type of pasta and also to use salsa instead of catalina. This was fun to make and although in the end it didn't look appetizing, it tasted great. Some suggestions are to boil the pasta at the very start, use red peppers and try adding sour cream.

At the beginning of this week, our foods teacher had given us a task to find a recipe that incorporated not only beef but pasta and root vegetables as well. So with the time given in the computer lab,  some students from a previous class discovered this recipe in particular while browsing upon this site. Seeing as we only had a certain amount of time to complete the recipe, we needed to find ways to make it less time consuming. Therefore, the first thing we did was boil the water as we were cooking the meat on an other element. Altogether, the recipe was quite a success throughout our entire class. The only thing we would suggest would be to eliminate the use of catalina salad dressing and use salsa instead. Also, to add a bit of flavour we cooked the onions with the beef.

This recipe was very good. It tasted delicious even with the slight changes we made. Instead of using the salad dressing we used salsa, which made it taste more like a taco dish but probably would have tasted fine if we added both. We only added onions, green pepers, cheese and lettus to the pasta and meat and it tasted fine like that. This recipe is easy and doesn't take too long to make so we'd definately want to make it again and recommend this for people to try.

Taco Pasta Salad 

 	As a group we have come to the conclusion that we really enjoyed the Pasta Taco Salad. 
We thought that the Salad was a very convenient meal. It is a meal that can be made for lunch or dinner and doesnât make you feel stuffed after. We also enjoyed it because we added hot peppers, and salsa. It is a type of meal that you can make your own, you can put almost anything in it and it is very tasty. It also has all four food groups in it, which makes it quite healthy. We would definitely eat this again and make it for others.

In all , this recipe turned out very good. It was a simple recipe with easy step by step instructions. Adding other vegtables such as carrots or beans would have added a much added kick of flavor to the salad, even though it tasted delicious. I would have put to start boiling right away to make itmore time managable. All and all it is a great recipe and I suggest you get out and try it !

We had this on a cold January night with cottage cheese, and it was a nice change from typical heavy winter meals. And it was enjoyed by all. With the pasta in it I now know why other taco salads seemed to be lacking something. This was perfect. (I ommitted the green pepper.)

We left out the onion and green peppers because we don't care for them in our house.  We tried the salad with the catalina dressing but did not care for the blended flavors of it with the taco seasoned meat. We made it again using just regular taco sauce and everyone loved it.

This was DELICIOUS!  I've been known to mess up a dish or ten, and this one was great.  My dad and I ate it up- for breakfast, lunch, dinner... it's that good!

I used other comments advice and used ranch and salsa mixed, and crunched up some Doritos before I ate it.  I didn't add the salsa, doritos, and ranch until it was time to eat that way each person can put however much they want and the lettuce and such doesn't get really soggy.

PLUS, even without salsa, ranch, and doritos it's still really good!  My new favorite.  MMMM!

So yummy: warm yet cool, savory yet fresh, tender yet crunchy, and as spicy as you'd like! I added green onions and 1 can black beans with jalapenos, rinsed and dried. Also, I substituted Ranch dressing instead of catalina and crushed habanero Doritos instead of tortilla chips. Love it!!

It was good. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything to write home about. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't outstanding, original or different & I wouldn't make it again.

This was a huge hit in our home. I did serve the noodles and meat hot but the catalina dressing really set off the flavors. will make this one again for sure!

I thought it was ust okay. Hubby thought it was pretty good.  I thought there was too much taco seasoning.  Didn't use Catalina thought- we don't care for it.  I used a sun-dried tomato vinagrette- not great, but decent.

I've served this the past two years for a family reunion, and it doesn't matter how much I make--it always disappears!  I make the recipe as written, but I add the crushed tortilla chips right before serving.
