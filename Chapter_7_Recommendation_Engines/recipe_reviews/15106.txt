i own a resturant in southern louisiana, and my customers go crazy over this soup everytime i make it. it is outstanding.  the only thing i do not use cornstarch b/c i don't like it.  instead i add one can of cream of shrimp and one can of cream of chicken.  but if you follow the reciepe exactly how it is it comes out perfect too. thanks this is really a five star reciepe

This was with out a doubt one of the best and easiest soups I've made to date. Great taste!  Can add rice and spiced sausage to the soup and get a more New Orleans flavor.  Difinitely try this one!

This was incredible.  As usual, I doctored it up with lots of Old bay, Emeril's Essence, and a lot more hot sauce (also used extra onion, and lots more garlic).  My husband and I absolutely crave it this soup.

This is close to the best soup I have ever had.  I spiced it up a little by using cheyenne pepper instead of pepper sauce.
I also used smoked sharp cheddar cheese and the smoked cheese flavor really added to this dish.
DELICIOUS!!

My husband's family is from New Orleans so we love any kind of cajun food, and crawfish are a mainstay in our house...this was a unique and delightful soup!

I added rice to make it more filling, and I used one pound crawfish and one pound shrimp. It was WONDERFUL.

I searched for a recipe today on allrecipes.com to use some broccoli that needed using.  I expected to saute, steam.....found this recipe, only needed a couple of things that were not on hand, shrimp (crawfish cost too much) and a couple of cans of soup.  Made the recipe to suit no one but me.  Made exactly by the recipe thinking, comfort, but not great.  My neighbor called and asked us to come down to eat.  I took this dish just to take, even thought I thought it was simple, but good.  The kids at their party devoured this soup even with the broccolil and shrimp.  The adults raved.  As long as I have tried to come up with the perfect dish for our gatherings. sometime good is really good, and great is hit and miss.  Make this one for friends.

I usually don't change recipes the first time around, but when I saw the directions for using all these pots, I decided to make prep simpler. I sauteed the onions and garlic down, added broccoli and stock to the onion mixture and cooked down for about 10 minutes. Used golden mushroom and cream of broccoli (EXCELLENT flavor!) soups, and 3/4 teaspoon of Tony Chachere's in place of the Creole seasoning and hotsauce. Skipped the cornstarch. Also, as much as I love me some cheese, I just sprinkled it on the top as a garnish. So I got the taste without the calories. It was YUMMM!! Thanks for another winner!

My friends always call to see what soup I made this week, so I just made it again. Used Emeril's Creole Seasoning and extra pepper sauce, not hot sauce.  Excellent. Do not overcook the broccoli or crawfish (like I did the 1st time), the broccoli will be pureed and the crawfish will be mushy. A keeper.

I used Shrimp, Scallops, and a White Fish as my seafood and since I scaled it down I used a cream of Broccoli soup. This was so good. Definatly will be making it again.

Oh my goodness!  This is one of the best recipes I've ever tried on this site.  My boyfriend and his parents absolutely destroyed this soup! I used both shrimp and crawfish in mine.  This recipe makes a huge amount of soup as it took us two days to eat it all.  I have a feeling, this will be made regularly at my house.  I can't wait to make it on a cold winter day!

I cut it in half since I was just making it for my wife and me.  Since I did not want a couple half cans of condensed soup left over, I went with the cream of celery soup and used the whole can.  I also went with shrimp as so many other reviewers.  I took the shells from the fresh shrimp and simmered them in the chicken stock for 5 minutes to add more shrimp flavor to the soup.   I then filtered out the shells from the stock and discarded them.   I did not have creole seasoning so I substituted some Cajun seasoning and Old Bay seasoning.  Great soup, Thanks for the recipe.

Great 'starter' recipe.  I added chicken sausage instead of crawfish, plus cilantro & dry-roasted tomatoes.  Additional Louisiana seasoning for a little kick.  Delicious!

This is one favor packed soup. I just made it today and it is sooooooo good. I left off the cornstarch too and it tasted just awesome. My kids even love it which says a lot. I added a can of crab meat into mine along with the crawfish. Makes a big bunch. I plan to freeze some of it for the cold days headed our way. You will love it! If I can make it taste good anyone can, give it a try.

absolutly delicious. when we boil crawfish we add mushrooms to the mix and they really soak up the great flavors. so i had a bag of frozen crawfish tails and these mushrooms that i used for the soup. besides the addition of the mushrooms i made this exactly as stated and i would not change a thing.

Excellent recipe and super-simple.  I made a few changes according to my personal taste.  1. caramelized onions for 40 minutes, also used about 3 times as much onion and garlic as called for  2. mixed the shrimp into onion/garlic/butter/hot sauce before putting into the soup but did not cook them as I was worried the shrimp would become over-cooked  3. subbed creamed corn and chedder cheese soup for cream of chicken and celery  4. added about 3 tablespoons of lobster base to soup once it got hot  5. used old bay as well as increased amounts of hot sauce and cajun seasoning

This was a very excellent recipe.  I substituted shrimp for the crawfish and my 4 yr old son could not get enough.  He had me picking out the shrimp bc it was so good.  I will def make this again in the winter time.

This was AWESOME !!I made a few changes. I used 2 heads broccoli chopped, 4 pressed garlic cloves, 3/4 of a block of 2 percent velveta, 2 1/2 cups of 2 percent milk, 3 table spoolns corn starch, 7 cups of chicken broth & added cheddar cheese on top & served in a bread bowl. ( large fresh deli rolls with the top cut out)I cooked it in low till the broccoli was very tender.. My family asked when I was making this again? Defiantly a keeper:)

Made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! I used shrimp instead of crawfish because the local store didn't have crawfish.

Made this for dinner last night and it was wonderful!! I did substitute cream of shrimp for the cream of celery and I really recommend trying this. It gives the soup a rich seafood taste that just adds depth to an already delicious soup. I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a super recipe!!

I would say this recipe is just Ok. Despite liberal use of Balls Cajun Seasoning (my sister sends it to me from Louisiana)it was rather bland. I'm thinking it maybe would have benefited from some sauteed celery or green or red pepper? At any rate, we did eat it, and it was by no means horrid, but for the amount of calories involved, I won't be making again, just not good enough.

Absolutely loved this one, and so did my family, including my two boys, ages 5 and 6!  Used Old Bay spice and went lightly with the pepper sauce.  One little issue, though.  The description at top of recipe when you print it says that you use cream of mushroom and celery soups.  I didn't pay enough attention to the actual ingredient list and used cream of mushroom soup.  Wasn't too fond of the mushrooms in this, but it still worked.  We also used fresh crab, instead of crawfish or shrimp, from a recent crabbing trip in Oregon.  Fabulous dish!  By the way, I'm not at all experienced with Cajun food, but this had just the right amount of kick for me!

Outstanding!!!! Followed the recipe very closely except I made everything in one pot sautéing the onions, garlic, and seafood first and then returning them after adding the soup mixture. Didn’t have a whole pound of crawfish so I added some scallops as well. I think any seafood will work great but the crawfish have a texture and flavor that compliments this well. We ate the entire pot in one day! Getting ready to make a second batch. I will be adding more broccoli and onion to this one, while using shrimp and tilapia as I am out of mudbugs.

Have made this several times to rave reviews always. Use 1 1/2 pounds of salad shrimp, sometimes add more a little more of this or that, meaning it's great even not following the directions exactly.
If I have picky eaters will put the broccoli, shrimp, crawfish, added cheese, croutons, etc. as side dishes they can add as they like. Makes a pretty presentation!  
I make it so it simmers for at least 3 hours before dining.

Whoop I made this tonight and the kids absolutely Loved it !!  After reading reviews I opted to use cream of shrimp in place of cream of celery. I also added a dash of "Slap yo Mama" Cajun seasoning. This dish was served with crusty jalapeño cheese French bread. Will definitely make it again. Gonna try shrimp instead of crawfish next, the possibilities are endless.

I made this exactly to the recipe except I used sharp cheddar cheese and my family loved it.  Husband says to add more broccoli next time.  He even said it tasted like something you would order at a restaurant.  I can't cook a lick so I'm pretty proud it turned out.  You must try it.

Woohoo...Very delicious.   Husband and I loved it.  If not already you might give it some thought to making it Crawfish Broccoli Cheese soup to put it in the seafood category.  I used 1/2 lb.  shrimp and 1/2 lb. fish since that's all I had on hand at the time.  I used 1/2 tsp. Creole seasoning as I found it very spicy although loved.  My grown son loved it so much he went home and made it immediately for his family and they loved it,  also.  I am always so happy to find this type of a dish.  I won't let the rest of my family have a moment's peace until they try it, too!

This is a great recipe.  I have made it many times just as written and it looks and tastes like restaruant quality.  Some modifications I have made depending on what I have on hand include the addition of oyster mushrooms and chopped celery.  Since I don't want a half can of condensed soup sitting around in the fridge, some times I will just use a whole can of cream of celery soup and skip the other half can of chicken soup all together.  Thanks for the recipe.

Positively delicious! I added 1/2 of a red bell pepper and 1/2 c raw carrots to the onion sauté, then pureed the mixture for a 'very kid friendly version'. I used 1# polish sausage as one suggested, instead of the crawfish. Everyone loved it!

Wow! The reaction I got was 'Wow'! I wasn't too sure about crawfish with broccoli soup but it was SOOOO good! I did everything but instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of potato ( that's my taste ) and I thought I had cream of chicken in my pantry but didn't so I just used the potato soup with the milk and like I said, it was outstanding!
And my thought was that this makes a great Christmas soup, it's red and green! He he. Happy eating folks!

Had lots of fresh broccoli from mom and dad's garden to use.  I did make this as written (crawfish included).  I did use beef broth instead of chicken and cajun spice instead of creole.  Really yummy, filling meal.

Very good recipe. The only changes that I made was after the broccoli and chicken broth was done I put a little at a time in the blender for a more creamier broccoli. I also used half and half instead of milk.

Pretty darn good...my only qualm is that the cheese appears more for coloring than any kind of flavor...but I'm from Wisconsin so I always want more cheese.

My entire family loved this recipe including my picky mother-in-law and even my 12 year old son who did not like crawfish but ate 3 bowls.  I didn't make any changes.  ***Used 2 Tablespoons of Webers New Orleans Seasoning. Webers is more a jar of Creole Seasoning without the salt that Tony's has.

Even more great the next day. I used "Not-Chicken" bouillon cubes to make the broth and substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken. Served in bread bowls. Really, really, really worth making (and all 12 servings, for leftovers)!

Absolutely delicious! I would only make one suggestion, and it has to do with reviews rather than recipe: many folks are making with cooked shrimp instead (I added some for a combo - WOW).
The cooked shrimp got a bit overdone in the soup, so I suggest making sure it is close to room temperature, then just add it with the cheese to quickly heat through.
