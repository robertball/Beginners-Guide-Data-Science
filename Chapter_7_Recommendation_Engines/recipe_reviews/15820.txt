I reduced the amount of cereal to 8 cups, and added 1/4 cup butter and 1 tsp of vanilla to it.  I cooled it slightly in the fridge before tossing with the powdered sugar so it doesn't absorb it so much...coats better with less.  This is soooo adictive.  I can't make it unless I know there are people here to help me eat it or it's gone before I know it!

****Here's a tip, line your measuring cup with saran wrap before mesauring the peanut butter.  It will slide right out with no messy clean up! I do this for all sticky ingredients (shortening, honey, pb, corn syrup)  Works great!***

I had made puppy chow before but with a different recipe.  This recipe definitely needed more chocolate.  I would recommend a 12 oz bag vs. 1 cup of chips.  Using only 1 cup did not coat the cereal nearly enough to make the "puppy chow" consistency [the chex squares did not stick together]!

I love this recipe. The only thing that I would add is that you can microwave the chocolate peanut butter mixture instead of heating on the stove. It makes it much easier. Just microwave for a minute, stir, then microwave for 30 seconds. It works great. Remember to use a microwave safe bowl. Love the recipe. Great snack for kids sleepovers and snacks at lunch.

Cute story to tell...  I had a gathering and offered some Puppy Chow to 4 yr-old Anthony.  He asked what was in it.  I told him it was Chex cereal that had melted chocolate and peanut butter poured on it.  Then it was tossed in powdered sugar.  He says "Oh no... I couldn't possibly eat that."  Thinking he was allergic to something I kind of freaked and asked why not.  He put his little hand to his chest, took a step backwards and said "Because it sounds too delicious."  FOUR YEARS OLD!  Needless to say, I had to give the kid a hug.  Anthony proceeded to gobble it up and even took a doggy bag (which he thought was hilarious) home for his brother.

I made this with one full 16 oz. box of Rice Chex, a full bag of chocolate chips, and one cup of p/b.  Because of this large quantity, I had to move the sauce from the saucepan to a very large bowl to stir everything.  What an easy way to make delicious snacks for a large group!  And it's SOOO good!

Really great! A few suggestions. I added half a stick of butter so that the chocolate mixture would be more fluid (thus, easier to spread). 9 cups was WAY too much cereal to coat each piece of cereal completely, so I'd go with 7 or 8. Really great otherwise =)

Coming across this recipe brought a smile to my face and evoked years and years of delightful memories with my children--classroom treats, sleepovers, birthday parties...even finding pieces of Puppy Chow underneath their beds! This is a treat, I'm sure, that has pleased millions of kids and adults alike. The original recipe adds 1/4 cup of butter melted with the chocolate chips and peanut butter, in the microwave, for about a minute and a half, stirring after one minute. Then stir in 1 tsp. of vanilla. Once laid out on waxed paper, the challenge is to wait until the Puppy Chow (or Muddie Buddies) is cool before you start nibbling!

LOVE this recipe! I have found that using a paper grocery bag works better for coating the chow with the powdered sugar though. Just a little note.

I had always made this recipe with a stick of butter.  I was surprised how tasty it came out with less fat!  I did add extra peanut butter to make one cup(to have an even chocolate peanut butter taste.) and just stuck it all in the microwave to melt for a couple minutes.

It just isn't Christmas around here without this stuff. Last year things were a little hectic and I forgot to make the Puppy Chow and sure enough, by the end of the night, TWELVE people asked about it. It's SO easy--a little messy, though. The large bag works well, but so does a large bowl with a lid. Just pour everything into the bowl, pop on the lid, and shake your little heart out!


Oh and peanut fans will LOVE this recipe with crunchy peanut butter! It really makes a difference!

CHANGE TIPS:  To make the "goo" easier to toss, and for a bit of extra flavor, add 1/4 cup butter.  Use a very large pot, (large enough to hold all the cereal in and toss), and melt the butter over low heat.  Stir in the chips and peanut butter until melted.  (I've made this with combinations of semi-sweet, milk chocolate, and butterscotch chips.  Doesn't matter what proportions of which, as it's all delicious!)  Stir the cereal into the melted mixture in the pot.  Let cool in pot until pot is room temperature.  Put pot in fridge for 5-10 minutes to firm the coating.  Then put mixture into a 2-gallon ziploc bag that contains the sugar and shake until evenly coated.  Store in refrigerator.  Delicious!  It goes fast, but do not double this recipe as it will be too difficult to stir it all together without spilling and making a mess.  Just make two consecutive batches.

This is a SNAP TO MAKE! Tweaked it up a bit just for funzies!! 2 cu milk chocolate chips....1/2 cu peanut butter.... and a sprinkle of cinnamon melted in the microwave on 30 second blasts. Stir after every 30 seconds (this went fast). The cinnamon really added a nice flavor too (sort of like Mexican chocolate!)............. I had measured 12 cups of the cereal into a lg. Tupperware bowl. Poured the chocolate over it and gently stirred/folded it with a spatula (being careful to NOT break up the cereal pieces). After the chocolate was well folded in I added the powdered sugar right in the same bowl.  I snapped the lid on the bowl...and gently shook and rolled it around in the bowl from side to side.  Worked PERFECT and sooo easy! I was so pleased as it was still crunchy the next morning!   

Took it to work.  Served it mounded up in aluminum cupcake wrappers (normally they are paper, but I found aluminum on sale last year) I served it up on a tray and it was easy for my coworkers to nab a cup and take it back to their desk.  THEY LOVED IT!

This is a fun snack. After mixing some of the cereal into the chocolate mixture, I poured it onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper to distribute the chocolate more evenly. After it was all coated I let it cool for a few minutes, then put it into a big bowl and sprinkled it with the powdered sugar. I did not use nearly as much powdered sugar as the recipe called for; it was plenty sweet with just a little to keep the cereal from sticking together too much. I also did not use the full amount of cereal as there was not enough chocolate to coat it all. Hint: do not add the powdered sugar until the chocolate has(mostly)cooled; otherwise you will get that wet texture others have mentioned and the chocolate will just absorb the sugar.

I like this recipe, and its pretty easy to make. I just wish the instructions would have mentioned that 9 cups of this cereal is really about one 12.8 oz box. That would have saved me some confusion,and some money since I bought 2 boxes. I made this exactly as directed, using chunky peanut butter as mentioned in a comment. I also added some mini M&Ms to add some color because it looked a little boring.

Love this stuff! :) I use Crispix cereal & add 1/4 c. butter to the choc/peanut butter...microwave...stir...then add 1 tsp. vanilla. I use a large, Tupperware cake-carrier to shake everything up in - only need 1 1/4 c. powdered sugar.

As did everyone else, I changed the original recipe. I used 8 cups Chex Rice cereal, 1 cup peanut butter, 1/4 c butter, 1 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 1 tsp vanilla. I melted the chips in the microwave for 1 minute. I stirred it and then I added the butter, vanilla, and peanut butter. I then microwaved it for another minute. While everything was in the microwave, I measured out my Chex cereal on a sheet of wax paper that I put on a cookie sheet (one with sides is best). I spread out the cereal and then I poured the melted microwave mixture over the cereal. After folding in the chocolate, I noticed that I had some excess chocolate, so I added a little more cereal. After everything was covered.I poured the chocolate covered cereal into a brown paper bag that had about 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar in the bottom. This is when the wax paper comes in handy! I just lifted the cereal and put it right into the bag. After shaking the bag, I opened it up to ensure that everything was coated with powdered sugar. After that, I put a new sheet of wax paper on the cookie sheet and poured the puppy chow on the sheet to cool.

I doubled butter to make it easier to mix and added a 1/2 tsp almond extract. Trick for mixing chex: Just pour into a big bowl, spread your spoon around the top layer then pour into another big bowl and repeat back and forth. This limits broken chex.

This recipe is a 5 star one adding the MISSING ingredients! The original recipe on the back of the Rice Chex box is the same, except for the addition of 1/4 cup butter and a teaspoon of vanilla (add after melting the butter/pb/chips in the microwave).

This is easy and delicious!  My 8 year old daughter showed her class at school how to make it, and the kids in her class and her teacher loved it.  My kids can make it on their own - they melt the chocolate in the microwave in two 1-minute intervals (stirring in between minutes).  It gets an A+ from all of us!

I've always been a big fan of puppy chow!  I added some butter (1/4 Cup).  The cereal/chocolate goo mix ratio is perfect.  With the Chex Muddie Buddie recipe, they call for more cereal than the chocolate goo can handle.  I didn't have any gallon size ziplocs so I just covered the bowl I mixed it in with Saran Wrap and that worked great! It didn't even leak any sugar! HOORAH! Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this after my son made it in preschool and brought some home.  I used Crispix cereal, Jif natural peanut butter, added 1/4 c butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla after butter, pb, and choc chips melted.  I melted everything in a large pot on the stove then dumped the cereal right into it and stirred it up (less dishes).  Dumped the powdered sugar on top, put the lid on the pot, then shook it up to coat.  Super easy and absolutely delicious!  I'm taking some to a party and saving some for us :).

this was SO simple and SO tasty! I loved munching on it a handful at a time, my 20 month old son also loved munching on them. My only problem with it, I got indigestion every time I would eat it. Turns out, I was getting indigestion from anything with peanut butter in it- because I later found out I am pregnant! :D

Okay, the dish itself deserves 5 stars, but this recipe caused alot of frustration to me! First, the chocolate mixture wouldn't become thin so i added some butter to help. Also, adding cereal to the skillet is a TERRIBLE idea. this turned into a clumpy mess and I actually had an emotional breakdown at my stove. I'm new to cooking and didn't realize how difficult adding cereal to the pan would've turned out. NEXT TIME, I'll put cereal on a baking pan lined with wax paper and pour mixure.. or maybe even a giant bowl would work better. ANYTHING is better than adding a ton a cereal to chocolate mixture & it turning into one clump. **If this happened to you, put the clump in the microwave for 30 seconds and stir. Repeat if necessary.

very good, I use milk chocolate chips and a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter and also the chocolate chips. I think it coats better using more, I also add 1tsp of vanilla to the chocolate and peanut butter. Oh and the most important thing of all is, use a microwave safe bowl, heat chocolate chips in microwave for 2 minutes, stir and add peanut butter, this is way faster and less clean-up.

Mmmm delicious!!! So addicting, I can't stop eating them! My Mom used to make this all the time. The one thing I'd say is that 1 cup of chips is defffinatly not enough for 9 cups of cereal. I used two cups of chips. I probably should have increased the peanut butter as well, as it didn't have a very strong taste of PB. WILL be making this again.

My 6th grade son made this and it turned out great!  Recipe was quick and easy, the finished product looked good and stored well, and best of all it tasted delicious!  (Only bad thing, was I couldn't quit eating it.)

So easy, and I haven't met a kid who doesn't love this snack.  For kids who have a peanut allergy, I have also used butterscotch chips in place of the peanut butter.

I make this recipe with white chocolate chips and it has a flavor more reminiscent of tiger butter - it is delicious! I also used the crunchy corn bran cereal, and it doesn't detract from the flavor.

**Some hints**
If you choose to microwave the chocolate, heat it at 50% power for 30 seconds and stir until the bowl has cooled down, then put back in for 15 second intervals, stirring until the bowl cools inbetween.  If you don't do this, your chocolate will get lumpy and crumbly and taste burnt.  Also, if there is any water in your bowl, the chocolate will get lumpy, so make sure the bowl is thoroughly dry.

after mixing in the cereal, cool in the fridge for at least 5 minutes, or it will soak up too much powdered sugar and be sickeningly sweet.

This is so yummy and so easy!  The kids love making it just as much as eating it!  Just use caution with the hot chocolate and peanut butter when making this with the kids!  I added a little more powdered sugar.  I think I am going to follow someone's recommendation of using milk chocolate next time.  That sounds great too!

This was yummy! It is very important that you first melt chocolate on low and then add peanut butter. The second batch I made, I burned the chocolate. They still got eaten up just as fast but didn't taste as good!

Hey, thanks for the recipe!  This is such a fun treat so I decided to make some for our familiy's camping trip.  My son has a peanut allergy, so I was going to sub Sunbutter for the PB.  Well I found myself at our small town's tiny grocery store staring at the nonexistant options for PB alternatives.  My only choice was a jar of $13 almond butter or $4 Nutella.  I grabbed the Nutella.  It made a great Puppy Chow!  Very chocolately but still a hint of nutty flavor.  I have a large family so used the whole 13 oz jar of nutella, almost a whole package of chocolate chips (I just reserved a handful or two of chocolate chips to throw into energy bars I'm making) and a whole box of rice chex (~13 oz).  I did end up using more powdered sugar too since I wanted each piece thoroughly coated to keep little fingers from getting sticky as much as possible.   Just wanted to add the nutella option in case anyone needs a PB alternative or would like it more chocolately!  Yum!

I was out of chocolate and really wanted to make this for my son's 6 hour road trip, so I substituted butterscotch chips and it just may become a favorite of ours!  I also took suggestions from others of adding 1/4 c butter and 2 t. vanilla.  LOVED the idea of plastic wrap covering my measuring cup before the peanut butter, which made me think to use cooking spray on first my spoon before measuring the peanut butter and then on my hands to mix the cooked mixture into the cereal easier than a spoon!  I also loved the idea of shaking it in paperbag vs plastic!

Healthier version. Use fiber one or fiber now cereal and shredded wheat. Use additional morsels and add  a few tablespoons of cocoa. This will provide fiber to your yummy naughty dessert.

Can substitute Sunbutter for the peanut butter and the taste is great!
I also used 3 T. butter and a little vanilla...just to to see how it turned out.  I loved it!
As other reviewers said...decrease your cereal amount a little and you'll be set.

Used some of the suggestions from the others and added some more chocolate chips and a tad more peanut butter too!!! Then, I also cooled the chow in the refrigerator for about 5-7 minutes before coating with powdered sugar.  Very good, quick, easy delicious dessert. Thank You!!!

I make this every Christmas it's a huge hit and everyone loves it. I do make it a little easier.  Put the chocolate and peanut butter in a microwave safe bowl, microwave for 1 minute and then every 1o seconds until melted. Then pour cereal bowl and stir until well coated. Pour cereal mixture into a large Renynolds bag with powdered sugar and turn until once again well coated. Pour Puppy Chow out onto a sided baking sheet and let cool for 10 minutes before putting storing.  I put mine in mason jars or little cute cello bags to give as gifts.

This is really yummy!  I like this particular recipe because it does not call for butter/margarine.  I started out making a 1/2 recipe, because I only had a scant 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in the pantry.  I ended up adding more cereal (probably about 5.5 or 6 cups total)  and still had good coverage.  I also only used about 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and that was enough to keep it from being sticky and to add a little sugary flavor. So, I was able to use 1/2 the peanut butter/chocolate mixture and less than 1/2 the powdered sugar while using MORE than 1/2 the cereal, and still got a good result. As treats go, I feel like this is a relatively good choice as it has the nutrients of the cereal and protein of the peanut butter (I used all natural pb).  Next time maybe I'll try it with the whole wheat Chex and make it even better "health"-wise.

YOU MUST LIKE NUTS OR PEANUT BUTTER or you will not like this.  Peanut taste is strong.  Although this recipe was very easy to make ...no one ate this...it really does look like puppy chow so I had to beg people to try it and the response was it's ok.  A couple people did ask for milk to eat it as cereal!

Lots of people love it, and I prefer to use milk chocolate chips rather than semi sweet. . . Also, if you don't like it to be too sweet, then use the crispix cereal, since its cereal squares are larger and lessen the sweetness of one square...

I love puppy chow as do my grand children so I needed to make a larger batch, which I did. I took a 14 oz box of chex cereal, I melted 1 cup of peanut butter and 2 cups of chocolate chips in microwave at 30 sec intervals stirring each time poured on to chex mixed it all together and used about 11/2 cups of confectioner sugar. Turned out great was gone in the same day. Thank you for the recipe :)

I have made a version like this for years but I use Golden Grahams instead and add raisins and peanuts.  My son cannot have gluten so I make a version using the Honey Chex cereal and he loves it.

I've tried many variations of this recipe, and this one is near the bottom of my list. Recipes with butter taste better.

I found out if you use Crispx cereal instead of chex cereal, the peanut butter/chocolate mix gets into the cereal cavity better and taster great.

YUMMMMMMY x10! I used 8 cups of cereal, 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of butter and reduced fat peanut butter. I let it the mixture cool in the fridge a little before mixing it with the sugar.. I brought it to a party and it was a HUGE hit!

This is so addictive!  To make this even easier, I melt the peanut butter and chocolate with 1/4 c. butter (I know the recipe doesn't call for it, but I find that the mixture coats better with the butter) in the microwave for a minute, stir, and microwave an additional 20-30 seconds or until smooth.  Also, I've found that using 8 cups cereal ensures that all of the pieces are coated in peanut-butter chocolately goodness.

I lost my recipe and couldn't remember exactly what was in it so was looking for a place to start. This recipe is close but it really needs a stick of butter and about a tsp of vanilla to give it that little extra something. I also used the whole 12oz bag of chips I don't think it would have came close to covering them if I hadn't but thank you for pointing me in the right direction! I would have been in SO much trouble if the holidays passed and I didn't make it LOL!

Yummy!  I use a large brown grocery bag to help coat it with powder sugar.  Just dump in the chocolate coated cereal, pour the powder sugar on top, roll the top down and shake.

This was my first go-round with this recipe and it's really good.  I need to clean the entire kitchen because it is slightly messy to make(at least the first time!!)  Next time I will microwave the chocolate and peanut butter, add a little butter and vanilla and I will mix all together in a MUCH larger bowl.  I also like the suggestion of one use that you coat with powdered sugar in a large paper bag.  I mixed forever on a cookie sheet (about to go clean that area of the kitchen!!)
All I can in the end is that my 4 year old says it's AWESOME, that all the flavors he can taste in it are GOOD ones, and he just told his 2 year old brother that he HAS to come taste the AWESOME stuff that Mommy just made.  THAT makes the mess worth it!!!!!

I have a recipe similar to this but I think mine is 10 times better!!!  It is:  1 cup SEMI-sweet Choc Chips, 1/2 C peanut butter, 1/4 C butter, 2-1/2 C PWD Sugar, and 6 C Crispex or Corn/Rice Cereal.  Try this!  Trust me, you'll LOVE IT!

I don't usually use a recipe for making puppy chow but I was looking at this one's previous reviews and liked the idea of adding some butter to the chocolate...it really made the puppy chow rich and extra delicious. I served it at a party a couple weeks ago and it was gone fast. I really can't stay out of it myself! I will make again this week for dinner party and a meeting. Thanks for the tip.

Good recipe, but you need to add margarine or butter to help make the choc. the right texture.  I don't know how you would get it to cover the rice cereal without it.  Anyway, this was so good!  Very addictive!

This was great!  The recipe I use calls for 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 tsp. vanilla added when melting the chocolate.  Adding the margarine makes it easier to spread, and the vanilla adds a nice touch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great Recipe.  Based on another users complaint that it was too peanutty, I made the recipe through step 2, then divided the coated ceareal between two bags.  I added half of the powdered sugar to each bag, then added about a half a cup of cocoa powder into one.  Three of us loved it without the cocoa, and the other three (the non-peanut butter lovers) loved it with the cocoa.

I like this recipe because it doesn't have the butter that all the other ones seem to have.  I use Crispix, a whole bag of choc. chips, and melt it in the microwave.  The hardest part about the recipe is remembering not to inhale when throwing a handful of the puppy chow into your mouth.  I'm always coughing on the powdered sugar!

Good stuff.  Like other reviewers, we used more chocolate than called for, a little butter and did it all the simple way...in the microwave!  My daughter loved making this, esspecially shaking it all up.  It's too sweet for my tastes but my family enjoyed it.  My boyfriend plans to take some to work tomorrow.

This was ok---nothing like I expected considering all the rave reviews, but it is good.  I made this and the White Chocolate Gorp (submitted by Ruth Crickmer) for our friends that come over after church on Sundays to play card/board games, and we all prefered the White Chocolate one over this.  I used freezer bags and used more confectioners sugar to cover.  I most likely wont be making this again.

Fun activity with my 4yr old grandson. Used a paper bag instead of the plastic, grandson shook the sack to get all the chacolate-coated cereal coated with the powdered sugar. Picky little eater loved it!

I kept the amount of Rice Chex the same, but doubled the chocolate chips and the peanut butter, yielding 2cups and 1 cup respectively.  I did not measure the powdered sugar, used jut enough to coat over the chocolate mixture, adding as I went if needed.

I followed the advice of others adding 1/4c butter making the chocolate peanut butter mixture more fluid. However, once I added the mixture to the cereal, it was too wet so the powdered sugar was absorbed. It didnt change the taste of the recipe and I'd still make it again. For aesthetic purposes I'd use less butter next time.

My kids ask for this atleast once a month! I make mine with butter, and a little vanilla though. It is SO ADDDICTIVE! I only wish it weren't so unhealthy! It probably wouldn't taste so good if it were! LOl Oh, well. You only live once!

I have to disagree about using the microwave.  I tried it for 1 minute on high, stirred it, and microwaved it another 30 seconds.  My chocolate came out a weird, chalky consistency.  It was very difficult to coat the pieces.  I tried heating it again and it did not help.  Perhaps this is just my microwave or the type of chips I used?  Either way, I tried making it again using the original stove-top directions and it was FABULOUS.  We added a little cocoa powder to make it extra chocolatey and it was great!

The amount of the ingredients for each item should be adjusted:
1 small box of Crispix cereal
Small jar of creamy peanut butter
1 12 oz or 16 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 stick of butter
1 box of confectioner's sugar
Melt butter, choc. chips, & peanut butter together on low just until melted; turn off heat & add cereal. Pour powdered sugar in large paper bag & add melted cereal mixture & shake till coated. Easiest recipe in the world & everyone loves it!

This is a great and also quick recipe! The suggestion about placing the chocolate covered cereal in the refrigerator (10 minutes) before putting the powdered sugar in was a wonderfu ideal...it covered so much better without the clumps.  Thanks for this suggestions!

I made it as written, except I also added 1/4 cup real unsalted butter.

Perfect.  Be sure not to skimp on the powdered sugar, otherwise you end up with all your Chex stuck together.  I used the wheat version and they taste just as great, and are a smidge better for you.  =)

Delightful little snack here. My son loves Puppy Chow and I actually hate to make it because of how gloopy my old chocolate sauce always turned out--the addition of the butter smoothed out the sauce and made it a breeze to cover the Chex cereal squares. Now, if I could just figure out how to keep from getting powdered sugar "dust" everywhere I wouldn't mind making this more frequently!

I accidentally bought Cinnamon Toast Crunch instead of Chex (don't ask me how that happened) -- but the recipe still turned out GREAT!!!  The cinnamon from the cereal actually added a great extra flavor.  The other changes I made were:  increase to 2 cups of chocolate chips, down to 8 cups of cereal, and just 1 cup of powered sugar.

Tried this recipe today and everyone enjoys it! :) Next time I'll put in less peanut butter though. The amount of peanut butter seemed to overwhelm the yummy chocolaty taste. But, that's probably something that's different for everyone's tastes.

I hadn't had puppy chow in years, and had never made it myself, so I was so excited when I found this recipe. They're sooo good & totally addictive! I read other reviews and added 1/4 c. butter and 1 tsp. vanilla. I also used a whole bag of Guittard's milk chocolate chips, which are huge and so amazing. The batch was gone in a day and a half! Definitly one of my new favorite treats!

DELICIOUS!  I increased the cereal (I used Crispix) to 12 cups because that was the amount in the box.  I also doubled the chocolate/peanutbutter mixture, but left the powdered sugar amount the same.  I didn't think that the butter that other reviewers added was necessary.

Absolutely delicious. For parties or giving away, I'll make it exactly as the recipe states (+1/4 cup chocolate chips).   For myself, I make mine candy-like! I'll add an EXTRA 1 cup chocolate and 1/4 cup peanut butter. It results in large pieces that you can break apart, kind of like almond bark. If you're a chocolate-peanut butter lover like me, try it. It won't look quite as nice, but it'll taste a hundred times better!

I made this in half batches to reduce mess and keep pieces more evenly coted with the sugar.  I added 2 T butter as well to make the chocolate mixture a little smoother.

My kids liked it. I thought was dry. Have seen recipes with a little butter added to mixture. I think I will try that next time. To make things coat better. They still ate it and enjoyed it though.

My husband loves this stuff and asks me to make it atleast once a month. I usually make a huge batch due to how many live in our household (between 6 and 8). I changed the recipe to 60 servings (equal to 12.8 oz cereal) & used an entire 12 oz bag of chocolate, but kept the powered sugar & PB the same. I also used a small pot to heat the choco/PB mix but only added half of the cereal into the pot. I split the mix between 2 gallon baggies, split the plain cereal between the 2, closed the baggies, & shook them up to coat the cereal. I repeated this for the sugar, & except for the baggies looking like a mottled mess, it worked perfectly. A great idea for those who handwash their dishes.

made this for my bf who couldn't get enough of it at a party. I'm not really a chocolate fan, so I used about a cup, no more. 1 cup of peanut butter. 1 TSP of vanilla extract. And I think I used close to 2 cups of powdered sugar. I kept adding more and more, mostly to get the nice white color on the squares. Probably could have used even more. A grocery paper bag was used for the shaking which definitely helped.

My kids and I LOVE this recipe!! I make it a little different than this version though! I use 1 box crispix, 1 bag semi-sweet choco chips, 1 cup PB, 1 stick butter, 1 box powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla(I seem to forget this one sometimes though  but I can never taste a difference). I just melt the chips,PB, butter then add vanilla. Dump it over cereal and mix together. Dump in a paper grocery bag and dump powdered sugar over it and shake, shake, shake!Sometimes, I have to add a little extra powdered sugar so the cereal is nice an covered and white.I think that has to do with humidity on the day I make it or something. I made this last night and my daughter said " this is the most amazing puppy chow ever!!" lol  she likes mine best!

Has the potential to make quite a mess if little hands are helping (but that's just part of the fun!)This turned out wonderfully. I made a large batch because I knew how quickly it would go. My family loved it!

I remember the first time I tried puppy chow-I was addicted. For this recipe, I followed another review and used 1/4 cup of butter and less cereal. The tip for lining your measuring cups with plastic wrap worked great for the peanut butter- I wrapped a rubber band around mine so that it wouldn't move around. Thanks!

I added 1/4 cup butter to this recipe which is what I think you're supposed to do.  Made this last night with that modification... If you like a more "peanut buttery" taste I would advise adding an extra 1/4 cup peanut butter as well.  That being said... this is great comfort food.

Very addictive snack! I added 1/4 cup of butter to the chocolate chips and peanut butter before melting in the microwave. I also stirred in a teaspoon of vanilla extract once the chocolate/peanut butter/butter mixture was combined. I used a little less powdered sugar - about 1 1/4 cups - and there was still some left over in the plastic bag. I then spread the cereal out on waxed paper to cool and harden up before storing the fridge.

I made this yesterday and took most of it to work today.  My co-workers just went nuts over it, most of them had never even heard of it.  Very good and soooo easy!  I followed suggestions, used 8 C cereal, and added 1/2 stick of butter and 1 tsp vanilla and it came out fantastic!  After you add the choc/pnut butter mixture to the cereal, put it in the fridge for 5 min or so to let the choc harden, makes it easier to add the powdered sugar.

Yum. I used milk chocolate chips, and melted them with the PB in the microwave...so much easier. I also added about 1/8 C butter. Took to a company party and it was gobbled up.

The chocolate mixture was too thick and was hard to mix with the cereal without crushing it. I added 1/4 cup of butter and it needed more. I also used 2cups of powdered sugar instead of 1 1/2.

Yum- I love making this on movie nights. Sometimes I add about a teaspoon of vanilla. Once I didn't have any creamy peanut butter, so I used chunky. It works fine- but you'll have little peanut chunks coated in chocolate and powdered sugar down at the bottom of the bag.

I only give it a 4 because the person who posted this recipe needs to add butter to the recipe. I added 1/4 cup but it needed more like 3/4 for the chocolate to be more smooth. Also you need more sugar I used 2 cups, other then that it turned out great I had to stir forever.

I thought this recipe was great!  I didn't add any butter as other people had suggested, and it turned out wonderful.  I was kind of worried about not adding the butter as that is how I usually make it, but it tasted the same, and it's less fattening!

This is a great finger food dessert...we make it for the Superbowl. I like it with 7 cups of the cereal instead of 9.  I would even consider making more of the chocolate and peanut butter mixture.

I make this every year for Christmas. It is delicious and very easy to make. It never lasts long, even when I double the recipe.

Don't forget the stick of butter. So melt the butter in the pan, add the chocolate, then the pb.
I also prefer to use a brown paper bag since I guess I once got too rowdie and happened to get holes in the plastic bag that made the powder sugar go everywhere. For the moment it made a good laugh with the friends :]

Yummy!  WE loved this treat.  I added a 1/2 cup of butter to the chocolate mix.  I don't think I let the chocolate set enough when i mixed it with the cereal because when I did the confectioner's sugar, it blended with the chocolate.  It made quite a unique coating.  Loved it all the same.  Thanks.

A holiday necessity. I use a whole box of Crispix, a jar of PB, a bag of chips, and a box of powdered sugar. Very easy to make, hard to mess up. Just make sure to gently shake the mixture in the sugar so you don't end up with pieces of cereal and clumps of powdered sugar.

Awesome recipe! I recommend this for anyone with a major sweet tooth like mine. I used 6-7 cups of cereal instead of nine, and  I substituted cheerios and rice crispies for rice squares instead. Still turned out great!! I'll be using this over and over again.

Very good!  But I also found that there wasn't enough chocolate to coat 9 cups of the cereal, I used 6-7 cups before it ran out.

Simple, quick and tastey recipe.  I added 1 cup lightly salted peanuts and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to chocolate mixture.  Dry on waxed paper before storing in fridge.  Serve in large doggy bowl!

This was quite the hit at this years Christmas Party.  I made one batch, and ended up sending it home with my guests.  I did use one cup of peanut butter, 16oz bag of milk chocolate chips and crispix cereal.  Great!! Thanks for sharing Nicky!

I grew up eating this but it was called "muddy buddies" back then.  The recipe was on the back of the cereal box.  Now my kids, ages 6, 3 1/2, and 1 1/2 love them.  They ask for them all the time.

Always a hit. I used a full 12 oz bag of chocolate chips because of some of the suggestions in previous reviews and it was perfect. I also used the reduced fat peanut butter and I couldn't tell a difference between the batch I made and the batch my mom always made. Very easy and quick.

I am not sure how anyone got the chocolate peanut butter mixture to coat all that cereal. I added a quarter cup of butter and there was still not nearly enough chocolate mixture to coat the cereal. I had to melt more in the microwave and the rest of the cereal with the first bit of coating clumped together while waiting. Next time I will use two cups of chocolate and maybe double the peanut butter too. I used the paper bag idea and that worked pretty well.

What a disappointment! MISSING INGREDIENTS: butter and vanilla found in other recipes. Was craving this after my sister brought over for xmas. Did a Google search for "puppy chow recipe". This was first recipe that came up. Honestly, didn't know there was more than one recipe for puppy chow. After I made this, I knew something  was wrong. It wasn't satisfying...it wasn't rich...it wasn't what I had been craving.

I cut the recipe in half. Instead of 36 servings, it turned into 18 servings. I used 2/3 cup swmi sweet chocolate chips, 1/4 cup peanut butter plus a tablespoon, and one cup of powered sugar. Turned out great. This is definitely the recipe I will be using from now on.

Nice, quick, easy and delicious!  I used the whole 12oz bag of chocolate, added 3 tablespoons of butter, and only used 8 cups of cereal.  ...split up the cereal into two different 1 gallon bags and make sure they're puffed up with air when tossing with the powdered sugar.  Oh, also don't be afraid to add more powdered sugar.  I required more to fully cover all of the cereal.

I ruined a whole box of chex, and it didn't turn out right. It needs 1/4 cup of butter and vanilla to work. Also use regular chocolate chips, not semi-sweet.

I lessened the amounts on it all to make a smaller portion and I also used cinnamon flavored life cereal rather than the rice crispy squares, it came out delicious!

It turned out okay as written. However, it wasn't chocolatey enough for my family. The next batch, I doubled the chocolate (and added a couple more TB of PB) and it was MUCH better. A full 11-12 oz bag of chocolate chips is about 2 cups so that worked perfectly. It also helps to lay it out on a cookie sheet for an hour or so afterward to allow the chocolate to solidify. That way you have more individual pieces and fewer large clumps.

Yummm!  We took this to a school event and it was devoured.  I used a whole box of cereal, 1 whole bag of chocolate chips, 1 cup of peanut butter, and 3 cups of powdered sugar.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave and added the peanut butter to that, then put that plus everything else in a giant bowl and carefully stirred, turning over from the outside in.

i do use a little more chocolate chips than called for. And if you do in micrwave you cant over cook the chocolate or it does come out to *chawky* as she said, just know your microwave and do a few seconds at a time starting at 30 seconds. But I do on stove top. I add teaspoon of vanilla as well. IT is addicting.

I've never had puppy chow before, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was good, but the ratio of peanut butter and chocolate was off for me. I would have enjoyed less peanut butter. I'll definitely make this again in the future but I'll probably cut the peanut butter in half.

Very good!  Only changes ... microwaved the chocolate chips, peanut butter (with 1/4 c margarine) until smooth then added 1 tsp vanilla.  Store in little snack sized baggies in fridge.  Perfect size to grab and run.

This is a great recipe!  I use it every time.  I find that it's easier to warm the peanut butter + chocolate one more time so it's easier to mix it with the cereal.  It should be pretty smooth.

We loved this puppy chow! I have made it twice in the last four days actually. The first time I made it just to have to eat around the house for my family, and I thought it was a little too chocolate-y. So the second time I made it for my three year old's preschool class I added about another 1/2 cup of peanut butter to balance out the chocolate. It was a hit with both my family and the preschool class! So easy to make and very addicting. I will be making this again fairly often because we all liked it so much. Thanks for the recipe, Nicky!

Perfect puppy chow! The only thing I did was add a little bit more powdered sugar than what is recommended, more like 2 cups. Makes a healthy amount of puppy chow good for gifting.

I love puppy chow. I originally made it when I was in third grade and our teacher called it Reindeer Chow for the holidays ahaha. Now that I'm almost 22, I make it every year around Christmas to give to friends. It's much better home made than it is when you find it in the store.

As for this recipe, I also reduced the amount of cereal to 8 cups. I liked the option of putting the butter and vanilla in, but a whole stick was a little much. Also, if you put the butter in and you plan to make this in the microwave, bad idea. The butter makes the chocolate and peanut butter stick together like crazy. I had to put hot milk in the mixture jus to make it smooth enough to coat the cereal. Might be better if done in a pot/pan on the stove. Over all though, a wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe. I read the reviews and followed some advice from several contributors. I used one 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips and microwaved the chocolate and PB for one minute, stirred and then continued microwaving at 30 second intervals. I would recommend that if you plan to use the Ziploc bag method to add the powdered sugar that you add 1/2 cup to coat completely. Also, I would add 1/2 cup of sugar, then some of the chocolate covered cereal and then another 1/2 cup of sugar....etc. that way you can coat more evenly with less shaking and mess. Good luck keeping this yummy stuff around! ;-)

I used a 12 oz box Crispix, which is about 9 cups. I also added a stick of butter at my friend's suggestion. I had to make more of the chocolate mixture to coat all of the cereal. I'd recommend using 16 oz of chocolate vs. 12 oz. I also added more powdered sugar, figuring more is better. :)

Daughter told me about this one after moms at school made it for school treats. I became a hero after finding the recipe here... it is really addictive like others say. I use the store-brand cereal and add the peanutbutter like others say. I also used one reviewers tip about putting it and the powdered sugar in a paper grocery bag for a quadrupled recipe and it worked fantastic for mixing. Easy and a hit with all kids, and it is gluten free.

I have been meaning to make this for quite some time. My daughter's school always sells a ton of this for any bake sale. People can't seem to get enough of it. They LOVE it! I finally made it using this recipe without changing anything with the exception of I only had 'corn' cereal squares. And not only was this really easy to make, but my family raved about it. I also sent it in for my daughter's birthday treat for school and the kids loved it! I should also mention that I used mini morsels so that they would melt faster. I will definitely continue to make this recipe for many years to come.

I made a double batch of this, this afternoon. For church bus kids tomorrow.  Using the butter, vanilla, and brown grocery bag. With 8 cups of cereal. I had enough for 15 1 cup servings and a small bowl left over. It is delicious but rich. So it will last even longer as it doesn't take as much to fill us up. Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe.

Very good recipe - uses less peanut butter and butter than most recipes like this; so even if it's not "healthy" at least it's not as detrimental to your health as others out there.

One word: Nutella! I wanted to make puppy chow for some British friends while studying abroad in the UK. English grocery stores, however, do not sell chocolate chips in large quantities. As a solution, I substituted Nutella (a chocolate hazelnut spread) for chocolate. I also added butter, because I didn't want to skimp on flavour for friends who had never tasted it :) The result was phenomenal! The Nutella added a smooth, nutty, outstanding flavour. It also made the puppy chow significantly richer, though, so you may want to watch out for that. (Although I didn't measure how much I put in, so that might just be poor judgment on my part.)

Just like what I remembered from when I was little.  A couple tips 1) Using a plastic bag can get very messy, you might want to use a tupperware.  2) Store this in the refrigerator and serve cold.  It tastes a lot better that way.

This is AWESOME! The first time I made it, I did it the same except used half corn chex. The second time, I added a quarter cup more of peanut butter, chocolate, and powdered sugar and used all rice chex. (Corn doesn't have the right flavor.) It's really good how it is, I just wanted a little extra peanut butter-chocolate.

Great stuff as always, puppy chow never disappoints!  My boyfriend and his friends ate the whole batch in one night.  The recipe is very easy, I though it would be a huge mess but it was really just one bowl.  Instead of using a plastic bag for the powdered sugar I just kept in the large bowl and tossed it with the lid on.  Yummy!

Just a note- if you choose to add vanilla to the peanut butter & chocolate mixture, do so only AFTER heating it. If you add the vanilla before heating it, it will turn into chocolate peanut butter dough. It tastes good, but doesn't exactly mix with cereal at that point. (I was tired and in a hurry that day.)

This is a great recipe that pleases all the men in my life (hubby, two nephews, little bro & friends) who frequent my home. I do use a whole 12oz bag of chocolate chips and a little extra powdered sugar and it's a hit!

My niece in Iraq asked for this and I thought when I heard this name she had lost it. LOL! I have been schooled so they say and found this recipe and made it, tasted it and also sent in onto Iraq for her to enjoy a little bit of home. Thank you as they are delicous and a very nice and easy recipe to make. :)

Yummy, and such a crowd pleaser! I think I used about 7 cups of chex, but at least 8 or 9 cups are needed, otherwise the chocolate has fewer pieces to spread to, and the chex clump up together. Also, using a double boiler might be better to melt the chocolate so it doesn't start to burn as it melts.

This recipe is a good starting off point for this classic holiday treat. I added a full bag of chocolate chips and brought the chex down to 8 cups. I also added an extra half cup of peanut butter. They turned out great!

I love this recipe and for a twist I also add 1 cup of salted peanuts, 1 cup of raisins, and about 3 to 4 cups of tiny pretzel twists.  You have to use a huge bowl, I use 1 entire bag of chocolate chips and 1 cup of peanut butter melted together in the microwave.  You can buy very large plastic ziploc bags ( 2-3 gallon size)  to mix the chocolate with the powdered sugar.  Yummy!!  It is an awesome Christmas gift, just fill a large coffee mug with the puppy chow and wrap with some colored celophane and a ribbon!

If you don't have a large bowl you can use a paper bag from the grocery store to throw the mixture into and shake it up...the pieces will be evenly covered this way.

I make this every Christmas and always have to make more than one batch. We love it, but it definitely needs more chocolate. There is never too much chocolate so I used almost 2 cups.

Oh MY!  I made this per the recipe, except I also added 4 tablespoons of butter and about a half cup of salted peanuts and a little of the salt from the bottom of the jar... I like salty and sweet together and THIS little mixture is ADDICTIVE!  Crunchy, sweet, salty and CHOCOLATE all in one!  Oh, and I didn't have enough chocolate chips for both recipes I wanted to make, but I had 4 ounce bars of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate.  I measured out a cup of the chips and found they weigh just over 6 ounces, so I used a bar and a half, broke it up into the bowl with the peanut butter and butter... microwaved it on high for one minute... worked beautifully!  I also added the chocolate mixture slowly instead of adding it all at once.  I got good coverage that way and didn't need to add more.

Yeah, these are called Muddy Buddies.  The recipe is on the Chex cereal box.  They ARE completely addicting.

Added 1/4 cup butter and about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Husband and toddler loved it.  I don't eat peanut butter, so I'm rating based on their ravings.

I spent some time in the midwest and had never heard of Puppy Chow until then. I make this regularly and it never lasts long in my house.

I LOVE making this for my Grandson for an after school treat!! Like other reviews I used a whole bag of chocolate chips, a little extra peanut butter, 1/4 cup of butter and a tsp of vanilla. So much easier to Microwave than stovetop. I also like the idea of putting the mixture in the Fridge for awhile before tossing in the powdered sugar. I found that it helps coat the chex mix better! I will be making this "Puppy Chow" for a fund raiser at my Grandson's school. A cupful in a plastic ziplock bag will be a great idea for a treat to sell at this function!

This is a really easy and yummy recipe. Like other reviewers I melt my chocolate in the microwave, mix in the PB and then melt for a few more seconds.  I also don't really measure the powdered sugar.  I just keep adding it in until everything is totally coated with it.  I wanted to make this tonight and had everything but the cereal...so I used microwave popcorn instead.  It was really yummy too and one popped bag makes 8-9 cups of popcorn so it fits in well with the recipe. Next time I would make sure to check for any unpopped kernels though because once covered in chocolate they are not easy to see and are a little hard on the teeth :-)

This isn't my favorite thing in the world, but I use it as a staple for a fun playdate snack.  Both the moms and kids always love it! You can also make whatever alterations you want.  It's pretty hard to screw up.

Good base for a recipe. I used the Quaker oatmeal squares instead and it turned out AWESOME! I also used 1 1/2 cups choc. This is the way I will continue to make it, this cereal stays intact and has a better texture. Everyone that has tried it says its the best puppy chow they've ever had!

i needed to make something sweet for a party last night and i kept thinking back to when i was younger, i used to eat this. so i found this recipe. the other recipes on the website call for too much butter, etc.. i thought the amount of ingredients in this was perfect. if it were done with any more, it would have been too intense and too sweet. i loved not using any butter ! needless to say, i came home with an empty container.

Having made this recipe countless times, I think I've learned a few tricks and variations that might seem useful.  You can either have the cereal be evenly coated by eliminating the butter from the recipe, making the chocolate mixture very smooth which easily coats the cereal evenly.  Or you can add the butter and microwave for 1 1/2 min. (added about 1/2 to 3/4 cups crunchy peanut butter), which turns the mixture into a more solid than liquidy.  It coats the cereal, but it clumps pieces together, creating these wonderful little clumps of chocolate and cereal.  Also if you use crunchy peanut butter the little peanut  buts get covered in powdered sugar and fall to the bottom of the bag--excellent.  In addition to using more confectioners' sugar (about half a bag), another variation is to add peanut butter M & M's! You can also use both milk chocolate and semisweet chips. It makes it less of a bitter semi-sweet taste, or even use hershey kisses and semisweet chips!

This is so delicious it's a hit at every party!! I made a couple of tweeks to make it my own :) I basically increased the chocolate & peanut butter a half a cup and added 2 tbs of vanilla for that extra yummy home-made flavor :)

My kids and their friends love this!  It is very easy to make as well.  Instead of mixing the powdered sugar in a bag I just mixed it in the bowl that I mixed the cereal and chocolate mixture in, seemed like it would be less messy.  Perfect!

Maybe I did something wrong but I didn't care for this at all. I would like to try it again - if someone else made it, just to see if maybe I messed it up. I feel terrible giving only 3 stars since everyone else said they really enjoyed it =(

This was perfect.  Just enough chocolate to coat each piece of cereal, and I did use 9 cups.  I also used a grocery bag to shake the cereal and powdered sugar.  Next time I'm going to use chunky peanut butter because I think it would be absolutely wonderful with peanuts added.

Not lovin it. Made the recipe exactly as stated. I keep going back to the bowl trying a piece,and thinking what is everyone raving about? It wasn't what I expected, but to each his own right? UPDATE 7/26/08 by popular demand I was told to edit my review. Any one who ate this stuff LOVED IT ! I still don't get it, but hey just thought you guys should know it goes over well. OH, also gave some away as a small thank you gift and added M&Ms and pretzels to the mix.

Yummy.  I've never tasted this recipe before and was pleasantly surprised.  I added a quarter cup of butter which helped to coat the cereal very well.  I highly recommend using a grocery bag to mix the concoction, it definitely helped to lessen the mess.

Not sure what I think of this... My son really liked it. I think next time I'd add a bit more peanut butter, wasn't enough for me. Couldn't figure out how I was going to get the powdered sugar all over that gooey mess, ended up doubling up two plastic grocery bags, dumping everything in there and shaking, worked very well.

This is such a great treat!  I make it every year at Thanksgiving, and people munch on it all weekend long.  I do follow a couple of the reviews and add 1/4 C butter and 1 t vanilla to the peanut butter/chocolate mixture.

I love how easy this recipe is! Next time I will increase the amount of cereal slightly as the coating was bit thicker than I would like.

Tastes perfect!  Made it exactly like directions.  Some people said they would have put more chocolate in on other reviews, but I thought it was the perfect amount.

I love puppy chow and have been making this for years.  The only change I do is use Chex Mix instead of just cereal.  I like the variety.  Puppy chow is definately easy and good.

I can't get enough of this stuff! I made it for my daughter's Valentine's party at school. I added 1/4 cup butter to the peanut butter and chocolate recipe and melted it in the microwave. I coated the cereal with the mixture using gloved hands (easier than a spoon), then laid it on wax paper for about 30 minutes. I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar and that was more than enough to coat it! Will make this for many years to come.

This recipe was great, and really easy to make. I gave it four stars because the chocolate does not melt that well and just remains thick; I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup of butter and it made it perfect. Nice, easy treat.

I followed a similar recipe I had for Puppy Chow which called for an entire box of chex cereal, 1 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup butter, 1 pkg choc chips and 1 cup nuts, coated with 1-2 cups of powdered sugar.  All other steps remained the same.   I found this to be VERY sweet ( a little too sweet for me) and it did indeed seem to absorb a lot of the powdered sugar.  Would consider making it again in the future for a party or other gathering.... but way too much sugar in it to just have around the house.  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!!!That is all that needs to be said. I made this several years ago and lost the recipe. I was so glad when I found it here. My 5 year old, who likes nothing, said he wouldn't eat it because he knew he wouldn't like it, can't stop eating it. He gave it two thumbs up. My older two were excited when they heard I was going to make it while they were in school. They have fond memories of this special recipe. ENJOY!!!!!

Ahh, the Puppy Chow of my youth. I would have given it five stars, but the ingredients are a bit off. There wasn't nearly enough chocolate/PB to coat the peices (I didn't measure the sugar, I did it by sight). When I've made it again, I use the whole bag of chocolate chips and about a cup of peanut butter.

Wonderful! This is a great recipe that everyone knows and loves.  Don't be afraid of the less than gourmet appearance. I think the ratio of chocolate to cereal is just right.  I also made a batch with dark chocolate (60% cocoa bittersweet chips), and a batch with dark chocolate raspberry peanut butter I found at a gourmet store.  I am eager to try it with Nutella (Italian hazelnut spread)next time. I melted the chocolate in corningware at 30 second intervals in the microwave.  I found it helpful to include the peanut butter with the chocolate during the last 30 seconds.

wonderful recipe!  My girls loved it.  Even my picky daughter couldn't stop eating it once she tried it.  We brought it camping and all the kids (and daddies) LOVED it.  One thing, at first I tried to make it with milk chocolate chips but I found that they didn't melt well on the stove (I didn't use the added butter that some other reviewers suggested) then iI gave up and used regular chocolate chips and they worked beautifully (again I didn't add the butter).  All in all, easy to make and delicious!

Oh My! My guys loved this for the munchies. Very easy to fix, and only 4 ingredients, how easy is that? No heating up the kitchen either. Now the only problem is keeping myself away from this stuff. Thanks ever so much for posting this one, Nicky!

My puppy chow is famous where I live because instead of adding just a half cup of peanut butter, I add sometimes 2 or 3 times what my recipe says and it makes all the difference! I never measure how much PB i use, I just make sure the chocolate mixture stays soupy and doesn't get to thick. MMMMMMM : )

I have used this recipe several times, for parties, and we were licking the bowl, it was so good. But I lowered the amount to 30 serving while I was at home eating it as a snack. Wonderful recipe! Definetly 5 stars!

This was very tasty.  I used the whole bag of choc. chips and 1 cup of peanut butter.  I used about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I saved time by melting the choc. and pb in the microwave. This is messy but worth it.  I shook everything up in a plastic grocery sack and it worked well.

This was so easy to make.  Best to make it in a dutch oven instead of a saucepan because of the amount of cereal you have to add.  Also tried it with crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and that was good as well.  Added a new texture.  Went over very well at my office.

This is SO GOOD!  I used 7 cups of cereal because of the other reviews on here, but I found that it was a bit too chocolatey.  Next time I'm sticking to 9 cups.  Delicious!

I had a craving for something sweet and crunchy, and this recipe definitely did the trick.  Turned out great with natural peanut butter and Wheat Chex.  As one of the reviewers recommended, I placed the cereal briefly in the freezer to allow the chocolate/peanut butter to firm up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did the melting in a pyrex bowl and in the microwave. This chow is VERY addictive and you will want to eat and eat, and eat. Make sure the bag you use to do the mixing is hole free ( experience speaking here ) A great recipe, treat.

This recipe is absolutely perfect. Easy to make with very few ingredients. I use a double-lined brown grocery bag to shake up the mixture and it works perfectly. I have made it for several parties, and it is now the most requested treat for me to bring. Be warned...it can be addictive!

No one could believe I had made it and one of my teachers said it looked like I had spent hours cutting the squares myself! I had been looking for this recipie for 2 years, and now I can make it anytime I want. Quick, simple and a delicious snack!

In my family, there are some things we save just for Christmas time, but this is an al year long treat. It's too good to only have 1 time per year! It's easy (and fun) to make and just as simple to clean up.

For all you parents who want to save $$$ on snack food this is definately a keeper. I have yet to come across a child who does not love this snack. My son (and husband) gobble it up each time I make it.

My kids loved this. I made it at Christmas and it was their favorite thing. I liked it, but my husband wouldn't even touch it. It is good though and really easy to pig out on!

I guess I'm in the minority on this one. I felt it was way too dry and didn't have much flavor. I wound up throwing most of it out. I did add a 1/4 cup of butter after the initial taste test. It helped but wasn't enough to salvage the dish.

This is usually a really good snack....but unless you only want half of your cereal to get coated With chocolate, you either have to use half the amount of cereal or double the amount of chocolate and pb. You may want to add a bit of butter and vanilla while melting the choc/pb to make it run smoother over the cereal. Don’t overheat your chocolate or it will get clumpy and hard to manage. 

I use a plastic or paper bag to put the cereal in and shake with powdered sugar so it’s easily and evenly coated

This recipe is fantastic! It's the perfect sweet-n-salty, crunchy snack.
I've played around with the recipe in past years & recommend: use 1 stick of real butter (helps to thin out the chocolate & peanut butter & makes the mix a little more rich), I use 1 full cup of PB! I tested Peter Pan Crunchy & Jiff Crunchy peanut butter. Both are softer butters than Natural peanut butter, therefore to me, makes the mixture easier to work with. I use Hershey's chips. Tried another brand & wasn't the same. I omitted the vanilla because you can't taste it & to me is a waste of vanilla.
I used a jumbo freezer bag to shake then poured into a colander to shake off excess sugar.
Lastly, I put the mix into freezer bags and placed in the freezer. Night & day difference in taste! So i always keep in the freezer. It's a wonderful cold, sweetncrunchy treat!

Not enough chocolate and too sweet; didn't like it.  I would use a 12 oz. bag semi-sweet choc. (dark chocolate is preferred). Incorporate a little powdered sugar into the melted choc (not coated on the outside).

This is the perfect chocolate to peanut butter mixture ratio. I was able to use a whole box of rice chex cereal with the 1 to .5 ratio and roughly 2 cups of the powdered sugar to coat the entire thing. Also I set my microwave to 50% cook power and microwaved for about 1 minute.

Everybody at my child’s birthday party LOVED the recipe!! I added 3/4 stick of butter during the melting process to help smooth out the chocolate. It almost didn’t make it to the party with my family “sampling”.

I followed this recipe, but did add more powdered sugar after increasing the melted chocolate and peanut butter as the recipe’s suggestion didn’t cover all of the cereal.

This was rather dry and I could barely taste the chocolate and peanut butter. I did use Crispex instead of rice Chex but the same amount so I don’t think that was the problem. It needs a whole bag (12oz) of chocolate chips, 1 full cup of peanut butter and then 3-4 cups sugar to coat.

It is a good easy recipe.  I add a splash of vanilla sometimes,  depends on your preference.

I made a double batch - used an entire box of Rice Chex, an entire 10 oz. bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, a whole stick of butter, a cup of peanut butter, and a tbls. of vanilla.  Followed the directions exactly but made sure to let the coated cereal cool down a bit before I started shaking it in a bag with the powdered sugar.  I shook up several small batches at a time vs. one or two huge batches.  I didn't measure out the powdered sugar, just dumped a bit at a time in the bag, shook, added more if it looked like it needed more.   Best Puppy Chow I ever made.

It mostly tastes like what you can buy in the store, but it would be better/closer with milk chocolate chips. The peanut butter to chocolate ratio is a bit high as well. I also used way *way* less cereal than the recipe calls for (~half a box) and it barely got coated by the chocolate-peanut-butter mixture. Probably won't be using this again.

It was delicious!! Very easy to make, but I would make more of the peanut butter and chocolate mix because it is difficult to cover all of the rice chex.

This used to be one of my favorite things at Christmas time when I was a kid. I have never made it myself but, I just made my first batch for my kids this year and it is still as delicious as I remember. Thank you for sharing this recipe, brings back many wonderful memories.

You definitely need a lot more peanut butter, a little more chocolate, and definitely less powdered sugar. Great otherwise!!

Mine turned stale tasting very quickly. The chocolate made my Chex mix soggyish. Idk what I did wrong but it was gross. Maybe I put too much chocolate on it

Works better if you use a flat wide container to put the chex in as more chex would get covered more easily. I used a vertical container and had a great deal of trouble getting chocolate on many of the chex. Ended up making more sauce.  The powdered sugar just got soaked in the chocolate/peanut butter covering the chex. 

People ate it but didn't rave about 
it . We are giving the remaining several cups away.

I used  the exact amounts of chocolate chips, butter and peanut butter and it coated 9 cups really thick.  I added the rest of the box into which was almost 3 more cups and it gave it a nice chocolate coating.   I then put powdered sugar into gallon zip lock bag, shook and added more.  I divided it into about 3 batches to coat.   Then spread it out on parchment paper to let cool.  Then I put the batch in a colander bowl and gently stirred to get rid of the loose powdered sugar.  Beautiful dish.  Toss in a red and green chocolate candy and it makes a beautiful candy dish.

Great recipe! I use 1 box cereal, one bag of milk chocolate chips and 1 bag of peanut butter chip instead of peanut butter. I spread cereal on large baking sheet and sprinkle both chips all over--then put in oven until it looks like chips are melted--then I remove from oven and spread melted goodness around. Moving to large container as coated. Then I add the powdered sugar to container and shake shake shake to coat. Skip the butter calories...not that it makes that much difference :-)

For those who don't want to use your stove top, you can easily use a microwave to melt the chocolate and peanut butter mixture. I cut my recipe to 24 servings, melted my chocolate mixture for 1 minute at 30 second intervals, checking and stirring after each. Nice and smooth. Thanks for posting the recipe and have fun!

Great basic recipe! Other recipes use more chocolate, but in my experience that gets clumpy. This was just right (for us).

Good recipe but there is always a ton of left over sugar in the bottom of the bowl, add vanilla as well for extra flavor. makes more than you think it will!

Very good! Used whole box cereal which was 12 cups and increased chocolate (about 1/2 cup more) and peanut butter (about 1/4 cup more) to compensate. Heated the chips in microwave about 30 seconds at a time and stir before adding more time. Pour mixture over some of the cereal in huge bowl then keep layering cereal over more chocolate to help with mixing. To keep from smashing too much cereal, toss the mixture together by shaking the bowl rather than stirring it. Allow the mixture to cool and stiffen before adding powdered sugar so the sugar doesn't absorb too quickly. Shake bowl again to cover the the cereal rather than stirring.

It turned out AMAZING! I decided to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips and it still tastes fantastic!

I'd recommend the 12 oz bag of chocolate...better too much than not enough. Definitely doesn't need butter. I've made it with and without, and the extra calories/fat isn't necessary for good puppy chow!

I did make a couple changes i used a whole 12 oz bag of chocolate chips and 8 cups cereal i did follow the idea of putting the coated cereal in the fridge so the sugar does not disappear how ever i left my in the fridge for 40 minutes and when i took it out it reassemble bark so if you decide to do this suggestion only leave it in the fridge for a few minutes but  mine is still very yummy and I will definitely make again

This recipe makes SUCH a big batch it's pretty unmanageable and unrealistic to stir in a large sauce pan and even the largest mixing bowl I had.  I used a gallon ziplock and that wasn't large enough either for this quantity. Definitely disappointed and will be cutting the recipe in half next time!!!

Delicious! Instead of putting the powder sugar in a big bag with the coated cereal, I put the powder sugar in a sifter and shook it over the bowl while mixing/stirring.****Great recipe overall and super delicious!!!

I love this recipe. The only thing I do different is I add 1 tsp vanilla after I melt the chocolate and it is off or out of the heat source.

Yummy puppy chow....used dark chocolate for this recipe....next time I will use a little less peanut butter because I think it overpowered the chocolate. I also used a little less powdered sugar because OMG is this sweet!  I used a mix of vanilla and chocolate chex mix for this.

When I made this I didn't have enough peanut butter in the house so I added a little bit more chocolate and I just add cereal until I thought it was enough. You can use the measurements as a guid but whatever you do will not be bad. Also it was easier to melt the chocolate in the microwave and just dumb it in a large mixing bowl with the peanut butter.

I made double the amount that the recipe says. I used other reviews to help make mine better. I used 14 cups of chex cereal and I added more chocolate chips. Turned out great and enjoyed by all. First time was a success.

Beware! Once you start eating this recipe, it is difficult to stop! I doubled the amount of peanut butter and chocolate chips in the recipe. I also use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I use enough confectioners' sugar to cover them completely. With those changes, I've found that it is perfect!

I add a teaspoon of vanilla as per the original recipe on the box. This is one of the biggest hits I make every year for Christmas, which is sad considering how easy it is compared to things that have been less popular!

This recipe has always been one of my favorites! Takes me back to my childhood. It is so quick and easy to make. I didn't want to waste any of the left over ingredients, so I doubled it. I love that this recipe calls for only one type of cereal mix. Most recipes call for different varieties, but it all tastes the same to me. I just added a little extra conf sugar. Thanks for sharing!

Yum! I followed the recipe except adding more powdered sugar so it was white like the picture. It soaked it up quickly because I leave the mixture on the stovetop on low while I stir to coat the cereal. Keeping the choco/pb mixture warm helps coat the cereal easier and more thoroughly!

I also add a little bit of Vanilla to it. And before you add the powered sugar, put it into the freezer. Works SO much better. That way it doesn't stick together.

I used milk chocolate chips and butterscotch chips One bag of each and 8 cups of cereal. This make it easy for people with allergies go eat. One could try semi sweet chips also. I will try it the next time.

Very good, the kids in the neighbourhood love this. I was going to only add four cups of cereal as suggested by other viewers however it looked a little too chocolatey so I ended up making the recipe as is. I used the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred the mixture of chips and peanut butter, then 60 seconds more. Stirred in cereal. Placed the mixture on a foil lined cookie sheet (I was out of wax paper) spread the icing sugar on top and mixed on the cookie sheet. Very easy, enjoyed by all. Thanks for the recipe.

This is always everyones favorite. I used a 12oz box of crispix cereal, a whole bag of chocolate chips, a cup of beanut butter and a stick of butter. Used the microwave to melt the butter and the peanut butter and chocolate together. Then poured over the cereal and shook the coated cereal in the powdered sugar. Never any left.

Delicious!! I made this with my nieces over Easter and they had the best time making it - shaking the bags with all the sugar. It tasted great and turned out perfect. I did add butter and vanilla extract as others suggested and I added a bit more peanut butter as everyone in our family loves it!

My kids BEG for me to make this.  Its so easy to make too!  I usually mix in a little extra peanut butter and put powdered sugar in the bottom of the bag I mix the cereal in.  After i add the cereal to the bag i put a little more powdered sugar on top just to make sure i coat everything evenly.

Very awesome, but i made it Christmas style. I followed the recipe but instead of brown chocolate i used, red, green & white candy melts chocolate.  it is soooo neat, i did each batch seperately then mixed all colors in a big bowl, which gave it a red, green, and white christmas mix.  try it its awesome

Yep. This was the first time I've made puppy chow but I could tell as I was mixing it needed more chocolate. I ended up microwaving about a 3/4 of a cup more and it came out well. I think next time I'll try to add some butter though because the chocolate mixture was a bit thick.

This is fantastic. At first I was a bit skeptical about the portions, I thought, how could so much cereal need so little cho chips and peanut butter? I went ahead and measured it exactly, and it is accurate. My hubby gobbled it up and I'm looking forward to having this as a staple for the holidays and for snacking.

Wow! This was Delicious! Be sure to use a really big bowl when combining the Chocolate mixture with the cereal. I used the whole 12 oz box and there was still Chocolate to spare. i recommend refrigerating this until serving so that the Powdered Sugar can stay on the Chow. What is better then Peanut Butter and Chocolate together anyway?

I, along with my 6, 8, and 10 year old assistants, just made this.  It is super easy and very tasty (albeit pretty darn sweet).  Everyone - even the neighbor kids, liked it a lot!!!!  Good summer vacation activity.

I used used a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I did not measure the cereal but used just enough to coat all the pieces with the mixture and then tossed in a gallon baggie filled 1/4 the way full with powdered sugar.  Turned out perfect.  I also like the idea of freezing it for a snack.  Very good recipe..thanks for sharing.

These are great, even though mine did not come out exactly as they should, my mistake. I refrigerated them as suggested by a reviewer before tossing in the confec sugar and the entire bowl was just one huge chunk, I broke it apart as best I could, it still was eaten by every one. Will make again but will not put in refrigerator, just follow the directions given and they should come out fine.

Went with others' suggestions... added 1 tsp. of vanilla, used one entire 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips, and I added another half of a cup of sugar (since there was more chocolate). Then I kept it in a sealed container in my fridge... I personally like it better when it is chilled!

For me it was a very OK recipe. It was not NEARLY enough chocolate/pb, so I ended up having to do another chocolate/pb batch. Then, another problem, it stuck together, so it bunched all together and looked like a big ball of mud. And it could have used more confectioners sugar as you didn't get that white looking outer appearance. It tasted great though, after it took half an hour to try to get the recipe to work.

I am in charge of providing desserts for Christmas so I thought Puppy Chow would be a huge hit! I was right! I also made White Chocolate Puppy Chow that looked like little snowflakes. I will definitely be making this for future Christmases.

Classic! This is delicious and perfect as written and very very addicting. I don't make any changes except that I think a large paper bag is easiest for coating with powdered sugar. Make sure to use PLENTY of powdered sugar; it looks a lot prettier.

This was an amazing recipe. My whole family loved it and I will DEFINITELY make it again! I recommend this recipe to anyone who is looking for an easy, quick, and amazing recipe! The only modifications I made was that instead of using a bag to mix it, I used the cereal box from the Chex for a more sanitary way to mix it. I also added more powdered sugar after mixing the cereal and chocolate/PB mix because I found it didn't cover it all. Thanks to Nikki for the great recipe!

My family just loves this snack! Here is what I do to tweak it to our likings.   I used 8 cups of cereal, 12 oz. of chocolate chips, 1 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup butter, and added 1 tsp. vanilla to the melted chocolate mixture.  I then coated all the cereal with the chocolate mixture.  Next I put some powdered sugar in a ziplock bag, added about half of the cereal, shook it up.  Dumped it into my serving bowl and then repeated the process with the remaining cereal.  It worked really well and was super easy to do!

YUM! I was looking for something easy for a football party that would appeal to kids as well as adults.  This is it! I followed another reviewers suggestion to microwave the chocolate and peanut butter.  After microwaving, I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/4 cup butter and melted it all together.  There was plenty to cover the 9 cups of cereal.  Delicious, easy and different from anything I'd made before.

This recipe was good but not quite as good as a friend's recipe. I don't know what directions they followed so I can't compare that way. I did follow these instructions but used a full bag of chocolate chips and more cereal as other reviewers recommended.

Love this recipe! I add 1/4 cup butter and 1 tsp vanilla. I don't measure the cereal or powdered sugar, just add until everything is coated to my liking. Thanks! :)

Good starting point for this recipe, I liked it better with another small handful of chocolate chips, half a stick of butter and less cereal (I just add until the pieces are all coated well).  I also end up using more powdered sugar to get the pieces completely coated.

I love these! I used the recipe on the Chex Mix site. One difference, I used a whole package of MILK chocolate morsels. And definitely added the vanilla. Jif peanut butter is the only one we keep in the house :D
Yum Yum I can't stop eating them!

This has been a favorite for years... I prefer to use Crispix or Chex - the air pocket makes a unique crunch, and load on the powdered sugar to keep them from sticking. Also, a bit of margarine to the PB/chocolate mix helps to thin the sauce.

This is sooo good! I have been making this for several years now but in a slightly different way! Preparing it is the same but I use a box of Golden Grahams Cereal, 1-16oz jar dry roasted peanuts & 1 box of raisins. Melt together 1-18oz jar peanut butter, 2 stks of margarine or butter, 1 pkg of chocolate chips. Pour over cereal, nuts & raisins. Mix until well covered. Use a whole bag of powdered sugar to coat. This makes a lot but it gets gobbled up fast! Kids love it in their lunches.

I have made many batches of this in the past few weeks! We all love it! My boy friend's kids help me make it and they will be taking this to school for all thier teachers as a little Christmas treat. We are hosting an appetizer dinner this weekend and everyone will be given a goodie bag with "Reindeer Chow" to take home. Such a good homemade gift that goes a long way.

This is sooo good! A look at the nutritional chart provided says that the serving size is about 1/3 cup. Don't pay any attention to that because you will be eating a LOT more! In fact, just don't look at the chart at all.
I think I used more than the recommended amount of sugar. I like an all over coating of powdered sugar on mine.
Also, due to personal preference, I think I will add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of peanut butter next time. There wasn't as much pb flavor as I was hoping for, but I am a peanut butter fan. 
Still gets 5 stars for a great (and big) recipe!

Made this with the help of a 6 year old friend....She had a great time helping me make it and an even better time eating it. Melted it in the microwave and did add vanilla.  Great recipe.  Thanks, Nicky.

I LOVE this recipe! Just the way it is, it's perfect. I've made it twice, the second time cutting everything in half (since I'm usually the one who eats it all!), and the ingredient amounts were fine. Definitely a must for the holidays.

I was really surprised how easy this recipe is and how well kids devour it. Big hit here and taking another reviewer's advice of microwaving the chocalate and peanut butter makes it super easy and fast!

I just finished making this for some friends going on a mission trip. I also added butter and vanilla to the recipe & reduced the amount of rice cereal. I put the powdered sugar in the bottom of a gallon size zip-lock bag, then gradually added spoonfuls of the mixture to coat small amounts at a time. I did have to add a little more powdered sugar to coat the last spoonfuls. Yummy! Thanks.

I don't know how you can really go wrong with a recipe like this. Puppy Chow is one of my favorite snacks and I think this recipe is great. The only thing was that there was not near enough powdered sugar for the mix, and it got to be a mess when I had to keep opening the bag and pouring more in. But, if you just make sure you have extra powdered sugar, I think it will be just fine. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is great. The only thing I did different was I added a whole package of the chocolate chips. It makes it a lot easier to cover all the pieces of cereal.

I used more chocolate then it called for to completely cover the cereal. I also microwaved the mixture as someone else mentioned and it was easier. Overall it was a great snack the tasted the same as it did years ago when I had it as a child.

I followed the recipe to a tee. I had to add more ingredients than it called for. If using this recipe just keep that in mind. Other than that it is an okay recipe.

One of my favorite foods ever... I always seem to make a HUGE mess making it, though. =)   Use a little less cereal than this recipe calls for... there isn't enough sauce in this recipe.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars..only because I didn't end up using this actual recipe.  I used the recipe on the back of the rice Chex box which calls for the addition of butter to the pb/choc chips.  It was reeeallly sweet, but a nice treat and everyone liked it!

This stuff makes a great snack, especially for kids. I am 24 and my mom used to make it for me when I was little, so when I found this recipe I wanted to give it a try myself. It is a little messy to make, and I recommend using milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet chocolate chips, I find when I use the semi sweet chips it tastes a little bitter. I also use extra powdered sugar. Other than that, this is a great snack recipe!

I love this! Even my mom, who HATES peanut butter, loves puppy chow! I make it every time I fly. I just put it in a 1 quart ziploc bag and it is perfect for a snack on the plane. I use 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and 1 bag of chocolate chips. Also, I melt the pb and butter first and then add the chocolate chips becuase it is easy for the chocolate to burn. The only problem is the mess I create every time I make this!

I lost my old recipe for puppy chow and this one replaced the old one perfectly.  Like usual, everyone loved it and my brother even went to the extreme of hiding a bag of it and then taking it home with him.

I'm giving this 5 stars on behalf of my husband! He loves it, but I find it a bit too sweet for my taste, and I LOVE sweets! But, it is very good, although I myself would give it 4 stars. :-)

I made this thinking my husband would love this because basically it is a peanut butter ball without the hassle. He thought the powdered sugar on the outside made it feel "wet" and he didn't think this was one of the better things I have made.  I took it to work and tried it out on my co-workers/test subjects and they loved it.  The younger ones anyway.  I would make it again, because I thought it was good and easy and for a party it would be great and inexpensive.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love it!  Did need more sugar because I think it tastes better that way, and I used 8 cups of Crispix.

My sister made this recipe for a jewelry show we hosted and the results were pretty good.  I think the amount of powdered sugar could be reduced, though, as the picture for this recipe looks like a "light dusting" of sugar, while ours looks like a "complete coating" of sugar.  The taste is good, though!

Very good recipe. I love puppy chow, but have never made it before. I wish though that I had read the other reviews suggesting butter before I made it because I had a hard time getting to chocolate to melt and smooth out, but the finished product was very tasty!

Yum!! I just made this and had to review on this tasty treat. I used rice and corn cereal(Crispex), about 3/4 of a bag of mini choco chips, 3/4 c. reduced fat peanut butter and a little more than called for confex. sugar to completely coat. How delicious is this!! I threw a few pieces in my mouth before they even completely cooled. I cant wait for my daughter to try it. Thanks!

Wow, that is sooooo good.  I added almost 1/4 cup of butter and used 8 cups of cereal instead of 9 cups and it is perfect.  Now someone needs to take it away from me before I eat it all in the next few hours!!!!

This is good but I still like the Chex Muddie Buddies better. Without the butter this choco mixture is hard to mix the cereal into. I also used less powdered sugar.

YUM! This stuff is SOOO good and addicting! The only thing I do differently is add 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) with the chocolate. Great as a snack or to bring to parties.

I make this all the time! It's the most delicious snack and it's easy to make. I noticed everyone saying that there is way too much cerea. Why not use the correct amount and then you can have some leftover for later! I make this for my friends all the time and they love it. If you do use 9 cups of cereal-add a bit mor chocolate and peanut butter

I have made this before with no strict measurements, but this came out much better and without too much powdered sugar! I recommend using the BIG Ziploc 10 Gallon bags to mix it. It is an (almost) mess free job.

I was introduced to this by my pastor's wife, and since I lost the recipe I was glad to find it here so that I didn't have to pester her! It's so yummy! I would never have guessed how good it is by the simple ingredients!

I brought these to a superbowl party and they were gobbled up very quickly.  I thought that 9 C of the cereal was too much for the amount of choc. chips and pb, so I doubled them and added about 12 c of cereal along with the normal amount of powdered sugar and they tasted great.

Kids enjoyed this snack in the beginning, but halfway through the amount, they lost interest.  I will probably make again and give as part of the holiday gift baskets.

I use 7 cups of rice chex a little more peanut butter- gives it more flavor, also I add powdered sugar when still hot and then a little more after it's cold.  That way it soaks into the chocolate! mmmm

I made up a batch of this today. It is a little sweet for me but my husband and his co-workers liked it.  One of them even asked me for the recipe!  I will probably make this again sometime as it was a quick easy snack.  

Thanks for the recipe.

This stuff is addicting!!  :-D  I bake cookies & make candy for my Christmas gifts every year and the variety of cookies/candies varies from year to year.  This was the first year I added this stuff!  WOW!!!  I had to make 3 batches and still ran out.  I used Crispix cereal and took the advice of a previous review to add 1 cup peanut butter and and extra cup of the chocolate chips.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!  This will definitely be on my "regulars" list from now on!

I prefer this recipe with a little more peanutbutter and a bit of butter, but it was an easy recipe to follow and everything came out good.

Easy to make, just wasn't my or my family's favorite.  I am a big holiday baker and candy maker and I don't think I will repeat this one.
