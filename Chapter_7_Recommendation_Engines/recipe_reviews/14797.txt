This recipe is good and basic, but like others, I dolled it up a bit. I added a lot of Old Bay seasoning, fresh lemon juice, cilantro, jalepeno pepper, and I used real crab. I also used fat free cream cheese and added a bit of lite Mayo. It was very fresh and tasty.

This is real quick, simple, and good. I give 3 stars cos i found the recipe to be a bit bland, so i added jalapeno pepper to the mix and a dash of old bay.

This recipe is so quick and so easy! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought the green onion overpowered the crabmeat a little bit. Next time I will use a little less green onion. But overall, a very tasty recipe!

This gets 5 stars from me as my fiance ate it and he hates crab! Of course, I love crabmeat so I ate these right up, but I was pleasantly surprised when he ate them. He did put some chilli sauce on top of his pita bread as a garnish, but still, they are fabulous to eat.

Very good, and very simple. I used more like 4 ounces of Neufchatel cheese (pretty much identical to cream cheese but a lot less fat), but that was my only change. I only have a little mini chopper, so it took two batches to make it smoothish, although not too smooth (if I wanted pate, I would make pate! :). I served it with Peppy's Pita Bread off this site (a really simple recipe!). My husband likes his krab a lot more than I do, so he wolfed the suckers down. I liked it but thought it might be missing something... Maybe a little hot sauce or diced celery?  A nice, quick recipe that can be altered to personal taste quite easily. Thanks, Whitney. :)

This was absolutely awful, I would definitely not make it again. Thankfully the ingredients didn't cost much so when I tossed it in the garbage I didn't feel bad. If you are wanting a crab Rangoon don't make this, if you are wanting a good crab salad, please don't make this. Followed the simple directions to the word. I was stunned at how so few ingredients each on their own delicious and even when typically mixed still delicious, not in this instance and I'm bummed I love crab..... save yourself some heartache just say NO!

I liked this! I do think it needed a little salt, but that's just personal preference. This would also be great as a dip for crackers. Thanks for sharing. :)

I liked it a lot!  My teenagers, not so much.  I added cucumber to the finished pita to give it some color.
