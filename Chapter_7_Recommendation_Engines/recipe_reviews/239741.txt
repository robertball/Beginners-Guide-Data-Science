Couldn't find a small eggplant, so I just used a small biscuit/cookie cutter and cut into small rounds (used 2/chip).  I baked my own pita chips, spritzed with olive oil, sprinkled with salt & pepper, and baked for about 5 mins; also used Italian panko breadcrumbs on the eggplant.  I think just a little bit of spaghetti sauce under the eggplant might add another layer of flavor and some moisture, but that's not to say that it wasn't good without it.  I loved the ricotta on this (rather than mozzarella), IMO made it taste more authentic and fresh.   Quick, easy, two bites & it was gone!  Very nice.
