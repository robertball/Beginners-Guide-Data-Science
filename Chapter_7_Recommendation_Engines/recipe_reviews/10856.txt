I confess I had my doubts when I saw the cornstarch in the recipe.  In my mind, shortbread contains butter, flour and sugar in the proper proportions.

However, the good reviews associated with recipe convinced me to try it.

I don't write reviews for recipes because, hey, they're only recipes, right?  Let me tell you that this cookie recipe is shockingly good.  All the reviews are right-- this is a shortbread with a completely unique presentation and taste.  Try it, follow the recipe exactly, and your cookies will rock.

UPDATE 11/27/2002.  Made them again, and they are still quite fine.  Correct temperature is 350 degrees F, however, and cooking time is 9 minutes.  Watch the edges REALLY CAREFULLY because they burn suddenly.

Some reviews claim this recipe can be powdery.  That is true IF you eat these cookies hot.  For some reason these cookies taste a little better the day after.

If you want people to think you fussed, drop the dough from an icing bag onto your ungreased cookie sheet, through a large star icing tip.

These are definitely melt in your mouth.  They were just what I remembered. One thing to keep in mind.  They move off the pan easier when they are almost to completely cool.  they tend to fall apart if moved before cool.

These are oh-so-good! I find with these that in order to achieve the golden brown bottom, I had to remove them from the over just before they were starting to brown, because you need to let them sit on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before removing them, so they don't break apart. This achieves your golden brown bottom.

OH MY GOODNESS!!  these cookies are TO DIE FOR!!  It is very important that you whip the  out of the butter....turn on the mixer, and walk away....let it whip for like 20 minutes...add the rest of the ingredients, and whip it some more...
After they are baked....they really do MELT in your mouth....MMMMMMM....by far, the BEST shortbread I have ever made!!

Excellent!!! 

I have always wanted to make whipped shortbread and these were great.  I ate it warm and it did NOT crumble like some of the reviews said.

Here's what I did:
WHIP the butter a lot on high. Then beat the other ingredients in on high for several minutes - it should be a whipped white color - almost like a 'coolwhip' type look.  

I added a little extra sugar for added sweetness (about 1/8 cup more).  

I put hershey kisses in the center of some, green candied cheries in others and I left some plain! 

ENJOY!! Yum.

I wish I could give more than 5 stars.  This was by far my favorite of all the cookies we made this year.  I topped them with a tiny amount of icing and Christmas sprinkles, just to make them prettier.  One thing I learned while making them is: the batches I left in the oven a minute longer were a lot less likely to fall apart.  The first batch I made, about half of them crumbled apart while removing them from the cookie sheet, but after that, I just added a minute to the baking time and it seemed to solve that problem.  I will be making these bad boys EVERY year!!

I must admit that I don't care for this recipe.  However, I am the minority!  Every person that eats these absolutely loves them.  I make them all of the time for those 2 reasons too!  (This way I don't pig out on cookies.)  :) I place the dough for these in a pastry bag and pipe them out using the largest star tip, they turn out really pretty.  I have dipped them in chocolate and added sprinkles and they look great.  Yesterday I added the rind from an orange for a citrus-y flavor, it was very subtle but well received.  These cookies do honestly melt in your mouth, they are a cinch to make and are fairly inexpensive to prepare-what more could you ask for in a recipe?  Thanks for sharing it!

This was a Great Recipie.  I Loved it.  I only baked it for 8 min and when I made some on the non stick cookie sheets they burned within 5 minutes.  I won't use the non stick pans again as they were dark on the bottom and not fully cooked on the top.  I will make these again :)

While surfing this site for ideas for Christmas food gifts, I found this wonderful recipe. It truly is melt-in-you-mouth tastey! The second batch I made by pinching off a piece of the dough about the size of your little fingernail, rolling it into a ball, then baking. When cooled I frosted them with a butter, lemon juice, powdered sugar frosting! Yum Yum

Excellent Shortbread Cookies! I use 1/2 unsalted and 1/2 salted butter. We love cranberry/orange flavors and these were delicious with 1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries and the zest of an orange folded in with a simple glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice and zest. I used a small ice cream scoop and baked for 11 minutes and they are perfect. Allow them to cool on the sheets for 4 - 5 minutes before moving to racks to cool completely. This is one of our favorite holiday cookies. Thanks for sharing!

10 STARS.  I've been making 'Kay's Shorbread' from this site for a few years and thought I had my master recipe, but then tried this just recently and was so pleasantly surprised that it topped the other recipe.  The powder sugar/cornstarch makes this cookie melt-in-your mouth. There is absolutely no alterations needed. I also made it once with the additiona of vanilla extract but it took away from the true butter flavor - the way it's supposed to be.  So this is truly a perfect recipe - ingredient porportions and all. I have also added walnuts on top or minced candy ginger for added flavor and variety.  The nuts adds a nice texture and appearance. You can use chopped raw nuts and push it gently onto the dough and will roast while it's baking. I also do NOT make drop cookies.  I bake this in porcelain dishes (8x8) and cut into wedges or squares.  Metal dishes don't brown as well as porcelain.

This a variation on the Melting Moments cookies from the yellow Argo Cornstarch box of the early 1980s.. that my children LOVED and are now making for their families!  Genius recipe! use good (sifted) cocoa for about half the flour for true melting magic... or sub a good quality peanut butter for half (or more) of the butter (DO NOT USE MARGARINE) and they become a bite of heaven.  Easily tinted to match a bit of extract for different flavors, and with or without frosting, sprinkles, etc. they are wonderful, easy, and convince your children, grandchildren, friends (and anyone else lucky enough to grab a couple) that you are a kitchen faery queen!  Use real butter, beat and beat, parchment paper helps a lot, and a small scoop is the world's BEST kitchen investment... cook magic and enjoy!

I know this recipe as 'Whipped Shortbread' and yes it is excellent. The secret is in whipping the butter. I whip the butter with an electric mixer for at least 15-20 minutes before adding anything else. The flour should be added at the end in batches stirring well between each addition.
I like to add Xmas sprinkles on top before baking - they do have to be pressed into dough otherwise they just fall off.

I'm not a huge shortbread fan, but thought I'd give these a try these on my friend who really loves shortbread... I did make a few changes (which I don't normally do)... they were: 1 tsp almond extract, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 T packed brown sugar.  I think that really cut out the "powder" like consistency a lot of people get with these cookies.  I also lowered the temp to 350 and they baked for only 12 min... PERFECT! These DO melt in your mouth and they are excellent!!!  I will be making these a lot in the future!

Yum!  Used my small cookie scoop, which sized them perfectly!  Baked on parchment paper lined pan at 350* for 13 minutes = perfect in our oven.  Just until the bottom edges started to brown.  Did half plain and half with almond (1/2t for half the batter) and the almond ones were our favorite!  So good!  And I followed many reviewers suggestion to whip the butter for a long time.  Many recommended 15 minutes; I probably did 5-8 minutes.  I didn't tell my husband what these cookies were.  I just gave him one.  His reply?  "Mmmm...they melt in your mouth!"  ;-)

I make these to sell at our local Christmas market and they are a huge hit. Be sure not to overcook them as they can turn a little dry.

These cookies are very good, and sure do melt in your mouth, literally! I don't think my oven runs hot, but I only baked these for about 10 minutes before the edges started to get really golden brown. Another slight problem I had was they really spread, which I wasn't expecting. Next time I will chill the batter, maybe that will make a difference. I used a pastry bag with a large star tip to pipe small circular cookies and placed halves of well drained maraschino cherries in the center, and sprinkled colored sugar around the edges. They did turn out really pretty, but it took me a few tries to get the size just right because of the spreading. Also, I found them a bit difficult to store. I placed these in tins for the holidays, and when I went to make up my trays, I couldn't even pick them up, they just about crumbled. They are very delicate. All in all, they are delicious cookies and I will try these again. This was my first time making shortbread, so I'm sure some of these problems I had encountered was because of that. Thank you for the recipe :)

the key with this is in the mixing..whip up the butter for at least 15 mins before adding the sugar, then whip it up again for at least 15 mins. then add the cornstarch and whip it up again...the result is definately going to melt in your mouth!

If you wrap the dough around a chocolate kiss before baking, it makes them almost heavenly.. I will bake batches of these at Christmas time because they also freeze very well..

These were so simple to make and very yummy! I got exactly 24 cookies out of the recipe. I baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, and I whipped the butter for 10 minutes in my KitchenAid. The dough felt so airy and light before baking. For decorating, I used a simple glaze and multicolored sprinkles. To make the glaze: Mix 1.5 cups powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon softened butter, 1 tablespoon light corn syrup, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (or almond) extract, and food coloring if desired. Once powdered sugar is moistened, mix on medium speed until glaze reaches desired consistency. Add more water, if needed.

Little cookie update... I took my first batch of these babies to work and not only was I pressured into surrendering the recipe, but I even got a marriage proposal! If that's not the sign of a fantastic cookie, I donno what is!! 5 HUGE stars!

Great recipe - but best when used as a base, and other ingredients are added for extra flavor. I've tried adding 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup crushed Skor bits, which was yummy. I've also tried adding almond extract and slivered almonds, which was great too. These cookies always disappear within a day of making them.

I've been using this shortbread recipe for years, and I've noticed a few things.  1. if your shortbread is crumbling too much, try whipping your butter less next time. 2. your shortbread will crumble more if you add vanilla or salt.  3. for an interesting twist, try substituting some brown sugar for some of the icing sugar. it adds kind of a caramel twist.  4. the cookie dough is fabulous in ice cream because there aren't any eggs in it!

Oh my goodness!!!  I never comment on recipes, but I HAD to comment on this one!  I just made a batch and am watching my husband inhale his fifth cookie!  They really do melt in your mouth!  We LOVE them!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I will probably be making another batch in the morning since I don't think there will be any left from tonight (and my batch made 24)!!!
Oh, I forgot - I did reduce the cornstarch to 1/4 TEASPOON - simply because I didn't have enough in my pantry . . . worked GREAT!

These were Excellent. I did increase the confectioner's sugar by a couple tablespoons as I wanted a little sweeter cookie. Baked at 350 for ten minutes in my oven. Word of warning for those who (like me!) haven't made shortbread cookies before, even though there is no baking powder or soda in these, no leavening at all, they will Still puff up and out on the cookie sheet so don't put them too close together, I learned the hard way =). These really are great though, not too sweet, melt away completely in your mouth. They are much better once cooled than warm out of the oven imo. Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

This was fantastic cookie --- looks pretty & melt-in-mouth goodness as advertised.  Followed tips of others... let mixer run for 15 min when whipping butter & added 2 tsp almond extract to mix.  I piped on to cookie sheet with pastry large tip & pressed 1/4 maraschino cherry in middle before baking.  Brought to cookie exchange & used camera phone for quick picture on recipe card ...included on web site.  Got to try it!

I make a recipe very similar to this with 3/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup icing sugar, 1/2 cup cornstarch, and 1 cup flour.  Very easy to make and roll out or form into cookies.  Chilling the dough always makes things easier!

Wow, these really do melt in your mouth! I added an extra 1/8 cup of sugar and a tsp. of vanilla extract. I whipped the butter first in the stand mixer for about 20 minutes and then added the other ingredients and mixed for another 10. Baked at 325 for 12 minutes. On some of them, I thumb-printed and added a bit of jam to the indentation before cooking--those were my favorite. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I usually double this recipe and freeze them.  They taste best right out of the freezer, and so convenient when company comes.  I add 1 1/4 tsp vanilla to a doubled recipe.  The big difference is cooking temperature and time:  Bake at 275 degrees for 35-40 minutes until golden.

This is almost exactly the recipe my mom passed on to me.  The only difference...garnish with a maraschino cherry sliver then and bake at 300 for 20 minutes.  It's really important to use room temperature butter and to whip them until the batter is icing consistency!  It feels like it takes forever for the dough to whip light and fluffy, but it eventually does, and then they really do melt in your mouth.   I use the small pampered chef cookie scoop and can get 3 doz out of a recipe as long as I whip it long enough.

OMG! I just died and went to heaven! I followed the recipe exactly, except had the oven on 350, leaving them in the oven just 10 minutes.  I only whipped my butter for 10 minutes with a hand mixer.  I also added chopped pecans because I wanted to get rid of them.  I tossed one cookie in confectioner's sugar and tried it.  It tasted almost exactly like Archway's "Cashew Nougat" holiday cookies, only mine had pecans.  This recipe is exactly what I have been looking for since you can't buy those holiday cookies anytime of the year.  This recipe is a keeper! Thanks so much Jennifer!

I've made this recipe a Yuletide tradition in my family.  Every year I make at least three batches, one plain and two lemon with a blackberry jam thumb print.  Just add a 1/2 tsp lemon zest and a few drops of lemon extract to make the best lemon shortbread ever!  I'm in the process of trying to convert this recipe to brown sugar.  I'll submit both the lemon blackberry and brown sugar as separate recipes when I get a chance.

Added 1/4 tsp vanilla to recipe.  When warm out of the over, drizzled a glaze of 3 tbsp powdered sugar and 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice.  Great change from the chocolate overload during the holidays!

Wanted to try this recipe because I had never used an electric mixer on a shortbread recipe before.  With the first dozen, I plopped spoonfuls on the cookie sheet as per the instructions and they basically maintained their unattractive blob shape after baked.  On the second dozen, I used my hands to roll them into walnut-sized balls and gently pressed them into nicely shaped round cookies.  This made it easier to add sprinkles etc. before baking.  The flavour was not as sweet as my standard recipe, but was still pleasing.  I may choose to adjust the flour / sugar ratio next time.  The biggest advantage to this recipe over my old one is the ability to handle the dough and have it all stay together without crumbling and sticking to your hands.  I'd like to try rolling out the dough (perhaps after a bit of chilling) and use cookie cutter shapes for a more festive look.  NOTE:  I adjusting the cooking time significantly.  8-10 mins at 375 deg. worked for me.  My oven is new and of course cooking times should be adjusted according to personal preference.  12-15 mins would have burned them.  In summary, remember whatever size/shape you choose to place them on the sheet, is basically how they're gonna look after baking and watch the cooking time closely...oh and yes they melt in your mouth as I believe a shortbread cookie should!

This is a truly spectacular cookie recipe! Light and airy, it lives up to  its "melt-in-your-mouth" title! I just made some tonight, actually to use for thumbprint cookies, and I had to test it both ways. Without the jam, these cookies would be outstanding with tea, since they're fluffy, buttery and just sweet enough to  offset my favorite earl grey... With jam, they make for an extraordinary thumbprint (hint: put the jam in before you bake the cookie, not during or after - makes for a more integrated, non-messy, non-runny jam spot). I added half a cup more confectioners sugar, and an eight of a cup less flour, but I think it would work out fine without those additions and subtractions. I can't recommend this simple, wonderful recipe enough!

I've used this recipe for years, I forget where I found it. I'm so happy to find it on here!! My favotite way to have thenm is with 1 tsp each o vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves. Then ice them with a sugar cookie icing recipe....sooooo good. And you can pretty much put in anything you want and suit them to your taste....I'm going to try lemon soon...yummy. These are foolproof. :)

A real winner. I sifted all the ingredients (minus butter) and used a cookie press to place them on the baking trays. A great shortbread. I really enjoyed the subtle amount of sweetness and texture.

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm no baker, but these turned out pretty darn good!  I added a tsp. of vanilla extract to the dough, and mixed the butter for a full 20 minutes before adding the additional ingredients.  I also refrigerated the dough for about 10 minutes to make it easier to work with when adding it to the cookie sheet.  I put them on a sheet with foil and lightly sprayed it so they wouldn't crumble when taking them off.  I garnished the second batch with some tiny red sprinkles... mmmmm mmmmm!!!!!  These tasted great the following day and were still pretty soft :)

I use this recipe, however I substitute Imperial Margarine for the butter and use a small baby spoon to make an indentation in the center of the uncooked cookie. I then add grape (or any other kind) of jelly in that spot. They turn out really flavorful and delicious! Also with any extra dough I roll it in crushed pecans before baking and then dust it with confectioner's sugar after they have cooled.

I tried this recipe on Saturday 2/13/10.  They are a melt in your mouth cookie. but to much taste of confectioner's sugar and cornstarch.  Followed recipe again but used 1 pkg of cream cheese that made them taste 100% better. I recommend trying it with cream cheese. The size of the cookie stays and does not spread out on cookie sheet as the original recipe does.

I love this dough because it is so versatile.  I chose to add a little almond extract (just because I love it so much).  Then I rolled the dough into balls, rolled 1/2 in Valentine's sprinkles and placed a cherry in the middle.  The other 1/2 I rolled in colored sprinkles, baked, and then put a Hershey Kiss in the center.  I will admit the Kiss cookies would have been better without the almond.  There are so many possibilities, especially for holidays.

This recipe comes pretty close to Shortbread, but the traditional one is made with 1lb Butter, 2 Cups Sugar, and 4 Cups Flour.  I also make my Shortbread Jennifer's way but my recipe is a little different.

This is a very easy and quick recipe to make when you are in a hurry.  The cookies are pretty good.  Next time will add some vanilla extract for more flavor and when making them for a holiday sprinkle them with colored sprinkles.   Other than that they are good.

These really DO melt in your mouth. I hardly had to chew, lol! I followed the recipe but baked at 350F for 9 minutes. I rolled into little balls and flattened with a fork dipped in confectioners sugar (to prevent sticking) and pressed 1/2 a glazed cherry in the middle. I also used parchment paper for easy clean up. I tried follow someone's suggestion of using a piping bag, but the cookie dough was WAY to thick to pipe so my wrist was all shaky. Anyway, this recipe makes GREAT shortbread cookies!

This is the best shortbread recipe I have ever used.  These are total melt-in-your mouth cookies and so simple to make. They are fool proof.
I omit the cornstarch; only because the first time I made these I didnt have cornstarch. And now that I know how well they turn out without it, I've never bothered to use it.
Tips: beat the butter and sugar together for at least 2 or 3 minutes. The same again when you add the flour. 

These are THE favourite at our house!

Tried this yesterday and...I'm still looking for that perfect shortbread for my kiwi friend.  I beat the heck out of the butter and the batter.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla and cooked at 350 for 13 minutes.  Some I sprinkled chocolate shot on top and some I topped with Heath bits.  They were ok but still tasted pretty floury to me.  I think I'll switch up next time - using less flour and more powdered sugar.

I'll be using this shortbread recipe every year.  The dough was so easy to work with, delicious! The cookies didn't crack and were NOT dry tasting. I used rice flour instead of cornstarch, i had it on hand. I added 1 tsp of vanilla for extra flavor.  It did the trick.  Great recipe!

These were a hit so far this season - had to make two more batches.  Used hand beaters for 7 minutes to beat the butter (unsalted - for a purer taste) - and I omitted about 3 tbsp of flour (used organic unbleached white).  Found using a piping bag a quick and impressive way to shape these cookies (340 degrees and for 9 minutes) - sprinkled with icing sugar when cooled.  They are delicate - immediately after coming out of the oven I slipped the parchment on which they were baked, to my counter and didn't touch them until cool.  Great recipe.

YUMMMM. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the butter and whipped for 20 minutes. After adding the remaining ingredients I whipped for 15 more minutes. I piped quarter size circles on parchment paper and convection baked at 350 for exactly 8 minutes. Cool on cookie sheet, then remove. PERFECT!!!

I might go so far as to call these heavenly! It's true, they melt in your mouth.  I followed the advice of others and creamed the butter alone for 10 minutes, and then after adding the other ingredients, beat the whole mixture for several minutes more.  I also added about 2 tsp almond flavoring  after adding the powdered sugar (this is a good time to taste the mixture to see if it's where you want it).  I used an OXO dough baller to shape the cookies, and they didnt't spread much. Great alone, or with  a thumbprint filled with preserves or a Hershey's kiss.  They look like velvet when they come out of the oven!

These were really good, definitely melt in your mouth.  When they were done, I iced them with 1/4 cup browned butter, 1 tblsp. of vanilla, 3 tblsp. of milk, then stir in powdered sugar to make a thick glaze.  I sprinkled green and red sugars on them.  The browned butter glaze was really complimentary to the cookie!

Easy cookie to make.  Added squares of dark chocolate and/or hazelnuts to top of shortbread.  They were a melt in your mouth cookie.

These cookies tasted good, the problem was no matter how long or what temp I cook them at, they still crumble completely when I try to remove them from the sheet. I even let them cool completely.

They do melt in your mouth. Kind of. They crumble in your mouth. It's like... sand that tastes good.

It's not Christmas without these cookies at my house.  Delicate and perfect.  I use a cookie press to make pretty shapes and they make wonderful gifts (you just have to pack them so they don't break). I do use a hint of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.

DELICIOUS.  ONCE THE SHORTBREAD COOKIES HAVE COOLED, I ICE THEM WITH FRENCH VANILLA CAKE ICING (BETTY CROCKER OR DUNCAN HINES) AND ADD A PIECE OF GREEN OR RED MARASCHINO CHERRIE IN THE CENTER OF THE ICING.  TASTES AND LOOKS GREAT.

Melt-in-your-mouth is NO LIE!  Let cool completely, because, as previously stated, they do crumble.  I added finely chopped pecans for a sort of "pecan sandie" taste.  They work well for a cookie press, but aren't as stiff as traditional shortbread.  All-in-all...excellent cookie - very rich, but not overly sweet.

wow... very good recipe. I was impressed. I had no problems at all with the recipe... (although I had a little trouble keeping some of the cookies together when I took them off the cookie sheet... but I think its just because I was impatient, next time I'll let them cool a little longer first)  I would definitatily recommend this recipe!

What a simple and delicious recipe.  You do have to be very careful with them because it is easy to burn them.  I burnt about half of them.  All of the ones I made using an Airbake cookie sheet turned out fine but regular cookie sheets made them extra crispy.  Very delicious though.

A simple and enjoyable cookie with a wonderfully fine texture and a slightly sweet, buttery flavor. More of a butter cookie than a shortbread, in my opinion, because the texture isn't at all coarse like traditional shortbread, and they're not quite as full-flavored. Regarding the ingredients and process behind these, I liked them more with an additional 1/4 cup of confectioner's sugar. Powdered sugar is more voluminous than granulated sugar, and 3/4 cup powdered is equivalent to 1/2 cup granulated by weight. I also found that the texture is best when the butter is whipped until nearly white and when the dough is beaten for at least 4 minutes--tough work with a hand mixer, but worth it. Additionally, if one desires to make the dough ahead, it is better to pipe or shape the dough on a cookie sheet and then refrigerate, rather than refrigerating the dough before shaping. The texture of the cookies was a bit heavier when the dough was refrigerated and then shaped and baked.

These cookies are decent plain, and probably make a nice companion for hot coffee or tea, but they are a touch plain. I made my second batch more interesting. I drizzled some with dark chocolate and dressed others with melted vanilla chips and jimmies, which created a cookie reminiscent of classic circus animal cookies. Overall, enjoyable cookies, a little forgettable on their own, but quite good with a bit of accessorizing.

I gave these a few days before rating. I usually make my Grandmothers recipe for Scotch shortbread, which uses regular sugar and no cornstarch. These crumbled very easily after a few days when eating them. My husband said they tasted powdery. I do believe you can detect that they are made with cornstarch, he didn't know and tasted it. All my family said they like my Grandmother's recipe better. So guess I'll stick to that one, not that this one is bad, it is okay, just hers isn't as dry.

So easy and delicious!  Make sure you beat 3-4 min until light and fluffy.  I added a carmel frosting once the cookies cooled and it was divine.  Received lots of compliments at holiday parties.

baked around 10 mins, and bottoms were already too dark. maybe lowering oven temp to 350 would help. weren't crumbly, and overall had a nice flavour. you might want to flatten them a bit.

These do melt in the mouth but they are a bit flavorless. I even added  vanilla extract, the double strength kind and it didn't give it much flavor. Some  cookies I sprinkled colored sugar on top,  others I added a mint M&M and some I left  plain.

This recipe is great! I added a little extra icing sugar, about 1/4 cup. But they truly do melt in your mouth and they are super easy to make. I will definatly make these again. I did however beat the mixture for about ten minutes so the it took on a whipped texture. The longer you beat the mixture the better!

Wow these cookies are amazing I have made quite a few recipes from this site and always read the reviews but have never written one. I just had to with these cookies, I took one of the reviewer's advice and beat the heck out of the butter. They are truly delicious!!! and don't even need any icing. My Husband loved them and he's very critical of new things that I try.

Was alright! I didn't expect it to be THAT met in your mouth!!! This is the closest thing you will ever get to melt-in-your-mouth,in my opinion.  I think if it had a little more of a substantial ing. it would be great!! And it was also too buttery.  Of of that i guess i would have to say it was only alright! ...But it sure does make a pretty picture! =)

I have been looking for a shortbread recipe that reminded me of my grandma's shortbread when I was growing up.  Well, I finally found it!  These cookies were so easy to make and they turned out amazing.  I love how they taste like butter - that was the taste I was after.  The only thing was that mine only took 8 minutes to brown, otherwise thank you for a great recipe!

Wow. These are amazing, and pretty easy to make. We sprinkled with colored sugars. Important to bake at 350, I think instead of 375, and you'll have to check often because they go from not done to done in a short period of time. How many minutes it takes depends on the pan, really. I used two different pans. In one pan it took 15, and the other it took only 10. Just keep an eye on those edges and take out as soon as they start to turn brown and you'll be fine.  Also, whip that butter a LONG time. I think I let it go maybe 15 minutes on high. Once I added the other ingredients I think I let it go on high about 5 minutes after the initial minute on low. Everyone loved them.

I was a little unsure of these cookies, thinking that they could use a little vanilla and salt. I still think that they do...next time I will put some in. I'm still giving these 5 starts though...they are incredible! The texture was awesome, they truly did melt in your mouth! My family loved these...they were honestly gone in minutes. To dress them up a little,  I mixed chocolate chips with some shortening, melted it up, and drizzled it over the cookies. I sprinkled them with little jimmies, and they looked great! The one problem I had with these, though, was trying to press it through the pastry bag as some reviewers did. The dough was really stiff, and they  didn't look all that great in the end. Next time, I will probably use a cookie press. Thanks for sharing...this one is a winner!!!!

These are quick, easy, and do melt in your mouth. Very impressed for such simple ingredients. After eating one that had just come out of the oven, I found they tasted better after they had been sitting out for a little while. I changed nothing about the recipe and used the same temp that it called for. I rolled them into small balls and baked for about 12 minutes. Topped with a little vanilla glaze just for fun..  Thanks Jennifer!

These are easy fab!  Added vanilla, rolled them into balls, flattened them with the bottom of a cup and put sprinkles and red glazed cherries.  Baked for 10 min at 350..melt in your mouth and were not crumbly!

These taste exactly like Melting Moments to me. They are very good though. I halved the recipe and added half a tsp of vanilla.

These cookies were quite good.  I added a small amount of both vanilla and almond extract to mine in fear that they would be tasteless if I did not.  I piped the cookies using a #32 large star tip into little rosettes to make smaller cookies, and sprinkled them with chopped chocolate covered almonds.  I baked them for 8 minutes until they were just barely brown on the edges.  Everybody seemed to love them and they vanished quite quickly.  I almost never eat/make shortbread, but if I do it again I'll be using this recipe.

THIS RECIPE IS EXCELLENT. I DIVIDED THE DOUGH IN HALF AND ADDED GREEN FOOD COLOURING TO IT.  HAVE TO WATCH CAREFULLY THOUGH, BAKED IN ABOUT 7 OR 8 MINUTES.

Yuck!  These cookies were so powdery.  They smelled like shortbread and looked like shortbread but I've never tasted shortbread like this.  Sure they melt in your mouth because they turn into powder.  I threw the whole batch in the garbage my husband wouldn't even eat them.

I found this recipe yesterday and made it last night. I was very excited to find a shortbread recipe that did not require rolling and cutting. These cookies are GREAT. I will be making more tonight for a cookie exchange this weekend. I have to take 10 dozen and this recipe allows me to do so with ease. Thank You.

I had to substitute the confectioners sugar by sending granulated sugar in my nutibullet and I completely forgot to whip the butter but you know what they still came out perfect! I also added some vanilla extract to taste. My room mates LOVE them and with how simple and cost effective they are to make these are great for those times you have a sweet tooth!

Good recipe, but took off one star because 375 is too hot, I used 350, also I had to add a bit more sugar than stated.  The method I used was as follows: Let butter soften to room temperature, then I whipped it for exactly 10 minutes with a hand-held electric mixer (whew!). I previous to this had sifted the dry ingredients together, then added the dry mix to the whipped butter in three stages, mixing and whipping for a minute or so in between.  The dough is very soft and a bit sticky so it took a bit of fiddling to spoon it out in to small blobs on the cookie sheets (I used parchment paper over shiny metal baking sheets). The size of the cookies I decided should be bit-sized, so no breaking. I used a tableware teaspoon to scoop.  I then pressed the blobs down lightly with a fork dipped in dry icing sugar (to avoid fork sticking). I decorated each cookie before baking with 1/4 pieces of red or green cherries (ones you get in a little tub in the baking isle). Everything turned out very well, and its true you must time things exactly to avoid the edges burning. I let the cookies cool 5 minutes before gently moving them off the baking sheet. Definitely these are melt in the mouth, and delicate, and not overly sweet. Cookies have a dusty yet fluffy mouth feel. The extra piece of sweetness, eg the candied cherries , or a tiny blob of sweet jam makes these cookies perfect.  Result tasted just like shortbread my gramma used to make (she also used cornstarch in her recipe).

I have been making this recipe for years.  Without telling anyone the name, almost everyone says they're "melt in your mouth".  My family can't wait until I make them each year.  And they freeze well.  I just made 15 dozen, hope they make it to Christmas....Heather

"Wow! These are actually really good." My friend and I saw the recipe and we had our doubts. We made them, and I have to admit they are to die for! I would recommend them to anyone who loves shortbread as much as I do! You wont be disappointed.

This recipe was super simple and easy to make.  The first time I made it, I made it almost exactly as the recipe stated with the only exception being that I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I thought it was a little too floury and not sweet enough.  I also used a cookie press, so my cookies were just overdone while I played with the cooking time.  The second time I made it, I whipped the butter even longer (about 20 minutes), I used only 1 1/4 cups of flour, used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, kept the vanilla, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I still used the cookie press and baked at 325 for 8-9 minutes.  They were perfect!!!!!

These are SOOOO good. I want to give it more stars. I added about 3 tbl of white sugar a few drops of lemon juice and 2 tbl finely grated lemon peel to the cookie dough. I topped the cooled cookies with homemade lemon buttercream frosting and they really did melt in your mouth. I already saved it. Next time, dutch cocoa! Mmm

These cookies are much more like MERINGUE than shortbread.  
[Not that they aren't good, but if you are expecting buttery shortbread, you may be dissapointed.  These turn out to be more like airy, crumbly meringue.]

I love these cookies!  The recipe didn't sound like much but for just a few ingredients these things are terrific.  I added walnuts on top of half of them and just dusted the rest with powdered sugar.  I prefer them with just the sugar.  The walnuts made them look prettier but did not enhance the taste.

Hands down the BEST shortbread cookies I've ever had! 
Only changes I made: Added 1/2 tsp almond extract, whipped the butter until it was pure white (several minutes), used the cookie dough scooper, & baked at 350 for about 13-15 minutes.

I was sceptical of these cookies but they were easy and really delicious. No need to whip the butter forever just follow the directions for prefect cookies, mine were crumbly when i was finished mixing but actually cooked up great, i give a 5 because they are so easy to make with only 4 ingredients, and the cook time was fast as well i followed someone elses recommendation of 350 for 10 min, i also used whole wheat flour-delicious! they really do melt in your mouth!

I only chose to make these cookies after reading so many rave reviews (as with most things on this website). I took the advice of other reviewers and whipped the butter for a good long time before adding anything else. I added a teensy extra bit of sugar as well and beat that in for several minutes before adding the corn starch and flour. 

The cookies baked for approx. 8.5 minutes at 350 and came out looking pale. I allowed them to sit on the pan for about 10 minutes while I tidied my kitchen (I'm a messy cook you see) and then timidly tried one. DELICIOUS! They're buttery, melt-away perfect with just enough sweet. Thanks very much for a great recipe!

Delicious! These seem like gourmet cookies!  I let my butter whip for at least 10 minutes, then switched beaters and mixed in the rest.  I rolled the dough into 1-inch balls, flattened a bit, and sprinkled with sugar before baking. They were just golden after about 10 minutes at 350.  I didn't have any trouble with cracking on the sheets- I always bake on parchment, so that might have helped.  I melted some chocolate and made sandwiches with some of the cookies- the result is darn close to a Milano cookie! Yum!

These were amazingly tasty, totally not what I was expecting at all, but terribly fragile. The thicker they were piled onto the sheet, the better they came out. Don't move them AT ALL until they're completely cooled and keep them in small round shapes so you can get them up. They are not, however, traditional shortbread. I'll keep looking.

Perfect shortbread.  Not too sweet, but wonderfully buttery and crumbly.

I whipped these quite a long time per other reviews.  I added a little almond extract for flavor.  I did put the dough in a pasty bag with a large star tip - they look great...they taste pretty good.  I don't think that I would like them without the almond extract.  I might try to make these again and tweak the recipe to add more flavor.

I love this recipe and used a large star tip and made them about 1 1/4 inch round. Sprinkle with red or green crystal sugar before baking, then sprinkle with icing sugar after baking while they are still hot. Very yummy! When my father-in-law tasted them and asked if I had made these, he said, where have you been all my life!

Good recipe, I baked the cookies at 300 degrees for 20 minutes so they won't actually brown, and topped each one with a chunk of toblerone.  They were great.

These were simply wonderful and so easy! I was leery of a whipped shortbread. I'm of the 'cut the butter into the flour and handle lightly' school.  EDIT: I made some changes with the second batch. Perhaps this will help anyone with the same issues I have. I have a faulty gas oven with one rack that cooks everything on high. I inverted two bread pans under my baking sheet (it has to be a shiny baking sheet to avoid a fast burn). I checked it often, turning the baking sheet once. One reviewer's advice to take the cookies out before they're brown was helpful. I did just that. Confectioner's sugar is hard to come by here, so I just used fine sugar. This made the cookies crunchier, but still good. With my second batch, I added a little rum essence, making it somewhat different and still really tasty. Next time, I'll chill the cookies before baking to try to keep some shape. Our 90º+ weather isn't conducive to keeping a butter cookie's shape in any way.   Thanks for a super recipe!

These really melt in your mouth. I added almond extract and rolled them between parchment paper to about 1/4 inch and refrigerated them until firm and the top sheet  of parchment paper easily lifted off and then cut them out into shapes. Just beautiful.

These are simply the BEST shortbread cookies I have ever had!  I made half the batch with raspberry jam in the center and the rest I just rolled and flattend with the bottom of a cup. I dribbled melted white chocolate over all of them. These are so easy and delicious that I will make them for all my cooking swaps!  Thank you for sharing Ü

These are INCREDIBLE!  I'm used to a more dense shortbread cookie, but I love these.  At the advise of other reviewers, I set the oven to 350 degrees and it worked perfectly.  One of my new cookie favorites.

These really do melt in your mouth. I drizzled mine with icing to make them slightly sweet. I did have trouble with the bottoms browning up to much. Next time may lower oven temp to 350 degrees F. and/or try a different baking sheet.

This is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe before.  Never in my life have I ever made something so "melt-in-your-mouth" yummy, and I've been making shortbread since I was a little girl.  I didn't have any cornstarch, so I added almost an extra 1/4 cup flour (not quite, but close) and I also threw in about half a teaspoon of vanilla.  To die for!  These have been out of the oven about ten minutes and I can tell they'll be gone in another ten.  Thanks for sharing!

Three stars for ease of making and the lesser amount of ingredients.  Did not care for texture, taste or aftertaste.  Also, glad I read a few of the reviews, I would have baked these as the recipe states at 375* for 15 min. instead of 350* for 8 minutes.

These cookies are great!  I followed advice and whipped them in my KA.  I added a pinch of salt.  Baked at 350º on parchment covered baking pans til lightly brown around the edges.  My 6 yr old grandaughter iced them with buttercream frosting and topped with sugar sprinkles.  They were delicious!

I doubled the recipe, and whipped it to death in the mixer as a few people had recomended.  I found that baking at 375F was good for a maximum of 9 minutes in my oven. The edges were lightly browned, but not overbaked. (One reviewer had said 350F for 9 minutes was perfect, but that didn't work in my oven at all). I did half the batter according to the recipe, but for the second half I added a bit of vanilla, and I liked the next batches a bit better.  All in all, they are so melt-in-your-mouth, that there's no other way to describe them.  I waited for the cookies to cool COMPLETELY before removing them from the sheet, but I still experienced a lot of crumbling cookies nonetheless.  However, my kids were not unhappy being able to feast on the broken cookies and crumbs.  These really are exceptional.  Next time I will make them teeny little one-bite cookies with a marachino cherry for decoration, just as my gradmother did. Thanks for a great old recipe!!

I doubled the recipe, omitted the cherries, and added a few handful of toffee chips (skor bits) into the mix and they turned out great.  I might also try these with the cherries but then coated in chocolate for a 'chocolate covered cherry' theme.

My decorating tip is to make a thin glaze (powdered sugar, milk, and flavoring--almond, vanilla, or whatever) and food coloring.  I make red and green glaze at Christmas, and drizzle one color one way, and then drizzle the other color the other way.  For baby showers, try pink and blue.  For patriotic holidays, red, white and blue.  The possibilities are endless!

These are really melt in your mouth cookies. They are the perfect shortbread. If you like a sweeter cookie, you might want to sprinkle these with confectioners sugar as soon as you take them out of the oven.Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Melt-in-your-mouth is exactly what these cookies do when you bite into them.  They are wonderful and have gotten rave reviews everywhere I have taken them.  I did add 1/8 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp for vanilla to make them a little richer.  I also used raspberry preserves for my thumb print.  I did whip the butter for 10 minutes with my mixer to make it light and airy.  I think this really make the difference for the melty texture of the cookies.  These are to-die-for as well as melt-in-your-mouth. Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad at all~  I usually am not too good at making shortbread but I whipped these like crazy 350 in the oven 8 n' 3/4mins and they came out fine~  only thing is that it sounds real tasty with a little more sugar, almond extract & vanilla would have made them perfect.. Next time.. Thanks!

I never review recipes on this site, but this one I had to.  I have been trying dozens of shortbread recipes but none have turned out to my liking...until now!  These are fantastic!  I didn't change anything, except the baking time but that had nothing to do with the recipe.  
Many people have changed the temperature and baking time, or complained about the baking time, but keep in mind that how fast it bakes depends on your altitude.  Cookies, along with any recipe that contains moderate to high amounts of chocolate, tend to burn faster at a higher altitude.  I am at an elevation of 3500ft so mine were perfectly browned at 8 minutes, whereas this recipe is from Victoria which has an elevation of 75ft.

DELICIOUS!

I don't know who would not like these delicious cookies. This is the best shortbread I have ever tasted and they really do melt in your mouth. These cookies also taste good with a dot of melted chocolate on the top.

These really do melt in your mouth.  They were easy to make and didn't last very long in my house.  Next time, I think I will dip the tops in melted chocolate.

Yum! I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of lemon extract to give it a lemon flavor. Then added some yellow sprinkles to the tops. For a little extra flavor and interest, I melted a little almond bark, mixed in some more lemon extract and yellow food color, and dipped the bottoms of the cookies in it when they were cool. I set them on wax paper to dry and they came out very nice! A refreshing treat for summertime or any time!

I cut the recipe in half and added a few tablespoons of almond meal, then baked them at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes. I also drizzled the tops of the cookies with milk chocolate. Overall, the cookies are very tasty and are even better the day (or two) after. However they are a little "powdery."

Great recipe... I followed it exactly... after the cookies cooled I dipped them in chocolate almond bark and sprinkled some toffee bits, nut topping, and coconut... my family loved these and they looked so pretty on a plate... even without the chocolate and toppings it was delicious!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  Wow!  Melt in your mouth is right.  Added some Vanilla extract to mixture before baking, and as suggested by another user, 350 for 9-10 minutes worked perfect. Not one fell apart. First dozen, made as is, 2nd made the raspberry jam imprints and 3rd dz I added mini chocolate chips to the dough. Made a little almond glaze to top them all. Over 1/2 were gone by the end of the night!!  LOVE these cookies! Oh so light!

These were so delicious and easy to make. I shaped them like the bakery does,and I melted semi-sweet chocolate and dipped half of the cookie and kept them in the fridge.  Everyone loved them, they didn't last long

Pretty good.  The first batch will have to be tossed as I dropped them like the recipe stated.  Maybe it's because I'm unfamiliar with shortbread and thought they might spread out a little or maybe I'm just too exact at following recipes.

The second pan I flattened the balls and they came out delicious.  I should've read ALL the reviews and not just some of them.  Then perhaps I would've known to chill and cut the dough instead of just dropping it.

Made half a recipe just as written... These were definitely "melt in your mouth", but they had very little flavor!  You might want to add a little vanilla, almond, or peppermint extract to the dough.  These also crumbled to pieces at the slightest touch - and they were completely cooled.  Delicate but lacking something... Thanks though!

The flavour of this recipe is great - they do melt in your mouth - but I don't agree with the temp and time - I'd say 350 for less than 10 minutes, for rolled out and cut cookies anyway, and only 8 minutes for dropped cookies or ones made using a cookie press.  For rolled cookies, chilling the dough made all the difference, for the cookie press it can't be chilled though. Not sure the deal with having to let them cool on the sheet or else they crumble - I found they came off the sheet straight out of the oven and we could eat them right way, no crumbling whatsoever.  Perhaps this is due to whipping the butter for many minutes and taking about 10 minutes in total to add the flour mixture.  Also, I added some almond extract, as they needed just a hint of flavour.  Even without it though they are great.

These are absolutely excellent!  I agree that you should whip the butter for awhile, like some else said, I just turned my mixer on and left it running for about 10-15 minutes.  I also crushed up some toffee pieces and sprinkled them on top.  Heavenly!

LOVE IT! It literally does melt in your mouth! I whipped the butter at least 10 minutes before putting the rest of the ingredients in. Plus, i added a couple of tbsp of granulated sugar for a bit more sweetness. The dough may seem a bit too fluffy when raw, but the shortbread turns out perfect! LOVE IT!

I am not a shortbread fan and these turned out quite good. I followed the advice of another reviewer and whipped the butter for at least 10 minutes until it was white and fluffy. I was told this makes all the difference. These cookies definitely taste better as they age. This is my husband's favourite type of cookie but he said his mother's still taste better ... so I better get on the phone and see how her recipe is different :) I put the dough in an icing bag and used a large star tip to pipe it into a pretty shape. Also added small piece of red marashino cherry to top of each one for Christmas. Very attractive

I was real dissapointed in this one, especially because of the great reviews. The cookies didn't taste bad or anything they just didn't do anything for me, I even added almond extract like someone suggested. I probably won't make these again.

These were great cookies!  Everyone loved them!  Be sure to whip the butter for 20 minutes for a melt in your mouth cookie.  I add a little almond extract, nice addition.  Next time I might try someones recommendation for making them bars.

I only changed the way I put them on the cookie sheet. I made little balls and used a cookie cutter press to push the cookie flat and leave a little ginger bread boy in the center of cookie really cute.

These truly do melt in your mouth; however, they were a little bland for me. I guess I am used to a sweeter shortbread.  I also wish I had flattened them slightly. These were quick to make. There is no way that these can be given away - or travel -  as they break apart very easily.

For those of you who find the cookies crumble too easily, try compressing,using lots of pressure, the dough VERY firmly into the pan, eliminating any air holes.

this is the an awesome recipe for shortbread cookies.  I didn't have any cornstarch, so I used all flour and they were still delicious!  I put the dough in the fridge for an hour or more so it would be easier to work with then frosted them with "butter icing for cookies" (found on this site).  They were superb!

This was my first shortbread baking experience and I am going to stick with this recipe!  

Here are a few of the modifications that I made: (1) I only beat the batter for about 2 minutes on high (2) I found that 12 minutes was perfect for the light browning on the edges (3)I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter before beating.  Definately let the cookies cool well before removing.

These are the best cookies ever! They really do melt in your mouth! Just be careful on the cooking time and the sheet pan that you use. If it's a really worn in one like the one i used you only need to bake these for about 8-9 minutes. I sprinkled some green and red sugars on the first batch. Now i am off to bake a second batch because i know that these are going to be a big hit! They are really great! Thanks for the great recipe! You'd be a fool not to try these! Simple and GREAT!!!

Talk about EASY to make!  I made a batch of these and my husband couldn't stop eating them.  The rest, I brought to work and they were consumed with gusto in no time at all.  Several wanted the recipe for these delicious shortbread cookies, and they are indeed, melt-in-your mouth texture.

I had never made Shortbread cookies before and these seemed too easy. I figured they'd never come out right. Boy was I wrong. They are sooo good. They remind me of Shortbread cookies I used to sell as a child - but much more moist and tasty. I will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe Jennifer!  Lisa

Incredible shortbread!  Wow!  I added chopped pecans to one batch and sliced almonds to another, for a nice touch.  The only thing is that 12 minutes in the oven is too long - the cookies got too brown.  I recommend 10 minutes for perfect cookies.  Thanks for submitting this recipe, Jennifer!

The changes I made were to whip non-salted butter for 4 to 5 minutes before adding the other ingredients, use parchment paper on the cookie sheets and cook for 10 minutes. I have been trying to make really good shortbread for years and this is the first time I have succeeded.  Truly a wonderful recipe Jennifer, Thank you for sharing!

Make these for Christmas cookie boxes. Followed other reviewers advice on whipping the butter for a extended period of time. Whipped for about 20 minutes, then added the other ingredients and continued whipping for a bit longer. The cookies were absolutely phenomenal! So light and delicate. The friends I gave the cookies to raved about them! Planning on making another batch just for me and the husband.

I have never reviewed a recipe before on here.  However, I am amazed that I stumbled upon this.  I noticed in some of the reviews that some people used a piping bag or a cookie press.  I have a cookie press that was given to me by my Mom, that I have NEVER been able to press more than 1 or 2 cookies without the dough messing up.  I was messing around so decided to try it out...PERFECT pressed cookies.  I did not have butter but did have Country Crock sticks, and only had self rising flour & added 1/4 tsp vanilla.  Will use this lots.  THANK YOU!!

I give it 5 stars though I didn't try it strictly as written - I wanted more stuff in there so I added mini chocolate chips, a pinch of salt, and vanilla.  Turned out fabulously!  I will be making a second batch so I can share with friends and family.

THE SEARCH FOR THE BEST SHORTBREAD HAS ENDED!! this recipe is incredible, I've made it a few times and my family can't get enough. you can either make them as drop cookies or roll them into balls and flatten them with a glass. the secret is to whip the dough into oblivion. when you think it's done, whip it more. you want it to look like whipped cream before you start working with it.

Yum! I made these exactly as directed, only I doubled it (it only makes like 2 dozen cookies per batch), and I chilled the dough in the fridge for several hours before. I think this way it helped them keep more of a ball shape (which I wanted). Also, I baked these in 1-inch balls for about 12' at 350, until the edges were JUST starting to brown. I put red and green sprinkles on them for Christmas, but I think other modifications that other reviews suggest sound yummy as well. 

I've made these twice now, and I found that the more I whip the butter, the more "melt-in-your-mouth" they are. Thanks for this recipe, I never thought I would be able to make a cookie like this so easily!

Also, these are way better the next few days after they cool and harden a bit. I didn't have any problems with them being too crumbly (although they are a bit fragile - I think the ball shape helps).

WOW! They really does melt in your mouth!  I used a pastry bag and made little bite size cookies, any larger I think they would fall apart after the first bite.  Instead of icing I sifted powdered sugar over these and it made them even more melty.  Like others have said, you MUST cream the butter for 5+ minutes, it makes them light & fluffy.  Next time I will try vanilla sugar in the mix, or put a dollop of jam on them before baking. It will be in my Christmas Cookies plates from now on!

OMG I'm addicted! These cookies are absolutely wonderful. I read all the comments and took notes. Beating the butter to death seems to be the key. I also added about 1/4 more powders sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon. Delish! Thank you for making it so easy to be a good cook.

Perfect with no changes. I whipped the butter for 10 min, mixed in the rest of the ingredients for 4 minutes and was able to pipe them (be ready to squeeze!) with a very large Wilton 6B tip. Tinted them green and put on a dot of white chocolate to hold a french dragee. They looked adorable, perfect for a cookie exchange, super easy, yet they added such pretty touch to the tray!
I baked them 5 min, turned the tray added 2 minutes more and done!
Fabulous!

My Oh My! This recipe is definitely melt in your mouth good. I made the recipe exactly as written except I was about 1 1/2 Tbsp short on cornstarch, so I added an extra 1 1/2 Tbsp confectioners sugar.  I did take advice from other reviewers and whipped the butter for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients, then whipped everything together for another 10 minutes. My husband who is NOT a cookie, dessert kind of guy ate 2 of these as soon as they were cool enough for me to give them to him. I was making a quick dinner as these baked and before I could get dinner done he was sneaking 2 more. The next morning when I asked if he was ready for breakfast, he said I'll take 5 of those cookies please. Definitely a keeper.

great whipped shortbread. they are truly melt in your mouth. As another reviewer states though, beat the tar out of your butter first ( at least 20 Minutes). Will be making these every Christmas.

I just tried these, and they certainly hold up to their promise of melting in your mouth! That said, I would only recommend this recipe to people who aren't very big on sweets, as they are very bland in flavor. I even added some vanilla extract to mine and I still wasn't satisfied with the flavor. Perhaps that's something that comes with the territory of shortbread, though - I honestly wouldn't know, as this is the first shortbread I've tried. If you want a sweeter cookie, I suggest either looking elsewhere, or adding frosting or dipping them in chocolate. The recipe is VERY easy, and I was very pleased with how few ingredients it required. Overall, it's a good recipe, but it really depends on how sweet you do or don't like your cookies!

These are tasty little jewels. I added a little vanilla extract  because I like the vanilla flavor. Also I rolled some into balls, made a thumb indent and filled with lemon curd before baking. Yum! Next time I need to double the recipe and share with the neighbors. Thank you for sharing this quick and easy recipe.

As so many others have stated, these truly do melt in your mouth!  It is like eating a cloud (not that I have ever done that, but you know what I mean :)).  As written, these are a lovely, not-too-sweet treat to enjoy with one's coffee or tea (or hot chocolate?  Mmmm!).  I baked them on my Sil-Pat until the edges were just brown, then removed them from the oven and let sit on the cookie sheet for about 10 minutes.  I had no problems with them crumbling apart this way.  I can only imagine the possibilities of various flavor combinations are endless.  I made them as is, as I need the crumbs to use in a crust for another recipe.  I think this recipe is going to be just perfect for that purpose, but I will make again and play around with flavors.  Thanks for sharing Jennifer Wilton :)

This recipe is just what I was looking for - a cookie that would hold up to dipping in chocolate, sanwiched with jelly, etc. - like the cookies you get in a bakery or deli. I used my cookie press to make these. SUPER short, light and not sweet at all. Plain, they are a little bland, I admit, but good with a cup of tea or coffee. 

I will be making these for my cookie selection this Christmas and I will update accordingly!

Wow. That's all I have to say. I've been struggling for a while now to get the right shortbread recipe and this one...blew me away. Amazing! Just like the perfect shortbread you would buy at a good bakery. Will definitely be using this one again. The only minor thing I changed was to add just a touch of vanilla extract, otherwise everything was left as is. Yum!

I prepared this recipe exactly as written and, when I looked in the oven door not even two minutes after placing the filled ungreased cookie sheet in the oven, I saw a sea of a melted butter mix - not the spoonfuls of cookie dough I had put in the oven.  Thinking I had somehow done something wrong in the mixing, I made another batch with the same results.  This recipe apparently has an ingredient left out.  What a waste of ingredents!  Please check into this problem.

These are delicious!  Melt in your mouth is right on.  They do get rather crumbly the next day, so these are best to eat the day they are made.

OUTSTANDING!  They do melt in your mouth.  I used the 375 temp for 13 minutes and they were perfect.....all ovens are different so if yours does not turn out the perfect shortbread the first time, try it again.  These are great and EASY!!

I generally don't like shortbread because of its too-dense consistency, but these were as soft as promised.  I served them with a dollop of whipped cream and slices of strawberry and kiwi on top. Light, fresh, and just the right amount of sweet! Next time I cook them I'll be more careful about shaping the tops; I expected them to settle and spread in the oven but they retained their exact shapes as dropped onto the cookie sheet. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jennifer; it's a keeper!

These were really good.  They are your typical shortbread, a little dry but that's what they are!!  I wish they were just a tad creamier but still good!!  My mother in law and hubby inhaled them.

I whipped the butter for about 10 minutes in the kitchen aid mixer before adding the other ingredients, and this turned out to be the best shortbread I have ever made. I doubled the recipe and EVERYONE wanted to take some home from the party! I sprinkled the tops with red and green coloured sugar, which added just the right touch. Amazing recipe and highly recommended.

This is the best shortbread I've ever made. I baked it for 10 minutes at 350 though, which made them much less likely to burn.

mmmm backing the cookies as i speak, the cookies just got out of the oven. I must say they are fabulous!They are the perfect cookie if you love butter because they are ALL butter! Make sure though that you watch the edges because they burn rapidly and also make sure you dont whip the butter too long because it becomes hard. Happy Baking!

These were pretty good! I usually like a traditional shortbread, but I have to say I do like this recipe. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and whipped the heck out of the butter. I tried to pipe the dough, but for some reason it was way too thick and didn't work. I ended up making little balls and pressing them down a bit on the baking sheet. They turned out great!

These are the best shortbread cookies I have ever tasted.  I was a bit weary of the recipe after I mixed all the ingredients just because the dough was so sticky but they turned out great.  I cooked them at 340 for 8-9 minutes, let them cool and then drizzled vanilla frosting on them with red candies for Christmas.

The reviews don't lie! This recipe is fantastic! Wish I'd doubled it to make more. I followed most of the recommendations and beat the butter for 15 mins, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Baked for 10-12 mins also. 15 mins would have made then way too brown for my oven, but all ovens vary so just keep an eye on them. Definitely will become my go to shortbread recipe for the holidays! Thanks so much!!!!

Best Shortbread cookies.  These really do melt in your mouth.  If there are any diabetics in your family, we substituted the sugar with Splenda and they are amazing.

I just finished making this recipe last night and I have to admit that I found it less than satisfying.  This recipe is definitely quick and easy but I didn't find that the cookies actually tasted good.  I think next time I will skip "fast and easy" when it comes to shortbread.  Sorry!

These turned out really good - I rolled them out to make "mid-winter Christmas" cookies.  They weren't too horrible to roll out, obviously not as easy as an actual roll out cookie recipe.  I think these would be even more divine thicker, like in the photo.  I also think they could benefit from some vanilla extract or some sort of flavoring.  Thanks for the recipe Jennifer, it's a keeper!

So fabulous and EASY! We did a ton of these for our holiday cookie trays. We drizzled some with chocolate, and pressed cherries into some of them before cooking as well. They're very delicate, but definitely melt in your mouth.

For a while I have been searching for the perfect shortbread recipe. I thought this might be the one due to the rave reviews. The first batch was crumbly to the point they could not even be picked up for transfer. I followed one reviewer's advice to bake for a minute or two longer. Unfortunately, this did not work either. The cookies were just as crumbly as the first. The taste was okay but the texture was not.  Í suggest if you are going to try this recipe that you make the cookies very small as one reader suggested and maybe less cornstarch which is what I think gives it the crumbly lighter than air texture. three stars because because feel the site may have altered recipe. I will continue my search...

Very easy and turned out awesome. They are even more amazing the next day if you can hide a few. I used a cookie press to make clovers for St. Patrick's Day. As others, I beat the mess out of the butter till it was white. And I doubled the recipe with no problems.

These are melt in the mouth, yes. But they are not shortbread.  Shortbread should have a supremely buttery taste - that taste was lost in the dough here.  i salvaged them by flavoring the glaze a little but if you are looking for a quick shortbread, this is not it.

they did just as the name implied, melted in your mouth, although they didn't have much flavor on their own. i used a large star tip to pipe rosettes, and then dipped half in milk chocolate once the cookies were cooled. they were beautiful and delicious for christmas.

Oh my, are these good.  And really easy to make. I didn't change a thing and these cookies turned out JUST the way I wanted.  If using a convection oven, cut the time down to about 7-8 minutes   SO good.  Thanks for sharing

I made these to go in gift bags for Christmas along with the Candy Apple jelly from Allrecipes. These were super easy and tasted yummy.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Really thought I'd love these, but they kinda left a funny taste in my mouth after eating them.  They are melt in your mouth, maybe too much.  I beat the butter for 7-8 minutes and added 1 Tbs of vanilla - maybe too much vanilla was the taste problem?

I gave 4 stars because I needed to use the reviewers tweaks to make this a wonderful, 5 star recipe.  My additions: 2T. confec. sugar, 1/2 t. each salt and vanilla, and sprinkled with a little colored sugar before baking.  And they are even better the next day.  Very Yummy!

This are very easy to make, but I found it was really lacking something.  I should have thought to add some type of flavoring in, but even after icing the cookies or filling them with jam, my kids/husband weren't that impressed.  Not my favorite shortbread recipe.

THESE ARE VERY GOOD COOKIES AND EASY TO MAKE. HOWEVER I WISH THE RECIPE FOR THE ICING IN THE PHOTO WAS INCLUDED. THE COOKIES ARE NOT AS SWEET AS SOME AND I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH THE ICING. THEY DO ACTUALLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH .

I like shortbread, so I thought they were okay, but kinda bland. I think next time I might add some almond or vanilla extract. I made my own simple frosting and drizzled it over and sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. My husband definitely did not like them!! He said it was like eating dust!

I'm not one to like really sweet cookies but these fall too short of what's good about shortbread cookies. They are very tender, though.  Probably needs at least double the amount of sugar stated. Will keep looking for the right recipe.

There are pretty incredible. I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the recipe, the salt helps bring the flavors together and makes a very big difference.

This is my first time making shortbeards. This recipe is wonderful, simple and melt in the taste so good. Can't wait to let my husband taste them tomoorow. All review says you've gotta wait for a day to taste better. The recipe says it makes 24. I used the same amount but it only makes 15 regular sized ones. Will double the amount next time. Also I agree 350 degree is better than 375.

5 these can also be cut-outs, just chill dough for 1 hour, then roll out 1/4 inch thick and cut with your favorite cookies cutters. Margarine can also be subbed for butter with no noticeable difference in taste

Following the recipe, don't eat these hot. Allow them to cool. Your taste-buds will thank you. It just doesn't taste right hot. The recipe is perfect as is. If you choose to do cut-outs, adjust heat to 350F and time to 9 mins. I found some perfect cutters about 1 1/2" x 1 1/2". Don't use anything too intricate ('cause the angel heads fall off, lol) or too big. Keep them between 1/4" - 1/2" thick; closer to 1/4". Thicker and they don't cook through; thinner and they burn. I wanted to make them a pinch sweeter so I pressed them into a plate of colored, granulated sprinkles. They look good and taste good. I accidentally dropped one into a cup of tea and it was still crisp when I pulled it out. lol... Perfect!

I do not leave alot of comments on recipes but this one deserved one. I fallowed the suggestions of others and added a dash of salt and about a tablespoon of vanilla and topped my cookies off with mini peanut butter cups and they were amazing. I have to admit that right out of the oven they are not so tasty but I made them in the morning and by the evening they tasted sooo much better. I will make these again soon:)

These were the lightest shortbread ever!  I added about a  TBS of vanilla, rolled them into balls, patted them down and thumb printed them.  Filled them with strawberry preserves after they cooled.  Fantastic!

I am really disappointed in this recipe, especially after the rave reviews.  Even though they do melt in your mouth, they don't taste good at all. I know shortbread are a bland cookie, but this tasted like ever so slightly sweet flour.  :(

I usually like shortbread, and I like lots of butter cookies.  But I couldn't stand this.  In fact I can't believe it got such great reviews.  These taste just like pats of butter lightly (and I mean LIGHTLY) dusted with sugar.  Bet those would melt in your mouth too, but I won't be making them any time soon.

OMG!!!!!  I have never EVER had a shortbread cookie like this.  After reading the reviews I just had to try it but needless to say I am terribly disappointed.  I'm convinced all the reviews came from the same user with different profiles.

Deliciously delicate and different than the traditional harder, denser shortbread.  The more flour you add to this recipe (say if you scoop flour into the measuring cup, instead of lightly spooning it in and leveling it,) the firmer the result would be.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, then very lightly rolled the dough into one-inch balls, coated each very lightly with granulated sugar, flattened each ball lightly to about one-third of an inch and baked.  I received more compliments on these plain, straightforward cookies than other more complicated offerings. Excellent butter is also a must for the flavor.  Will make these from now on.

This recipie is simple and DELICIOUS!!! my 2 year old and I bake all the time and we had a lot of fun with this recipie because it is an easy dough to work with...we made green hearts and dinosaurs and we put chocolate "rocks" in the center, and hershey's kissables...The cookie really does melt in your mouth! I see a new favorite in my house and a new cookie recipie for holiday gifts!! I made the recipie EXACTLY as it reads, and I can't think of any way to improve it but I do see experimenting in the future with adding different flavors like maybe almond extract or nuts of some kind. Thanks for a GREAT recipie.

Followed the recipe exactly except I added 1/2t of vanilla and 1/2t salt because my butter was unsalted.  I whipped the butter for a long time and they seemed good going in the oven.  I love the taste of them, but almost all of them broke in half!  I waited for them to cool on the sheets as recommended by other reviewers, but mine still fell apart.  :(  I also tried dipping them in chocolate which tasted great, but they weren't strong enough for it.  Probably won't make them again.  Very light airy taste - just wish they would hold together better!

Mmmmmm. These are yummy cookies they so remind me of "grandma's shortbread cookies" They are definitly "pretty" with a blueberry, cherry or something in the middle before baked, mine came out perfect and I followed your recipe to a "t" and me and my man are now enjoying them. Thank you for this "keeper" recipe

These were delicious. And they really DID melt in my mouth. But make sure the cookies aren't too big because smaller cookies come out cooked batter (and atually cooked all the way through) than larger cooies. And the larger cookies will break at touch. Let them cool before you try to take them off with a spatula. I made these for my school bake sale and they went sold out!

I refrigerated my dough because my kids wanted to make them into shapes.  I floured the surface and made them into heart shapes and turned out perfect!  Big hit

this recipe does not roll out well like I had hoped but it is very delicious. I rolled the dough into a small ball in my palm and flattened it with 2 fingers on the cookie sheet. Everyone at my christmas party enjoyed these.

I am actually right in the middle of baking these cookies.  They are absolutely delicious and are true to the claim of melting in your mouth.  After reading the other reviews, and tasting the batter, I made a few alterations.  I did mix the butter for a very long time (15 min) to give it a whipped cream like consistency.  The batter tasted a bit starchy so I added a 1/2 t. of almond extract.  I baked them at 350 for about 10-12 min.  One warning:  once you add the dry ingredients, the batter is extremely dense, so make sure you have a strong mixer that can handle it.  Regardless, I will definitely be making these cookies again!

Wow!  I just took these babies out of the oven, and they are perfect! I baked them exactly as ordered, and they are just lightly golden on the bottom.  Parchment paper is a must!

I think I'll ask Santa for a cookie press this year.....

These are terrible! They have no flavour and leave a disgusting aftertaste in your mouth. Even my vaccuum of a roommate said they were not good!

I usually make shortbread without the cornstarch but thought I would try this recipe because of all the great reviews and my original recipe is so much better.

I will never make this again!!

Made them yesterday and my husband called me at work today asking if I printed off the recipe. Even though I tried to tell him that it was easy and I can remember it he insisted that I print it off so we never lose it.

Loved it!

I played around with the recipe, I added a little more butter and a few tablespoons of ground almonds.  Then, I added just a bit of self raising flour, only a tablespoon or so.  It was a bit hit or miss, I didn't really measure properly, but they came out perfect.

This is the easiest shortbread recipe I have ever made...and its very rich and tasty!  Instead of dropping the dough by spoonfuls though, I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls and placed them on the cookie tray, and then I let my 2 year old decorate the balls with sprinkles.  They turned into perfectly shaped cookies, and baked evenly.

Cookies turned out exactly as described. I also took the advice of several reviewers and whipped the heck out of the butter before adding the other ingredients. As a result the cookie dough was smooth and easy to pipe onto a cookie sheet. Because the cookies don't spread I was able to pack a lot of cookies onto one sheet as well. 

It is true the cookies are fragile, but I just made them bite sized, this worked perfectly and really cut down on the crumbling.

Thanks!

The cookie tastes just like the name describes. I followed it exactly, came out very well. I prefer the more browned cookie, the lighter colored ones had softer centers.

This are a true favorite amongst my people.  From 1 year old to 89 years old.  The key is to whip the heck out of the butter before proceeding with the other ingredients.  Already have made numerous times.  This is truly a keeper.

The texture really is a lovely melt-in-your-mouth texture, but the flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  I will expiriment with different extracts before I write it off as a lost cause, though.  These look kind of gross when you spoon them, but the dough is soft enough that you can make prettier cookies with a cookie press.

good- I beat the butter for 15-20 minutes. They are best when you make them on the small side. I used my pastry bag with a star tip and made into about the size of a mans thumbprint.

These were yummy! I made them for Christmas and followed the ingredients exactly. They were perfect but I had to watch them very carefully (some of them did burn). I also dipped some of them in chocolate which made them even better. Next time I think I'll add vanilla or almond extract.

5 stars because it is incredibly easy to mix and the finished flavor is excellent. My son ate one and actually said "Mom, this cookie melts in your mouth". I will make them again. I used a cookie press but the only slate that worked well with the dough was the simple round. That may just be because I have a manual press, though. Good cookie!

Absolutely delicious! I consider myself a shortbread cookie efficianado and I've made several different recipes. This time around I wanted something easy and sent my husband out for cornstarch just so I could try this. It really does melt in your mouth. They're very delicate, though, and that's my only complaint. I think I'm going to make them smaller and see if they hold up a little better. I don't want to add anything to them because the best shortbread cookie in my opinion is the one with the fewest ingredients. You just want to taste the butter and a teeny bit of saltiness.

make it properly - no shortcuts. Good thing they're only expected around

Definatly melt-in-your-mouth!  And they are so darned easy.  Half way through baking, I put the dough into a pastry bag and piped it out onto the cookie sheet with the widest mouthed tip I had.  I made them very small and after they were done I sprinkled them with powdered sugar.  They are pretty, and my husband, who doesn't care for sweet things, really enjoyed them.  Make these just because they are sooo easy.

I have made several cookie recipes this holiday season, and this is my favorite so far. It's deceptively easy and delicious! I made one batch of dough, and then decided on another b/c I knew they'd be gone fast.

Excellent- my husband immediately begged me to make another batch.  We dipped half of each cookie in Baker's German chocolate to dress them up a bit.  They cooked in about 10 minutes.

I made these at first for work as a trial.  I made a double batch and by the time I came in the next day the second shift had finished the whole lot of them.  They are wonderful.  Everyone said they "melt-in-your-mount" hence the name.  I did find it easier to mix when the Butter was completely melted rather than softened like the recipe says.

These literally do melt in your mouth!  Delicious.  I also added 2 teaspoons of lemon extract to give it a nice lemony taste.

This recipe was absolutely phenominal!  The cookies literally melt in your mouth.  I made 10 dozen of them and brought them to work... they were gone, and I mean GONE, in 40 minutes!!  I've made these cookies 6 other times since!  Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! Light and fluffy and very tasty. I put a red or green glace cherry in the center of each. Very festive.

I saw the ingredients list and thought to myself, "this is way too easy.  These things can't possibly be as good as advertised."  But that was the beauty of the recipe, it's simplicity.  I admit, I am not much of a baker.  I am just putting myself through the hurdles of learning how to bake without a boxed mix and found these to be a great starting point.  They were just as the recipe said, "melt in your mount."  Just the right amount of sugar and nice and light but still so rich and sweet.  On my second round I mixed things up a bit and added a dash of vanilla and they got even better.  This is a great and simple recipe and I highly recommend it.

This recipe results in a cookie dough that is not manageable. Wasted 2 pounds of butter trying to make it OK but it's no good. Can't spoon it onto the pan because it just sticks to the spoons! Even tried refrigerating it to make it work, but still a big waste of time and effort.

We just finished baking these cookies with my son ...We read most reviews , watched the allrecipe video ,we were very excited to try this recipe, but were very disappointed during mixing the dough…accordingly to the recipe we put 1 cup of butter and mixed it until fluffy,but the dough was super dry and not manageable to form into anything it was like a powder, so I had to put more butter and mixed it with electronic mixer… even after that it was just manageable enough to shape balls- with the ice cream spoon as showed on the allrecipe video-but boy another disappointment – the balls stayed the same did not shape into cookies- I had to quickly squished them with a spoon to flatten them …  I like to know what we did wrong-we followed the recipe from A to Z and it was completely opposite from the reviews I read and even from the video allrecipe posted of this particular recipe …….   Anyone ??  thank you…we like to give this recipe a 5* but not able to .... what went wrong ?

This recipe came out perfectly! I didn't change a thing except to allow the cookies to cool completely before removing them from the pan as another rater suggested. As a first attempt at short bread, they came out beautifully.  As soon as I took them off of the pan they were devoured. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

I made these, for the first time, today, and THEY. WERE. A. HIT!  So much so that it has been requested that I make another double batch in the morning, before I depart - Visiting family.  

I don't think I modified anything this round, although I may play around a bit eventually, with drizzles and whatnot.  No need to mess with excellent all the same!  Thank you!

I compared this shortbread recipe to several others before choosing this one. I am glad I chose this one! I do believe the Cornstarch does make a noticeable improvement as does  a bit more icing sugar (1/8 cup) . I put tin foil, shiny side up on my pans, to avoid the bottoms getting too dark and reduced cooking time in proportion to cookie size.

As a heart attack and quad bypass survivor , with a sweet tooth and like trying new recipes , making them heart healthier , these were sooooooooo good. I cut the recipe in half , mixed 1/4c salted butter with 1/4c soft margerine , beat it like crazy , (lower cholestrol and fat , heart healthier). Then added 1/2 tsp vanilla , whipped it more. Added 1tbsp brown sugar , to the dry ingredients , mixed well. I then added the dry ingredients about 1/4 of it at a time to the whipped butter/margerine/vanilla combination , using the mixer after each dry addition. All ovens are a different , I baked them on parchment paper 15 minutes at 325.

My family has been making these cookies for many many years. They are a favorite. If prepared correctly they definitely melt in your mouth, as for flavor if the right butter is used the flavor perfect.

Amazing! The only thing I have to be very careful of is the oven temp. Them brown on the bottom rapidly, but that's my oven, not the fault of the recipe.

This recipe, is fast, quick and awesome.  Day and night difference, when you use unsalted butter, that the recipe calls for....my "dough" didn't drop by the spoonful. However, I was able to measure by the spoonful and roll each in a soft ball, before placing on "parchment paper" . They all cooked evenly and was easy to remove. The only way I use a cookie sheet or cake pan, is if, it is covered with parchment paper.  Good thing to remember is; if you see a little golden brown at the base of the cookie, it is time to remove them. The warm cookie will set and harden once it cools. Oh yes... I drizzled hot chocolate icing over mine and was in heaven..

Once I figured out that it's not possible to make these with powdered butter, the results were awesome. Don't take shortcuts, and your shortbread cookies will float like air.

Very yummy, as others have said, these are best if you let it sit to cool BEFORE removing them from the cookie sheet, and also, they taste WAY better the next day. Mine was crumbly so I added 1 tsp almond extract and it did the trick. Wonderful cookies, will make again.

Very light and fluffy when they came out. I added in chopped pecans when I added in the flour. I started at the nine minute mark and went from there. Every oven is different and mine worked out to 12 minutes.

This recipe is amazing. Confession: I don't really like Christmas cookies all that much. It might because I've been waiting for something like to to come around. I've gifted them, brought them to parties and used them for exchanges. I don't do anything fancy, just drop them, bake them and present them! If you are shipping, don't whip too much. The stir setting on my KitchenAid does enough. They do "melt" more if you do the high speed blend on the end, however, they are still mouth-melting fabulous mounds of goodness without that step (and probably ship better). The KitchenAid mixing bowl is a lot easier to clean up after the whipped batch. Another difference is the less whipped ones (just using the stir setting) have a more smooth look to them. I'm not into them for their looks though. I'll look past aesthetics to get these mouth-watering delights!

I added an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar, very sweet cookies! I should have removed some confection sugar. Added 1 tsp vanilla but would be good either or depends on what you like. DO whip the butter for as long as you possibly can, I did 10 minutes then added cornstarch and icing, whip for another 5, vanilla and whip, then flour and whipped for another 5. Small cookies 350 degrees for 9 minutes. Large ones for 13 minutes.

I was skeptical with the cornstarch as well, but with the many suggestions of great cooks, I waited for them to cool before tasting these fabulous little treats.  I can't wait to share them with my family.

Have tried this and though it does not have alot of flavour, adding other components like lemon zest, orange zest, crushed chocolate chips etc adds to it and makes them different using the same recipe.  Don't underestimate its versatility.

Oh, dear me, these are amazing! They are not as dense as traditional shortbread without the cornstarch but they do literally melt in your mouth. Those who said they were tasteless or dry apparently don't have an appreciation for good shortbread. It's a delicate cookie with delicate flavor. If you don't have the palate for subtle flavors these will taste bland. Too bad for you! Beat the butter 5 min, scooped w/1" cookie scoop, baked ~14 minutes. Easy, delicious.

wow. what a delicious shortbread.  the flavor is so buttery, and the texture is wonderful!  They literally do melt in your mouth.  The dough goes through a press so easy, and I used the stencil that creates a 'railroad track' type shape.  Because the shape I produced was a very thin one, they didnt take quite the time specified in the oven.  They do need to be watched because they brown quickly.  I had one little ball of dough left over that wouldn't go through the press so I just added it to the sheet but I liked the flavor and texture of the thin crisp type shortbread better.  thank you so much for this recipe.

This recipe is fabulous.  The key is to whip it for a really LONG time. I also add two packages of vanilla sugar which gives it a little twist, and tastes great!

Very easy to make. Definitely melt in your mouth. But boring. They really have no flavor. The first dozen I made plain. Bleh. The second dozen I added some almond extract to try to add some flavor. That helped. The third dozen I topped with a pecan half. The fourth dozen I took Jenmi's advice and piped them just to make them pretty. Those I will dip in chocolate. It's an ok recipe. Easy.

These tasted amazing.. too bad I had to eat them from a bowl with a spoon! Followed recipe to the letter and ended up with cookies that couldn't even be picked up, they just disintegrate in your hand. Melts in your mouth, sure.. if you can get it that far!

So delish...I added a little extra sugar as suggested.... a hint of cinnamon and some orange rind. I then piped it on to PARCHMENT paper. 375 for 9 minutes. Turned out beautiful, didn't crumble at all and melted in my mouth! mmmmmmm  And so SUPER easy to make!

This is my first time making shortbread cookies. I lived them! I love the consistency, they crumble and melt in your mouth. You have to be very careful with baking times, as soon as you see the bottom edges get LIGHT brown, it means they're ready. usually 12 min. for me. I put a little piece of maraschino cherry on top of some of them. use the highest quality butter you can find, and butter is pretty much the only flavor these cookies have.

I screwed up big time. My family recipe for shortbreads has been passed down through the generations. And I lost the index card the month after I got it. But this recipe is exactly the same! They couldn't tell the difference, and we're huge baking snobs. These are amazing cookies, just add some vanilla and voila!

Very good cookies, they are a bit crumbly but much softer than the shortbread cookies I am used to. Quite similar to butter cookies, the taste is a bit plain, I wouldn't add vanilla, I think that might take away from the cookie, but I think some icing or sprinkles might be in order. Simple, easy to do recipe.

This recipe was really great! I just made little balls out of the dough flattened them out with the bottom of a glass that I dipped in flour. I added some candied cherries prior to baking, and once cool, I drizzled with chocolate and Christmas sprinkles...sooo good!

So easy to make. Took about 20 minutes. I put the dough into an icing bag and made half-dollar size stars. AMAZING! I put them in the oven for 350 degrees for 9 minutes. I altered the temperature because I have a lot of other cookies to be baked with that temp. I also put parchment paper underneath of the dough. The cookies just slid off of the tray. It was perfect! They are a bit powdery at first, but once the cool they don't have that same effect. WAIT FOR THEM TO COOL BEFORE TAKING THEM OFF. They are extremely fragile. I dipped half of the in chocolate and the other half had powdered sugar on top. HUGE SUCCESS! Everyone loved them! I made about 32 of these cookies. They really do melt in your mouth!

I usually make a traditional shortbread at Christmas time. These have a nice texture, but I wasn't sold on the flavor when I tasted the dough. It just didn't taste as rich. I added some lemon juice and zest to make the taste more multi-dimensional.

These are great cookies.  I added a teaspoon a almond extract for a bit of flavour, but they are just fine just as they are.

These do literally melt in your mouth. They come out very light and are a bit fragile. I cooked them in a 190 deg (C) oven for 10 minutes.

I make it three times more and divided into three portion
one followed the original recipe and the second with some almond 
nuts on top third portion with chocolate chips and add 1/2 tsp of soda bic and half tsp of baking powder (its only for choc chip cookies) trust me all three taste great, my hubby and kids says choc cookies is very tasty and decide no more buying outside.thank you for this great recipe on christmas season

I have been using this recipe for a few years and we all love it! I always double the ingredients and then top them with halved cherries before baking.

They tasted great! A little crumbly. I will put them in the refrigerator and maybe they will harden a little bit. I'll make them again.

Super easy, super quick and always tasty. These are a fail safe cookie in my home and I often whip a batch up whenever I have a sweet tooth craving. It's also a good recipe to flavour, I usually add a teaspoon on cinnamon or ginger .

I'm sorry but these are not like "original" shortbread cookies.  The flavor is good but I almost choked on them because they are so dry and light they just caught at the back of my throat.  I tried, I tasted, but I won't be back.  Sorry!

I followed the advices of other people and beat the butter for 20 before mixing in the flour, and when they frist came out of the oven didnt get a good response to them they were crumbly and chalky, but after they sat and cooled they lasted about 10 mins they were so good i am making another batch to night i added a little orange extract and dip them in chocolate, so dont judge these as soon as there out of the oven, because they are so good you cant stop eatting them..

While these were good, I agree with some in that you can taste the corn starch. I could not get them to work in my cookie press either but that fact didn't count against the recipe as it isn't a cookie press recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla.

Excellent cookies!  So easy to make and they taste so good.  I did the recipe as it states and cooked mine between 8-10 minutes.  It seemed like when the edges JUST start to color, they're done.  The first batch I did I waited until the edges were a little brown and they were a bit dry... still good flavor, but a little dry.  I think maybe next time I will keep a closer eye and only cook them 7-9 minutes... this was my first attempt at shortbread cookies and they turned out great!  I used a cookie press after letting the dough sit at room temp for a while and they were awesome looking :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I'm making more this weekend... mine are already gone!

gave this 3 stars originally but everyone i know loves these even if i dont! they are a hit everytime, try using a tsp or tbp and putting really stirred up jam of any kind without lumps in in the top of the cookie. use the spoon to make a depression in the cookie and fill with jam before baking, it really gives it that something extra.

Delicious shortbread.  It definitely has flavor.  However, the picture is a bit misleading because they are definitely much more flat than the picture.  I'd have to guess you need to add baking powder or baking soda to get them to rise like the picture.  I added a about 1/3 cup additional of powdered sugar too.

These were really good and easy to make, just a tad bland and could maybe use a bit more sugar. Other than this, they were quite good. Also, I did not have an electric mixer, so I kneaded the dough by hand and this was an effective way to mix it as well!

I have been searching and searching to find a shortbread recipe that came close the the shortbread a friend of mine makes every Christmas (and refuses to share the recipe)...and lo and behold, this is it!  So excited. They taste EXACTLY like hers and now I can make them. Thanks for posting this terrific recipe. I'm in heaven!

Not what I expected at all. I agree with some of the other reviews identifying this shortbread has no taste and is very dry. I will not make these again.

Seriously good and literally melt-in-your-mouth!  Warning: this makes a very small batch and it's hard to stop at just one cookie!  Had I realized, I would have at least doubled it!

This recipe is "OK", but certainly not great. I'm not sure why in the world you'd ever want to make it as a drop cookie. It stays exactly in the shape you dropped it in - which just seems wrong for a shortbread. I didn't think it was a world beater, by any stretch of the imagination. I won't make this recipe again.

These are wonderful and so easy. Great advice around really whipping the butter and making sure to let the cookies sit for a minute or two before removing them from the cookie sheet. Good simple flavor without any topping and they really do just melt in your mouth.

Wonderful Shortbread cookie.  I've made them plain, made them topped with drizzled milk chocolate, and made personalized heart shaped ones for my daughters class on Valentine's day.  (I used Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies on this site for the names:).  They are a favourite at our house!

light, mild, butter cookie - not overly sweet or rich like apparently some people expected.  added 1/2 t vanilla though, just to enhance the butter.  delicious and addicting!

The taste was ok- but they were difficult to get off the pan and kept cracking. I did use parchament as I always do dont think it was that but you never know and also there is no flavoring(vanilla,almond,nothing) so alittle bland .

I made these and the dough did not have enough moisture to hold together.  So I added a little milk and vanilla that worked ok.  Don't think I will make these again since they did not have much flavor.

This cookie was a disaster. For starters it looked lumpy and unappitizing. It tasted ok, but burned on the bottom and was raw in the middle. Not sure what to do to correct it so I will not be doing this recipe again.

I honestly didn't expect these to be anything special. To my delight they actually melted on my tongue. They are better when they are cool or the next day. I dipped some half in chocolate then in finely chopped nuts. They are wonderful!! They are very delicate, so handle with care.

These are odd cookies.  Yes they have a good taste but when you put them in your mouth they seem to be like "sawdust" in your mouth...I like them but don't..Its weird...They will fall apart if your not careful..But just can't quite but my finger on this cookie...

Great flavor but they were so delicate they almost all broke in half when I tried to transport them to the wire rack. Even when I let them cool completely on the cookie sheet they were super fragile... Definably not taking these to my cookie exchange as they would be crumbs when I got there!

Fabulous!!  Anyone who came out with crumbly dough must have used too much flour or cornstarch.  I followed the recipe and even added a tinge more powder suger. These are fabulous.  The only draw back is that it takes 2 sticks of butter for 18-24 cookies, definitely not low cal.  :)

Not our favorite.  Kind of dry, not much flavor.  I did add a cream filling and sandwiched it between two of the cookies--made it a little better.

I am so happy to have finally found the shortbread recipe that is exactly what I remember my grandma making me as a child. Just as the recipe is named - they will melt in your mouth!  I thought the finished cookie needed a little more sweetness and made a quick glaze with icing sugar and milk.  They were perfect, delicious and were gobbled up in one day!

These really were easy and melt in your mouth.  The only problem I had was that the dough didn't come out like cookie dough, it was all crumbly, I had to use my hands to knead it together, then rolled them up into balls. Directions said to beat for 3-4 mins.  I probably only did that for 2, so I don't know if thats what the problem was. Either way it was still easy, and will definitely be making it again.

This is definitely a melt-in-your-mouth cookie, but it has absolutely no flavor.  I made these with the addition of a teaspoon of vanilla, but it wasn't enough.  It's a good base recipe, but my second try will include a couple of ingredients for flavor (lemon or orange zest?) or a topping.

I followed the recipe exactly and it makes perfectly delicious shortbread! Like others, I wasn't sure about the cornstarch but it works! This stuff really does melt in your mouth, and its really easy to make. Thanks for the recipe :)

I hate it when I make a highly rated recipe & don't like it. First of all, I've only had store-bought  & evil girl scout shortbread cookies-this was the first time making my own. These were bland, extremely greasy, & the "melt-in-your-mouth really meant that they turn to powder in your mouth. We didn't like the texture at all. Sorry, I prefer the store-bought:(

One of the best shortbread recipes that I've tried.  they really do melt in your mouth.  I did add 1 tablespoon of vanilla (can't have proper baked goods without!) and will be dipping them in chocolate and sending them to my dad!

I am confused.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a cookie that I couldn't get off the baking sheet without it falling apart.  They were quite brown at 8 minutes so I took them out and ended up with a heck of a mess.  I must have done something wrong.

WOW!  When I read "melt in your mouth" I didn't realize what that meant - it quite literally melts in your mouth!  I made these exactly as the recipe states, piped them from a pastry bag with a star tip and added a chocolate chip on top.  PERFECT bite sized cookie.  Give this recipe a try - it's definitely a keeper!

The recipe needs for probably 2 times (at least) the amount of all purpose flour than indicated. If not, the cookie taste just like eating a douhy stick of butter and will be much too crumbly to be a cookie. If you cook as is, then you could probably use the results as a sprinkly topper for ice cream or something. Will not be attempting this again- big disappointment and first big disappointment of this site.

This is great for a nice shortbread cookie.  Was surprised about using the cornstarch but it ended up very nice and didn't have such a strong flour texture and taste as others I have tried.  Thanks for a nice easy recipe!

This was the first time I have ever tried my hand at shortbread.  I love it!  The recipe is simple with ingredients I had on hand.  The flavor and texture are superb.  I will never be able to buy them from the store again!

Really good.  I was concerned there wouldn't be enough flavor (does not call for any vanilla, etc.) but they were delicious.  We made thumbprints and added strawberry preserves--turned out great.

OH SO GOOD shortbread cookies!  They were one of the best shortbread cookies I've made.  I whipped them longer and baked them at 350 for 9 mins as suggested.  Thanks for the reviews and recipe!

Oh My Goodness! This is ingenious. The best shortbread cookies I've ever had. I took a thread spool and pressed the end into the cookies to make a flower design on them.

Indeed this is the easiest shortbread cookie ever but not short on taste! I just baked several batches and tried some variations after everything was mixed.  Added dried cherries to one batch, almond extract in another the n dusted with powdered sugar (taste like a wedding cookie) mini choc chips/vanilla in one and lastly orange extract with a lemon glaze.  In some of the reviews that said cookies fell apart when taking off the cookie sheet, that means they have not baked long enough and I would bake at 350 degrees as someone else mentioned otherwise the sides brown more than you want.  Just lift one cookie with an off set spatual and if it comes apart put back in the overn for 2-3 mins.  Mine scooted right off onto the cooling racks.  This recipe is a real keeper.  Lastly I doubt if you can use margarine since it contains water and I used salted butter otherwise the cookies would be bland.

i drizzled these with melted chocolate - amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Baked on parchment for 12 min only (leave on sheet for about 2 min before transferring to racks).  I also often use salted butter in my baking. I think that's what people probably needed when they said the cookies "taste like nothing" because mine have a very strong buttery flavor, brought out by that tiny bit of salt in the butter.

Absolutely amazing, whipping them for 4 full minutes is the key they end up being so flaky they are the best shortbread ive ever had. Both my husband and his best friend said they didnt like shortbread so i assumed i would be eating them all. The next day 3/4 of them were gone! They loved them

Love it, my mixer died in the middle of whipping it, so I had to use my hands to mix everything. I kneaded the dough and when happy with the texture I  took small pieces of dough rolled them into balls, placed on cookie sheets and flattened them with a fork. They came out looking really cute and after they were cooled, I put melted white and dark chocolate in little baggies and squirted squiggles all over. They look really fancy and taste heavenly. They freeze well too. I got to hide them in the freezer in tins with a different label or the cookie monsters will make short work before Christmas comes. LOL

Tasty.  I used another users review to put the temperature at 350 for 9 minutes.  I also let my butter fluff for about 20 minutes in a kitchenaid.

WOW! These cookies really live up to their name. They are very delicate and tender and totally melt-in-your-mouth. I added about 3/4 teaspoon vanilla to the batter and topped mine with mini M&M candies. They looked great and tasted even better! I used a small cookie scoop and got about 44 out of the recipe. I will definately be using this recipe from now on! Thanks for posting. :)

Whoa.....DEFINITELY a keeper!! I'll start off by saying my oven is horrible, it turns off at random, so the cooking time was off a bit for mine, yet they still turned out AMAZING!! I was thinking that they would not be sweet enough...they are! I rolled mine in red and green sugar crystals and they were not only amazing to eat, but looked great too!

These were awesome! However, at 375* when I just dropped them on the sheet, they burned. I piped them onto the cookie sheet, lowered it to 350*.  They turned out perfect!

This is not bad but I added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of salt just to give it a little more flavor. For a Christmas twist you can add red food coloring paste to half the dough and green to the other. Roll them together and they look like little Christmas marbles!

These are fabulous! I did turn the heat down a bit because I was using a non-stick pan. Next time I will add maybe 2 more tablespoons of confectioners sugar- I personally like them sweeter. Thanks for the yummy recipe :)

Like JEMNI , i am also the minority , well in every sense of the word.The correct temp to bake,  is 350' for 9 minutes.They turned out fine as far as presentation. They do melt in your mouth because they very buttery & powdery.They seem to lack sweetness (and i'm not crazy for lots of sugar)and the shortbread flavor. With all the rave reviews, i'm thinking i did something wrong, but can't figure what. Love shortbread but i'm not sure if i'll try this one again.

OMG...thank you for this recipe! I normally don't review things on here because i haven't found anything superb, until now, it's simple, easy to make, and delicious. I followed it exact except for the cooking time. I cooked mine for 5 minutes, just because my oven cooks everything quickly, but they turned out beautiful, and they really do melt in your mouth! Thank you!

WOW! I am blown away! These really do melt in your mouth and are amazing. I made a double batch which is too many cookies! But I'll try to freeze some. I made them with my tiny cookie scoop, and the cookies are bite-sized. They are perfect! So rich and fabulous.   Also, instead of extract, I used fresh vanilla bean scrapings for flavoring. Yum yum!

Wow, I may suggest adding lime rind to this fabulous recipe? Jenmi, thank you for the citrus suggestion. I added aprox 1Tbs finely grated lime rind to the recipe, and 1/8 cup finely chopped pecans. I piped the dough out through a very large star tip, large enough to accommodate the pecan shards, then after baking and cooling I lightly rolled the cookies in confectioners sugar. I made four dozen of the little darlin's. Two dozen to mail to my family, and um...I will have to think of something to do with the rest. :) Wonderful tangy lime melt-in-your-mouth shortbread. Thank you so much for this recipe, Ms. Wilton. Also, thank you for everyone's suggestions here. I read them, and learn.

OMG These are the best shortbread I have ever tasted.  I did follow the advice of some to whip the butter for 10-15 minutes and then whip the rest of ingredients for same.  I did add some orange zest as was suggested as I am bringing these to a "fruit themed tea" - came out spectacular. Next time I will leave orange out.  These will be made again and again. Thanks.

These were good and yes, very melt-in-your-mouth.  I was looking for a denser recipe, though, one more like the cookie tins you get at the store.  So for me, these were a little too fluffy and not quite crunchy enough.  I could probably do something to the recipe to change that, but I'm not a chef... I'll just find another recipe.

OMG!!!  These cookies are what they say they are, melt in your mouth.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they taste good.  They are buttery, but they also taste powdery at the same time.  Not what I want.  Will continue my search for delicious shortbread cookies...

I used Spelt flour and was worried these would literally melt-in-your-hand-and-mouth, but the flour prooved to stand up to this recipe.  Also, I don't recommend decorating with Maracchino cherries as they caused the cookies to be soft, and not crisp.  Next time, I'll use candied cherries instead.

I used the helpful hints of previous reviewers to my advantage. To whip and mix, I used a food processor and used a spatula every few minutes to scarpe and mix. I cooked the cookies for 10 minutes maximum at 350 degrees on teflon baking sheets, and they were lightly golden brown on the bottom.  The recipe I found made few too many cookies, so next time I'd double the recipe and perhaps add a splash of vanilla.  I made half plain and the other half I rolled in walnuts and filled the thumbprint with strawberry preserves.  Definitely a good basic shortbread recipe to fancy up or keep simple :)

Excellent shortbread! I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I found the dough benefitted from much more mixing time than sugggested in the recipe as written. I beat the dough at medium speed in my mixer for about 15 mins until it was the consistency of butter cream icing.  I put the dough in a piping bag and piped rounds of dough with a start tip. I added almomds slices and a 1/4 of a marichino cherry to the top of each before baking.  They were easy to make and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies turned out fabulous.  The flavor was perfect.  We also made a second batch with 1 Tbs of Rose water, and made thumb print cookies filled with strawberry preserves.  

***The butter should only be creamed about 5 minutes.  Any more than that and you're cookies are going to spread and fall horribly.

These just did not turn out at all! I followed the recipe to a "T" only modification being the addition of 1tsp of vanilla as per other comments. Whipped the butter for approx. 20 minutes until nice and white, etc. The result - the garbage can!

I guess I'm in the camp who found these too crumbly and bland.  I can't imagine trying to transport these to a party.  The reviewer who suggested leaving them in the oven a minute longer to help prevent this was right on.  The ones I took out too soon were impossible to even remove from the cookie sheet without them disintegrating.  I took someone else's advice and added a tsp. of vanilla but still found them rather bland - so I ended up icing most of them.  And, yes, they certainly do melt in your mouth, but I just can't warm up to these. Sorry.

Perfect! And I used margarine. I don't usually use butter in my baking because it simply costs too much. I did add some vanilla and almond extract to the mix. About 1/2 tsp of each and I used this recipe for jam thumbprints. Used raspberry jam. I used my small cookie scoop to make them.

Make sure you follow the directions to whip the butter until it is fluffy (almost like whipped cream), and keep whipping as you sprinkle in the rest of the ingredients.  Finish it off by whipping some more, and you'll get truly melt-in-your-mouth shortbread!  I think next time I will add in a tsp. of vanilla- we thought the flavor was a bit bland.

Awesome cookie!  This recipe made perfect shortbread cookies. I rolled some of them in a sugar/chopped pistachio mixture then put apple cinnamon jelly in the thumbprint center.  Huge hit at work and several people wanted the recipe.  Will definitely use this recipe when I want shortbread.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow, followed the recipe exactly. Well, almost. I rolled them in a mixture of green/red/white sugar for the Holiday Season. I rolled them into small teaspoon size balls too instead of dropping them. Anyhow, they are so cute and they are "melt in your mouth" good. Thanks for sharing!

Decided to give this recipe another chance. I did not like it the first time. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out bland and dry and just not good.

This time, I added in 1/4 cup more confectioner sugar, I also added in 2 tsp of vanilla extract and blended it all for alot longer.
The taste was greatly improved and the cookies weren't crumbling like they were before.

This truly is melt-in-your-mouth ... but only if you beat the butter for a FULL 20 minutes!!  That is what makes the big difference in this recipe!

These cookies aren't very good. I will say though that my husband and I have never had shortbread before so maybe it's not a bad recipe, maybe we just don't like shortbread.  To me they just tasted like butter.  The texture was nice as it did "melt in your mouth" but the flavor was not enjoyable.

This is a decent butter cookie, but it is not a shortbread cookie. In my sons words "they are powdery. Even though the cornstarch was fully mixed in, you could still detect it in the way the cookie is very crumbly. All that said, they have a nice flavor and I did add a tsp. of vanilla to it. I will make them again but may cut out the cornstarch all together

Like some of the others, I was skeptical about the ingredients. I made these based on the reviews for my grandaughter's 1st birthday party. They are awesome. I added a little vanilla and a little almond flavorings, put them through a flower shaped cookie press...you won't believe how good they taste. What a hit!!

Although this cookie was very easy to make, my husband and I were not fans of it.  I must admit we are cookie connaseurs and so our standards are high.  It was too crumbly and messy, although they looked tasty.

I used brown sugar and added a dash of salt. Really liked them fresh from the oven. Crumbly and soft when warm, crunchier when cold.

I even messed up and melted the butter rather than just soften it and these turned out perfectly.
I made Valentine's day shaped out of them, the letters of my mans name and some hearts. Fabulous.

Such an easy recipe and the cookies are truly melt-in-your-mouth! I used a melon baller to scoop out the dough and drizzled some melted chocolate over the top after they'd cooled. The result was a cookie that almost looked like a truffle. De-licious!

Unfortunately, the cookies do MELT in your mouth and leave a powedery aftertaste.  My husband did not like them.  I baked 2 dozen and tried to dress them up a bit by using chocolate, almonds and sprinkles.  Didn't work because the cookies practically turn into to powder.  Will go back to using the recipe without the cornstarch.

Very good, and they do melt in your mouth. I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes, with on each 2 semi sweet chocolate chips and 2 white. I never had a shortbread cookie before, and shaped them into slightly flattened balls. My husband said they should be flatter, so the cooking time should probably be decreased down to 10 min or so in this case... Thanks!

MMMMMmmmmm. yummy.  I don't even like shortbread, but I made this because i was looking for a crust for my lemon bars that was more crumbly and less sweet than the recipes I found.  When I took it out of the oven though I tried it and wanted to just eat it plain and never mind the lemon.  I am a health nut so I never follow the recipe exactly so I used 1/4 cup Whey protein and 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and then the rest (1 cup) of the white flour.  I also use Xylitol for sugar instead ( for those of you trying to cut down on sugar for whatever reason (diabetics, candida, calories, teeth, ect.you cannot taste the difference) After all this it still tasted like a dream.  Great recipe!

Wow these are great.
YOU MUST TRY THESE!!!  I added a little vanilla essence to mine.  I also rolled mine into small balls and then pressed them with a fork, they looked and tasted yum!  Its important not overcook these so keep an eye on your first batch and work with that.  I found 8 minutes in a pre heated oven to 170 worked well with my oven.

Yes, they did melt in my mouth - dissolve would be another word.  Unfortunately, they were almost completely tasteless.  I followed the recipe exactly, except as other reviewers suggested, I beat the butter for 10-15 minutes.  Still not worth it.

These were a complete disappointment.  I grew up in a British colony and always remember the smell and taste of shortbread when I went over to my friend's house.  I remember their recipe was fairly simple (and the best shortbreads usually are) so when I saw this one I got excited and ran to the kitchen with my print out.  It sadly did not live up to my expectations, the cookies were stiff and most definitely did not melt in my mouth, the dough was much to chewy for a shortbread cookie, and they tasted more like a "polvorosa" cookie, which are known for their dusty, crumbly texture.

Very yummy! The dough is really crumbly but you just kind of have to smash it together a little bit and they come out lovely! Watch em', they'll burn quick!

I tried this recipe tonight, I read a few pages of reviews to get it right. I beat the daylights out of the butter first like others advised, and then again after including all ingredients. I did add a bit of almond extract as we like it. I also didn't make them to big as others said they fall apart easy, out of near 3 dozens I think I only had about 3 casualties, the rest were great. I powdered them with icing sugar after...mmmm yummy...this is the only shortbread recipe I have had work out. this is  a keeper

My second try on a shortbread recipe, and although they smell and are as light as real shortbread, we found them too dry. Kind of powdery when you put them in your mouth. Not something we will be making again.

It was a given a 4 star by my daughter and I but a well deserved one. We will definitly make these again. The only change I made was to add a splash of milk. The batter was a little crumbly for some reason. We finished them off with some melted chocolate spooned on top and a glass of ice cold milk. Thanks for the recipe!

Good! After reading other reviews I did whip the butter for ten minutes. I also read that the recipe came out dry for a few people so I cut back the flour by 1/4 cup and it turned out nicely! 
Thank you for sharing it with us.

This recipe was O.K.  A tad bit dry, and they did not spread even remotely in the oven, so I flattened with the back of a spoon. But, pretty good, extremely easy. Would be excellent dipped in chocolate, i'm sure.

This recipe is absolutley fantastic!! I used the suggestions and added almond extract to the butter while I was mixing it, and also mixed the butter and almond extract for 15 minutes as suggested. I suggest making the cookies extremely small so that they are bite sized, unless you want to keep cleaning up crumbs, because they are very fragile if youtry to just take a bite. Pop in your mouth and eat is the way to go on this one! I also added some slivered almond slices to the top tp decorate. I tried to use a manual cookie press and found that the batter was too soft to use an actual shape ( I tried a Christmas tree)A simple round tip worked great. Definatley a keeper, thanks for sharing this recipe!

I was excited to make these because of all the rave reviews I read about them, but was dissapointed with the end result.  They do "melt in your mouth", but were extremely buttery and overly rich with really no flavor at all, and I even added some vanilla extract.  I'm the only person who will even eat them!

I only give this a four star rating because I found the cookie to be....too delicate to handle. It has a great taste and was well enjoyed, but I had planned on sending these to my daughter's kindergarten holiday party, but there is no way little 5 yr old hands can handle these without the cookie instantly falling apart. As my husband (the cookie monster) said

I've never made shortbread before, so I was very impressed when these cookies turned out so good. I whipped the butter for 15 minutes like others suggested and they came out perfect. The name "Melt In Your Mouth" is very suiting. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Every year I look for a new recipe to add to my holiday baking and this year this one wins! These are soooo easy to make and truly delicious. The only thing I added was a tsp. of almond extract and I, too, used a pastry bag and piped onto a cookie sheet. So pretty. Don't you just love this site? Thanks Jennifer for making the season bright!!!!!

Truly melt in your mouth.  For ease, I pressed a double recipe into a jellyroll pan lined with plastic wrap, then inverted it onto a cutting board and cut the dough into small rectangles.  Plopped the cookies on the cookie sheets.  I cut them rather small so I baked them for only 10 minutes.  Delicious!

everyone loved these. Dipped half of cookie in chocolate. I think they must look better from a cookie press. They did not smooth out when i used a spoon. looked kind of like a biscuit ,but tasted awesome. Will make again and again. Will try using a press and frosting next time! Thanks Jennifer!

Wow!! These are so fantastic I may never make another kind of cookie! Very easy and truly melt-in-your-mouth. Everyone loved them so much, they could be called vanishing cookies. They disappear almost as soon as you put them out!

Everyone LOVED them! They were gone moments after they came out of the oven. To make them be really light, try stamping them, or flattening them before putting them in the oven.

my kids didnt care for this at all. But shortbread is more of an adult cookie. This one definitely melts in your mouth and crumbles all over the place! very difficult to handle, but tasty as far as shortbread goes.

My Mom made the same type of melt-in-your-mouth shortbreads.  They are delicious!  Adding 1/2 cup or so of finely chopped pecans (or hazelnuts) to the dough makes for a wonderful, nutty, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread.  It's a good thing Christmas comes but once a year!

Wow!  I made these into cookie size and easily got 3 dozen.  Rolled a few (gently) in finely chopped pecans, then sprinkled with powdered sugar after slight cooling.  Yum!  Also, made a thumbprint cookie with finely chopped almonds and currant jelly.  Only took 8 minutes per batch.

This is such a great recipe! So simple and everyone who has tried them really loves them. Think I will try dipping some in melted chocolate (either white or milk chocolate) for a little added interest.

My family did not enjoy these cookies.  I would recommend testing this recipe before including it with your annual Christmas cookies.  I have decided to dip them in fudge and nuts to salvage them.

These cookies were fast, easy, and delicious!  I made them into bite-sized cookies, so you can pop a whole one in your mouth, instead of having them break apart when bitten into.  I also added some colorful sprinkles, to give them eye appeal.

So my kids  friends were visiting them in Toronto on Christmas Day and asked me if I wanted to send something. I decided to send the cookies. I list my keeper and decided to go for this one. What else to say! Loved by family and friends. I will not say they ‘melt in mouth’  but they  are just yummy. It’s going to be a keeper after losing my original recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Fantastic cookies. I have in the past whipped the butter way longer and the flour etc afterwards in other shortbread recipes so I was a bit leery with this recipe. But it turned out just fine! I also added some cherries on top before baking. Not sure why some have said they are tasteless, they definitely are not. Or that they are to crumbly, again not at all. Maybe some just need some cooking lessons ?? I'd make these again in a heartbeat!

Really easy and yummy cookie! I did use a cookie press tho, and I probably should have chilled the dough first as the cookie lost a lot of definition while baking. Still delicious, I just told people my kids helped. They went fast in the cookie exchange.

This is one of my go to recipes for bringing to holiday gatherings. I add some vanilla to the original recipe...everything is better with vanilla! Then drizzle a buttercream icing on top and add seasonal sprinkles! The light texture of the cookie with the heavier, rich butter cream is amazing together!

These cookies are the best! The only tip I have to add is to make them with salted butter. I've made them with both salted and unsalted and found them to taste better when made with salted. I also melt some semi sweet chocolate and half dip them once they're cooled. I was super proud of myself after making these and think I'm going to make up little boxes of these to give to family and friends as gifts at Christmas this year!

The recipe was perfect as-is! Side note, the video makes it seem like the dough is going to spread out when baking, but mine stayed I exactly the same form I put them in the oven as. I used a cookie dough scooper for half the dough, and their form hadn’t changed at all while baking. The second half I rolled into a log, covered in sprinkles, and sliced. Both sets were wonderful!

First time through, I made it exactly as written - very dry and fell apart, very crumbly.  Second time through, I added a bit of milk and some vanilla for some flavor.  Whipped the butter for several minutes - still had problems.  Very dry.  I think the taste is there, but I couldn't eat one without it crumbling - "exploding" as my 16yo son said.  Off to look for a different shortbread cookie recipe.

This recipe is SO good! Although I never understood why shortbread doesn't call for vanilla extract to make the overall flavour perfect. I always add a half to full teaspoon.

Made it exactly as written, and made sure to whip the butter for over 20 minutes, as well as whip the batter until it was quite light and fluffy.

Nothing but crumbs. When placed on cookie sheet also nothing but crumbs. Nothing formed when baked. Dough was extremely dry and crumby. Not happy after making 2 batches that turned out the same.

I make this every year and they are always a hit. It’s good with either salted or unsalted butter. It’s 50/50 split in my family preference on the butter. I recommend to make a batch with each salted and unsalted then decide.  I use a 1M Wilton tip for piping. Make sure to whip for at least 7 mins on high so piping is a breeze.  I use parchment paper when baking so the cookies slide easily onto cooling rack.

True to the name, this shortbread does melt in your mouth. Unfortunately, the exceptionally buttery recipe made the cookies so delicate that they were quite difficult to transport. Personally, I didn't love them, and the massive amount of butter per cookie gave me heartburn, to be honest.

The cookies were ok , just that . There was absolutely nothing that was traditional in the flavour to make you think you were eating shortbread. I even sprinkled some icing sugar on top to attempt to “save” the cookies as they had zero flavour while they were still warm. Nothing. To add to this review my GF and myself utilize Allrecipes constantly as our “Go To” place as virtually no fail. Obviously in this case , in our opinion these shortbread fall way , way SHORT!!

Amazing I was a bit sceptical at first but it was amazing!
I found baking at 375 for the length of time it calls for too much, the heat starts to burn the edges before the center is fully done. 350 for 10-12 minutes on my stove seemed to work great. Definitely know your stove and I suggest standing by them while they bake to keep a eye on them. 
But honestly amazing. After I made the first batch I made 2 more! 1 more for my family and another for a friend. Perfect for holidays .

My son loves whipped shortbread so I decided to add this recipe to my Christmas cookie list. I used homemade vanilla sugar that I ground in the food processor for the icing sugar and added 1/4 tsp salt as I use unsalted butter. This recipe yielded 32 cookies using my #2070 scoop, I baked at 350 for 14 minutes, turning pans halfway through, I used 4 of each red and green glace cherries quartered to decorate the tops. Thanks!

Five stars for minimal ingredients and ease!  I followed recipe to a T, used my oven on convect bake (set for 12 minutes and watch at 10), and I have 60 small cookies within one hour!  I like the un-perfect look so I grab dough by fingers and place on cookie sheet. Thank you for this great recipe!

Loved these cookies as a shortbread base alone, but I added some pizzazz to it.  

I sifted my ingredients, added 1/8 cup extra sugar, added about a tsp vanilla, topped with raspberry preserves, or chocolate chips or a slivered almond.  And topped all that with a drizzle of almond extract  + confectioners sugar + water.  These are so good!

Used a piping

I wish I could give it more stars. These were AMAZING!!! I loved them and so did mom and my boyfriend. They both were shocked that I made them.
Made exactly as shown in video. Except that I only had salted Mimosa butter and by mistake melted it so had to keep it beating for 30 mins or so to see it turn white and flufier. Still worked out perfectly.

It is amazing on day 1. But, after that, it gets drier and  the melt in mouth feel changes to crumble in mouth feel. But, every time I have made, it never lasted for more than a day. So 4 stars :)

These are absolutely wonderful texture wise! They just melt in your mouth. I make these a few times a year and always receive compliments. The reason for my 4 stars rather than 5 is because when made as written I find that they are mostly tasteless with a hint of a butter taste, but mostly all I can taste is flour. The best shortbread have a more pronounced flavour that these are lacking. I now add vanilla extract and that gives these what they need to be 5 stars in my books. It all comes down to preference, I suppose. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't care for the texture.  Too dry and stick to your mouth terribly.  No flavor.  Needs too much doctoring to try again.

Overall, my family and I weren't a fan of these. I followed the recipe exactly and it resulted in a very powdery cookie that did indeed melt in your mouth. Afterwards we decided to wait a day to see if it would taste better the second day, they did slightly but not by much. We finshed the rest of the batch but I don't think this will be a repeat  for me.

Great recipe! My first batch failed unfortunately, as I think the batter got too warm and all the cookies flattened completely in the oven. For the second batch I refrigerated them for about 10 minutes and it turned out great! So yummy :)

I made it for the first time this morning, it's easy to make, no freeze time as some other recipes. And, it is less sweet than most that I've tried, which is what I prefer. It really melts in the mouths, I think I might need to make another batch this afternoon.

Perfect recipe - best shortbread recipe I have tried. Only thing I did differently was to blend the butter and then only poured in half of the flour/sugar mix.  Then by stirring it, I mixed the rest of the flour/sugar mix in with the butter.  I separated the mix into two batches into ziplock bags then kneaded it by hand. Would make this every time now!

These turned out really good! Just like the shortbread cookies I remember growing up. I followed another reviewers suggestion and set my oven to 350 and they took about 10 min for a perfect cook. I added some peppermint oil and vanilla, added red food coloring to half, and used it for candy cane cookies.

It is indeed light and melts in your mouth but I would have to agree with some bakers that it was a little bland. I even added in generous 1 tsp vanilla extract. I think a pinch of salt would help. Definitely use good quality butter like Kerrygold or Plagra or even Land O Lakes European Style. Since it's a butter cookie YUm....and all you taste is the butter...

I love these cookies! Whilst making them the first time i noticed that the dough tasted a little bland. I decided to add 1 tsp of vanilla to give it some taste, and it certainly made it better. Make sure to watch as they burn easily.

I made the cookies with gluten free flour because of my mom's allergy to wheat. They were a little smaller than the picture but tasted out-of-this- world! I also used granular sugar because that's what I had on hand. Going to make more.

I’ve made these a few times and it makes a big difference to beat the softened butter for about 20 minutes. They are lighter and full of a buttery taste. Those that like shortbread cookies love this recipe.. I make buttercream icing to top off them off. It adds just the right amount of sweetness.

Super easy to make,  and yes they melt in your mouth but they do lack flavour. I even added Vanilla extract after reading some reviews and they were still a bit bland. Could use some improvement. I've definitely had better tasting shortbread cookies. Taste trumps 'melt in your mouth' in my opinion.

Super easy to make and they really are melt in your mouth.  Super tender cookies.  Let them cool completely before trying to pick them up or the will crumble.  Once cool they are fine.  

I decorated some with colored sugar, some with chocolate drizzle and coated some in powdered sugar.   The powdered sugar remind me of the most delicate Mexican wedding cookie you ever had.

The only thing I changed was added 1tsp of vanilla.  350 at 9-10 minutes worked for me. I kind of used the parchment paper to flip a cookie on its side to check doneness.  Took them off when they were JUST starting to turn golden and let them sit on the pan for a couple of minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

The only change i made was to add a pinch of salt.
They turned out just lovely,i used a mitt cutter and stamped them with a Santa stamp and red sprinkles.

These were good but made another batch from a different recipe without corn starch and the ones without corn starch are definitely more melt in your mouth!

When I made this recipe as stated, I would've only given it 2 stars. However, after my 2nd batch and the following changes, I give this 5 stars. 
I whipped the butter on high for 10 - 15 minutes, then added the flour, cornstarch, 3/4 cups of powdered (icing) sugar, a slpash of vanilla extract and 3 tbsp of white sugar. I beat that on high for 5 - 10 mins.  
I baked this on a parchment lined baking sheet at 350°f for 8 minutes. That was the perfect temperature and time. The bottoms were just starting to brown, and they continued to cook while on the cooling rack. Turned out delicious! Will make again for sure!

I made it once according to recipe the next time I made a few changes.  I added a1/2 tsp vanilla and chilled the dough for 20 minutes so I could roll it out and cut it into shapes. Delicious recipe

Absolutely horrible.

I followed the video after watching it about 10 times.  If I left the cookies on the tray to cool, I'd pick them off the tray and they'd fall apart into many pieces.

i tried leaving then to cool on the baking pan for 5 minutes and then move them to the wire rack.  When I picked them off the wire rack very gently, same thing -- the cookies would fall apart into pieces.

I never could get one unbroken whole cookie.

I'd have to invite friends over to my house and have them eat directly from the baking pan if I want friends to eat this.

I bake to give to others.  I don't bake for myself.

I was worried when I saw so many reviews that these cookies had no taste.  I debated adding something for flavor, but decided to try it without.  These cookies are amazing.  So light and they really melt in your mouth.  Add flavour if you must, but these cookies are great for those who just love a pure shortbread cookie.

Love this recipe. I made it with a holiday twist by adding 1/2 tsp of peppermint oil, then adding a 1/4 cup of mint chocolate chips and instead of a cherry I used Nutella. Melt in your mouth and are a hit with my husband.

I made these cookies and true to the reviews they are light with a hint of crispiness and they do in fact melt in your mouth. 
I read most of ya'll's reviews before making mine. One person said the cook time should be shorter, I tried that and my experience was that the time indicated on the recipe was closer to the correct time for my cookies to have a nice golden brown bottom.
My tip to ya'll is, if you would like the cookies to be a bit sweeter (a lot of you complained that they weren't sweet enough) flip your cookies around in a bowl of powdered sugar soon after they come out of the oven.
I did this and they were SO GOOD!!!

Nice! Tender, crispy delicate cookies. I added some lemon zest to the flour mixture and glazed the cookies with a mixture of lemon juice and confectioner's sugar. Next time I think I'll add a splash of almond extract and press some slivered almonds into the tops of the cookies before I bake them.

Best shortbread recipe! Every time I make these, people LOVE them. I have made them a few times, since I love the shortbread thumbprint cookies, but when I make those, I always add up to about 1/2 cup more flour, so they are a little firmer. They come out PERFECT!

Thank you, Jennifer!!! For years, I never went near a shortbread recipe because I had tried one and it was so much bloody trouble, it ended up in the trash. This is so beautifully, wonderfully EASY! And the cookies are INCREDIBLE!!! I make them every Christmas now and give as gifts and today, I made a batch  because tomorrow is my friend's birthday and she is mad for them. And I took another poster's advice -  you've got to whip that butter - for a long time (at least 20 min.)  but boy...is it worth it!!!

They definitely melt in your mouth but I wasn't very excited by them. I dipped half of each cookie in chocolate and lost a couple of cookies from breakage. I will probably try another recipe next time, or try to adjust this recipe.

I did not make any changes. Next time I might cut back the flour a little  as the cookies were a little hard to form. Maybe add a little flour at a time as I get closer to the recipe amount.

These are hands down the best short bread cookies I have ever had.  My mother and I make an icing/glaze to go over the top.  We won't be buying Panera's short bread cookie anymore now that we have this recipe. :)

I made a half batch to test out the recipe and these were really good. The only change I made was I added vanilla extract because I add vanilla to all baked goods. The outsides were lightly crisp while the inside was soft and melted in your mouth. They did not flatten out in the oven so I pushed them down slightly on the second cookie sheet. I will definately make these again and make a full batch.

I made this recently and personally thought the texture was great for shortbread. As others had commented about the lack of flavour I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla essence to the mixture and found that the taste was great for shortbread. I'll be making this again.

Then switched again baking at 2 min intervals switch as it goes until beautifully golden. let cool and devour!

They were delicious, a little dry, will figure out how to change that next time. Everyone loved them.

These cookies are my favorite.  I have made them multiple times. I finally just saved the recipe to my favorites.  This last time I melted semi sweet chocolate and dipped the cookies and let them set in the refrigerator.  They are delish by themselves and dipped in chocolate !!

I didn't like these,  very crumbly and "grainy". Taste was ok but the texture was horrible and they crumbled apart as soon as you took a bite.

I did make some changes after reading the reviews.      I added 
1t. Vanilla, 
1 1/2 t. Almond extract 
1 T. bakers sugar along with a handful of Mini Chocolate chips.

I did this because of the review of " lack of flavor" and I agree without the extracts I wouldn't have liked them.

Almond extract was perfect

These are truly the easiest and best cookies ever, make sure to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour to make it less sticky and easier to work with.  I rolled the dough into balls, flattened, and wrapped dough around half Reese's miniature cup, then when cooled, frosted some with  chocolate can  frosting and some wih vanilla frosting and sprinkled Reese's on top of the frosting, people loved them, many many compliments. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! :)

I doubled the recipe thinking I was gonna make double the amount of cookies... instead of doing two separate cooking batches I put everything one three trays but the spoons were way too large. This made the cookies much larger than they should have been. It threw the baking time off and I left them 22min in... they looked good but tasted 'sandy'. I should have let them bake a bit more and I think it would have been fine. Solid 4 stars.

This recipe would be a 5 star for me if not for the fact that it was overly salty.  Next time I will use unsalted butter.  Otherwise, they were fluffy and melt in your mouth indeed!

Delicious! I was wanting some lemon flavored cookies so I decided to added some lemon extract (about 2 tsp) and also topped with some lemon flavored icing. After baking, I let them sit for about an hour before moving from cookie sheet. Came out nice and lightly crisp but also melt in your mouth yummy.

Great recipe.  The only changes I made was to add a dash of vanilla, baked at 350 for 10 minutes.  Let cool on trays for 30 minutes and packaged them up.  Not one cookie crumbled.  Keeper

I added some cranberries and white chocolate chips, while also doubling the recipe. They turned out great, although I think I made them too large. Next time I'll make them smaller (inch and a half diameter) because everyone just gobbles them up!!!

I followed the recipe but added chopped pecans at the end.  Guess I was going for the store bought commercial brand taste.  Turned out pretty good.  Definitely melt in your mouth.  My only hesitation about this recipe is that it was a bit low on taste.  But that is a personal preference.

I made them a little big and because of that the flour taste was a little strong, also the recipe calls for less icing sugar then normal recipes other then that they turned out perfect! Will use again!

This is my favourite type of shortbread. It's firm and it holds its shape when it comes out of the oven. I like them thick, so we roll them into a ball and press them gently with a fork (like a peanut butter cookie!) and decorate them. They melt in your mouth but don't crumble everywhere. It's really the perfect shortbread recipe. Thank you!!

I told some people about the cornstarch in the cookies they had an odd look on their face, but after they tried it they thought it was pretty good. I would definitely make these again, but I had to add a little more butter then they called for because it was to crumbly.

They were good, but very basic shortbread, they tasted better after the first day, that cornstarch sucks the moisture out of your mouth when they are warm.  They were good, just no real "wow" factor.

The first batch, I tasted the corn starch. I ended up using 1/8 cup corn starch, and 1-3/4 cups cake flour. Made a softer cookie with a truly melt in your mouth feeling. I made these forty years ago and have made them on and off since. Storing them in an airtight container , I think adds to the softness as they rest.

I love them and they really do melt in your mouth however I was taken back when I saw cornstarch and no eggs or milk or anything but they're fantastic.

For anyone complaining that these cookies have no flavor, use salted butter and add vanilla (vanilla bean is best, but pure vanilla extract works well, too).  You can also decorate with frosting or dip the finished cookies in melted chocolate, for an added punch.  

I've been using cornstarch in my shortbread for years and I swear by it.  You can sub tapioca starch for cornstarch (no need to adjust amounts for the substitution).  It yields the same flaky result, without changing the flavor at all.

Made these just now. They are awesome...I snuck 2 of them just to be sure ;) I made a few changes according to some of the reviews. I used 1 stick of salted butter and 1 stick of unsalted butter, added 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tbsp light brown sugar. I also added a few Christmas sprinkles. Baked at 350 for 12 minutes on parchment lined cookie sheets. Yum!

Best shortbread cookies I've ever made!  I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla into the butter while beating, baked at 300 degrees for 18 minutes.  Perfect!!!

They turned out well, I didn't have corn starch so used rice flour. I did find the cookie tasteless. I might add a touch of salt and a little extra sugar. They do melt in your mouth

I made these for my son's class because he had to bring in something Scottish.  While this is not authentic Scottish shortbread, it will do for a 5th grade class.  They were delicious, and a bit fragile.  I used a cookie press because I was trying to make as many cookies as possible.

I doubled this recipe and added vanilla extract. I made rolled cookie cutter cookies and jam print cookies out of this batch they were exactly like shortbread cookies. Only thing is I dont like how they only come smooth type batter if you have a stand up mixer which i only habe a hand held mixture. other then that very universal batter :)

Good! I used them in a cookie press and they worked well. I cooked them in a 350 degree oven for 9 minutes. Keep an eye on them, though - they go brown quickly!

I tried this recipe because of all the rave reviews. I obviously did something wrong because they came out of the oven flat and crumbly. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and watched them very closely as they were baking. Tried one cookie sheet at 375 for 10 minutes, then another sheet for 12 minutes. I tried a third sheet at 350 as recommended by one reviewer. They still came out looking like melted snowmen. I threw away one sheet completely as I couldn't even remove them from the Silpat liner, they were so fragile.

More like melt in your OVEN!

I did it exactly by the recipe and I think there is way too much butter in this recipe or something, because they spread and turned to a melted mess in my oven. Unusable.

This will be my new go to recipe for shortbread cookies. It's very similar to my mom's recipe, but the quantities are different. I added and extra 1/8 cup of confectioners sugar as the batter needed a touch of sweetness.  I used a small cookie scoop and ended up having to bake (350) them about 12 minutes until they were set and lightly browned around the edges. They are delicious. I used sprinkles on top prior to baking them.

I made the recipe as it is and it was really good but a bit sweet for my tastes.  I whipped the butter for a full 20 minutes and the cookies really do melt in your mouth.  I did not drop the cookies but floured a surface and made a roll then sliced them.  The dough was a little crumbly but I just pinched it together.   I decorated with little green trees and the cookies were cute.

Mmmm. Truly yummiest short bread cookie recipe. I am beginner in terms of short bread cookies. Today itself was my second attempt with making short bread cookie recipe. First recipe was not as good. I added a,little more confectioner's sugar then the recipe called for. I failed with using cookie press and didn't have any cookie cutter so I pressed the dough in a foil tray (with parchment paper underneath of course ??) , refrigerated for around an hour and then baked for almost 13 -15 minutes. Very yummy and for sure *Melt in your mouth* recipe. Thank you so much for posting. And Thank you all the people for your REVIEWS !! ??.. it really HELPS !!  ??

Only thing I did to change it was add a teaspoon of almond extract,  Dough tasted a tiny bit flat.  It helped a lot.  When they say melt in your mouth, they mean melt in your mouth.  Took a batch to a knitting party and it was fun watching people try and eat just one.  Once that butter taste is on the tongue it's all over.  Fabulous recipe, will make it time and again.

Excellent! I add a tsp or so of vanilla or almond extract to give them a little flavor because they do taste a bit bland otherwise. I also bake them at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes. They don't burn or dry out at this temp.

Great recipe. I loved them and so did everyone else who ate them. They melt in your mouth and they aren't too sweet. We will be making again and again and again.

I just made these cookies for the first time and they turned out amazing! I've NEVER had any success with any whipped/melt in your mouth shortbread. They've always flattened out completely on the pan while baking (probably something I kept doing wrong). Absolutely no issues here with this recipe. As per the reviews I made this following the recipe exactly and just kept an eye on them once they were in the oven as that was what seemed to vary. My tastebuds do prefer the traditional shortbread but I will be adding this to my regular collection....because it's that good!!

Not as good as I expected; after reading reviews. Good consistency. Not the rich tasting cookie I was expecting. I will use another recipe that I have used for years before making this one again.

Made these delicate and divine  cookies as per the recipe.  I did however, take Johnwbyrd's advice and lowered the oven to 350 and baked for 14 minutes.  I also whipped the butter first, then added the cornstarch and icing sugar, whipped well again and lastly the flour and whipped for about five minutes.  They came our beautifully and are melt in the mouth.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Tonight, I made this recipe, and another recipe that is identical except without the 1/4 cup of corn starch.  I found the cookies with corn starch held their shape a bit better, and were less delicate than the cookies without corn starch.   The cookies without corn starch baked faster.   I couldn't taste a difference between the two recipes.  Both tasted very good, and benefited from 12 - 15 minutes of whipping time for the unsalted butter.

This recipe was super easy to make and the cookies were delicious. I added a capful of vanilla extract to the butter whilst it was whipping (I whipped the butter for about 20 minutes). My only critique is that the cookies are slightly dry, but that might just be my oven. I will definitely make these again!

Great base for a recipe! The only change I made was to add 1 cup of confectioner's sugar instead of just half a cup. Wow! Delish! And for a touch of something extra special, I mixed cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkled some on top of half the batch. This recipe is a keeper!!

Great recipe. I made it twice. The first time I followed it exactly and spooned them into pan. Found that it was a little bland but kids loved them. Second time I added about 1/8 cup more confectioner's sugar and a pinch of salt. I also put it on plastic wrap and formed it into a log. I "dropped" it gently on each side on a cutting board to give it a rectangular shape and then put it in fridge for about 15 minutes. I unwrapped it and gently pressed rainbow sprinkles on each side and then cut them into thin slices and baked for 10 minutes. They ended up being larger than expected. Second batch I cut the rectangles in half and added more sprinkles. Only needed to be baked 6 minutes then. They look super cute and taste great. Can't wait for kids to try them. I know they will bring smiles to their faces. Super easy!

These were very light and powdery. I think they would suit being made into very small bite sized cookies, or even piped into drops. They're not bad but won't satisfy a shortbread craving.

Fantastic cookie with only four ingredients!  This was my first time making shortbread cookies and it was very simple. I followed everyone's recommendations to ensure you whip that butter. I used a dark non-stick pan with parchment paper and baked for 10 mins. They came out light brown on the bottom and perfect. I let them cool down before drizzling some icing: powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Next time I'll dip half the cookie in melted chocolate. This will make a great cookie gift year-round. Thanks for sharing!

I got this recipe a very long time ago from a good friend. I have followed it's recipe to the "T" and it is awesome each time I make it. As time went on, I started to increase the icing sugar by about 1/4 of a cup. I have even ventured to treating the mixture as a pie crust: mix dry ingredients  (sifted ), blend butter in 20th pastry knife then ROLL on a lightly floured surface. In doing so, these cookies are flaky and melty too..my 7 year old always asks me to make him shortbread for his birthday in July !!
Make these about 1/8" thick..

So, I have never made shortbread before, I always ate my mother's.   This recipe is very easy to make and very tasty indeed. These cookies literally melt in your mouth. I will continue to make these every year for Christmas.

I have made shortbread cookies every year for at least 20 years.  This is the worst recipe I have used.  I have never baked my shortbread at 375 degrees.  I lost my old recipe so thought I would try something new.   Really disappointed.  They came out flat and even though I carefully watched the time the edges went all brown and the dough was melted looking. Never seen anything like it.

Since we found 2 identical recipes to this one both with mostly great reviews, we made it.  We followed the exact recipe to the letter and whipped as suggested 15 mins. They were tasteless, so floury you almost choked  and crumbled very easily. We made an adjustment to the remainder of the batter by adding some more butter to try to save the dough - even worse. So we are moving on to our friend's recipe which uses  1/2 cup more cornstarch and 1/2 cup less flour. I'm going to see about the sugar too since these were so bland!

These were very good. The edges started browning around 8 to 9 minutes. The second batch I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, a dash of sea salt and 1 teaspoon fresh lavender, minced.

I wish I could leave zero stars  and get a refund for the money I spent on these ingredients. There is absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, ZERO TASTE to these cookies.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I find that there is too much butter in the recipe for the amount of flour. Next time I make these, I will reduce the amount of butter just a bit. Other than that, this cookis are delicious. I loved them!

They came out just like the directions said and melt in your mouth, but have no taste.  I'll be adding frosting or something, but otherwise they're the most bland cookies I've ever tasted or made.

I loved this recipe! It was great! The only thing I did differently was I added a little less cornstarch then it asked for. It came out fantastic! It had the perfect texture,  the cookies were definitely not flavorless as other reviewers said. I enjoyed them quite a lot.

Quick and easy.  I had a hard time believing it was moist enough but a couple minutes with the mixer on high definitely did the trick.  
The base recipe is really bland though.  I know it isn't supposed to be complex but I added a dash of vanilla, some fresh nutmeg, and a little cinnamon and clove to batch #2 and liked it a lot better.
I also rolled the spoonfuls into balls and did a little decorating to make them look a little neater and more festive.

These are tender and yummy, but even better if you add a small amount of flavoring such as vanilla, almond or orange extract. My next batch I'm going to try adding some Butter Rum flavoring. 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. is all you need to give it some extra dimension.

This recipe is amazing. I'm always scared to try new recipes because I don't want to be disappointed with bland flavoured food or to mess up, but I'm so glad I did! I followed it almost exactly other than making bigger cookies, and it turned out great. I agree with it taking 9 mins because a few of mine were darker brown than I'd like. I doubled the recipe and it made 30.

I made a few tweaks to this recipe.  I didn't use any cornstarch, dropped the oven temperature down to 275 degrees, covered my cookie sheet with parchment paper, and baked for 30 minutes.  They melt in your mouth, truly!

Made them pretty small, and made x's on the top to allow room for sprinkles. Family loved them, easy to make, took 8 minutes to bake, and I'd definitely make them again, very soon.

This is the very same recipe I have been using for years.  The secret is in the beating...the longer you beat, the fluffier the cookies will be.  Great buttery taste - didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I topped each cookie with a milk chocolate chip cause I don't like candied cherries.

Definitely melt in your mouth! My daughter said these were the best shortbreads she's had. I did add a little extra sugar because the batter didn't taste quite sweet enough.

OMG I'm going to lose it on these cookies. I have tried this recipe twice, what is my issue? Both times, cookies flattened in the oven. Used decent butter (Island Farms unsalted), parchment paper. Maybe my kitchen is too hot and affected the butter?

Absolutely outstanding! 
I use a true convection oven. It drops the temperature by 25 degrees but I added about 10 minutes more in time than the recipe called for.

These are easy to make and delicious. I make them around the holidays and add colored sugar to them, and they are part of my treat boxes that I prepare for friends and family. It's a light and not-too-sweet variety (sitting among rich truffles and buckeyes and butterscotch fudge).

I would give this more stars if possible. I did as others said and beat the butter for like 10-15 minutes until like whipped cream.  Then I added the other ingredients per the recipe and beat them another 8-10 minutes.  I cooked mine about 9 minutes and let them cool on the pan.  These are soooooo good...OMG Melt in your mouth good.  I also made  a lemon frosting for them. I used 1/4 cup butter softened.  I added the zest of 1/2 lemon and the juice of a whole small lemon.  Then I added confectioners sugar to taste.  I love lemon and made my frosting real lemony....you can test it to your palette.  The cookies are so good by themselves also. Literally I can eat the entire batch and not get enough. Thank you so much for the recipe...wooohooo....

I made these exactly as stated. I added chopped dried cranberries in the mix and some miniature white chocolate chips on top. They certainly are melt in your mouth! Everyone's oven heats differently so just keep an eye on them. I will definitely make them again and add different toppings etc.   thanks for posting.

This is my go to recipe for Christmas every year. I have tried others and they just don't compare. Would love to play around with different variations of the base recipe!

I have been making these for many years now and am always asked for them at my daughters charity bake sale.  
I will be honest though and say that I throw everything into the food processor and whiz it till it starts to form a dough.
I then take it out, knead it a couple of time to bring it together, roll it, cut it and bake.
They come out exactly the same as when I made them the traditional way.
I just make sure the butter is not too soft by taking it out of the fridge about an hour before using it.
They are also lovely if you dip them half way into melted chocolate.

I'm think I may have needed to whip the butter for a longer time..but not sure if this is what it was supposed to taste like since I am not familiar with shortbread..may try to make again but I will let it harden in the freezer a bit and will probably have some frosting.

Update: So much better this time around! Beat the butter  about twenty minutes and also followed the advice of  others and added about an 1/8 cup more of confectioners sugar.

This is the perfect shortbread! I used my stand mixer to whip it with the whisk attachment. Piping was easiest with the largest star tip, and very cute.

Although these cookies tasted great, they did have brown peaks which were difficult for my husband to get over.  He is used to traditional shortbread, but he did like the taste

I have been making these cookies at Christmas for the past 5 years.  I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out perfectly every time.  My family calls them "Cloud Cookies", because they are so light and fluffy.  I encourage those who had a bad experience to try again!  Soften the butter before whipping it with an electric mixer.  Whip it  on high speed for at least 10  minutes.  Don't overbake!  Take them out when they are barely brown.   One batch is never enough and I recommend doubling the recipe.  Easy to make with kids. Love these cookies!

This is an amazing recipe! Melt in your mouth is right! SLightly cooler temp required as I've seen in other posts, and agree not to move them until cool, but this is the best shortbread recipe i've ever tried and is very quick and easy, have pinned permanently to my pinterest board!

Cookies very easy to make, and they do melt in your mouth, but the taste is awful.  Not even sprinkles or icing helped. The cornstarch seems to be the problem.  Will not make again.

Not very sweet at all; more like a biscuit. I recommend making a lemon glaze for the topping. It brought out a lot of nice buttery flavor of the cookie.

I just made these cookies and they are really good. They are a perfect Christmas cookie and they do melt in your mouth. Such an easy recipe too. Next time I may sprinkle them with red and green sugar just another alternative to drizzling the icing on them. Thanks for the recipe!

I used exact measurements and the mixture was very dry. Had to pick it out and roll it into a ball with my hands.  Note to anyone else making this add more butter or something. Eventhough i did that they were still awesome.

I make hamentashen every year with a shortbread base.  I thought I would try this recipe but I tweaked it by adding two ingredients.  I added 1/3 cup fine chopped pecans and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Whipped the butter 20 minutes and added the rest of the ingredients whipping it an additional 4 minutes on high.  I floured my hands lightly and made a two inch ball putting it on parchment paper and shaped it into the triangle with an indented center needed for the jam.  I used jam to fill the center and baked them at 375* for 12 minutes.  They came out perfect.  When cool I dusted the cookies with powdered sugar and have a tray of red plum, poppy seed and apricot filled hamentashen.

These are really nice and do melt in your mouth! I added 1/8 cup more icing sugar as one poster suggested, as well as 2tbsp of lemon juice to give it a gentle lemon flavour. The lemon juice also helped make the mix easier to pipe through an icing bag with star tip. Love this recipe. So simple too! Will use again!!!

Amazing.... My fiance is very picky and he loved  them. One thing I did was putting the mixture in a piping bag with a big tip. Is hard to squeeze at first but they came out sooo beautiful, is less messy and sooo worth it...

Delicious, easy, and delightfully simple.  The perfect not-too-sweet cookie.

I made these twice and added in 2-3 t. of vanilla extract each time and next time I would likely up it to 1 T of vanilla paste. The first time I made them, they stayed puffed up. The second time I made them they flattened out into thin disks (probably because I didn't use enough cornstarch). Both times they were fantastic! I'm not sure why the recipe wouldn't call for vanilla in the first place...I imagine they would taste quite plain without it.

Made these for New Years. Kids liked them, I felt they needed a little something. They tasted real floury to me. I may try to add an extract of some kind next time. They were really light and melt in your mouth, just did not enjoy the flour after taste.

The recipe has too little flour, another 1/2 cup was called for. Also, add a little more icing sugar, it gives it more taste.  It's better to have the mixture a little more stiff for a better biscuit. Also, instead of spooning the mixture onto the tray, it's better to roll the mixture on a little of the icing surgar (powdered sugar). You want to make sure that you only roll out to 3/4 inch and cut into squares. Place on tray then prick with a fork on top.  This is the traditional shortbread!!.  VJ

AMAZING! I crushed some candy canes and mixed them in one batch and added some "Lemon Bakery Emulsion" to another, then dipped the baked cookies in a little powdered sugar. Since there are no raw eggs in this recipe, you can "taste as you go" for the amount of flavor a person wants. You could also add some peppermint oil (food grade please) as well. If a person is expecting sweet, this is NOT the recipe for you. These are wonderful w/coffee and/or tea cuz they aren't sweet.

The taste was great, but wayyyy to crumbly! I let it cool for 20 minutes and still crumbly.  I followed this recipe to the T. Not liking it very disapointed :( I was looking forward on giving these to my Sunday school class.

These are delicious. I added 1 tsp of salt to bring out the flavour, then baked at 350 for 10 mins!  Perfect!

These are so easy and are so buttery and yes, they fall apart in your mouth! Exactly what I was looking for. I made a chocolate glaze to drizzle the tops with, just for a little extra flair. I baked for 13 minutes and the bottoms are just barely golden brown. I could have left them in a little longer to darken, but I am satisfied with them as is. Also, I used a 1 1/4 in cookie scoop and it worked great!

These are pretty good, but I added about 1-2 T brown sugar and I think they'd have been too dull without it.  In addition, per other reviews and my own experience, they need to be baked at 350f for 9-10 minutes, not 375f for 12-15 minutes.  That would make charcoal.

This recipe is just wonderful. I always add just bit of almond flavoring to it simply because I love almond. I give these as gifts and people just rave about them.

Just made these and they are good, but not my mother in law's recipe (I wish I had her recipe!) which would be to me, a 4 or 5 star recipe. They had almost the right texture and almost the right flavour but not quite. I didn't find the rich butter flavour coming through enough for my liking though they *are* melt in your mouth if a little on the powdery side. That all said, I only have a cheap handheld mixer and so didn't have the luxury of whipping the butter for 20 min straight without blowing a fuse or the motor but it was white and creamy/light/fluffy after about 5-10 min of mixing on high so I think, should have been okay. Also, have to note, I turned my back for a second to measure the corn starch and my mixer which had been propped against the side of the bowl, slipped, fell and knocked the bowl to the floor, so I lost some of the butter but measured the flour/cornstarch the same. I only lost about 10% of the butter though, not sure how much of a difference that would make in texture and/or flavour but I would imagine it would affect it some. I'd try this again and possibly rate it higher but given my experience today I have to give it a 3. Adequate, a nice treat, fine to eat and even give away for Christmas (which I made them for, decorated with sprinkles and icing sugar, some with walnut pieces and some with chocolate chips pressed in), but not the most delicious I've ever had.

These are wonderful and incredibly light!!  Was surprised at how easy they were to make.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla paste, which I think it really benefits from as I feel the butter is the only real flavouring here, and the cornflour would take some of that buttery flavour away.  I used salted butter too.  Very difficult to find fault with this excellent recipe!!  I made a stack for Christmas gifts for my kids teachers, wrapped and tied with a ribbon they looked wonderful!  You could easily pipe the mixture, but I like the chunky 'rustic' look.  Cannot recommend enough

The flavor and texture of this cookie were not pleasant.  Felt like eating mostly flour/starch.  I used gluten free flour.  Could that be the problem?  Will not try it again.

I didn't find these as amazing as others, unfortunately. I whipped the butter for 15 minutes as someone else suggested and kept everything else the same, other than rolling in sprinkles and pressing flat. The taste was off. Almost like too much corn starch or something. It was definitely lacking in flavor.

I made these this evening and they turned out wonderful. My advice is to whip them vigoursly, as they come out light and fluffy. I garnished with green and red cherries.

OMG. My mother always told me there was an art to shortbread. NAILED it! Thanks :) This recipe was by far the very best shortbread I have EVER had.

My mom made these every Christmas (she is now 90) and I have now taken over the tradition - however we have never used corn starch - I also dip them in melted chocolate or melted butterscotch chips - yummy

i halved this recipe to try making a batch and it was PERFECT. this is my 3rd shortbread attempt and after trying 2 other recipes (both of which frankly tasted good — but like butter cookies), this recipe is The One. cornflour was really the secret ingredient to transform the texture and taste from simple butter cookies to shortbread with its classic powdery melt-in-your-mouth texture, with a sweetness that isn't too overpowering yet still savoury. two thumbs up.

This is a very tender, delicately flavored butter cookie, and quite delicious. If you want a bit more flavor, go ahead and throw in a teaspoon of your favorite flavor of extract. I've made these cookies many times and sometimes I make them as written, other times I throw in either Mexican vanilla, almond or lemon extract. they are delicious with or without the extract!

Definitely melt in your mouth. Shortbread tastes good but a bit too soft for me. I prefer a cookie with some crunch when I bite into it. I didn't mix for 15-20 mins like other reviewers suggested, but just mixed the butter till fluffy as the recipe indicates. I used butter at room temperature which probably results in the same as mixing for 15 mins. Bake at 350° on parchment paper for exactly 9 mins and you will get a perfectly golden bottom.

4 stars because I had promised the kids we would make cookies, then realized I was out of eggs. So this recipe saved me. The cookies do melt in your mouth, I loved them while my husband felt they were bland. Super easy to make and I think next time I will dip them in chocolate to appease the old man. ;)

Very light, airy and they do melt in your mouth.  Crisp outside with a light center.  However, you NEED to put an icing or glaze on them, because without it, they are tasteless.  I recommend mixing 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1.5 teaspoon almond extract and 2 teaspoons milk.  You'll have a little glaze left over.

I thought this recipe was absolutely amazing.  I did need to watch the time on the baking to make sure that it achieved a lovely golden brown color.  I did add 2 t. of maple syrup just to change things up a bit!

I've baked many varieties of cookies thru the years as gifts for Christmas.  This year I tried this recipe as 1 of my 8 I baked. I'd never attempted shortbread before. These are EXTREMELY TENDER cookies. I stored them in an airtight plastic container after baking, layered between wax paper. When I opened container to start packaging cookies separately as gifts next day I noticed most cookies had broken apart (I used cookie press to make them pretty).  Very disappointed, these cookies were not durable.  I felt the flavor was ok, better after they sat a day (3-4 star rating).  Gave this a 1 star because the cookies I made crumbled, wasting time, money, and resulted in few cookies to gift.  In the few I was able to gift, I only heard one person enjoyed this cookie. I won't attempt this recipe again.

This was a great recipe. It was very easy and tasted great. I used unsalted butter. When they were finished I let them cool and the kids decorated them with icing and sprinkles which sweetened them up.

Just made these and they are amazing!  Make sure you do whip the butter long and well and then with the other ingredients again, but you don't need to for as long.  I rolled them by hand into small balls and they make the perfect shortbread cookie!  I was able to get 4 dozen out of this recipe doing it this way.  I rolled 2 dozen and then drizzled them with chocolate after they were baked and then I crisscrossed the other 2 dozen and put sprinkles on them before they were baked.  They all came right off the pan without cooling and no crumbles! Yummy! :)  Wonderful, easy recipe!

I have made these cookies 3 times in the last week. The first batch didn't really have much of a taste, as others have stated. In my second batch, I added vanilla. Made all the difference. Last night I made another batch and someone said to add maple syrup for a maple flavour. DO NOT DO THIS. I did not think of it at the time but as you know, maple syrup is made up of mostly sugar. So, cookies did not keep form. They flattened and then burned around the sides, however, the middle part was tasty. I am making a fourth batch now and I am using maple exract instead. Form is still good. They indeed melt in your mouth.

I was worried about the cornstarch, like other reviewers.  I made these for the cookie table for my wedding, and they didn't actually make it there... I didn't think they were good enough (a bit crumbly, even for shortbread), but my mother ate nearly all of them and loved them.

We have made 6 batches of these cookies.  Honestly the best I've had so far.  We used the pampered chef small scoop and drizzled some with dark chocolate, some with white chocolate and some milk chocolate.  I will be using this recipe again that's for sure!!  Thanks for sharing :)

I followed the recipe and then tried the 'dough.' It tasted like flour and very little flavor. So I knew it wasn't what I was looking for. I added a 1/4 cup of powder sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. The cookies do 'melt' in your mouth. But they don't stay together and in order to cook them all the way, you end up with cookies that taste like they are going to evaporate into dust. I am sure the texture problem happened because of what I added. But then, the dough wasn't the taste or texture I was looking for in the first place.

Beating the butter longer (10 minutes or so) really helps these cookies have a light and airy texture.  I drizzled with a butter based icing and they came out really tasty.

Easy enough to make, but they are quite bland and tasteless.  I am going to drizzle icing on mine which I am hoping will give them more flavor.

These were amazing! I was never a huge fan of shortbread cookies.  My boyfriend requested some, so I made them, and I'm so glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were perfect!  I place a ju-jube in the middle of some too.  Yummy.

These were delicious.  I looked at many many variations before deciding to try this one.  I found the texture to be just right, not sandy at all.  I did slightly over cook them, i think the 375 degree oven is too high for the length of time given.  I would recommend you start checking at 9-10 minutes for doneness, because of course ovens vary.  I used a cookie scoop to portion them out and was very please with the look.  I added a few holiday coulored sprinkles to make them festive

Awesome! This is the first shortbread cookie that's held together for me and tasted as they should! I followed the recipe exactly, although I doubled it for Christmas, and  placed a quartered glacé red or green cherry on top.
I did find the dough too stuff to push through a pastry bag (I may not have had a large enough tip), so I rolled them into small balls, placed the cherry piece on it and pushed it in a little, and they looked so pretty and very professional.
I did change up the baking to 350F, for 14-15 minutes in a convection oven, and they barely tanned on the bottom and stayed beautifully white! I was able to lift them off the baking pan immediately with no crumbling, but they still really did melt in my mouth....quality control is so important! :) This is absolutely a keeper and so much easier than making a delicate dough that had to be chilled...this is a no fuss recipe that produces a lovely, light, tasty shortbread cookie! I may have to try another one shortly...:)

Made these this weekend and the only reason why I'm giving these 5 stars is because I made some modification. After reading some reviews that it tasted blant, I added 1/2 of white and 2 teaspoons of vanilla (but you can use any extracts) ane used Land O' Lakes, sweet butter, the REAL butter not the fake kind, and let me tell you, it was stunnignly delicious and beautiful. I even baked half with strawberry jam (made thumbrpint in the middle of dough) and it was just amazing. Everyone raved about them.....

This IS my mothers recepie!! LOL, but she never put cornstarch in. The key is to whip them until very light. She used to put a pecan or a piece of glace cherry in the centre.  When feeling VERY artistic she would put green and red glacee cherry pieces to mimic holly. She died 24 years ago, and I've been making them ever since!

These are great cookies for tea or coffee in the afternoon, however they do not taste like shortbread cookies. They are soft, light and yes they melt in your mouth. I made them as is and also added jam in some and nuts in others, they all came out great. Thanks!

Before trying this recipe I had never tried making shortbread. It was quick and easy. My 4 year old did most of the work and had fun with it. This will definitely be my go to for shortbread cookies!

This recipe lives up to its name! To make them even more delicious, I made a thumbprint in the dough on some and added apricot preserves and Hershey's kisses on the tops to others. Following the advice of other reviews, I too baked them at 350 for 10 minutes to make them even softer.

Great texture and beautiful when piped from a pastry bag. The floury taste wasn't to our liking, but I may play with it a bit to see if we could modify it for ourselves because I really liked the meltiness.

My mom makes delicious shortbread cookies and I usually use her recipe, but i lost it and she wasn't home when I called.  My husband really wanted cookies so I thought i'd give this one a try.  I followed the recipe as written, but they had no flavor.  Maybe I made my cookies too big, as by the time they were finally cooked through in the middle, they were a dark brown on the bottom.  Would never make these again

OMG these are everything that you could possibly want in a whipped shortbread, so soft and buttery, they truly melt in your mouth. I whipped the butter until it turned a soft creamy yellow (5-10 mins) then I added the confectioners' sugar (icing sugar) and whipped for 5 to 10 mins more, mixture will lighten again. Then add flour mixed with cornstarch, beating for approx 5 to 8 mins, mixture will be very light and soft to the touch, drop by teaspoons  or use cookie press onto parchment lined cookie sheets. Bake for 10 mins, but keep an eye on them they will burn quickly.  Freezes well, if you can get them to the freezer before they're all gone!!

Really nice cookie!.  I was looking for something particular in my shortbread recipe and found this to be just what I was looking for!....Super easy and quick to make.  Just have to really watch them in the oven so they don't burn or over bake.  I turned the temp down a little bit and baked till they were semi firm and let them cool on the counter...ate one still hot and they didnt fall apart, not crumbly at all!...Will definetly bake these again!

Made these again today and just thought I would comment that this recipe doubles GREAT!!!!!

Great cookie, fantastic taste. I tried dropping the first batch from a teaspoon, they tasted great but looked a bit messy. Second batch I gently made into small balls with my palms, prettier! and still tasted great. Piped almond icing over them - wow!

My husband said it took him back to his childhood and his mother's cookies. That made him smile after a hard day. These will literally melt in your mouth and the sweet butter taste will linger. Absolute keeper!

AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!! For my cookies I left them in for 20 minutes at 375 F. I used cornMEAL instead of cornSTARCH but they still came out amazing! I also added a capful of vanilla extract to add more flavour.

Really easy and fool proof recipe. I have adapted it to make dog faces using coco crunch, chocolate rice and buttons. It really melts in your mouth.

This is a recipe I have had for many years and I LOVE it! For those who say it has no flavor... it has a very delicate flavor. I suggest you use salted butter. A tiny bit of real vanilla may give a more pleasing taste.

Super tasty and really easy!!  I used a decorator's bag and a star tip to make the cookies.  The dough was a bit thick for this, so it was a nice, though short, workout for my arms/forearms.  Doing this, I made 42 cookies.  I probably should have baked them a bit longer, but they are perfect for me!  I plan on making some more on the 4th with my friend, maybe I'll add some almond extract!

The taste is really nice. I added lemon zest and vanilla-butter flavour to make sure the cookies taste and smell like they should. What I didn't like was texture, they cramble too much for my taste. It's difficult to hold the in your hande, they are so delicate. I also covered them with a bit of frosting (powdered sugar, lemon and colorant).

Lovely! I followed the recipe exactly and piped it from an icing bag. The texture was amazing and the dough was firm enough to show shapes. However, there was a biting after taste which I did not like. I did another batch with vanilla extract and pipped it out from an icing bag. It was tastier with the vanilla extract but the dough was much too wet to show shapes.

I made these and followed the recipe exactly but found them to be a little bland and too crumbly, although they really do melt in your mouth.  I made a second batch with Milk Chocolate Chips and they disappeared within minutes.  My family gobbled them up.

Very easy Very good!  The key to shortbread is not to over mix or the cookie becomes heavy. I put in some mini chocolate chips.  I will do this one again and again!

This recipe is delicious! I played around with the temperature and bake time with each batch and they were great either way. I even doubled the recipe, but forgot to double the cornstarch. They were still excellent! I don't think these cookies could could ever taste poorly.

I must be missing something on this one.  They do melt in your mouth and they have a beautiful texture but I find they have too much of a starch aftertaste/bite.  I had to throw the entire batch away as uneatable.

Good.  They do melt in  your mouth, but are also very delicate and difficult to store/transport.  They also are somewhat tasteless, so I added a smidge of vanilla to my next batch, which I also made into thumbprints.  I don't particularly like shortbread, but the man says I never need make another cookie and my work people loved them.

Looked perfect, but tasted a bit pasty. Adding some flavoring is essential. Was surprised that they didn't have a creamy, buttery taste. Mouth feel was somewhat off. I can see where they would melt in your mouth, but I guess I want a cookie with a little snap. Shortbread, to me, should have a little crunch to be fully satisfying.

I made these tonight. I have a 4 yr old and a 4month old and I was so happy on how quick and easy these were to make. I made them in a cookie press gun and they turned out wonderful. I thought they were tasty and melt in your mouth. This one will be put in my cook book and made often.

A great shortbread recipe for a cookie press gun.  Still waiting for them to come out of them oven but from the reviews....I'm sure they'll be de'lish!  ARGH!!!! I got carried away with something and they got burned!  Ah...I'll just dust them with icing sugar and no one will ever know.

These were very good but a lot of trouble for so few cookies.  If I make them again I'll try pressing it into a pan and cutting them into squares.  It just takes so long rolling them.  But I do love the consistency.  The best shortbread I've made.

I made 2 batches of this shortbread. One with butter and one with margarine. The ones with butter were more tender than the margarine ones, how ever the results for both were fantastic. Spooned out and garnished with half of a candied cherry. A new family favorite

Amazing! Just like my grandmother made them. I found the baking time a bit high(first batch burned a little) but that could be my oven. I found 10 mins was the ideal.

Tried this recipe for a cookie contest.  not sure what happened as I followed the instructions and all they did was become huge puddles in my oven.  Totally discouraging for someone who wants to learn how to bake as well as my mom did.

These cookies taste absolutely wonderful and they really do melt in your mouth!  My only issue was, I was hoping to use them in a git basket and they turned out to much to fragile for shipping.  Bummer...I guess we are just going to have to eat them ourselves!  :) Yummm!

These were just okay to me. My kids really liked them. I felt that they were a little bland, and they did not melt in your mouth, very crumbly and dry. Will probably not make them again. I gave it 4 stars b/c it was simple to make and the kids enjoyed them!

This was AMAZINGLY easy!!! and delicious! I had a bunch of company show up last minute and threw a batch of these together. It was a huge hit! thanks! It probably didn't turn out like it was supposed to; for some reason, it got really crumbly right away and wouldn't mix, but we rolled them into cookies with our fingers and they turned out fabulous :) thanks so much!

I have gotten many reipes off of this website but this is my first review! These were so fantabulous and so easy to make.   As a topping I added butterscotch morsels and then once the cookies were done I melted hersey's symphony candy bar and topped the cookies with it.   These were so soft and easy, I just can't get over them!!

This really is a simple and easy recipe. I looked at some reviewers' advice and changed the baking temperature to 350F and bake the cookies for 9-11 minutes. Perfection! Make sure to cook them down completely before eating, they actually taste even better after a few hours.
Jammy Shortbread Cookies: I slightly flattened each cookie, made an indent in the middle, and spoon in a tsp of jam, then bake the at 350F for about 9-10 minutes.

It crumbles too quickly in your mouth, which I didn't like very much, but if you're a big fan of shortbread, I suggest you try this recipe. I piped it with a ziploc bag to get the amount I want per cookie, and then formed a ball with my hands, and pressed them down on the baking sheet. It seemed to work fine. I baked it for 10 min.

They certainly do "melt in your mouth"-- however, I felt they didn't have much flavor.  My taste testers disagreed with me, so I'll have to take their word for it.

These are the only whipped shortbread that are sturdy enough to handle freezing and mailing.  The trick is to whip it beyond just combining the ingredients.  After a few minutes the texture of the butter/icing sugar begins to become lighter.

This is absolutly the best shortbread recipe in the world. My husband said they were to die for. I took some to my boss at work who is addicted to the shortbread cookies from Panera'a and she said she likes these better and wanted the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. I followed the recipe as written.

These were great. I made 3 different types with one recipe. I used a star tip on a pastry bag and made beautiful litte swirled baby cookies. Then I put rasberry jam in the center of each cookie that I had made a little indent using the back of a wooden spoon. Lastly I made little indents in the center and placed one piece of dark chocolate and a half of a marichino cherry over the top to cover it. All three were lovely. Very delicate and delicious cookie.

True to their name, these cookies do melt in your mouth and they are very tasty (if you prefer a less sweet cookie). My family likes the flavor a lot, but we prefer a cookie that is a little more firm. Still giving 5 stars as this is just our personal preference.

This is my first review on this site and I'm happy to say it's a great one! These cookies are magical!!! I followed the recipe exactly, however I baked at 350 degrees F. For 12 mins. I let them cool on the pan for 5 mins. They turned out beautifully! They really do melt on contact with your mouth:) Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

One thing to keep in mind is that with an ingredient list this short the quality of the ingredients is very important.  Especially when substituting margarine in place of butter.  The difference is night and day.  Even the dough is fluffier and creamier when using real butter.  If you find you made a tasteless somewhat greasy cookie get better ingredients and stop using margarine.  All of the flavor in plain shortbread comes from the butter and the best shortbread I've had used the best butter.

I baked these at 350, for 9 minutes, and its no lie - these MELT in your mouth. I added some Mexican vanilla just before I started beating the dry ingredients with the butter, and they are phenomenal. Gotta buy myself a piping bag!!

Excellant.. My hubby stated that they are habit forming. I followed the recipe, but instead of using cornstarch, I just used 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar in confectioners' sugar is part cornstarch anyway. I baked at the suggested amount of time at the suggested temp. They came out great. Next time I plan on making thumbprint cookies and using raspberry preserves. Thanks for the great recipe.

The name says it all...'Melt-In-Your-Mouth'!  Followed the recipe as submitted and baked them till I could see small cracks on the top of the cookie.  No browning on the edges.  Also lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper and let cool for a few minutes before moving to a cooling rack.  Next time I might add vanilla extract.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

Very good. Simple (almost overly so) but good. Needs some sort of nut flour, or zest, something! They are quite easy and do in fact melt in your mouth. I'd admonish other bakers to add flavoring, but definitely try it!

Delicious. I whipped the shortbread for a little longer than the recipe recommended, and it turned out amazing. Even almost a week later, the cookies are light and still tasty.

Very melt in your mouth, but dough was extremely difficult to work with.  Too sticky to drop, so I opted to put the dough in a round cake pan for petticoat tails.  Even with this option, it was very hard to get the top smooth because it was so sticky. Small price to  pay for flavor and texture though...

YUMMY!  Better after they sit for a couple of days. I just sprinkled with colored sugar while they were cooling. I no longer do cutouts so these are a very tasty replacement.

Very nice indeed. I read some other reviewer's suggestions- I added a little more sugar, about 1/8 of cup or more to get more sweetness. 350 at 9 minutes was perfectly fine. Next time I'm going to add Hazelnut flavoring to it.

this is an okay recipe, but i like shortbread to be a little sweeter.  i sprinkled colored sugar on top before baking and it tasted better this way.  less floury. i would probably add vanilla or some other flavor next time also.

This cookie is delicious and light, not at all sweet and a nice change of pace from the very very sweet of most Christmas treats.  I do recommend some sugar sprinkled on the cookie before baking it - I chose to use a larger crystal sugar, Sugar in the Raw, and really loved the outcome.  It had a sparkle to it that dressed up this plain looking treat to easily hold it's own in a platter of Christmas desserts.

My mom, daughter and I made these for xmas and LOVED them. We added a pinch of salt and nutmeg and a dash of vanilla.  Easy and fun and came out perfect!!  We also added red and green food coloring and rolled out the dough to use cookie cutters. Covered in sprinkles and ta-dah - fantastic shortbread xmas cookies.

I'm not sure what went wrong... the texture was good and I followed the recipe completely. Maybe it was the silpat mats I used on my cookie sheets?  Long story short, they were too fragile to even move off of the cookie sheet (completely cooled, 25 min later) Yummy taste though.

These tasted great and did melt in your mouth.  My two girls loved them.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla as other suggested and baked at 350 degrees for about 16 minutes - they came out perfect!  I melted chocolate and drizzled it over the top... YUM!  The recipe yielded about 24 medium sized cookies using my small scooper.  Next time I will double the recipe I like to share and these disappeared FAST!  Thanks for a great simple recipe!

Not impressed! After reading many reviews, I thought I would give this recipe a try. I ended up with a dry almost cornmeal texture so i added another 1/2 cup of butter and salvaged the mixture. The final result was dry, and just average. If I wanted average, I would have tried a recipe that had just average reviews.

These are so good!  Only thing I did differently was add 1 Tsp of vanilla.  They do melt in your mouth.  I will make these again for Christmas except will add green & red food coloring to make them more festive.  10 stars!

I was hoping for the best based on all of the reviews. They definitely melt in your mouth but totally lack in flavor. This did not fix my shortbread craving... the classic rich, complex butter flavor was not there at all. I used unsalted butter, perhaps this made a difference, but as is, was not worth the calories.

These are so good! It was my first time making shortbread so I was a bit worried. However, these are very easy to make and turned out perfect when I followed the recipe exactly.

Just out of the oven, very good.  I did not have to wait to cool to remove from pan.  I did whip the butter until like "cool whip".

These cookies were amazing! I added some toasted coriander to the recipe!   I read if you toast the coriander that it can be used in desserts.  I looked online and found this recipe.   These cookies were delicate yet bold ( coriander) at the same time!  I will make this recipe again Thanks Ali

Has a good flavor, although maybe a little too much flour flavor. Kinda crumbly, too. Mine are cooling right now. The first one I tried was still warm and crumbled a bit. But they do melt in your mouth. I added almond extract for extra flavor and extra sugar too.

These cookies were very, very good.  I don't think I whipped my butter enough, so the dough was quite stiff, but they still tasted incredible!  Next time I know to whip the butter for much longer.  Regardless the taste of these great!

I will admit that these tasted delicious and melted in your mouth as named, but burnt on the edges and melted to a point where they were as flat as pancakes. I will keep looking for the perfect shortbread recipe.

I cannot believe how good these are! My 3 year old has been wanting to have a tea party with cookies (she got the idea from a cartoon), and I wanted to find the simplest, quickest recipe I could. I can't believe the one I found I actually LIKE. These are delicious. I whipped the butter for what feels FOREVER (my daughter didn't want to stop). I'm sure that helped. I followed the recipe as is, and YUM!

These are very tender as promised.  For flavor, I added vanilla extract.  Because these cookies are so delicate coming straight out of the oven, you have to be patient and let them cool down before "sampling."  Although this was good, I'll probably stick to traditional shortbread recipes (I prefer the density).

Pretty good!  I'd say they were pretty good for my first time making shortbread.  I also tried substituting 1/3c flour for cocoa.  The dough was really soft but refridgerating it made it too stiff for my cookie press.

Delicious!  These cookies are perfect.  When I touched one immediately after taking it out of the oven, it broke apart so I just let them cool a little then used a spatula to put them carefully on the cooling rack.  They didn't not crumble or anything, so I really think the cooling time is important before you try to move them.  This recipe is excellent and I will definitely make them again!

These were awesome I melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips and added some margerine to the melted chocolate to make it easy to drizzle over the cookies, I also dipped some in the chocolate very pretty and tasty!!

Fabulous shortbread, and truly light and melt in your mouth is you beat the butter first for about 5 minutes, and then beat 10 more minutes after adding the rest of the ingredients. Decorated with red and green crystal sugar. Thanks!

I made these as directed and they were a little bland for me.  On the second cookie sheet I made the cookies, put a thumbprint in the middle and added apricot preserves.  Very Good!

This is the very best shortbread recipe I have ever used!!!  It defintely deserves 5 stars! I rolled my cookies into small balls before baking, instead of spooning them onto the cookie sheet.  Very delicious! Just pop 'em in your mouth and enjoy the wonderful taste of Christmas!

I put these in at 375 and they were burnt by 7 minutes!?!? It works if you put them in at 350 for 6 or 7 minutes. Also, these cookies are so brittle they fall apart very easily. They definitely would not be good to hand out as gifts because they will be broken by the time they get there.

Super.  I did add one teaspoon of vanilla to mine.  They were perfect in every way.  They will be in my keeper file. :-) Hello Again,   This time I made them with vanilla and then added the zest of one lemon to the batter.  Baked as usual and power sugar on top to be pretty.  Also did six of them with a dollop of Seville Orange Marmelade pressed into the top before baking.  Both absolutely yummy.  Though this time I had to reduce the cooking time by two minutes.  (This just proves to us that ovens will vary given the outside temp. and inside too).  Enjoy this is very nice to give as a gift to a friend and I thank the person who shared it with all of us.

Easy, with staples you have in the kitchen. Did add 2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp almond extract, and 1 tbs brown sugar. I topped half with Maraschino Cherries and a quick almond glaze (powder sugar / milk / almond extract), and the other half with Strawberry Polaner All-Fruit.  Like everyone has said, they're not great. Crumbliest cookie I've ever made... Hopefully, they'll be less crumbly after a couple weeks in the freezer, as I'm taking them to Xmas.

Good cookie.  The dough was a little too stiff to use a piping bag, so I did the drop cookie and put some sugar crystals on.  Didn't make very many-not a very economical cookie.

It gets four stars for it's simplicity and good taste.  The dough was super soft and I just used my smallest scoop to get them on my parchment paper lined cookie sheet.  I topped it with a mini hershey's kiss milk chocolate.  I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the butter before I added the dry ingredients.  

I am looking for a shortbread recipe so I can cut out cookies with.  This wasn't it.  Still it was good & I would make it again.

I'm not sure quite what to think. On one hand, I thought they tasted wonderful- very good flavor (the only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp vanilla). On the other hand, I found the texture odd (as did my husband and sister). They were very powdery and dissolved instantly in my mouth, which was somewhat off-putting. But, because of the good taste, I'd still rate these a 3. I doubt I would make them again, though.

My kids, who are sugar addicts, liked this with chocolate on top.  It is definately a melt in your mouth and if your not careful, crumble in your hands, kind of cookie.  I did add a big pinch of sugar to batter as one review said.

These were a toss up for me, but my husband enjoyed them immensely.  He has incredible self control with food, but it flew out of the window with these cookies.  I found them to have a floury taste to them and the "melt in your mouth" experience was more one of "makes your mouth incredibly sticky/dry" for me.  I'll make these again, but only because he requested them.

Wow! I just made these with my 3 year old son.  What a wonderful discovery.  I am glad I didn't have any eggs for the cookies I was going to make.  These are so easy and so light and really do melt in your mouth.  Sad to say..... I am so excited about these cookies!

I don't have an electric mixer so I whipped this thoroughly with a fork, and it still turned out perfect - silky, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth cookies. I think they're full of flavour. My oven took about 10-11 minutes - I like a tiny bit of browning. They fell apart easily (we didn't care) but (like any cookies) if you let them sit and cool, they're much firmer. Next time I'll squeeze them from a star-shaped nozzle icing bag like another reviewer suggested. They taste like heaven but look a little dull.

These turned out AMAZING when whipped profusely. I did make them without the electric mixer the first time, and though they were crumbly, they were still awesome. I'd highly recommend them for holidays or anytime you're in the mood for some quick and delicious cookies.

This is probably the best recipe for shortbread. My sister was like "wow it melts in my mouth" when she tried it, not even knowing that was the title of the recipe :) I made indents in the center and put strawberry jam in them and baked. MMMMMMMMMM! i will use this recipe for my christmas shortbread baking!

I hate to think of the result of this recipe had I followed the directions.  I baked them for 8 minutes at 325 and even then the bottom is very, very dark.  Next time I'll bake them at 250 or something, because yes, I'll make them again; the taste is lovely & the texture fabulous.  So thanks anyway even though I have a feeling I almost burnt down my house :P

Great recipe!  This is my standard Christmas cookie now.  I always put the dough in the fridge for about half an hour before making the cookies, and I press a fork into the top of each cookie to make a simple pattern.

My first ever shortbread cookies and they came out really good!  They *are* better on day two like another reviewer stated, but all in all really nice.

The dough was easy to work with and they are soft, but they have no taste at all.  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, but it didn't help.

This recipe made the most amazing shortbread! I doubled the recipe (because I wanted to make a lot) and I made 1/2 the butter salted - I thought 375 was way too hot for cookies so I turned it down to 350 and baked them on the top oven rack for 12 mins. Perfect everytime. Thanks!!!

I have tried many shortbread recipes over the years (it's my favorite kind of cookie) and I think this one may be the worst I've ever made.  Didn't have the taste or texture of shortbread.  Powdery with a strange aftertaste and left a coating in the mouth.

So easy to make and yummy. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because it is so crumbly! You have to put the whole cookie in your mouth or you will lose the whole thing to crumbs.

So I was looking for another drop cookie recipe to add to my Christmas collection. I have so many that need a lot of attention before I even bake them, I wanted something easy!!! I was a sceptical as the others about this mix of ingredients, but WOW!!! The cookies are so wonderful and easy. Most shortbread has more butter flavor, so don't expect the usual heavy butter flavor. However, these are so light and tasty, as my husband put it they almost poof in your mouth! I wonderful addition to my permament holiday collection.

Marvelous, as is.  Does work from a cookie press (tastier than spritz), but keep an eye on that baking time.

The texture is unbelievable, the flavour, though good, is almost too mild.  I will likely add just a hint of flavour to my glaze.

A little too powdery for my taste, even after waiting a day as suggested by another reviewer.  There are better shortbread recipes out there, next time I'll try something else.

They came out perfect! Thanks for sharing. Though go with a sweet topping to counterbalance the buttery taste. I used sliced Almonds and they didn't give the cookies any kick.

These are soooo Yummy, they truly do melt in your mouth.  I was not sure how they were going to turn out while I was making them but WOW, they are great.  After I put them on the cookie sheet I flatened them and added a marichino Cherry on top. Yum Yum Yum

As the others stated, these were a bit dry and didn't actually "melt" in my mouth.  Aside from that, the recipe was very easy and "1 bowl recipes" are always good.  I added nuts and covered them in powdered sugar to liven them up a bit.

I am not a shortbread fan, but these were pretty good.  I doubled the recipe, and added 2 tsp of almond extract to the dough.  I used a mini ice cream scoop to make the shape, then I added a couple of slivered almonds to each cookie.  My kids LOVE them.  In fact, I am making my second double batch in a few minutes!
Enjoy and Merry Christmas!

I made these last Christmas and absolutely loved them.  This year I think I'll try them with a mocha icing.  That subtle coffee flavor might be interesting with these cookies.

These were extremely easy to make and honestly melt in your mouth.  They are extremely delicate though and were falling apart as I was taking them off of the cookie sheet, so be careful.  Most of them were breaking apart when picked up.  They were SO good though!  Topped with Christmas sprinkles for a nice touch.

OHMIGOSH! The BEST !!  I didn't have cornstarch so I substituted with 1/4 cup of rice flour.  The results were heavenly!   I also took someones' suggestion of adding vanilla.  I only had a vanilla pod/bean which I scraped out into the whipped butter.  Each yummy cookie is filled with teeny tiny vanilla granules.

One more thing.  My batch was finished within 6-7 minutes at the sugg. temperature.   Watch these delicate drops....Any longer and they could burn I would think.

Thank you Jennifer, for providing the absoloute best shortbread recipe I've ever come across.  I will use this recipe for many years to come.

LOVED this recipe. Actually one comment I got the first time I made them was "the best thing I have ever put in my mouth!" However, my cookies were done after 5 minutes... still perfect though!!

Wow, really good shortbread recipe.  And I didn't have to babysit the bowl or oven!  Really simple and literally melt in your mouth. I put half a cherry in the middle of each right after coming out of the oven for Xmas.

I'm Scottish and my Grandma used to make the world's best shortbread. Well, she passed away last year and so I searched long and hard for an amazing shortbread recipe (she didn't need a recipe) and this one is absolutely great.  I only gave it 4 stars because it would only be perfect if she made it herself.

Excellent!  They seriously melt in your mouth!  I made the mistake of only making half the recipe - these are soo good they will be gone in no time.  Very delicate and light.  Great drizzled with melted chocolate.

Could these be any easier and any tastier?  These cookies do exactly what they claim to do--melt in your mouth!  I shared them with my family and boyfriend's family and all loved them.  Someone even thought I bought them from a bakery!

I made these for a very picky eater for her birthday at the office.  She really liked them.  They weren't my cup of tea, but they really did "melt in your mouth."  I decorated half with a simple icing to share with people who like their cookies a little sweeter, and that tasted pretty good.  I give it 4 stars because everyone seemed pleased and you just can't find an easier recipe.

I thought this recipe was VERY good, the taste was excellent.  My only complaint is that I made them for children and the cookies were so delicate they made a huge mess!!  The children liked them alright but as one 3 year old put it "they taste flour-y".  I guess his palette just isn't refined yet...

I will make these again for sure!!  Thank you for sharing with us.

This is one of those recipes that everyone asks for after they have tasted it. It is the best shortbread around and always a hit. My brother in law loves them and always asks me to make them.

This recipe is definitely easy, but I'm a traditional cookie-burner. I watch the first batch like a hawk, try them out, and tend to forget about the rest. Normally, it's okay if they stay in an extra minute. Not these. The butter in the recipe means they burn up pretty quickly (much to my dismay). Tasty, but even one minute's difference, and they're not so great. I ended up baking them for just six minutes to get them right.
