I really liked this recipe. I didn't have broccoli so I used a frozen vegie mix of beans corn and carrots and I loved it. Leftovers were delightful too. Thanks.

This was really good.  I more than doubled the fresh ginger, added a little more lemon & soy sauce too.  Served over some brown rice I made with more onion, ginger and some tumeric.  Healthy and delicious!

I made this with tofu - great recipe for it! I use a little less chicken broth, a little more soy sauce, and add sriracha to the sauce to give it a kick. It tastes fantastic!

This was very good. I did add 3 cloves of garlic. And the sauce didn't want to thicken very well so I had to whip up another quick slurry to add, but that did the trick.

This was quick and tasty. I skipped the broth component, and substituted orange juice for lemon.

My family enjoyed this meal. I made a few changes to the recipe: 
1. Added 2 gloves of garlic in the sauce. 
2. Used 1 TBSP of lime juice in lieu of lemon juice. 
3. Pounded chicken breasts. 
4. Used the veggies I had: onions, carrots, and celery
5. In lieu of rice, we ate it with Quinoa - more protein : )

Definitely needs more seasoning than what the recipe calls for but it's okay for what it is.

We really liked this but added garlic, snow peas instead of broccoli, and a head of napa cabbage. Yummy!

Very good, used pork instead of chicken, will add a little more ginger though.

I wanted something fast and fresh with a little money. I spent $10 and it fed our family of 3 with left overs. Loved it, used lime because I didn't have lemon, also used red bell peppers skipped the mushrooms and cilantro didn't think it needed it. Served over a bed of rice. Will make this again!

This was pretty mediocre. Needed more cornstarch because it wouldn't thicken, could barely taste the ginger, and thought it needed some spice of sweetness to brighten the taste. It was edible, but I won't be making it again.

There was way too much sauce/broth. The sauce never thickened and was tasteless.  The chicken needs spices or a marinade as it was too bland. Will NEVER make this again!

My husband and I liked this a lot. We have a hot spicy soy sauce that we used and it was yummy. Didn't change anything.

I have a go-to stir fry recipe but was looking for something a bit quicker for weeknights. This recipe wasn't it. The amount of broth  ruined the sauce. No matter how long I cooked it, it just wouldn't thicken, even after adding more cornstarch. By the time I realized the sauce was a lost cause, the vegetables had been sitting in the broth/cornstarch mixture for too long and were overcooked. Only the chicken was salvageable.

This is a good recipe to tweak. It does require more than what is shown, I found that the chicken broth was way too much & the spices not enough...still, a good basic stirfry...
