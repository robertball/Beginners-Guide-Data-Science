Made this for dinner tonight and my family gobbled them all up! For the sauce I found it needed a. It I needed the room on the BBQ, so I made two separate batches, having half in the BBQ, and the other half in the oven. Both ways turned out very good.  I suggest the oven temperature be very high, 400 and cook for 15 min, turn them over and then cook for another 15 min.  The BBQ seemed to cook quicker, use medium to low heat and also 15, turn over and another 15.

Followed the recipe exactly, but not a single person at our dinner party ate more than one which is pretty telling.

No changes to ingredients, baked in oven, added 10 minutes, used a 1 pound pkg of organic baby yams. Very tasty, flavor from lime juice stands out above others, right amount of spice from cumin and chili powder. Husband loved it, I loved it, will make again.

I did this recipe in my Actifry and it tastes great with a lot less oil. Healthier that way.

Be careful not to let them burn. They cooked a lot faster than I thought.

Maybe cook them a little less...Ibaked them. Maybe better on the BBQ. Good flavour but just okay.

These were very tasty and we will do it again. However, they do need lots of grill space and took much less time on a charcoal grill.

I cut the potato in thicker chunks so that it is less work and is more like baked french fries.
Next time I will cut the chili by 1/2.
I halfed the recipe but used 1 1/2potatoes and not just 1.

The seasoning is great, but my family found it a bit oily.  I grilled it in the oven in a oven pan, which was probably the cause (as opposed to grilling it on the barbecue)
