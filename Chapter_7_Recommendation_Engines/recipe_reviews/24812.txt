This is very good, quick and easy!  I had hamburger on hand, so instead of chicken I browned 1lb of hamburger, added about 1/4c. salsa and 1/3 pkg taco seasoning and cooked on med-low for a couple of minutes.  I tossed the salad, cheese, chips and olives with the ranch/salsa mixture and topped it with the taco meat.  Yum!  Next time I will add tomatoes & avacado!

I misread the recipe & thought that it had a home made dressing, by that, I mean not just salad ingredients mixed together with ranch dressing.  Needless to say, as it was my own fault for misreading it, I was disappointed.  I normally use Hidden Valley's  Fiesta Ranch (which rocks over this) for a taco salad because it is more than just ranch dressing with chili powder added, and serve in tortilla shell "bowls".  Sorry Sara. ;)

Very good.  I left the chili powder out by accident, but still good.  Much less fattening than taco salad with sour cream since I used lite dressing. My husband didn't seem to notice the switch either.

I made the low fat buttermilk ranch dressing recipe from this site for the salad. I omitted the black olives and used garden fresh veggies (roma tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers). Instead of crushed tortilla chips, I topped with store bought crushed buttermilk ranch pretzels bits.

This was very simple to prepare and my husband and I both thought it was very delicious! (However, I recommend that you use less Ranch dressing, as it was a bit too much for us.)

This recipe was good although I did find that there was a bit too much ranch dressing in it.  I will definitely make again but won't use as much dressing.  

I also cooked the chicken in taco mix and it added some extra flavour.

Ok......this recipe is so good just the way it is. (I made it) But, when I went to make for the second time........I wanted to make it more substantial and healthy so I added: one red onion cooked until brown and crispy, 1/2 can organic red kidney beans mixed in while I cooked the chicken strips in a little olive oil and taco seasoning, one chopped avocado, 2 chopped tomatoes.  So delicious!!!  And thank you previous poster for directions on the "tortilla bowl".....my teenagers loved it.  Great recipe.

This recipe is great in a tortilla bowl. Thank you to the person on the exchange who gave me the recipe for the bowl. For those of you who would like it, here it is. Preheat oven to 400. Spray both sides of a flour tortilla with cooking spray and place on an inverted custard cup on a baking sheet. Bake 8-10 min. or until browned and crispy (i found that if you take another inverted custard cup and gently push it over the tortilla just slightly while its baking, then it shapes it better) I added avocado and tomatoes. Delicious.

This needs more ingredients to make it a salad. Add some black beans or kidney beans. Maybe some corn. Green onions and tomato is good in it, even some grated carrot would add a dimension to the salad. Lettuce, chicken and olives do not a salad make. Also, as others have said, there is way too much dressing. It swims in dressing.

This was pretty good as is. Something about after the chicken cools off isn't very tastey- probably just a personal pref. We enjoy this recipe with hamburger.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. Very easy to make. My wife cooked boneless skinless chicken tenderloins in a skillet with extra virgin olive oil and seasoned the chicken with Mrs.Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning this added a little extra spice to the salad. We also used medium salsa instead of mild. We only used 8oz of lettuce as we felt 1lb of lettuce was going to be to much. But we definatley enjoyed it and will be making it again!

Very good though clearly very unhealthy. I made it more so by adding sour cream. I also added cilantro which was an excellent idea. Very tasty. And I diced a tomato. Now I won't get prostate cancer. Hurray.

This was delicious.  I tossed it all together in a bowl and then once it was plated I sprinkled diced avocado over the top.

I used a little less cheese and salsa and I left out the black olives.  Next time I will add some canned corn and perhaps some black beans.

Good.  I add a small can of mexicorn and one can of black beans drained and rinsed for more texture, flavor and fiber.  If I have on hand I top each serving with a few slices of avocado.

Absolutely outstanding!!  I agree with the other reviews in that I didn't use the entire bottle of ranch dressing (about 3/4 of it) and it had plenty to coat the ingredients.  I also seasoned my chicken with cajun seasoning for a little added flavor.  In addition I used hot salsa and if you like it spicy, this definitely makes it that way.  Since I don't like olives, I added in some corn and black beans and those were both great additions.

I haven't tried this particular recipe, but I have to question refrigerating the crushed tortilla chips. I've made other recipes using seasoned ground beef and pinto beans, as well as chopped tomatoes. The tortilla chips in the leftover salad are soggy.

I fried 1" thick chicken breasts on medium/low heat seasoned with salt, pepper and a garlic and herb rub.  They were juicy and had a great flavor.  I made the salad according to the recipe, but it just didn't taste that good.  It needed more flavors.

This is great!  I usually broil my chicken breasts for this one.  I also recommend putting the salsa and ranch dressing in the blender to combine-it tastes fabulous on this salad!

Been making a recipe like this for years with the following changes - place lettuce on each person's plate, top with diced fresh tomatoes, shredded cheese, olives.  Cook chicken, add 1/4 cup salsa and 1/4 cup ranch dressing and mix just till warm.  Put some on top of each salad, and top with crumbled tortilla chips if desired.  We prefer it this way as the warm chicken/sauce melts the cheese a little.

I have made this taco salad for some 35 years except I use french dressing (orange), I also add green onions with some chili to top it off.  You can use chicken, ground beef or steak.

I thought this was good I would have liked it better if it had more flavor.  Next time I am going to use better salsa you know with black beans and corn in it maybe if I make the salsa myself it would be better.  I added olives and red onions and ground beef not chicken.

Not bad for a quick lunch or dinner, but adding the torttila chips to the mixture and chilling? I guess some people like soggy chips. I suggest adding the chips just before you serve the salad.

This was fantastic. I made the chicken the night before and threw in a tsp taco seasoning instead of chili powder. Instead of throwing everything together I left them seperate so each one of my children could build thier own taco salad in a Tortilla taco bowl. I added onion , chopped tomatoes, and avacado to the table.

This is the first time I have ever made a Taco SAlad of any kind. I can't imagine it without Ranch dressing and with beans now. All 4 kids loved it. I did listen to previuos posts and lower the ranch dressing to 6ounces tho. FAMTASTIC!

MMM soooo good.  Not sure if it was a mistake writing a full 8oz bottle of ranch because that is far to much for me but luckily I just went by what looked sufficient.  Definitely a crowd pleaser and am adding this to my monthly meal plan!!

This is an excellent combination of ingredients.  I used an organic mix of baby greens, and the result was out of this world!

Pretty good!  I used fat free ranch to make it a little more healthy.  I didn't really measure the ingredients, just estimated.  I also used chopped pre-cooked/seasoned chicken strips. We had this for dinner along with chips and hot cheese salsa.

I made this for a potluck and it disappeared quickly.  I would use a bit less dressing and salsa next time, and don't make it too far ahead or the tortilla chips will be too soggy.

Really good. I used chipotle ranch dressing instead of salsa and ranch. Added cut grape tomatoes, drained black beans, and thawed from corn. Great with Doritoes.
