Hi everyone!  This is my recipe.  Because it's kitchen tested I think the yield may have been modified- my original submission was for mini cupcakes, and I always use a piping bag and tip for frosting (which makes them mile-high, but no one ever seems to complain about it if you catch my drift)!  That said, you should carefully watch larger cakes in your oven as this is the time I use for miniature cakes. If the batter seems way too dense, add a bit more milk to your liking, and always remember to use a stand or hand mixer.  Enjoy!

These are amazing.  I made these for Easter and everyone said they were the best cupcakes they'd ever eaten.  I only gave this recipe four stars not for ingredients, but for yield.  I used regular muffin pans and the recipe only made 19 small cupcakes - I was wondering what they would rise like or I could've made 12.  That being said, the frosting recipe makes enough for 3 times what you need...so next time I make this (which will be often!) I will double the cake recipe and half the frosting recipe.  
The frosting seems too sweet on its own, but don't be fooled - once you put it on a lemon cupcake the flavors balance perfectly!
I also added fresh blackberries on top for a pretty garnish to the cupcake.

Amazingly delicious! 5 stars for taste! Rave reviews from the family. Only change I made was that I used red raspberry preserves instead of blackberry simply because that is what I had. It worked perfectly. So lemony and refreshing - the flavors compliment eachother wonderfully. As written the recipes does NOT produce 24 cupcakes, I got 16 out of mine. I cut the frosting in half and had the perfect amount to frost 16 cupcakes...if I would have made the entire amount of frosting it would have been way too much.

I must be honest that as I mixed up both the cake batter and the frosting I was initially somewhat disappointed with both. The batter, due to the lemon juice, was just a teensy bit on the curdled side but once it was good and mixed it seemed to have corrected. The frosting appeared sticky and gummy, not light, creamy and "cloud-like" as I would have liked. The cupcakes did bake up real pretty, and when I put them together with the frosting I was very pleased. Took a bite of the cake by itself - great lemony vanilla flavor, light and fluffy, with an airy crumb, and very moist, even it being a butter cake! But I do have a criticism - while the cake was indeed moist and airy, it was also somewhat crumbly, unable to support itself with its fragility. Too much baking powder may be to blame -were I to make this again I'd probably reduce it to maybe 1-1/2 teaspoons. The frosting piped on much better than it looked in the bowl, and when I took a forkful of the cake and the frosting together, it was sheer bliss. Very nicely flavored frosting, with neither too much nor too little flavor from the jam. Whether you use blackberry as directed or raspberry as I did, the lemon/berry contrast in this cupcake is a match made in heaven. This falls short of perfection only for the fact that the cake was moist, but crumbly - something easily remedied, I believe, by simply reducing the amount of baking powder. One other critical issue is the yield - I got 14, not 24, standard-sized cupcakes!

I thought this cupcake was pretty tasty. My lemons were a little on the smaller side so, I used two and had a good lemon flavor. The frosting was a tad too sweet on its own but, had a balance when eaten with the lemon cake. I personally think it would have been better if I added more blackberry jam to it or mixed in fresh pureed blackberries. I'll try that next time! Mmmm. I will also be trying this with different berries in the future. 

**Note: My first batch of cupcakes came out really dense and flat on top. I tried it again with a new can of baking powder and it made all the difference! Second batch came out nice and fluffy. Make sure your baking powder is still active by placing a half tsp. or so in hot water, it will bubble immediately if still good. Don't go by the exp. date on the can. The first can I used wasn't expired but, barely bubbled. I should've tested it first before I baked that first batch. =/

I love the cupcakes themselves. I did add more lemon juice since I wanted the flavor to really stand out. They are very dense, so add more milk if you want them to be lighter; leave as is if you want more muffin consistency. Now the frosting... I've made buttercream tons of times, so seeing the ingredients/instructions on this already had me raising an eyebrow. Before I even added the jam, it tasted like nothing but butter. I would never, ever, in my life, make it again. These went to work with me - I work up early to make them and was simply out of time. Not one single person didn't comment on how it tasted just like butter & jam. Most buttercream recipes call for a mix of butter/shortening to avoid the pure butter flavor which I think is exactly where I think the frosting recipe goes wrong.

I made these today to top my Mother's Day off.  I had my children help me with this.  The cupcakes came out so nice and fluffy, I let them bake for 20 minutes.  The buttercream came out great.  I think next time I make the buttercream I may add just a tiny squeeze of lemon juice to carry on the lemon in the cupcakes.  The taste testers in my house gave an all thumbs up.  I just finished mine and I think it is wonderful.  It reminds me of the cupcakes I would get from our local cupcake shop.  This is my first fully homemade cupcake and I think I am hooked.  It took the same amount of time as the box stuff.  We have found a new love.  Will make again!

Made the raspberry version and it was DELICIOUS!  I cut the whole recipe in half to make 12 cupcakes, and I had the perfect amount of icing (ok, I lied, I had about 1 cupcake's worth of icing left, which I ate. With a spoon.).  I had a beautiful swirl of icing on top. The cupcakes didn't fill their whole liner, so I guess they could have made fewer cupcakes then what the recipe called for, and then of course less icing would have been used. But anyways, delicious!

The recipe only made 12 standard cupcakes, but the taste is delicious. Light and slightly lemony, great for spring or summer. I used raspberry jam instead of blackberry, and subbed shortening for half of the butter in the frosting, just so it would hold up better in the heat. I'll be making these again.

SO Good and super easy no fail recipe! Substituted bottled lemon juice & used strawberry preserves in the frosting as it was what was on hand. Combo was like having strawberry lemondade! Same as others said this recipe yielded 16 cupcakes and I made half the recommended frosting and it was plenty. Making as a cake today! Thanks for a great new fav!

Absolutely delish.  My family is all very health conscious so I made these in mini muffin tins so each cupcake was only two bites.  I sent half the batch to my mothers house and the other half to the in-laws.  The only change I made to the recipe was to practically double the amount of blackberry jam...  I would taste the frosting, add another spoonful of jam, turn the mixer back on and then taste the frosting again... I'm not sure it was ever quite enough.  Eventually I had to stop before it compromised the consistency of the frosting.  But that's just me!  I topped each cupcake with a fresh blackberry and a lemon balm leaf from my garden.

Review only for the cupcake: I've made these a few times, and I love the flavor (I don't understand how some people end up with a subtle lemon flavor if you use the juice and zest of a whole lemon). Small issues with the recipe: I always get 21 cupcakes (I use regular size muffin pans) and the cupcakes always separate from the paper liners (any suggestions for what I may be doing wrong?!)
I have a slight obsession with cream cheese frosting so I always use that on these cupcakes and its absolutely delicious!

The cake is very dense & moist. Didn't rise well but is dense enough that it can hold a filling well. I used 3 tablespoons of lemon juice & 1 tsp of lemon extract. The cupcakes are pretty lemony, but not very 'zingy'. You won't get 24 out of this. Maybe 12 or 14 normal-sized cupcakes. Regarding the frosting, I also cut the recipe in half and got JUST enough frosting for 14 cupcakes. Mixed it with wilton's strawberry filling instead of blackberry jam (I was working with what I had on hand!). Added extra lemon juice, to taste, to the filling to get a bit of zing there.

I'm only rating the frosting because I didn't make this recipe for the lemon cake.  The frosting was fabulous!  I did add about another 1/4 cup of blackberry jam and it did soften it up a tiny bit.  It was a crowd pleaser and will be a repeat!

We loved it! I liked this recipe because it got its lemon flavor from actual lemons vs. lemon pudding or jello. This will be a favorite for our family.

This is just a review for the cupcake, I made a lighter, strawberry whipped cream + gelatin frosting instead of the jam buttercream.  

After the batter was mixed up, I had doubts, it was just too darn easy, there were no whipped egg whites, no multi bowl directions, i.e., having one bowl for egg whites, another for the wet ingredients and another for the dry, this was a one bowl recipe.  I diverged just a bit, not in ingredients, those I followed exactly, but in the execution, I mixed in the baking powder before adding the flower and mixed the lemon zest in with the sugar, being sure to squeeze them a bit, hoping to extract even more lemon flavor.  

The cupcakes didn't rise as much as I expected, I ended up with 12 smallish cupcakes and 4 regular size (after filling the first tray, I decided to fill the baking cups higher on the second batch so that I'd have fuller, above the paper brim cupcakes this time).  

Before making the frosting, I tested one cupcake, it was light, spongy and had a nice hint of lemony flavor.  All in all, a lovely little cake.  Since the cakes are so light and airy, I think they could stand up to a heavier frosting, something cream cheese based.  I chose a whipped frosting because that is what my family prefers, but a thick, chocolate frosting would be amazing on these cupcakes.

Amaaaazing recipe!! Total hit!!! I was worried that the batter was too dense, but they turned out so fluffy and delicate!! I used allpurpose flour, the one that comes with baking powder, and still added the baking powder the recipe called for, and they turned out great, but the first batch I filled the cups 3/4 with the batter, and the kind of overflew the cupcake cups. The second batch I only filled half of the cup and they were sooooo beautiful!!  And for the frosting, I used shortening instead of regular butter and instead of jam, I made blackberry coulis (put the blackberries in a saucepan with sugar and some liquor and bring it to a boil for some minutes, procesed and sifted to get rid of the seeds... Amazing!

The combination of lemon and blackberry is superb and the little cakes with purple frosting look so pretty! As others stated, the cake recipe doesn't yield 24 cupcakes. I ended up with 15. It doesn't rise a lot, so if you fill the papers about 2/3 of the way, the cake should rise just to the top of the papers. The buttercream icing does seem a little sweet on its own, but as soon as you put it on the lemon cake, it's perfect!  I would also like to try it with strawberry or raspberry jam next time.

The buttercream was great (I used strawberry preserves), but the cake portion of the recipe seemed off. The cakes didn't rise at all and I was left with flat-topped, burnt cupcakes. I had to trim them quite a bit and thought they'd surely be a disaster. Thankfully, I was able to hide the mess with a lot of frosting. I'd use the frosting recipe again, but not the cake one.

I made the cake portion of this cake exactly as instructed and it was moist and delicious.  I did not have jam to make the frosting, but used 3 Tb of lemon juice and lemon zest in place of the jam and omitted the vanilla and it was super tasty and complimented the cake very well.  I made a cake instead of cupcakes because I didn't have cupcake liners.  It fit nicely in my smaller 9x5 pan.  I will be making this again really soon as it was gone in one night. On a side note...I used a large lemon.

I followed this recipe exactly after finding it on Pinterest. The cupcake was heavy, like poundcake, and the frosting was over the top sweet. Disappointed.  I love sweets but this recipe was no good for me....

This is an amazing recipe!  So light and full of bright flavor.  Followed the recipe as is.  Something different than just chocolate cupcakes.  It was a huge hit for my dinner party. Will definitely make again.

These are pretty yummy!  Took suggestions of everyone and cut the frosting recipe in half since this doesn't make 24....I got 14.  All in all great though I will make them again for sure :)

I followed the recipes exactly and found that I needed to add an additional 2 tbs lemon juice to get a nice lemony flavor from the cake...  However dense, my cupcakes rose well and had good consistency.  

As for the frosting, I halved it as others suggested, yet added between 1/2 - 3/4 c. blackberry jam to get a true blackberry-ish flavor.    It is also a VERY sweet frosting, but was told that the balance between the cake and the frosting was really good.

I made these for Mother's Day and they were awesome!  The batter to so versatile that it will be my new "go-to" recipe for any flavored cupcakes!  I doubled the cake recipe and got 42 cupcakes. I added quite a bit more lemon juice because I wanted the flavor to really come through and I'm glad I did!  The cupcakes do not rise very much; I filled the cupcake pans 3/4 full and they rose just up to the edge of the paper cupcake liners.  I also made a quick filling using some cream cheese, lemon curd, and powdered sugar and filled the cupcakes after they were cooled.  I rolled a blackberry in sugar and placed it on the top of the icing.  Very professional looking!

I only made the frosting since I already had a lemon mix, but it just tasted like butter and sugar. You really don't taste the blackberry at all. And I even added more jam to the mix. I think using some other flavor of jam would be better. I won't be making this recipe again.

I loved the combo of lemon and blackberry.  Great moist lemony cake.  This recipe only yielded 16 regular sized cupcakes for me as well.  I made a cream cheese frosting with fresh blackberries instead of making the buttercream with jam.  Since blackberries are in season now, it is delicious and very berry.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This cupcake recipe is great! the texture is really really good. I added extra lemon juice and zest cause i did find the lemon flavor at first to be too sutil. I also replaced the buttercream with blackberry meringue...thought it was a healthier choice.

This makes 12 cupcakes, not more.
They tasted good, but I did add a little lemon extract, because the batter didn't taste at all like lemon. I made strawberry-lemon frosting for these. Baked  20-22 minutes.

I made a double batch of batter as others noted for the 24 cupcakes.  The icing was the perfect amount for 24 cupcakes as a little extra is needed when using an icing tip for decor.  These were superb and I got rave reviews!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tasty and refreshing cupcakes! The recipe yielded 24 minis and 6 regular cupcakes. I divided the icing recipe in half and added half an 8 oz container of cream cheese to it. I had just enough icing, so none went to waste. Although I tasted quite a bit while making it :-)

This recipe is abselouey a keeper. The cake is moist and the frosting is to die for . This combination is perfect. I think they're the best cupcakes I've ever had... I have one suggestion. Don't put too much frosting on because it is very powerful and you still want to taste the lemon. This is definetly a five star cupcake

I ended up with a lot of extra frosting but it was so good people ate it straight. Don't change a thing.

One thing to note: I made this a second time, halving the icing recipe and I used natural/organic butter (Kerigold)... I needed to add more than necessary to get it to whip up properly. Tasted great though, it just needed 2-3 extra tablespoons of butter. When I made it with normal (land o' lakes) I didn't need to change anything.

These are delicious!  One minor gripe: it only makes 18 small cupcakes. I'll definitely double it next time.  I made half Blackberry and half Raspberry Buttercream.  Personally, I like the Raspberry more, but I'm biased, lol.  Amazing recipe, though!  :)  Thank you!

So this recipe did work... BUT I gotta admit I was kinda terrified the whole time it was in the oven. The batter was thick, and heavy, and seemed like I was going to end up with little cupcake flavored hockey pucks.... BUT they came out 20min later just perfect! I modified the icing because I fundamentally am against buttercream frosting that doesn't have cream in it - but the addition of the fruit jam was nice.

I made this recipe & I used strawberry jelly instead. It was good, but a little too sugary. I also made big cupcakes, so there were only 12, so I halved the frosting. I  put a ton of frosting on each cupcake, and half of the frosting was still in the bowl!! yum, though.

I'm rating these on the cupcakes only. They were very moist and dense, just how I like my cupcakes. The frosting didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I substituted strawberry jam for the blackberry, and my frosting was not of a piping consistency; it was too soft and loose but it had a great flavor.

I would give this five stars, but this recipe only made about 16 small cupcakes. The flavor was great, cake itself is a bit dense so having these smaller actually works better. I substituted with (strained) boysenberry preserves since that's what I had. YUM. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  I didn't change a thing, and these were fantastic!  It makes a very light and fluffy cupcake with a great lemon flavor.  The only problem is that I only got 13 cupcakes out of it, not the 24 the recipe says it makes.  I just whipped up a regular butter cream frosting instead of the blackberry.

Wonderful recipe. I made it into a 9*9 cake instead of cupcakes and it was perfect. The cake was dense and very flavorful, and the frosting perfectly complements the lemon in the cake. I used strawberry jam though and added an extra cup of powdered sugar to the frosting for firmness. I think this is my new favorite cake :)

Best. Lemon. Cupcake. EVER.  I followed the recipe for the cupcakes exactly (it made 15) and the only thing I changed about the frosting was that I used a seedless blackberry all-fruit spread with no sugar added.  It was plenty sweet! This is one of those recipes that a girl could get famous for if she takes the cupcakes to any kind of a gathering!

Good flavor combo but the frosting was too sweet for me.  I made 12 full cupcakes and only prepared half the frosting.  There was plenty of frosting.  
I'm a cupcake novice so it was probably my fault by the texture was not good...not fluffy and not moist/dense.  Maybe I overbeat?

The cupcake itself is awesome and relatively simple. (This was my first cupcake from scratch)
The frosting needs some work.... It's really sweet, REALLY SWEET. I didn't add all of the sugar it called for and next time I will use fresh blackberries instead of the jam. 
I had a little bit of frosting left and squished up a blackberry into it to see how it would taste and it was much better and kicked up the the berry flavor tremendously. 
I will be making these again, just with some changes to the frosting. :)

Wow Megan! Thank you so very much for posting this recipe. It is AMAZING!! I have been making cupcakes from scratch for years now and this is one of the best recipes ever. I used Raspberry and it was great. I doubled the recipe and it made 24 regular sized cupcakes. I did not double the frosting recipe and it was enough to frost 24 of them. Everyone at the party raved about them. Thank you so much and if you do have any other recipes like this please post them.

The frosting was excellent!  The lemon cupcakes were just ok.  They had the consistancy of cornbread.  Next time I will use the lemon cupcakes from Our Best Bites with this frosting.  The lemon blackberry combo is fantastic.

These were truly amazing cupcakes, what a great recipe.  I tripled the batter to make three dozen and made 1 and a half times the icing.  I really wanted to make the blackberry buttercream but unfortunately I was unable to find seedless blackberry jam; I used raspberry jam instead. Nevertheless they were amazing.

I made this as a cake for a co-worker's birthday. Everyone absolutely loved it! Every slice I cut got taken away very quickly, before I knew it, it was all gone. I doubled the cupcake recipe and kept the frosting measurements the same, it made a full two layer cake and plenty of frosting.

I made these into rainbow cupcakes, and it worked really well! I found the 20-25 min cooking time to be a bit long. I took them out at 20 minutes and those in normal paper-lined pans were a little more burned on the bottom than I would have liked, though the silicon cup ones came out perfectly. As others mentioned, the frosting recipe is huge compared to the cupcake recipe. I doubled the cupcake recipe, which made 24 normal sized cupcakes for me (six of them in silicon cups), and still had a little bowl of frosting left. I'm sure we'll find a use for it, though!

this was amazing! everyone loved it and i'm making it again this weekend. everyone pretty much had the same opinion "not enough" we literally argued over the last one :D

followed some other reviewer's advice and doubled the batter but kept the icing the same, because that was A LOT of icing :) leftover to eat from the bowl though, so I can't say we were disappointed in the least!

Such a unique recipe! I forgot baking powder and they were still awesome. Cut frosting recipe in half, as others have said. Also add 50% more milk. I'm making another batch soon and will probably double the amount of lemon. I also think the frosting, depending on your preferences, could have more blackberry jam added to make it a little fruitier. YUM!

Since other reviews said to add more milk for a less dense cupcake, I added 2 more tablespoons of milk.  I also added 1/4 tsp of salt to the batter as I believe it goes there and not in the frosting, and used 2 lemons since they were small.  For the frosting I used a traditional buttercream and added lemon juice and zest to that.

I used a cup of milk instead of half a cup (as suggested by the comments) and they came out very light and fluffy!!! I also added probably a cup of blackberry jam instead—I measured out half a cup and then dumped in more till it was to a taste I liked. I found that with just the half a cup, it kind of just dyed the frosting instead of flavoring it, and even with the amount I put in, the taste was still overwhelmingly buttercream and not blackberry (which is what I was more going for). However, my friends mom almost cried when tasting it from how good they were, so DEFINITELY a major recommendation from me!

Super easy and extremely tasty!!  I took this to work to test out on co-workers before I made it for my parent’s party in a couple of weeks. It was a winner.  Lemony but not too much. Just perfect and the frosting was to die for!

I didn't think the batter had enough lemon flavor so I added the zest of one additional lemon.  When done, they were still not lemony enough so I filled them with lemon curd and added an extra dollop under the buttercream.  The blackberry buttercream was not great on it's on but with the tartness of the lemon curd, it worked in one bite.  If I ever do a berry buttercream again, I'll remember to choose a different berry!

I made these and they were  absolutely  delightful. They stayed moist for the 4 days until the last one was gone! I did half the recipe for my family of 2. I didn’t have the jam for the frosting so I made it to the point of adding the jam and substituted milk to get it to spreading consistency. It’s a very good buttercream frosting. I also used lemon extract to compliment the lemon in the cupcakes since I wasn’t using the jam. I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will be sure I have the jam so I can see how the flavors turn out. I am intrigued.

Decent flavors, could have used more lemon. However, every time I make these the cupcakes are very dense. I do not have this issue with other recipes, so its not my ingredients/measurements

It was a good cupcake a tip if you don't have blackberry's for the buttercream is to just add any jam and it will taste wonderful.

I added about I teaspoon of lemon extract to batter. The cake has nice flavor but definitely gets dense after it cools. I added about another 1/3 cup milk based on other reviews and should have added more to get more of a cake consistency. I used strawberry jam and shortening for half the butter so it would have a better consistency. The icing turned out great this way.

The texture and taste were phenomenal. Light in texture, full of flavor. Not dense or heavy at all. I will make again and again, varying flavors. This time I substituted orange rind for the lemon and made an orange buttercream frosting. Delicious.

The timing was all wrong!!!! I cooked mine for 20 minutes and they turned out hard as rocks and they were burned. You also need to add extra baking powder to make it less dense and more milk. On the icing I had to add so much milk to make it buttercream frosting — without it, it was buttercream fondant. The recipient did not even mention the fact of using milk to get that buttercream consistency. THIS RECIPE IS NOT GOOD — FIND A NEW ONE OR MAKE SOMETHING ELSE!!!

Yum!  Followed the exact instructions and since this was my first time using zest and lemon juice (medium sized lemon used) in a recipe I figured out quickly that you really do need a cooling rack and to remove the cupcakes from the tin when able.  The yield I had was 16 cupcakes.    The cupcakes are a little wet at the bottom through their cups when they are cooling but the rack fixed that easily.   They are super moist and just the right amount of tangy lemon flavor if you are a fan of lemon desserts.   I made the frosting but halved the recipe.  It's very declicious with the blackberry jam but it was a bit runny my first attempt.   Just letting them set in the fridge, but for a first arrempt at this delightful dessert, I am pleased.

The icing is fantastic, but the cupcakes turned out slightly dry for me and I only baked them ~19 minutes. I will definitely try again and see if it may have been a mistake on my end!

I use this recipe all the time, except for the icing.  (I use Chef John’s Cream Cheese Frosting).  This recipe makes the exact 12 cupcakes I’m looking for, plus I add crushed up frozen raspberries.  Cooking takes longer because the dough gets very cold due to frozen raspberries - about 25 min.  Instead of fresh lemon, I just use 2 tbsp bottled lemon juice.

These were a hit! Made some modifications based on reviews. I doubled the cupcake recipe as I wanted 20+ standard sized cupcakes. They took about 25 minutes to bake in my oven at same temp recommended in the recipe. I did a single batch of the icing and on recommendation of a previous review, I used half butter and half shortening as I don’t care for a strong butter flavor. I also cut down to only 3 cups of confectioners sugar. The icing was plenty sweet and the consistency was just fine for piping on. Cupcakes were dense, but delicious. These will be one of my go-to treats!

Very good cake and just enough sweatiness in the frosting. The blackberry on top was perfect.

I added some color to the icing portion of the recipe did not like the turn out of the color with the blackberry jam alone. Mine turned out a pretty blue which was preferred. I also added more lemon than required as it takes about one and a half lemons or lemon juice itself to really get the zest and taste. Overall beautiful recipe and easy to make!!! Will make again.

I’m giving a 3 because the frosting was too sweet and was so runny. I tried to fix it but it was still too sweet. I even made 2 batches. The lemon cupcake part was great just not frosting.

I doubled the recipe, as recommended by other commentators, to get 24 cupcakes and they exploded over the top of the liners and ended up looking like mushrooms. They do taste nice and have an ok texture, a bit crumbly, but I’ll have to watch the level of batter if I make them again.

Delicious! Very easy to make, tasted amazing, I made mini cupcakes and this yielded more than 24 for me, and I made the frosting with a cup less of powdered sugar and it was plenty for all my cupcakes and tasted perfect.
Made these for my daughters 1st birthday!

Really like this recipe! They were a little dense in my opinion, but my family loved them. I used raspberry preserves instead of blackberry preserves for the frosting and let me say it was DELICIOUS. The batter made 12 regular-sized cupcakes (took about 23 min to bake) and 6 mini ones (took about 17 min to bake). I ended up cutting the frosting recipe in half (just because I ran out of butter whoops) but I had just enough frosting. Thanks so much for the recipe, will be making again!

I made these for a friend's birthday and everyone really enjoyed them.  Many reviewers said it only made approximately 12 full size cupcakes, so I made one plus an additional half recipe which yielded 20 cupcakes. The single recipe of buttercream was enough to pipe on all 20. I baked mine for 18 minutes and they were moist and a good texture. I followed batter recipe exactly, but added a small amount of milk to the buttercream to make it less stiff. Blackberry flavor was nice. You could use any flavor of seedless jam that works with lemon. I liked that the blackberry jam made the frosting a lovely pale violet.

Was looking for something interesting to do with fresh blackberries and stumbled across this recipe. It required me to make a sort of jam first but that wasn't too difficult. I used lemon juice but no zest. The texture of these cupcakes is perfect and moist. I do wish they had more of a lemon flavor but maybe the missing zest is why. As for the buttercream, mine wasn't really a fluffy and creamy buttercream once my "jam" was added. Others' pics look good so am guessing my jam is to blame. In either case, my icing still held its form and tasted absolutely fantastic. In fact, even with a less than ideal buttercream, the resulting cupcake is one, probably more like 2-3, that I would gladly pay for. This recipe is outstanding in flavor and I will definitely make again to see if my methods are to blame for the buttercream. Either way, I will be thrilled to eat more mistakes :)

I love this recipe.  I followed it exactly the first time and the cupcakes turned out great.  They are pretty & they taste wonderful.  I love the frosting recipe so much, I have used it with different fruits (jellies).  So far I've done a peach version and a strawberry version with white cupcakes and fruit fillings.

I doubled the recipe, but only really needed twenty cupcakes (though baked 24). Should have made 1.5x the recipe. I also used 1 tbsp of baking powder total (double recipe). I only frosted twenty cupcakes and one recipe and that was sufficient. I will add more lemon or lemon extract next time as they were not lemony enough. I also added about a 1/4 cup of applesauce to the double batch of the batter because I was making them ahead of time for a party and I feel like applesauce keeps them moist. I didn't replace the butter. Just full on added the applesauce. I thought that worked well; they were quite moist.

Everyone loved this tart lemony cupcake. I did find that it made about 20 medium cupcakes. I halved the amount of frosting and did one half with raspberry and the other with blackberry.  We don't like quite as much frosting on our cupcakes, as the pictures show.  I really liked the raspberry flavour. They are really pretty with the berry on top.

These cupcakes turned out really well! I love lemon so much so I was a little disappointed when I didn't get a strong lemon taste (and I used 2 lemons instead of 1). I would add more lemon next time but the cakes were great! I topped mine with a strawberry champagne buttercream instead and they were delicious!

Made is exactly as written, using my own homemade blackberry jam.  This may be one of the best cupcakes I have ever had. It made 16 cupcakes for me though, not 24. That was no big deal because after looking at the recipe I was guessing 14 to 16 instead of 24. I can't wait to make these for  the next family or friend get together, just so everyone can try them!

These cupcakes are fantastic but the buttercream is even better!!  I didn't have blackberry jam so I used raspberry jam and it was soooo delicious.  I just had to make the buttercream again, and this time I used it to top chocolate cupcakes for Valentine's Day.  Everybody loved the buttercream.  I can't wait to try it again with blackberry jam.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe turned out really well.  The combination of lemon and blackberry is delicious.  I got 18 standard cupcakes rather than 24.  Next time I would cut the baking time a little, my cupcakes could have been moister.
The buttercream went through my pastry bag perfectly, held its shape well.  For my taste, it was too dense.  I want to try to create a lighter version using half the butter and maybe a little cream.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the blackberry buttercream is the best frosting/icing I've ever had in my life hands down! The cupcake was dry, though. Still, I'll make the frosting again!

I used lemon juice because I did not have a lemon -- I do not recommend doing this! The lemon flavor is dulled substantially, even after adding about 3 tablespoons. I really like this recipe, and my family likes it too! :)

I don't know exactly what I did. I followed he recipe exact but the cupcakes came out very lemony (which we loved) but had a very bitter aftertaste. I don't know what exactly what went wrong.

I substituted low-fat milk for 2% (that's the type we usually get), and I added more blackberries on top. The frosting is a little bit too sweet, so maybe add a little bit less confectioners sugar (I even added less than the recipe said to add), but it's overall great.

These were pretty good cupcakes. There were a few problems though. The first thing was that even though the recipe said it would make 24, I somehow got only 12.(That was before I realized they were supposed to be mini cupcakes.) I suspected it would be the same with the frosting, so I followed the recipe exactly, but then there was way too much frosting. In fact, I still have some in a container in my fridge now, and I made them a week ago. The good thing is that the frosting is delicious, but next time I will definitely put more blackberry jam in it. The cupcakes themselves taste rather like a muffin than a cupcake. Also, when I finished the batter, it was too lumpy and more like cookie dough than cake batter. Next time, I think I will cut back on the flour or add more milk like  suggested. I will try these again, and hope to come back with a five-star review. :)

Very good cupcake.  The recipe doesn't state an exact amount of lemon juice.  I used 4 TBLS of juice from a lemon.  That amount gave the cake a wonderful light lemon flavor.  I also did the  blackberry frosting with a berry on top.  My personal preference would be that the cake be a little more moist.  However, these were a hit!  Everyone loved them!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! This was my first time ever making cupcakes & frosting from scratch & it was super successful. It only made 12 though. I had fairly small lemons so I added 1 extra.

The icing was much too sweet and the cake was a bit crumbly. However, my husband thought the cup cakes I did not ice were a super lemon muffin.

I made these today and they were so beautiful and delicious. I added an extra half of all ingredients for the batter and left the icing recipe as is. I was left with 20 cupcakes. Next time I will try to make less icing and more cupcakes as others have instructed.

I was really looking forward to making this, but I didn't read the review that it was for mini cupcakes! I don't have a mini pan so I only got a few cupcakes out of the batter. The batter didn't rise very well and the icing was too thick. I think this could be a great recipe, so I'll try again.

I thought it was absolutely delicious! I did half the frosting recipe because of the 4 cups of powdered sugar was a lot. It ended up being the perfect amount of frosting with a piping bag. I give these cupcakes a definite 5 star review and will make these again!!

I'm only rating the cake batter here.  It halves well, I got 7 regular-sized cupcakes out of it.  It's good, a solid, simple lemon-tinged batter.  Next time, I think I'll up the zest and juice for a bit more zing.

I'm 14 and made this recipe very easily. The cupcakes were very moist and had a great lemon flavour as well as the buttercream. The only complaint I have is that there was a TON of buttercream left. However, it's very good and I can probably easily find a recipe to use the rest of the buttercream. Only than that, they were delicious and everyone loved them.

It could use some more flavor so I added some lemon extract and a packet of lemonade kool aid mix to the batter. The icing however was a mess. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with a runny batter.

The flavor was amazing, however I had some execution issues. Not sure if it was me or the recipe. My icing wasn't very stiff, it wasn't runny, but it didn't hold it's shape as well as I thought it should. Also my cupcakes were deliciously moist, but a little bit crumbly. Not a lot. Just enough that they made a mess while eating them.

Delicious! I don't usually read reviews before making a dish since most people seem to rate their version rather than the original recipe, however I wish I had read these reviews first. The portions are off which means you don't have enough batter for 24 full size cupcakes. Either double the batter or make mini cupcakes.

I thought that the cake and the frosting were to dense and thick. I liked the idea of blackberry in the frosting, but i thought the frosting was to sweet so i added about a half a lemon's worth of lemon juice and i liked it a little better. The lemon didn't really come through the batter.  I won't make this again, but if i do I will definitely make it with a different frosting recipe and just add the blackberry flavor. However my sisters liked it because they aren't very picky.

These tasted great! I used my family's homemade raspberry jam instead of blackberry, and it was delicious. Next time I will double the cupcake batch though, since it only made about 18 regular sized cupcakes. Super yummy!

Taste of summer! Just the right amount of lemon. Cupcakes were moist and flavorful. Did not have blackberry jam so I mashed some of the blackberries through a strainer. I got a very thick fruit puree which I added to the frosting which cut some of the sweetness of the frosting. Made exactly a dozen cupcakes. I would make these again!

I love this recipe!! The only thing I did different was I used boysenberry jam that tasted great in the frosting. My only fault was that the frosting came out super liquidy and I have no clue what I did wrong.

pretty tasty. cake is heavier than your typical cupcake but I like that. more full and sturdy, but not dry. I do feel that the lemon overpowers the blackberry some, but I still loved it

This cupcakes were delicious! Especially the frosting. The first batch I made came out very dense, but the second time when I halved the recipe I used the full lemon, resulting in a slightly lighter cake that had much more lemon flavor.

Make sure ingredients are room temperature.  This insured the mixture was not crumbly.  I measured lemon juice to help be more consistent each time. I used 2 small to medium lemons, equaled 1/4 cup lemon juice. I used a heaping Tablespoon of batter in mini muffin pans.  This made 30 cupcakes. Baked for 16-17 minutes.  Next time I plan on using more lemon!  These were light and not too dense.

The muffins tasted ok, but I found them to be a little tough. The frosting was good, but very runny, (even after I let the frosting sit in the refrigerator to thicken up for well over an hour)...Still runny! I found just a 1/2 cup of butter will make this frosting a little stiffer in texture to spread over the muffins.

It was pretty easy to make, less then an hour and 20 minutes. I also had to use more then 1/2 cup of jam, maybe a cup or so. I made this for my church and all they could talk about was the cupcakes!!!! We all loved them! I would like to make them again!

If I ever did make this again, definitely would double the batter recipe and cut the frosting portion in half! Waaaaay too much! I garnished with blueberries, and used 99% cocoa dark chocolate shavings, overtop. Delicious!

Very good cupcake.  I didn't have an actual lemon, so I had to use lemon juice.  I wasn't sure exactly how much juice was in one lemon.  I don't think I added enough, as it didn't taste too lemony.  I will be making these again!  Also, I only wanted 12 cupcakes so I cut the recipe in half.  I ended up with only 8 cupcakes, so I think the proportions are a little off.

I followed the cupcake recipe exactly and they were fantastic! Light and fluffy with a hint of lemon. I did, however, when making the frosting replace the blackberry jam with a fresh blackberry sauce I made by heating blackberries with sugar, water, and cornstarch, and then straining to remove seeds. I think these may be my favorite cupcake ever!

This frosting was AMAZING! I had a lot of extra, as I don't usually add much frosting to my cupcakes, and it was so good that I couldn't waste it, so I literally put the whole thing, bag and all, in the fridge to save it. xP The cupcakes were good as well. Great recipe!

I made both the cupcakes and the frosting exactly as written.  I give the cupcakes a 4.  The taste is lovely and lemony, not overly sweet, has a lightness I appreciate.  I took off one star because the cupcakes came out flat.  I would think it was an error on my part, but I see many, many others had the same result.  I give the frosting a 2, but I am not a huge fan of sweet things, so I'm not factoring that in as it may be a matter of personal preference.  I love blackberry jam and was looking forward to the combo of berries and lemon, but the frosting just tastes like sickeningly sweet butter with a hint of blackberries.  I thought it might just seem overly sweet on its own, so I frosted a cupcake and nearly spit it out, it was so sweet.  With doctoring (more jam, some lime juice, and about 3 oz. cream cheese), it wasn't too bad, but I think I'll make the frosting differently in the future.  I will definitely be making the cupcakes again!

These were okay. When I ate them I cried sweet tears of joy and the frosting was just fantastic. My problem was that, all my cupcakes caved in, taking away from the cupcake look. I followed the directions to a "T" and still had dysfunctional cupcakes. Any tips on how to fix this in the future?

Followed recipe exactly as written for the cupcakes and halved the icing - still had plenty. Delicious but only yielded 12 regular sized cupcakes. The cupcakes were moist and light with a nice lemon flavour. My oldest son, who only ever eats the icing off of cupcakes, ate the whole thing in no time!

I reduced the servings to yield half and made mini cupcake instead of regular sized ones, resulting in about 30 mini cupcakes. I personally found the icing and cupcakes too sweet but that can be easily fixed. Overall great recipe.

These were quite tasty. I didn't have lemons on hand, so I used the basic recipe and altered it to make lime cupcakes. I used the juice and zest of 2 limes in place of the lemon in the cupcakes. I made them with a lime frosting because I had neither blackberries nor blackberry jam.

Then frosting was: whip 1 cup margarine (I didn't have any butter). Add the juice of 1 lime and the zest of 2 limes. A little at a time add powdered sugar enough to make pipable frosting. Garnish with lime zest and a tiny wedge of lime.

The cake part was delicious it had a nice zesty taste thanks to the lemon, but I felt like the frosting was way to "buttery" almost greasy. Only modification was cutting down the butter in the frosting. Over wise amazing!

I tried this recipe using a few of the suggestions, but the texture did not seem quite right for one reason or another. It might be me, or it might be one of the changes I made. Also, some of them were short in the end, so perhaps they just got over-baked. The texture was similar to that of a muffin rather than cupcake. I added more milk and less baking powder as some suggested, but this was the result. I am certain it can be corrected. However, the frosting was amazing. When I tried it, even before the jam, it did not just taste of butter, it was very sweet though. I added more jam than just the 1/2 cup in the end because I wanted a stronger blackberry flavor. The frosting was actually my favorite part.

These cupcakes come out pretty dense, with an almost pound cake consistency. The lemon flavor is quite enjoyable. For us, the recipe made 22 cupcakes, but they were dense and did not rise to full size. Because they are rich and dense, this wasn't a problem. The icing recipe makes more than enough to swirl liberally on top to give it height. We would make this again--even my coworkers loved them.

These mini-cakes were wonderful.  Next time I will skip the icing, no need at all.  I cooked them the day ahead for a party and ate 3 right away before I iced them.  I had to wrap them up tight to keep from eating more.  The second day they weren't as good though.  I added lemon extract and vanilla extract.  Next time I will cut the vanilla way back to maybe 1/2 tsp. and make a lemon glaze.  I WILL be making these again... and again.

These were delicious! The pairing was so good.  The only change I made was to add Polaner all fruit seedless blackberry spread to the frosting rather than preserves.  With so much sugar, I felt the preserves would add too much sweetness.  The frosting was still sweet, but deliciously fruit flavored.  The cake itself was light and fluffy and had a lovely light vanilla-lemon flavor.  I will definitely make this again, although next time I may try adding a few drops of lemon oil to amp up the lemony flavor of the cake.

The 1st time I made these, I messed up the order on the cupcakes, even though I know better, so I thought the fact that they were a little dry and heavy was myu fault. But the second time I made them correctly and they were the same. Flavor is nice, but texture is not great. The frosting however is so fantastic, I would give it 6 starts and no one really noticed that the cupcakes weren't great because I used plenty of frosting to make up for it. This is my new frosting basic recipe.

I made these for my mom for Mother's Day this year and she, along with the rest of my family, absolutely adored them!  These were some of the best cupcakes I've ever had.  The lemon-blackberry combination is delightful, and the blackberry jam makes the icing such a beautiful, appetizing shade of pink!  My family can't stop talking about these cupcakes, and I highly recommend them.

These cupcakes were the talk of Easter desert at my inlaws! They were perfect in lemon flavor, and the blackberry frosting was just lovely on them. It worked in perfect harmony and made me look like a star in the kitchen.

This is the best cupcake I've ever had. I've had Sprinkles and loads of specialty cupcakes from little shops around town; this beats them all. Have made them for two different bridal showers. They're always an enormous hit!

I didn't make the frosting, just the cake.  It's got a great lemon flavour that doesn't over power.  As for it making 2 dozen cupcakes, it doesn't, I got about 18, but that's an easy fix, just double the recipe.

Okay. #1- the frosting does not hold it's shape AT ALL. It tasts very good and balances with the lemon cupcake (which is very delicious by the way, just don't over bake or it's really dry) but it can be runny and falls flat. Definatly refrigerate before piping it out. Other then that the cupcakes are really good and I would most certainly recommend them.

Instead of making the cupcakes I split the batter in half and made a small two layer cake and layered the buttercream in between (I used raspberry out of personal preference) and I have to say it turned out fantastic. The cake is moist, if a bit sweet, and the buttercream is fantastic. Next time I'd definitely up the amount of lemon juice/zest and reduce the sugar, but overall it's great.

This turned out way better than I expected! I loved the cake and even though I'm not a huge fan of blackberries, the icing was delicious too. I think next time I will try with raspberries instead.

I just made this recipe and it is so yummy, everyone in the family loved them. The fresher the lemon the better the flavor. I was only able to get 14 cupcakes out of one batch. And the frosting was amazing, I added 3 1/2 cups of confectioner sugar  instead of 4!

My new favorite cupcake. The flavor of the frosting is out of this world. The proportions are off...but it's easily fixed. Double the cake recipe and do 1 1/2 For the frosting. That'll make about 26-27 regular cupcakes.

I like the cake itself but the frosting comes out really thin and makes it hard to put it on cupcakes. I have also made this recipe as a cake and so far it turned out fine.I have tried 2x now with the same results. It'd you have any suggestions on how to make it a thicker frosting please let me know. I wanted to make this for my daughter's birthday.

First of all, these were delicious! Even the batter was some of the tastiest I've ever licked out of the bowl. I thought I was putting too much lemon juice in, but it was just perfect. The cupcake itself was delightfully lemony.

I made jumbo cupcakes (six to a pan), and I had some batter left over. I cut the icing recipe in half and probably put too much on the cupcakes...it was far too sweet and everyone had to scrape some off the top. I felt a little sick after eating one, but that might have been because I ate a glob of the frosting that I had left over.

I think if I actually had a normal cupcake pan around and made twelve, spreading the icing evenly over those instead of just six, these would have been perfect. I will definitely make them again though.

I made these for a baby shower. I wanted something different from the standard vanilla or chocolate that people make. These were amazing! They were easy to make and I loved how my house smelled like summer! My guests gobbled them up. I will be making these again.

Great recipe, but considering other reviews I modified as follows: I doubled the cake portion, which turned out perfect for 24 moderately sized cupcakes; and for the frosting I used 1/2C butter and 1/2C vegetable shortening rather than the full cup of butter. It was exactly enough frosting for the 24 cupcakes.

I should note that I also substituted light almond milk for the low fat milk, and a vegan butter replacement for regular butter due to a milk allergy, and it turned out fine (the vegan butter substitute won't be fluffy when you cream it with sugar to start the cake batter, but it didn't seem to have any impact on the finished product).

I had such high hopes. But the frosting ruined it for me. I couldn't really taste the blackberry over the flavor of the butter. I even ended up adding more jam and I am still not pleased with it. I think maybe it would have been much better as a whipped cream buttercream. It would have lightened it up and let the blackberry flavor come through more.

These are a really nice texture and the flavour is great! I used coconut almond milk and lactose free margarine (Becel Vegan). For the icing I used 1/2 C raspberries, 3 C icing sugar, and 1/2 C shortening.

These were quite good but not as lemony as I would have liked. On the second go-round, I added lemon extract 1.5 tsp and just 1 tsp vanilla extract plus a little extra lemon zest (from 3 small lemons). I did this with the raspberry jam/berries for the icing as this is what I had on hand. The result was like a little cake version of raspberry lemonade. Very light and refreshing. The cupcake is not that sweet, but the icing complements it perfectly. The cupcake recipe makes 12 regular cupcakes and needed about 3/4 of the icing recipe for the perfect amount of decoration & flavor.

These cupcakes were really moist and very tasty. I like a strong lemon flavor so I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and added the zest of one and a half lemons and the juice of two. They came out VERY lemony this way, which is how I like it. I also used unsalted butter and took them out after 18 minutes and let them cool in the pan. I live in a high altitude so the less sugar and salt put in baking, the better the product rises. The recipe also only yielded 12 average sized cupcakes for me.  For the frosting, I used frozen raspberries and I let them sit over night in the fridge, so all the juices came out. I only used half a cup unsalted butter, mixed the raspberries with the butter in the mixer and eyeballed the powdered sugar; it came out to be about 4 cups though. All in all, this is a really good base for delicious cupcakes and it was very forgiving with all the changes made.

This was a great recipe and my family really enjoyed it.  I added a little extra milk to get a looser "cake" consistency in the batter and also added 2 tsps of pure lemon extract on top of the juice to jazz up the lemon flavor.  I used normal size cupcake pans and got 14 cupcakes.  As for the frosting-- I thought it was phenomenal.  I can't stand super greasy, Crisco based frostings.  Ugh.  So I didn't change the butter at all.  I did use slightly less jam (I used home made and it's a lot more flavorful than store bought), then put in 1/4 tsp of raspberry flavoring and 2 tbslspns honey in the frosting after all the sugar was added.  It was KILLER and very flavorful.  I'd maybe reduce the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup in the future because it was super sweet.  But it's frosting-- it's supposed to be sweet!  Really great recipe though.  I will definitly make it again.

The cake came out really dense.  I doubled the cake portion due to other reviewers and it was enough to make ~26 full sized cupcakes.  I kept the frosting proportion as is and it was just enough.  Interesting flavors, but it wasn't a big hit.

Be sure to use a large lemon for this recipe. After reading numerous reviews about how there wasn't enough lemon flavor I can only conclude some people must not be using a large enough lemon or they must not be adding the lemon zest. I doubled this recipe and was able to make 27 cupcakes. After reading some reviews I cut back the baking soda to 1.5 tsps which isn't very substantial but since it was my first time working with this recipe I didn't want to alter anything. I was thrown a bit by the buttercream ingredients (only butter and sugar), so I used my own recipe and added jam to it. Came out great. Cupcakes were light and fluffy. If you find them dense or flat, be sure to check your baking soda.

These cupcakes were incredibly thick, with the consistency of a pound cake which, although being tasty in its own right, was not what I was looking for in a cupcake recipe. On top of this, the icing separated no matter what I tried. It's not likely that I will be making this recipe again except perhaps in the form of a glazed pound cake.

This recipe was amazing.  I did add 13 drops of blue food coloring to the icing to give it a more deep purple tint.  I would highly recommend doing this -- it becomes the color of what you think blackberry icing would be.  I made mini cupcakes and have eaten so many today it is sinful!  On one, I accidentally dropped some crushed dried mint on the top--- took it up to 6 stars.  May have to try a leaf of fresh mint under a blackberry for presentation!   Do try-- its an amazing combination.

These are great little cupcakes!  I made mine in the mini pan and because I didn't have any blackberries, I just paired it with a lemon frosting.  They got a little tough, but I think I might have over-beat them a bit...  Still, they were cute and tasty!

YUM!  Love the blackberry lemon combo.  Super easy to make.  I might add a little more milk for a lighter version.  I thought the blackberry buttercream was fab!  A nice change from the strawberry or blueberry you normally see with lemon.  Frosted cupcakes looked pretty too!  I was able to get 15 standard cupcakes and halved the frosting.  (Like many others have previously shared.)  Thank you for this recipe!  I will be making another batch soon :)

Made these for a bridal shower and they were a big success.  My cupcakes (I got 16 out of this recipe) really didn't rise much - in fact after they cooled they were pretty darn flat.  Having said that, once I put the frosting on it didn't really matter and they did taste good.  My lemons were on the small side, so I used two.  It was warm when I made the frosting and I ended up adding more sugar as it seemed too runny to pipe on the cupcakes.  Really nice blackberry flavor from the jam.  I will try raspberry next time!

The cake texture was great, dense but not too heavy.  We could really taste the lemon flavor.  I made two 9in rounds, baked at the same temp just a little longer.  The edges were a little overcooked, so next time I will drop the oven temp down a little, but the rest of the cake was perfect.  I didn't make the frosting from this recipe, but used another, and added the blackberry preserves.  It was good, I think I am just on the fence about blackberry in general.

This is the best cupcake recipe I have ever made. Like others I doubled to recipe for the batter to get 24 normal size cupcakes and single batch of the frosting is more than adequate for all 24 cupcakes.  The flavors are bright, fresh and absolutely delicious! The cake is the moistest from scratch cake I have ever been able to achieve there is just nothing bad I can say about this recipe.  It is in my opinion perfection.

Pretty good. I can't say that my family really liked them; lemon is such an underrated flavor! The cake part was really tough, it wasn't light and fluffy like you imagine cupcakes to be, it was thick and heavy. But that was okay, it tasted just fine, just made for extra crumbs. 
For the frosting I didn't have any blackberry jam, so I used blackberry flavored yogurt by yoplait. And ya know what, it worked! I just kept the cupcakes in the fridge, which I would have done anyway because buttercream melts.

I really loved this recipe. I used cake flour and added the zest and juice of 2 lemons because I wanted a more intense lemon flavour. I also used strawberry jam because that was what I had on hand and it was really yummy. It made 12 cupcakes and I halved the icing and there was still plenty left over. I will definitely make these again!

Outstanding recipe.  I halved the recipe and only got 7 cupcakes.  I also did the raspberry jam for the icing.  Great results. Lemony flavor and light and airy.

I made these for a friend's birthday and they all loved them! they really came out great and were definitely delicious! I added more lemon since I had more than the recipe called for and replaced the blackberry buttercream frosting for a cream cheese one with lemon zest as garnish! Bon appetit! :)

So delicious, I loved the frosting and wish I had made it into a layer cake because I wanted more frosting after the top was eaten.  I did have to add some hot water to the jar to get the last of the jam out and to also thin the frosting .  I halved the recipe on the frosting and the cupcakes,  I actually put all the normal amount of cupcake recipe in 12 cupcake tins.  Ok so I didnt read the quantity it makes.  They were huge and so good.  My boys loved them.

The batter was extremely think and yielded no where near 24 cupcakes. The cupcakes weighed a ton and were the wrong consistency, after they were baked the cupcake actually cracked.  I Think there needs to be more eggs, flour, and I would have used baking soda instead of powder.  This also gives you way too much icing, I would reduce that by half.

I just made these and am disappointed.  The batter was extremely dense.  I was hesitant to add more milk and now I regret it.  The flavor is good, but I have a feeling they are going to get dry very quickly (all of the tops are cracked and look more like muffins).  The frosting is delicious, but not a good piping consistency.

WOW!!!  My first go at homemade cupcakes... They're SOOO moist, awesome recipe!  The lemon flavor wasn't as strong as I'd probably prefer.  I juiced a large lemon and used the zest, but they're still awesome!  PS. This recipe makes 16 regular size cupcakes..

Amazing flavor!  The lemon cupcakes are perfect, not too sweet.  They don't rise very high and I would double the recipe to get a full dozen.  The frosting is really good and makes a lot.  I used raspberry jam since that was what I had on hand.  They were great.  This will me my go to lemon cupcake recipe.

Although it is stated in the authors review that the "24" was for mini-muffins, I didn't read that review before I made them.  So I too, only got these cookie-like cakes (I made them into rainbow cupcakes).  Very good flavors and I did half the frosting and still had some left.  I will make again but fill the liners to 2/3's full before baking.

Delicious! A hit at the party I took them to. The recipe makes about 12 cupcakes if you fill the cups 3/4 full. I also added a second lemon and zest, and it was perfect. The frosting also makes enough for twice as many cupcakes, so I made a gluten-free batch using Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten-Free flour and they were also quite tasty. I used strawberry jam for the frosting. Fantastic!

Fantastic!  I used1 cup of all purpose flour & 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, just less than 1 cup of cane sugar, 1/2 cup of egg whites, 2ish tsp of baking powder and almond milk for the cupcakes.  I also used just less than 1/2 cup of raspberry jam and topped them with blueberries, raspberries & blackberries.  Fantastic recipe!

Followed the recipe 'as is,' except for halving the frosting recipe that was perfect for 12 regular sized cupcakes. Moist, perfect, delicious flavor combo. As others found, the blackberry jam can be substituted for whatever you have on hand -- I've also used blueberry and raspberry. A great, versatile recipe for anyone looking for a non-chocolate option.

I thought that the cup cakes were good, just needed a little bit more lemon flavor. It seems like most lemon cake recoies i run into have great lemon flavor until the cake is cooled. The blackberry buttercream frosting is out of this world good; however it made way too much. I also doubled the cake recpie and made 36 regular size cupcakes and had a lot of frosting left over. I will make these again, maybe with extra lemon juice or extract or something.

This is just a review of the cupcakes, not the frosting, as I had a strawberry lemonade frosting I wanted to use on them.

I followed the advice of the original recipe submitter, and made these as mini muffins.  It made far more than 24.  Eventually I broke down and used most of the remaining batter for six full sized cupcakes.

I think perhaps the recipe calls for too much butter.  My cupcakes are greasy.  The lemon flavor is *extremely* subtle, despite my fears that I used too much zest.  I was hoping for more lemon kick.

Cupcakes would be amazing with a different frosting. This frosting is way too sweet like everyone else said. I halved the recipe like everyone said to do and it was the perfect aount. However, it was the wrong consistency and again, too sweet. Maybe it would be better if you flavor it with fresh berries that have been strained. I tried to add butter and cut down the sugar but i just couldn't get it to be less sweet without making it too buttery. Maybe add heavy cream? The cake was good but the next day it was dense vs fluffy.

I made these cupcakes for a coworkers birthday and they were a huge hit.  Here are the changes I made:  I doubled the batter (as did many other reviewers) in order to get 24 full sized cupcakes.  I also added the juice and zest of extra lemon for additional flavor. I made no changes to the icing.  I will definitely be making these again!
