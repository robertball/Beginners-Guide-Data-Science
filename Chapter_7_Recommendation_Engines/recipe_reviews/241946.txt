This is an excellent cold salad.  I also add a 15 oz. can of Garbanzo Beans.  It is a wonderful salad to have for dinner, or as your lunch!  I make and eat this at least 3 or 4 times a year.  It is a hit for Church Fellowship dinners, or a gathering of friends for a night of dinner and cards!

This was a perfect accompaniment to grilled chicken and a light summer salad. The flavor profile reminded me of a three bean salad. I thought it was good but I did miss the different textures you get from a three bean salad. I would make it again because I really liked the corn in the salad but I would add either a can of kidney beans or garbanzo beans. Thanks for the recipe!

My Grandmother's church cookbook has a similar recipe but it doesn't call for any oil. I love this salad and we always have it at Easter. You can eliminate the oil or just use 1/4 cup and it's still delicious. I've also made it with white vinegar and it always turns out good. My Grandmother's recipe calls for 3/4 sugar and 3/4 vinegar.
