Good flavor.  I did not have time to put it in the oven so I just let the meat and the sauce simmer on low in a cast iron skillet for 30 minutes.  Good!  I also added one minced clove of garlic in with the onion to saute in the steak drippings.  Nice addition.  I also just used a whole can of diced tomatos and about a third of that can full of water instead of the tomato juice and 1/2 cup tomatos.

This has to be one of the best comfort  food dishes ever! I used cubed steak, tomato sauce instead of tomato juice, and added mushrooms - I did everything else as stated in the recipe. GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!

Boy, did we ever like this! To me this good enough to be one of those special mom-dishes that would be brought out for special occasions when you're a kid. This says "home goodness" to me. I'd be pleased to serve this to friends and family.   The sauce's flavor reminds me of barbeque sauce, which we really liked, and the steak came out nice and tender.  I had leftover homemade tomato sauce from the previous night, and just added the additional seasonings and lemon juice to it.  I used dijon mustard because that's we had on hand. We will be eating this often.  Thank you!

Very good recipe I give it 5 stars. I used a 2 lb London broil sliced the long way so the roast was two long thin pieces about one inch thick. Then cut those in two giving me four nice servings. I didn't have tomato juice, so I used a whole can of diced tomatoes.  To tenderize the meat I stabbed the meat with a fork a hundred times, no more no less. OK you can do more. Everyone loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing this, this is a keeper!

This was terrific.  My husband & I ate the whole dish ourselves.  I used round steak which was really pounded thin.  I substituted the juice for tomato sauce and I doubled the liquid and seasoning because we like to put the sauce on our potatoes.  Will definitely be making this for company.

What a pleasant surprise! This was really easy and the meat was soooo tender when it was done. It has that classic swiss steak flavor that I was looking for. Thanks!

This was amazing!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I added three clove of garlic, used a small can of tomato sauce and about 10oz of spicy v8.  I also cooked it in my cast iron.  Super yummy and now in my regular recipe routine!  Thank you for sharing:)

This was good.I used round steak, substituted in tomato sauce instead of juice, and added a clove of garlic. Halfway thru the baking I stirred in some water so the sauce wouldn't go dry and burn. Next time though I will add the pepper to the sauce and not let my 8yr old pound it into meat. Lets just say one piece had some real zing to it. Hubby ate it anyway.

I made this last night for dinner. I used tomato paste instead of diced tomatoes and added beef broth. It turned out excellent! Swiss Steak is a total comfort food from my past. My Grandma always used North American Steak sauce in hers, but I cannot find it anywhere. This version was a close replica.

Very tasty and forgiving, can eyeball most of the ingredients without having to measure.  I didn't feel like that much of a tomato taste, so rather than use tomato juice I used the same amount of beef stock, gives more of a gravy type taste rather than predominantly tomato.  I dredged the steaks in seasoned flour and browned, after removing them from the pan I added approx 2 T  butter and the leftover flour and made a roux...added the beef stock and other ingredients.  Was tasty and solved the problem of the somewhat watery consistency.

This was ok. I felt I kinda wasted the piece of steak making this - cubed steak would have worked just as well, and been cheaper too. I guess it just tasted too stew-like. Thanks anyway.

This was a very good recipe and I found that my family didn't leave any leftovers and gave me many compliments on it. I could remember what it should taste like from when I ate it as a kid, and could guess some ingredients, but not all of them. Very helpful, very tasty!

Hubby actually did this one and everyone loved it! It fills the house with an amazing aroma. He did make some changes, including marinating the meat in a baja citrus marinade for about 3 hours. Instead of canned tomatoes (which we didn't have on hand) he used 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce. He omitted the flour and added some minced fresh garlic. The result was restaurant quality and we're adding this to our Christmas dinner menu!

I rarely have a negative review but this time, I was disappointed.  There is an combination of taste that really are not good.  
No one in my family enjoyed it and I just did not finish it.  I will not be making it again.

My second review on this recipe because it really is one of the best Swiss Steak Recipes ... I do add carrots and celery ... fresh oregano.  It turns out so mouth watering delicious and tender every single time!

I thought this was fairly bland as written, but WILL be making it again as my kids ate it up and were disappointed when it was all gone!  It is simple, easy, and family friendly.  What more could I ask?

I might try using stewed tomatoes and doubling the meat next time...so much sauce was left over!

This was delicious!! My family loved it and no left overs even though I tripled the recipe.  Only change  made was I coarsely chopped  6 oz's of portabella mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions.  Topped each serving with a slice of mozzarella cheese after removing from oven (but is great without cheese too). Next time might try cooking it on 300 degrees over 2 hours or so to make the meat a little more tender.  Served over wide egg noodles with green beans.  Thanks Vera.

This was a wonderful recipe! Made it tonight and we all loved it. Please notice, the measurements are for 2 servings. I've seen people say that this was bland. It's not. You just need to double or triple the sauce ingredients when making it for a family. I went a little heavy on the Worcestershire sauce as that has so much flavor! Served it with rice and green beans. I will be making this again!

I am not a big fan of swiss steak because it is usually to acidic for my taste.  This was very good.  I too used a tomato sauce instead of juice and I substituted soy sauce for the worcestershire sauce.  I also did the whole thing in my dutch oven on top of the stove.  Less clean up that way.  Great recipe!

Nice flavor, slightly BBQ.  When tripling the recipe I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce in place of the tomato juice and used a 14 oz can of tomatoes.  Good!

Boy does it smell delicious cooking.  I haven't eaten yet, so I'll have to post my review after dinner.  But if it tastes half as good as it smells, WOW.  I substituted the tomatoes with a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles.  Can't wait to try.

This was good. I ended up not measuring the pepper out and added a bit too much but it was still good, just a little spicey. I might add some bell peppers next time too. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great dish.  I followed the recipe exactly but added one rib sliced celery and chopped one bell pepper to saute with the onions. My family actually applauded at the table.

Great recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I used tomato soup when I didn't have tomato juice and it turned out great too.  This is one of our favorites!

The taste of this dish was very similar to the swiss steak I had as a child and it brought back lots of good memories. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

The sauce was too thick to my liking, even though it was baked at 325 degrees F.   Be careful buying canned tomatoes.  Mine were extra high in salt content.

Almost perfect!  I've been searching for Swiss Steak like Mom made, and with the addition of some chopped celery and about 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, this was it.  Thanks!

This is better than my mom's old fashioned swiss steak recipe was. I did change things a bit....used about 1 1/2 lb. of thin steak (rnd. for braciole)...salt and peppered meat then pounded with the flour (1/3 c) Browned meat, moved to casserole, then did med. large onion sliced added a TB of butter to the drippings and sauteed til soft.  Then added 8 oz jar of canned tomato, a large can of tomato sauce, 3 tsp lemon juice, a small handful of brown sugar, 1 T of french's mustard, 1 T plus a bit of Worcestershire sauce....added a couple shakes of celery salt and garlic salt....then added a bit more salt and pepper to sauce (to taste)  Baked at 350 for 90 minutes.....steak was fork tender....and the sauce was awesome on mashed potatoes.....Definitely a keeper

This turned out really good, tender and flavorful. Reminds me of my mother's version, which I think she improvised. I used diluted tomato paste, a full can of tomatoes and more onion because that's to our tastes here, and it was very well received. I'll be making it again.

The recipe wasn't clear about the cut of steak.  I used 1/4 inch thick pieces and felt the meat was dry. It was to sweet for my taste.

Cut beef into small serving size portions, dip in flour seasoned with salt & pepper and pound with the back of a knife or tenderizer,  Brown both sides in oil in heated pan.  Add thick onion slices, carrots cut in half lengthwise and crosswise, cover with tomatoes and simmer for 2 - 3 hrs. Delicious.

This was fabulous! Easy to make and delicious. The steak was fork-tender, and the sauce had a welcome zip to it. The only change I made was to add a full can of diced tomatoes because I used two ribeye steaks that were bigger than the 3/4 pound total in the recipe.

Very disappointing.  The meat was almost tender but tasteless and the sauce was just okay.  I will not make this again - at my family's request.

I always remember this with green peppers, so I added one.  I accidently grabbed a can of Ro-Tel and it was great.  I never actually looked at the picture, but served it with mashed potatoes and green beans too.  Excellent winter night dish.

Loved this. I did a double portion. 2 1/2 lb Eye of round (6 nice pieces) 14 oz tomatoes, 5.5 oz tomatoe sauce and rounded it out with 4.5 oz. tomatoe juice. I chose the juice for two reasons......first to keep the sauce moist and most importantalt....a Bloody Mary sounded good. Used a honey dijon and 1 tsp. of minced garlic. Sauteed the onion for a very short time (just to get the chrispness out). Baked at 350 1.45 min and added 1/8 cup water half way through. Served with new potatoes smothered in butter a little dill and fresh parsley. Steamed carrot sticks (thin) red and yellow peppers. Meat was so tender and full of flavor. Killer meal.........thanks.

This was my favorite Swiss steak recipe ever! The only thing I did different was to add fresh garlic. Yum!!! Next time I might not pre-cook the onion though as it did get a little soggy after baking. Other than that, the flavor was excellent!

This dish was excellent. The only things I did different were I used Dijon mustard instead of prepared(it was all I had and it tasted great!!), I did not add mushrooms because my family does not eat them and I used italian diced tomatoes. YUMMY!! This dish was very much liked and will be used again!!

Wow!  This was really EASY to make and soooo delicious!  I used Round Top Steak and added a little Dale's marinade on it before beating the flour in.  I used a can of medium spicy Rotel diced tomatoes and the juice from it plus 1 cup of water.  

I used all ingredients except for lemon juice since I didn't have any on hand.  Cooked for 1 1/2 hrs at 350 and it turned out perfect!  Didn't even need a knife to cut it.  Great comfort food!  My boyfriend LOVED it!!!!  Definitely one to keep.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. The only thing that I did different was I diced up fresh tomatoes, and I used a mixture of tomato juice and tomato sauce to make it a little thicker.

Loved this. So tender and great flavor. The only change I did was to add potatoes while backing the last 30 mins.

This is a great recipe--one of my "go-to" meals for company.  It does take some time, so I don't often make it on weekdays.  However, served with mashed potatoes and a veggie this is a great dinner.

Brings back childhood memories! So delicious! However, I always use cube steak. Much easier. Also, make sure you use a large enough pan, as the sauce will boil in the oven and could boil over and make a mess if the pan is too small.

This was very flavorful.  Baking did not result in the same tenderness that stovetop provides.  Had to bake this quite a bit longer to make it tender.

Love Love Love this recipe!  I've used it a couple of times for family and there are never any left overs.  I used a 5.5 oz can of garlic roasted tomato sauce instead of tomato juice and a while can of petite diced tomatoes.  So Yum!  Thanks so much for sharing this!

I was shocked at how tasty this was.  I let my budding chef (7 yr old daughter) make this for us (with supervision). That's how easy it was.  I did not cook it for the full 1.5 hrs.  It was a bit on the "tomato-ey" side, but very good. Will make again.

The meat was so tender and delicious, that I will definately be making this again. I added mushrooms, but kept everything else the same. Perfect with mashed potatoes.

I am giving this recipe a three only because my husband said this is how his Mother's tasted.  I guess that means if you want Swiss Steak, you want bland.  Not for me, sorry to say.

Great recipe.  I used tomato sauce instead of juice like many others suggested.  It's what I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe and the leftovers were great too.  I will definitely make again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some diced red bell pepper to the onions when sauteing. It had great flavor and was easy to make. Thanks for this recipe!
