Why this doesn't have more stars boggles my mind.  This cake is awesome, and I found it very good refrigerated.

I'm not going to lie to you. I didn't make the cake. They don't sell Ghiradelli products in the Middle East, where I'm living now. I did make a caramel cake and I made the GLAZE from the recipe above... using a sub-standard brand of chocolate. The results were pretty, but you can't beat good chocolate. I'll make this cake when I get home.... using Ghiradelli chocolate.

Made this cake for my family with Sue's hot fudge topping, an amazing dessert with plenty of hot fudge left over to pour on your ice cream.
You may want to double or triple the recipe like the last reviewer mentioned that was the on thing I would change about this "wonderful" dessert.

Like everyone else, I doubled the recipe.  Also added 1/2 cup applesauce since others said it was dry, used strong coffee instead of water (made a minor difference) and baked for 60 minutes. Turned out perfect!

The glaze is essential. Without the glaze the cake tastes like a brownie. With the glaze it is a  delicious chocolate cake. The cake is short -- half the size you expect -- and it has twice stuck to the pan and so came out broken. Not sure what to do about that, but the glaze patched it over.

Followed the recipe to a tee. Thought it was a little dry, fell apart when I took it out of the pan.  Thought it would have been sweeter as well. I will try another chocolate bundt cake recipe till I find the perfect one.

Quite honestly, this is the best chocolate cake I have ever baked.  For such a simple recipe, the taste is balanced, consistency moist.  You do need to wait long enough - maybe even an hour - for the glaze to thicken.  I made a non-dairy version, substituting butter flavored Crisco for the butter, non-dairy chocolate chips and Rich's Coffee Rich for the heavy cream. AMAZING!

I bought a heavy metal rose shaped bundt pan at an estate sale today and after washing it my husband said well lets try it out so I came across this recipe.  All I had on hand was hershey's unsweetened cocoa, only had white choco. chips, and had a bag of dark chocolate "Wilton" candy melts in pantry.  So made this with what I had in the house.  This is an awesome bundt cake.  The topping was really good, I used a 12 oz bag of the dark chocolate candy melts and 1 cup of the heavy cream and 3 pinches salt and about a teaspoon of sugar, it worked just fine, I only used probably 3/4 of the sauce.  If I ever have the Ghirardelli on hand I will use that but because I probably wont I will use what I have and whats affordable.  Definitely try this recipe its worth the work.  Also, I had to bake it for about 45 min.

Excellent moist cake. The ganache glaze thickens up nicely with a short cool down and enrobes the cake in a glossy blanket of chocolate. Very impressive looking.

You want to use a natural cocoa for this recipe, one that is not processed with alkaline and not Dutch processed. Natural cocoa is acidic - it will react with the alkaline baking soda called for in the recipe to create create carbon dioxide bubbles and leavening in your cake. If you use an alkalized cocoa, also called "Dutched" or "Dutch-process cocoa", the acidity of the cocoa has been neutralized and will not react with the baking soda to leaven your cake, leaving it flat and dense. For further explanation see here: http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/08/difference-dutch-process-natural-cocoa-powder-substitute.html

The recipe calls for a 6-cup tube pan. Most normal bundt pans are 12 cups, FYI! If using a 12-cup bundt pan, double the recipe and bake for 50 minutes.

As another reviewer commented, any holes that are left by chocolate chips that stick to the pan are easily camouflaged with the glaze.

I read the reviews and made this cake anyway! I am so glad that I did. I made exactly as the recipe stated though I used a different brand of chocolate. Mine took about 48 minutes to cook to perfection, and I dusted it with icing sugar instead of making the glaze. It is spectacular and will be going into my regular recipe rotation. Definitely try it once and if it's not what you love tweak it as others have, but try it just once as it calls for. My family loves it and I'll be surprised if it lasts more than a day!

This is a great recipe for chocolate cake, but the glaze really makes it special!  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the recipe, added about 1/2 cup applesauce, and used cake flour instead of all purpose flour because that's what I had on hand.  I also had to use other brands of chocolate as I didn't have any Ghirardelli. Baked it for 60 minutes, which may have been a few minutes too long, but still wonderful.  This cake is really good, but it's almost too chocolate for me - we solved that by serving it with vanilla ice cream :)  A delicious dessert made very special by a wonderful glaze!

I don't get the low ratings for this recipe. It's perfect as is.  Of course, you need to thoroughly grease your bundt pan (as the recipe states) and allow the cake to cool before removing it. This will prevent any sticking. I didn't make the glaze. The cake was delicious without it. I used a powdered sugar dusting instead. Highly recommended.

The cake's texture and taste was okay, but it comes out so tiny that it looks ridiculous. Ingredients should be doubled.  I've made tons of bundt cakes, and this is the first one that did not come out of the pan in one piece.  I didn't bother with the icing; will not make this cake again.

I think the recipe needs to be doubled for a full bundt cake. While I used Nestlés morsels I found the cake was sweet enough for me but was heavier more like a brownie than a cake.

Made this cake and loved it! I doubled the recipe like many of you to make a full size bundt cake. I also used the tip about replacing the water with coffee and adding 1/2 c applesauce to the mix to keep it moist. The glaze is super simple to make as well. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Cake was very dry and dense. Also realized after making recipe that it only filled my bundt pan less than halfway so had to make another batch just to get one regular size bundt cake.

Wow! Chocolate decadence deluxe! Doubled the recipe and used only butter Crisco,unbelievably was out of oil, used what chips I had on hand minis, regular, and white, baked twice as long and chocolate heaven came out of the oven.  My family moaned when I announced it was for todays celebration.  Of course I cracked and half the cake was gone without even adding the ganauche.  Leftovers are even better warm.

This recipe is a disappointment.  I made it as directed. After the recommended baking time I increased the oven temp to 350° and baked it an additional 10 minutes.  The top of the cake (about an inch) stuck to the pan and was not quite done, although the toothpick came out clean. 
The cake was moist, but tough. It did not hold its shape when cut, but fell to pieces.  
I don't know why this is listed as a bundt cake when it calls for a tube pan and must be doubled to fill a bundt pan. I did not read the comments before making this and was disappointed in the small amount of batter. 
We did not care for the icing. It is nothing more than chocolate chips and milk (heavy cream). I noticed in the comments others used a different icing. 
I will not make this again. I have made better boxed cake mixes. I was looking for a good "from scratch" cake, but this is definitely not it.

DOUBLE RECIPE!   

I used Hershey Cocoa and Nestles Choc Chips.
Cake tasted incredible !

You should double the recipe if you are making a normal size bundt cake since this recipe only filled pan 1/2-3/4 of way.

It was very yummy and moist, and my family loved the chocolatey flavor! If wanted, you can always add hot chocolate powder to give it a double chocolate flavor; which is just decadent.  I hope this review helps anyone with this recipe!

This cake is delicious, but it fell completely apart when taking it out of the bundt pan. I followed the recipe completely and greased the pan well and the cake fell apart.

Very yummy and easy to make, but will need to make a double batch of the cake to fill a bundt pan.

The kids loved helping with making it. It is easy to make and very delicious. I had small bundt bowls so I baked some of it in them and the rest in a regular baking pan. The ones in the bundt were more moist. Maybe this recipe needs a bundt pan. Everyone loved it including people who are not into chocolate cakes. Used white cane sugar as per the recipe and it wasn't too sweet or bitter. It was perfectly chocolatey. The only thing I changed was that we used raw cacao powder instead of cocoa powder since I had it (cacao at 2/3rds of the cocoa powder in recipe). Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

The cake fell apart when I took it out of the bundt pan.  I will try doubling recipe and cooking slower next time.  The glaze recipe made too much liquid.

Excellent recipe.  Moist and delicious.  I made this recipe especially for my new Nordicware Bundt Duet pan.  Each of the two pan holds 2.5 cups (full to the top).  This recipe was perfect.  I filled each of the two pans about 3/4 full and used the small amount of remaining batter in a mini-cocotte.  I sprayed all the pans with Bak-klene ZT and the cakes released when the pans were tipped over onto a rack following 10 minutes of cooling.  No sticking whatsoever!  Delicious!

I liked the overall flavour of this chocolate cake, and the fact that it wasn't too sweet.  Like the other reviewers wrote, it only filled up half of my pan, and made a small cake.  I thought I had greased my pan well enough, however the cake still stuck to it.

I'm giving this a 3 as it didn't raise nearly to the height i expected.  In fairness to Ghirardelli, no doubt if I had more cake baking experience, I would have had a better raise.  I had somewhat of a stunted bunt.  I used a 6 cup molded pan as called for.

But the flavor was very good.  I used Hershey's coco, because that's what I had on hand.  But did use Ghirardelli chips for the glaze.

I also used 1 tsp espresso powder to bring out the chocolate flavor.

I also use cake flour - otherwise, all proportions per the recipe.

Would have been a 4 or 5, if it would have been moister.

The cake had a good taste and texture, but it stuck to the pan so badly that in places it took off half of the volume

This is the second time I've made this particular cake. The first time I used a  "nonstick" bundt pan. I thought I cooled it long enough, but it stuck to the pan like crazy. Regardless, I made the glaze, and  poured it over the cake (glaze could have sat longer for thickness). I served the crumbled, glazed cake to my family. They devoured it! I myself found it not only easy to make, but delicious! This second time, I took a suggestion to coat the pan with butter and then with the powdered chocolate to avoid the sticking. I'm waiting for it to cool, but stick or not, I know it will be absolutely delicious, I love this recipe!

The chips disappeared when baking. We thought it bordered on bitter. Will not make this again.

Made it just now.
Can't say how it turned out yet. BUT!
This recipe makes a small bundt or nicely fills 6 mini bundts.

I just made this cake for a bake sale. The cake only filled up 1/2 of my Bundt pan but worst of all I must not have oiled the pan well enough. The cake did not come out of the pan....eventually I did get it out in pieces so it will be going to grandchildren who will love it with ice cream, Nice flavor though.

It was very rich--brownie like-- and was good with raspberries & ice cream. I would try another recipe next time.
