Really good. I used dried cranberries (doubled amount) just due to personal preference. The yogurt gave the chicken salad a surprising tangy element. I enjoyed it and my husband thanked me for making this recipe. So thank you Mrs. Williams. I will make this again.

This review is for the pastry only. These are the perfect puffs. I have tried many choux pastries and this one is easy and always turns out. The ingredients temperature and time (30 minutes) are spot on and create perfectly crisp beautifully golden nicely shaped puffs. Make sure to cut them open to release the steam soon after removing them from the oven and scoop out any gooey dough still in the center. I make the first part on the stove and remove the ball of dough to my kitchen aid stand mixer for about 5 minutes then beat the eggs in one at a time until completely blended. I place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet forming with my cookie scoop and get a much higher yield than 8... For half a recipe I get about twelve just the right size for filling with pastry cream. I usually put three per plate and drizzle them with chocolate sauce. I have also tried filling them with smoked salmon sour cream and capers and loved it. The possibilities are endless.

Made similar recipe for years. I do not use raisins though but roasted slivered almonds. Also much less mustard using sour cream instead of the yogurt. This gives it a much creamer taste and less tart.

Truly ENJOYED this recipe! Light but filling. EASY EASY EASY! Going to try variation of flaky tuna & grapes/black olives instead of chicken & raisins just to change out. Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely fantastic. I took it as a "covered dish" contribution to a gathering (all women) and they couldn't believe I actually made the cream puffs (apparently they thought that making cream puffs is too hard for normal people). And since I made lots I left some at home for hubby and they were eaten before I returned. All around huge success.

OMG! I'm so excited! I just pulled the puffs from the oven - and they are perfect! I read several reviews but still felt nervous making these my first time (I think that whole "puff pastry" thing made me uneasy)! But the recipe was simple and easy to follow. I'm sure I'll make again for salads and desserts! Thank you Mrs. Williams for sharing!
