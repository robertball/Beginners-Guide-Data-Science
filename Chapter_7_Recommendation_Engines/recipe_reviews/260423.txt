This was moist and delicious. The sweetness was perfect to my husband and I but we generally eat low sugar.

I found that the cake had a mayonnaise flavor, which I didn't love. I also thought it wasn't particularly  sweet and also crumbly. I liked that it's relatively healthy, though!

I didn't have any paleo mayo, so I used GF mayo.  Best cake I've made and eaten in over 7 years.
