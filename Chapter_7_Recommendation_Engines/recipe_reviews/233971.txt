This is a great recipe which is very good the way they suggest you use it.  This time however, I added a tablespoon of mayo before melting the butter and whisked it together before the heating step.  It added some great creaminess that was lacking from the initial version and held it together more when spooning it over my eggs.  WIN!

Perfect just the way it is!!!





Add on: This is still the only way we make it anymore! LOVE this recipe just the way it is!!! 

Note: for all the people adding mayo and changing the recipe why bother leaving a review? Technically you are not making this recipe so it is unfair to leave a review for your own recipe.

Honestly, this may not be quite as rich or smooth as the somewhat labor-intensive hollandaise sauce that I make, but it was pretty darn good.  I did end up adding a little more lemon juice and cayenne to suit our tastes. I took the photo right when it came out of the microwave, and the butter had separated a bit.  But all it really needed was a good whisk, and then the texture was spot on, and stayed that way.  Served this on Ham Cups and Eggs, a recipe on this site.  Thanks, scottki, we enjoyed your quick recipe.

Simple and easy way to make Hollandaise - Makes enough for about 3-4 eggs benedicts.  I used 1 tsp of lemon juice & added 1 tablespoon of mayo to the mix right before drizzling in the melted butter.  Microwaved for 15 seconds, whisked and microwaved 10 sec intervals whisking in between.  Sauce thickened each time it was heated. It took 3 times of heating before it was the consistency and temperature I wanted.  I won't make it any other way from now on! Thanks

I would say it needs a little longer in the microwave too depending on how hot the butter is being drizzled in.  I like the 10 sec increments.

This is by far the easiest and surprisingly the best hollandaise I have ever made. I love the sour back-taste in hollandaise, so I added more lemon juice and more cayenne for more heat. By using an initial microwave time of about 15 seconds, whisking, and then increments of about 10 seconds, whisking vigorously each time, I had excellent control over the amazing finished product. Eggs benedict will be on my breakfast menu more often. Bon appetite!

Adding a tablespoon of mayo' (just before heating) makes this recipe the best, quickest hollandaise sauce in the universe. You can swap the cayenne for mustard if you like (we did) and it tastes like the the angel Gabriel has gently dripped the kisses of The Lord Almighty into your mouth.

First time I tried hollandaise sauce and it was perfect. I will never do it any other way. I read through reviews before hand so after the initial 20secs in the microwave I also did it in 10sec intervals whisking in between. And also increased lemon juice and cayenne pepper as a personal preference. Absolutely amazing and so simple!!!! 
Thank you

Should have read all of the reviews to make a thicker tastier sauce for Eggs Benedict. Hubby was happy. Me, not so much.

So tasty and easy!  I had to microwave it longer, maybe 40 seconds.  I just did it in 10 second increments until it thickened up.  Will be making this again.  Thank you!

I wanted to make my own Hollandaise rather than consume the variety of additives that are in the Knorr packaged sauce. The only problem is that other recipes are either time consuming or use a blender. I'm both impatient and lazy about pulling out infrequently used appliances so I ruled other recipes out. This recipe required neither and had 5 star reviews. I followed the recipe but since it doesn't specify teaspoon or tablespoon of lemon juice so I guessed 1/4 tbls. I tasted the result and added more lemon juice and cayenne to our taste and a tablespoon of mayo as others recommended. I'm so happy, it's perfect!

Awesome...I took the advice to add Mayo and the consistency was perfect. If you feel you will need to add more lemon juice or Cayenne, wait to test taste the original recipe after its been heated...the flavors are enhanced...then add more to your liking if necessary. Enjoy!

This was easy and delicious.  After the first microwave and whisk, I repeated the process for a thicker sauce.  I found this to be more than two servings.  I substituted a slash of Worcestershire for the cayenne pepper.  I will certainly use this again.

I've made this recipe many, many times since finding it here. I love that I can halve it since I live alone and it still works well. The only change I had to make is to continue cooking and whisking the sauce at 15 second intervals until it's thickened. (I suspect total cooking time depends on the temperature of the butter and egg.) If you let it go too long without whisking it will separate and the easiest way to fix that is just let it sit for 5 minutes or more until it smoothes out again.

 This recipe is good as written, but I've modified it a bit to suit me more. Now I use double the lemon juice and a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Then I add a dash of white wine vinegar per serving.

I've found this recipe to be fool proof, quick and easy. Just keep a lemon in the refrigerator and you're always good to go.  The family members I've made this for like it, too. I mostly serve it on asparagus or fish cakes.

NB - Use butter, not any kind of margarine, and a real egg yolk. I warm the egg in hot water so the yolk isn't cold.

This was great. I did not need to add mayonnaise as other raters suggested.  Prior to adding the hot butter, I made sure to beat/whisk the egg mixture (for several minutes) until I could see the consistency of the egg getting fairly thick.  Then tons of whisking while drizzling hot butter.   I did add extra lemon because i love it. My blender broke so this was a great way to do it. I Microwaved it in 10 sec increments 4 x's but I doubled the recipe. This was nummy.

I will make this again...but I didn't notice that it gave no tsp/tbls or cup for the lemon juice. I totally thought I read 1/4 cup, lol. It was so sour! My bad! I will try with a tablespoon in the future. Would help if the actual recipe was updated with correct measurement :)

This was super easy and very delicious, only added a splash of white wine vinegar to thin it out.  I thought I had a packet of the powder stuff and couldn't find it, so glad I will never used the packet stuff ever again!

I tried the Blender Hollandaise and it was very watery.  So, I tried this one as the basic ingredients were similar. The key difference was the microwaving and was I ever surprised at the results!  I am ecstatic! Yeah!  It thickened nicely.  That's why I rated it a 5.  Once I got the thickness I wanted I tweaked the lemon and added 1/4 t. distilled white vinegar (just for my taste).  Thank you again and again for something so simple and now not so daunting for something so elegant.

Quick and easy, I’m a lemon fiend so this recipe gave me just the right level of pucker.  Once I drizzled in the melted butter, I microwaved the mix in 10 second intervals and whisked well between. I’ve made this recipe many times using tarragon, grainy mustard, Sriracha, browned butter, orange zest, anchovies...who knows what’s next.

I followed the recipe including the lemon, i suggest half or even a quarter amount of lemon. Also if you like thick, creamy sauce, microwave it for atleast a minute and whisk every 10 seconds.(or when you see it starting to bubble) Overall id make it in the microwave again in the future, id just make some alterations.

I followed this recipe to the t and the sauce had a great flavor, but it was so so thin. It did not look like the photo that is listed with the recipe. 

I ended up adding heavy cream because I didn’t really want to change the flavor, i just wanted it to be thicker. At no point did I have separation issues, the sauce stayed consistent. Overall, I will use this recipe as a quick fix if I don’t have time to make hollandaise sauce the longer (more difficult) way. I will definitely have to add to it if I make it again. I never thought of adding mayo, I think I will try that next time.

Very nice recipe - so simple and quick - didn't add salt, as we both have to watch our salt intake and the salted butter seemed like enough. I cut the recipe in half (only had one egg) and it made about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of sauce. Enough for two of us over asparagus and small steak.

I found it really wattery and runny when making it. I had to add flour to it bit by bit to thicken it. Otherwise it was really tasty.

I added a little more lemon juice and cayenne. Cooked on half power for 10 seconds at a time. Perfect,  thick rich sauce,  and so easy!  Easily the best I've had.

This is a revelation! This was super easy and came out perfect. Like other reviewers mine needed longer so as recommended I used 10 second intervals. I even melted my butter in the microwave which was tricky (watch it carefully and don't wait for it to go transparent) but saved on heating a pan of water. It was so quick and easy I will be sharing this with everyone! Thanks so much!

A quick hollandaise that is perfect for a quick breakfast. I cooked mine in two 15 second intervals to be sure the yolks were brought up to 145. I sat the finished recipe aside while I prepped the rest of my meal, and this sauce thickened nicely upon standing. I added a splash of water and stirred, and it came back together perfectly. Being single, I love the fact this only makes a couple of servings, so I don't have to use it at every meal for a week to avoid throwing it away.

Impressed! Was a bit skeptical, have had limited success in the past with Hollandaise sauce recipes and dry mix packages. Came out near perfect, smooth texture, good flavor. Might add a touch of vinegar next time, due to personal preference of a bit more tanginess. Thanks for sharing a great recipe scottki!

I microwaved in 7 second intervals and whisked like a madwomen in between, and it came out smooth and creamy. This is a keeper.

Too much butter for the amount of egg yolks used. Comes out much more runny than legit Hollandaise. Unfortunately, it ruined the bread I put our poached eggs on, because the butter soaked into it.

Since lemons come in different sizes I found that using 1 t. of fresh lemon juice was perfect. I also added 1 T mayo, which helped the consistency. A couple other reviewers mentioned adding white wine vinegar, but adding more than 2 drops in such a small amount of hollandaise sauce ruined the flavor. In addition, nuking for 10 seconds at 3 intervals and whisking in between worked out great!

This will be my go to hollandaise sauce. Super quick and easy, and not as rich as traditional hollandaise, but all the great lemony flavor (I did add extra lemon juice). Heats up the next day very well, too!!

Really good - I read the reviews that said to put 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise in it for creaminess, but I put 1 tablespoon of Miracle Whip in it and the flavor of the Miracle Whip did not taste good with the other ingredients. So the 2nd time I made it I just followed the recipe, without any Mayo added, put in juice from 1/2 a lemon because I like the tartness to come through a bit more, microwaved it for 15 seconds, whisked, then 15 more seconds, whisked again and the consistency was nice and thick and the flavor was really good. I put a small dollop  on top of Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, capers and onions and it tasted delicious. Making it 4 star because it's not quite restaurant quality, but still makes home-cooked brunch a real treat! Thanks! :)

Have not had Hollandaise sauce in years but woke up this morning with the image of eggs benedict in my mind. Not surprising since I have not gone grocery shopping and all I had was 1 English muffin, Canadian bacon & a carton of eggs. I was so surprised how few ingredients in the sauce and even happier that I had everything I needed!!  It came out so perfect! Definitely going to make this to pour over some asparagus- maybe with salmon! Yum! 

Also noticed this sauce recipe is Keto -friendly.  (Im not doing Keto) You could do an eggs bendict variation using Egg Thins instead of English Muffin with this sauce.

Okay! I have to admit. I did not read that well. I just chucked everything together in a sauce pan and over low heat on the stove whisked until it reached the desired consistency. The pepper gives this recipe an awesome kick!

Made the version above for family, they loved it! 
I made a gluten & dairy free Eggs benedict using Nuttlex spread instead of butter and it was devine. Thank you for the inspiration.

This was so incredibly easy and good I am amazed. I loved it and made it as written and I got some nice, thick, delicious hollandaise. But it was just so easy! Super recipe!

This was the first time I have ever made Hollandaise sauce and I made it just as written. My husband has never tried Hollandaise sauce and was a little leery about it, but he loved it. Thank you for this recipe.

I use this recipe regularly since it's so simple. I do add a little (a teaspoon-ish) to make it creamier. It's loved at my house.

It came out perfect.  I did microwave it for an additional 15-20 seconds and it thickened up more.  Amazing how easy it was and so quick.

Honestly the whole made simplicity of this recipe is a little unsettling but I made it think hey it’s worth a shot and man was I surprised!! This was terrific! Better than the powdered package stuff and very easy. Would make again, and would recommend.

Wow! This is awesome. The only difference is I followed others suggestions and added some mayo (I used Japanese mayo, it's made with only egg yolks) before whisking in the salted butter. I also added more lemon. Delicious and perfect

Easy peasy. Just whisked in microwave after 10 seconds. Then microwaved another 10 seconds. If it breaks, just add another small Pat of butter and whisk, or add a few drops of cold milk and whisk. That will bring it back together. Delicious and easy. Made lobster eggs benedict.

This was a very easy hollandaise sauce to make. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a little to buttery. I would cut back on the butter a little .

Only thing I did differently is microwave longer, so it thickens... you must be careful not to over heat. Recipe is awesome as is... no need to change ingredients whatsoever

Should specify microwaving starting at 10 seconds. I did 15 and it cooked the egg yolks to chunks. Some microwaves are different and stronger. I'll try again next time I need hollandaise and see about doing it in smaller increments.

Best  sauce I ever had.  I did like most of the reviewers. I added more lemon and the mayonnaise.  But, the original sauce is probably spicy enough when you have jalapenos, garlic and sausage to add flavor.

It scrambled my eggs in the microwave. I was willingly to just strain it but the sauce was gross! It was just butter. I’ve had Hollandaise sauce and this was NOT it!

Great recipe. I substituted Dijon mustard and the mayo with a dash of hot sauce. Delish but next time I will use just a tad less lemon juice.

I seldom leave reviews but this was too good and too easy not to!  Thank you!  I'm the only one in my household that likes hollandaise so never bother to make it as too much work.  I cut this recipe in half and came out perfect for one!  My new go-to and will be enjoying eggs benedict much more often now.  Thanks again!

I made egg Benedict for the first time, I’ve only ever eaten them at carrows before(they were disgusting). The first time I went with a blender recipe for the sauce...this is just as good and so much easier! I added a tiny bit of mayo as another reviewer advised for thickness and it was great. Will definitely make this sauce when we decide to have eggs Benedict.

Simple to make and simple to cleanup.
Conversion: 1/2 stick of butter = 1/4 Cup.
I have a 1,200 Watt Panasonic Inverter microwave and  use my 8" glass bowls. My butter, just out of the fridge, melts  uncovered in 20 seconds without making a mess.
The combined mixture thickens around the edges in 15 seconds so I remove it and whisk it together before putting it back in for another 10 seconds.  Then I whisk it more and serve.
Perfect every time, Thank You scottki

5 stars because of how low effort this is and the result is fine. My boyfriend makes a 'real' hollandaise and spends a good chunk of time making it. While the real deal is clearly better, this is something I can whip up in 2 minutes while I'm cooking other stuff to go with it.
This will have a much thinner texture than most other hollandaises, as well as a deeper color. The taste is about right, though! 
After microwaving mine I decided to add a tablespoon of mayo - it whisks in just fine after the heating. Then just a little more. And a splash of heavy whipping cream. I also like chives in mine. 
It makes a bit more than double what I needed for my 2-egg benedict. Luckily, this recipe is very easy to cut in half.  (Maybe it would have been just about double what I needed if I hadn't added the extras, since the recipe indicates it makes 2 servings.)

I appreciate this recipe for being simple and quick.  However...

Juice of a quarter of a lemon was a poor way to measure.  Perhaps just saying 1 teaspoon of lemon juice?

The sauce was too thin for my liking and lacked flavor.  I probably won’t use this recipe again

Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy!  This turned out great!  I added a bit too much lemon but I can easily adjust that next time.  

Just be careful with the microwave times.  I did 10 secs, whisked, then another 10.  It thickened up nicely.  Maybe a bit too much but I just added a small amount of hot water (from the tap) to thin it to the thickness I wanted.

Bottom line, super easy, super fast and tastes great.

3 Stars bc as is it didn't really work BUT I added a dollop of cream cheese and a little mayo (after it came out runny the first time through). Then I stirred stirred. Micro for another 20- 30 secs. Use a spoon around edges of bowl. Stir stir stir. Micro another 20-30, edges of bowl, stir stir stir. Keep doing that till it's thick.

Epic fail for me. I followed the recipe step by step and it was much too salty, I’m guessing because of the salted butter. I tried to salvage it by adding pepper and chives and then a splash of cream and nothing worked. Very disappointed with this recipe.

I made it according to the recipe  and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. Previous attempts using other recipes were  unpredictable at best. Sometimes it would come out fine and other times the sauce would separate beyond redemption. As a result, I quit making recipes that required hollandaise. This recipe rocks! Comes out fine every time. Made broiled salmon with asparagus last night and drizzled hollandaise over all and it was a gourmet experience. My only complaint is that the sauce was a bit on the thin side. I tried adding more corn starch but it was still a bit thin. After reading these reviews I will try mayo next time and reheat in 10 second intervals.

This is amazing! The recipe is perfect as is and so simple. I've made hollandaise before over a double boiler and it takes for ever and is so messy. This was fast and tasted delicious! We'll definitely be having hollandaise more often now!

I accidentally heated in microwave for 30 seconds instead of the suggested 5-20. It looked like it fell apart but I whisked again and it was fine. Thick, creamy and delicious!

I made to following the recipe but added more lemon and salt. My egg yokes scrambled some after 15 sec., so my microwave must be much stronger than others trying this recipe.  I salvaged it by straining it. It was the perfect consistency and delicious. My husband and I both loved it. Thank you for this easy and simple recipe!

I just made it two times.  First time was a flop, but the second turned out pretty well.  I have a whisk attachment on my hand mixer, so I used that to whisk before and after adding the butter.  This gave it some nice volume.  Still not as thick as normal Hollandaise, but the flavor was pretty good.

Mmmm our favorite eggs benny at home for a change - Nice. 
Good basic recipe, and the ease of making it, is what makes it worth it.  A few tweaks to your own tastes (more cayenne for us) and I agree with using the ten second heating increments as  I almost overcooked mine.  Will definitely make again.
Thanks

Ok I love my hollandaise sauces, however, I wanted a quick version and just enough for two!  I had two crab cakes leftover from a luncheon. This is it!! I was skeptical but this taste fantastic!  I had to adjust the salt (I buy unsalted)  and more lemon juice, it was nail on!!! Thank you!!

I always get stressed when I'm making Eggs Benedict.  With everything else to do and then you have to really pay attention to the sauce.  I found this recipe and thought, "there's no way this will work".
I screwed up and poured everything together, forgetting to "gradually" add the butter.  It still turned out great!

WOW!  This was SOOO easy!  Turned out silky smooth and delicious as well.  I did like most and did 10 second intervals stirring in between.  It took me 40 seconds total to get the thickness we liked.  This is going to be my go-to hollandaise recipe for now on :)

Great flavor!!! I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. 4 stars because a recipe like this needs to be made on the stove, not in the microwave.  And I thought it needed more cayenne pepper.  Other than that, YUMM!!!

Thank you for this. I can not leave a recipe alone. I added roasted garlic, white pepper, horseradish  and grated Asiago cheese.  Needless to say, YUM. Special thanks for the recipe very simple.

Came out great! I’m not a eggs Benedict person but made this for my boyfriend and he loved it.
I did add a teaspoon of mayo based off other reviewers however will make it without mayo next time and follow the actual receipe :)....
He could pick up on the mayo but said it was still good.

Used margarine because I was out of butter and didn't have lemon so I had to wing it. Unbelievably it was still quite yummy. I'm very excited to make it again using  the right ingredients given how incredibly easy this was to make

Making it this way will be watery.  Make as directed.  Mic 5 sec stir.  Mic 5 sec stir.  Repeat untill desired consistency.   Don't let it get too hot or it will seperate I  usually make it the proper way on the stove but today i wanted faster... It wasnt that much faster...lol...Still tasted perfect!

Oh Happy Days!  Here's a hollandaise sauce that's just my size!  So fast and easy it could be made often without wasting extra eggs and  2 sticks of butter on leftovers that will never be as nice as it was the first time.  Made it to go on an asparagus benedict, and added one teaspoon tip of mayo (1/2 tsp.?) as someone suggested.  I go heavy on the lemon and the cayenne, probably should not have even added any extra salt but I followed the recipe.  
I wasn't as vigilant on microwaving as I should have been, ended up microwaving twice for 15 seconds each, which caused my sauce to tighten up to almost a paste before it was warm enough to my liking.  But after whisking a bit more, it was so darn tasty and creamy!   But that was not as sauce-like, and I do suggest stopping and whisking after every 10 seconds like another reviewer did, and not cooking it 30 seconds. Tip: whisk those eggs like crazy with the lemon BEFORE you start whisking the butter in like crazy - that helps keep it from separating.  Mine was smooth as silk and crazy tasty!!!

My boyfriend found this recipe and made me eggs benedict for breakfast.  His first time making Hollandaise.  I found his results to be slightly on the lighter side as opposed to some that I have had that are very heavy.  The taste and consistency were divine.  Delicious!

Very good. No mayo needed, turned out silky and maybe even a tad too thick if anything. Didn't have cayenne, substituted with a tiny bit of chili.

This was wonderful!  I did use 1/2 lemon instead of the 1/4 because I like it more lemon tasting.  EASY!

I had a problem with this recipe because of the amount of lemon juice. My lemon was large so 1/4 was way too much and ruined it. I’m going to start with 1 tbl next time and adjust to my tastes. I microwaved in 10 second I intervals, whisking in between, until it thickened up. I will make this again following the changes above. Thanks for sharing such a simple recipe!

First time out of the gate, made a huge batch. 14 servings.  All at once. It was a large bowl that I just kept putting in the microwave at 30 second increments, and then whisking like crazy in between until it heated and started to thicken. Then I reduced the interval to 20 seconds to desired thickness. Amazing results. So easy.

Made it per the recipe and unfortunately didn't read the reviews with hints to make it edible. It was watery, too lemony and too spicy. I think we'd rather make a not-so-easy recipe than to revisit this waste of butter.

It took a few tries to get it right, but this version is much better than the double boiler process. I have been saving the egg whites in a jar in the fridge for a egg white quiche.

I made this on my lunch hr from work. It took me 10 min tops! 10 minutes for eggs Benedict! Wow! And it was good! I saw someone recommended a little mayo so I put in a teaspoon full as I figured it would make it creamier. Delish! This recipe is a keeper!

I made it for a wrap and I loved it! The method is super easy and you can customize it to whichever way you want! If the sauce is too runny, leave in the microwave for about 5 more seconds and it comes out great after whisking thoroughly!

Rating four stars due to simple prep and prepare time as well as being a great base...but it does require tweaking based on preference of flavor.  Butter flavor overpowered the taste so I added more lemon, a small tsp of light mayo and a half dime sized plop of basic yellow mustard .  Wah Lah - hubby and I loved it over toasted onion bagel "Benedict" with turkey meat, sunny side up egg and melted American cheese

It was very easy to make and delicious. I will start making it all the time I think. I didn't really how easy hollandaise sauce could be!
I did have to cook it for a few more 10 second intervals to get the consistency that I wanted.

Excellent easy recipe for hollandaise . I chose to use powdered lemon instead of lemon juice because it's easier to keep on hand.  I love this hollandaise on my breakfast pizza

Pretty good recipe if your'e short on time and don't feel like doing one of the blender recipes. I personally doubled the lemon juice in the recipe,  but that is surely a question of taste.

Easy and yummy recipe!
I did not add mayo, no need.  It was thick as is.

I initially microwaved for 15 seconds.  Then 2 more 10 second intervals.  Perfect!

Really good and much less time than on the stovetop. I used 15 second increments but will reduce it to 10 next time. It separated but I got it back with some cold water and whisking.

I doubled this recipe and made it in a 2 cup mason jar, whisking it with a handheld immersion blender as I added the butter. I only had one lemon so there was only about 1/4c of lemon juice which was perfect for us. Heated sauce in the microwave at 15 second bursts whisking in between for one minute and then kept it warm in a pot of hot water on the stove with the pot lid resting on top of the jar. It thickened up quite a bit in the 20 minutes it took to finish the brunch preparations, which I liked because it had been a bit on the thin side. I thinned it with about two Tbsp of cold water whisked in and it was perfect.

Super quick and easy. Taste and consistency just like real hollandaise-- not the store bought mix kind but the kind they used to make in really nice restaurants before everyone was so afraid of raw eggs.   I just melted the butter in the microwave until it was nuclear hot (not really, but close) then whisked the heck out of the egg mixture as I slowly added the hot butter.  No need to microwave again but my eggs were laid this morning and I am neither pregnant nor nursing so do what you need to do to be safe.   I might have added just a bit more lemon than recipe calls for but it was a big hit at my house.

This is amazing -- and by whipping it between microwave heating first at 15 seconds, then 12 seconds off and on several times, it was thick and perfect.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I didn't have to add any mayo, like others did, I felt it was thick enough for me after just the first 20 seconds of cooking that the recipe calls for.  Make sure you add the melted butter slowly and whisk it in well.  I did add some Worcestershire sauce, as hollandaise just doesn't taste the same without it.  Tasted delicious, was very easy to make, and had the perfect texture.  This was even better than I imagined it would be!

Wow. This will be my go to for hollandaise in the future.  I used to use the blender method but this is so much easier and less clean up.  I only had to microwave on my defrost setting for two 10 second increments.

Making this in the microwave took all the "fussing" out of sauce preparation on the stove. 
I had a beautiful sauce at the end of the allotted time! 
However, I was worried that the egg yolk wasn't cooked enough after so many seconds so I threw it in for 15 seconds more...DON'T do that! It sort of curdled in just that extra time. I used it and tasted great but didn't look good! 
If I use this method I'll have to get over my fear of eating raw egg!

This is the easiest hollandaise ever!  I just made this for 30 at a Christmas dinner!  I made 6 batches of 4 eggs each.  Keeping it warm in a double boiler at VERY  low heat.... It's so good.

Have always been put off making Hollandaise because of the whole double boiler thing. This was so easy and the texture was absolutely perfect. It was my first time and I was probably a little short on the salt and cayenne so will add a little more next time.

Too good - eaten before a photo could be taken and shared on social media to annoy everyone. Spot on recipe though. As others have said it needed an extra 10 seconds in the microwave and another whisk. I replaced the cayenne with a smidgen of American mustard for a bit of bite.

The flavor was great, my mistake was, since I cut it in half for one serving, I cooked it for 20 seconds and it started to cook the egg. I will make it again and start off with 15 seconds. Thanks for sharing!

I'm a semi-chef (home chef) at 59 and I've had my problems with making hollandaise for a long time.  This recipe is OUTSTANDING!  Nothing needs to be added or taken out.  Personally, after 20 seconds in the microwave, it's still a tad thin so I put it in for another 15-20 seconds and it is PERFECT after whisking it.  This is an amazing recipe and I will never use any other.  If I could have rated it 10 stars, I would have.  I only wish I had this recipe when I was 25 and had then started serious cooking.

This was my first time making hollandaise,  and it turned out nicely.  This is a good,  easy recipe.
I added the tablespoon of mayonnaise before adding the melted butter and microwaved in short increments until I got the desired consistency as well.  I'll be adjusting it slightly,  and using it in the future!  Thanks!

This was the most perfect hollandaise I've ever made! And so easy! I halved the recipe as it was just for me, and it still worked well with enough sauce for 2 poached eggs. Added half a teaspoon of mayonnaise as suggested by others.

04-02-16 ~ I made this to top 'Egg Benedict Casserole' from AR. It was simple to make, but a little thicker than what I was looking for. Next time, I'll add a little mayonnaise or increase the butter and lemon juice by just a tad. The flavor was very good and complimented the casserole, nicely. This is great way to make a fast hollandaise sauce.

Worked perfectly! I was very surprised.  I adjusted the ingredients to meet my taste expectations but the technique really worked. I microwaved it 5 seconds at a time, each time whipping it before heating again. I was able to get the desired "ribbon effect" after 20 seconds of heating. Very pleased, and so much easier than trying to hold a bowl over a double boiler, whip, AND stream butter in all at the same time.

1st time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. It was tasty and quick, however just a little too thin for my preference. 2nd time I added 1 tbsp of mayo to the butter, before melting.  Also I microwaved it in 10 second increments whisking in between until desired consistency (4× or 40 sec total for my microwave). Everyone loved it. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Mine turned out OK (I put way too much lemon) but before making it I noticed that a lot of people had said that they wished for it to be thicker. So what I did to combat it being runny is I wisked in a splash of cream with it before popping it into the microwave, but it still seemed too thin for my liking. So I kept switching between wisking and microwaving on 15 second intervals till it reached a consistency I liked. About three passes.

I used Tony Chacherie seasoning in place of cayenne and salt. I used one half of a small lemon.  I microwaved 15 seconds so it was too thin. Try 10 more seconds. If it gets too thick add a little bit of hot water.  I've made lots of different hollandaise sauce and by far this was the easiest.  It only makes enough for two people but that was just what I needed.

The club's in the name... this really was the easiest hollandaise I've ever made! 

I used white wine vinegar as I was out of lemon juice, but it tasted great. Lovely consistency, will always use this method in future!

I added a tablespoon of mayo and it turned out perfectly, just the right consistency it would have been too thin otherwise. You definitely need to whisk after microwaving.

Thank you for this recipe and the people that suggested the mayo.  Today is my dad's 89th birthday and I made him eggs Benedict.  He loved the sauce.  So easy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the addition of the mayo that wasn't included in the base recipe.

Followed other reviews by adding the Mayo and for the first time making a Hollandaise Sauce it turned out perfect. And couldn't be easier! Recipe actually made more than what I expected. It's in my fav list!

Great recipe! Definitely heat in 10 second increments, I heated it too long the first time and cooked the egg yolks. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Really really good. Don't be too liberal with the salt or the lemon tho... Follow the recipe with exact amounts.

Followed recipe ingredients exactly, but had to whip in a glass bowl over simmering pot of water because we do not use a microwave, and poured over servings of fresh steamed green beans. The sauce was rich and creamy, definitely my new go to sauce when short on time, which is often. Delicious!

I did a double batch.  I used the juice of a whole small lemon - about 25ml.  So easy!  I like wholegrain mustard in hollandaise so added 25g to the double mix before adding the melted butter.  Like others I cooked in 10 second increments after the initial 15 secs. My melted butter wasn't really hot to begin with so that probably made a difference.

This was good and easy. I would cut way back on the butter though. It seemed excessive. There's definitely a point in the 10 second intervals where it sets up and gets thick. I did a few rounds of 10 second intervals and it went from runny to thick in the last round. It was perfect so I stopped cooking it. It sat for a bit and I went to heat it up one last time and accidentally did 30 seconds instead of the intended 10 seconds. It scrambled... But was still tasty, just not very pretty.

Made it today using 1 tbsp. lemon juice.  Microwaved 10 seconds at a time stirring in between until thickened.  It did curdle a bit (should have gone maybe 5 seconds last burst) but a touch of water stirred in and it was perfect.  Daughter said the amount (using two small yolks) was perfect for two poached eggs, each on 1/2 English muffin.

This was delicious.  I did follow the suggestion of Shauana Tenple and added Mayo to the recipe.  I also cooked it longer, each time whisking well, and then adding 15 second increments.  It thickened up nicely.

I *love* hollandaise sauce. L-O-V-E it. And the flavor and consistency of this recipe is completely comparable to standing in front of your stove and whisking a pot of hollandaise for 25 minutes Julia Child style. I will never - NEVER - make hollandaise on my stove ever again. If I could give this recipe 6 stars I would, it was that easy and perfect (my first shot, too!)

I've never had hollandaise before but I made this this morning and really liked it. ^_^ I went for 40 seconds in the microwave for it to be a little thicker.

As is, I didn't think it had enough lemon and it was too runny.  After reading the reviews, I added a spoonful of mayo plus more lemon.  It's a 5 star after that and so easy!  I used Tabasco instead of cayenne.  I love this recipe.

I made this after a failed attempt at a different hollandaise recipe. I had all the eggs and bread and bacon done and then my sauce curdled and looked awful so I panicked then saw this recipe and gave it a go. It was amazing and perfect and so easy and quick and saved my breakfast. I doubled the recipe and everyone loved it. Thanks

i read the reviews first so i knew it might take a little longer in the microwave, which i did and it turned out fantastic. I went a little heavy handed with the cayenne pepper so will correct that next time. I juiced half a lemon but was not enough for me so i juiced the other half into the sauce. Wow, just fantastic, I can't believe i just made Hollandaise sauce for the very first time and it was delicious. thank you for the recipe, easy to follow and so so very good.

Absolutely love it. It is so easy to make. I did time it every 10 seconds, though, whisking in between, until it became thick and creamy.  I also added more lemon juice for the flavor we like in a Hollandaise. But otherwise it was yummy, almost as good as the stove top double boiler one, if that turns out as it should, which is not the norm for me, often leading to scrambled eggs. Thank you for posting this recipe. It is wonderful.

Delicious and dairy free. Used Becel Vegan Margarine instead of butter, added 1 tbsp fat free Miracle Whip before melting, 2 tsp Realemon juice instead of lemon and added some dry herbs to the salt and cayenne and voila...a delicious eggs Benedict when poured over gluten free toasted roll, pea meal bacon and my husband's yummylicious poached eggs.

After years of trying t find the perfect recipe, finally!! This is the easiest, most delicious one of all. Do not turn your back on it simply because it is microwaved, it's simply the best! I added chopped chives to it at the end just because I like them :-)

Thank you for sharing this recipe,scottki. It was quick AND delicious. I added juice of half a lemon and followed another reviewer's suggestion and microwaved in 10 second increments. I also added a few drops of hot water in the end to thin out a bit. Will definitely be making again. Whew! And I didn't have to wash the blender! Yeah! :)

Very easy to do in microwave.  Next time I would increase the lemon juice to 1/3 cup and after the first 20 seconds, whisk after every 10 seconds for 3 more intervals.  20 seconds was too long as the eggs would start to clump.  But overall quick, easy and yummy.

Easy and delicious just as other reviews rave. It isn't as rich as a regular hollandaise but it does the trick in way less time! I melted my butter for just a minute too long so it was very hot when I drizzled it into the yolk mixture...I whisked strongly to make sure it didn't cook the egg and it ended up being perfectly thick. I put it in the microwave for less than 10 seconds and it was exactly right. Would recommend/do again! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Easy, fast and tasty. A little extra cayenne and a dash of  mayo might be needed to suit some palates.

By far the simplest way I have found to get your "fix".  I added a splash of malt vinegar at the end to add a little extra tang which I like.  Also after I have done the final microwave, I sit the bowl in the water with the poached eggs as they finish their cooking.  This cooks the sauce to my liking, and keeps it hot.  Just remember to keep whisking it.  Thanks!

There is no reason to not have Hollandaise sauce now!  This is so easy and delicious.  I tried using a little mayo like some of the reviews mentioned but it ruined the pure, rich hollandaise sauce so I remade it just as it was written.  It's perfect as written!

Great recipe, I doubled it and found microwaving it at 10sec intervals with whisking in between until desired consistency a better way.

This was absolutely delicious! Did add the scant tablespoon of mayo as suggested. Easy enough to make a weekday breakfast weekend special.

Very easy to make and delicious!  I used margarine because I had no butter and it turned out just as good.  I should have started with 10 seconds in the microwave because I tried at 15 and it was a bit too thick.  I added a tiny bit of water until it was the right consistency and kept whisking and it turned out really creamy.   Definitely a keeper!

Very simple and worked well, even with half butter and half margarine (as I didn't have enough butter!) Added a bit of salt and pepper and the idea about adding a spoon full of mayo to thicken is a good one. Much less labour intensive than the normal method:-) Thank you!

Very quick and easy, be careful to not over-microwave , but a quick whisk will remove small lumps. Fantastic!

My blender went out and I was looking for a recipe that didn't require babysitting.  This was perfect!  Easily double.  I microwaved for 30 seconds, 10 seconds at a time and whisking between each go round.  Amazing!

This was good in a pinch but thought it needed more lemon... I too added some mayo to make a bit more creamy. I will make this again in a pinch but just add more lemon

Loved this recipe! Very easy to make. I added the mayo that another person recommended and instead of lemon juice I used lime juice because I did not have any lemons. I also added much more cayenne pepper.

I was sceptical - but this recipe delivered what it promised; a very quick and passable hollandaise in minutes for two people.

I was leery about trying the microwave but it worked great! You need to keep a close eye on it as you heat it and heat it in small increments.  But it was very easy and tasty. My husband even said I need to keep this recipe on hand.
