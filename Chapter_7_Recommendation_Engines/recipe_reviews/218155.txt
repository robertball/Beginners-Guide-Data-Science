As this recipe's first reviewer I was hoping to offer better than this average, 3-star review. Yes, they're good.  Moist, lightly chocolate and more cake-like, just as the submitter describes.  Still, I have a few criticisms that wouldn't allow me to rate them higher.  First, there are holes in the cake, which in my view is not pretty, whether it affects taste or not.  My fault, possibly, but I generally don't have that problem.  Second, the preparation requires a little more monkeying around with than it needs to and could easily be simplified.  Finally, there is just nothing uniquely special or stand-out about them to distinguish them from other, similar, recipes.  Good, but not memorable.

This recipe is very much like my Texas Sheet Cake recipe.  It is very moist delicious more cake like than the chewy brownies that I have traditionally made.  It is very good for a change.  I would list it as a cake recipe not a brownie recipe.

Moist, cake like brownies.  There isn't much flavor, so if there is a next time, I'd have to make extra strong coffee (maybe 3 T instant to a cup of water!).  The frosting  is smooth and rich.  I was surprised when frosting was  put it on the hot bars, that the bars didn't absorb it!

This really is chocolate cake--if you want a chewy brownie, this is not it.

Texas sheet cake. Not really brownies. But I added more cocoa (about 2/3 cup) and added 2 t vanilla to batter. (You really need vanilla in a chocolate recipe to draw out that rich cocoa flavor). Otherwise this recipe is amazing, I couldn't stop eating it.

This is a sure fire crowd pleaser and also takes me back to my childhood. I added an additional Tbsp of cocoa to the brownie batter an an additional 1/2 tbsp of cocoa to the frosting. Add a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon bourbon  along with the vanilla to the frosting. 
This will be my go to dessert to bring to big gatherings.

'Been eye-ing this recipe for a while since it's similar to one I love.  The only difference was that this one has an additional half cup flour.  Both have the exact same recipe for the frosting.  I love a frosted brownie.  Could this recipe as good as "My love" by adding frosting?  I wouldn't think that small amount of flour would make a difference, but it seems the frosting does?  The warm frosting over the warm brownies make them more dense & rich - I think?  These are cakelike.   I'm a mere "okay" with chocolate cake - with one exception, but I won't get into that.  Sum-up:  Short cake, not brownies, here.

The brownie part is just so-so. The frosting was over the top sweet and there was WAY too much. A very, very thin layer would have been sufficient.

Just made these and another brownie recipe. This particular recipe is similar to a recipe I used to make as a kid, with the buttermilk recipe and the powdered sugar icing. I enjoyed the brownies and were very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and my family thoroughly enjoyed them as well. I can see I'll definitely be making these again :))
