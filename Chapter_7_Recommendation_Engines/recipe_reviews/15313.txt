If you love rich chocolate, coffee, and a nice soft texture, this is a great cookie recipe! I have made it at least 10 times for my family and friends, and they always turn out tasting good. I always use the "microwave and glass bowl technique" to melt the chocolate chips and baking chocolate. The only problem I have had when baking these cookies is that sometimes they flatten out too much if the batter gets too close to room temperature. They seem to do much better when the batter is put in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before baking. Watch these closely--as soon as they begin cracking, take them out--they will look gooey, but after they cool, they will be rich and delicious! Thanks for this recipe--one of my favorites!

when i first finished mixing the batch, i placed the cookies on the sheet and they just melted right on there, so i thought it was a disaster. if you leave the batch around exposed for a while, it hardens, and the melting won't happen. i wouldn't make these cookies for guests to eat right out of the oven, but the day after, they're just absolutely to die for! love this recipe!! but not to be made the day-of for dinner guests, for instance

Chocolate Espresso Cookies are awesome!  I made a big batch to share with my coworkers, and everyone _loved_ them!  They are perfect, and the espresso flavor is not at all overpowering.  Some folks who tried them suggested putting in whole espresso beans -- only for true caffeine nuts!

I actually found this on anther site a few years ago and this is one of my all time faves. Yes, it has a brownie like consistency, so it was a surprise the 1st time I made it, but a GOOD surprise. Every time I make this I am showered with a mix of compliments (Oh my gawd these are amazing) and complaints (I hate you, a cannot stop eating these!), so I am always happy to make and share!

These really hit the spot!  I used instant espresso powder instead of espresso grounds and upped the amount to a heaping tablespoon which turned out great!  I also upped the flour to a cup because of everyone saying how flat the cookies were coming out, and it did work, but I probably would have liked them the way they were since I like flat cookies.  But if you like your cookies a little cakier, try that. :)

Absolutely delicious. I ended up discarding the nuts and mixing all of the chocolate chips into the initial chocolate mixture. This changed the cookie time a bit (if I did it for 11 minutes they turned out really mushy), so I just ended up taking them out when they looked "done". A huge hit with friends and family. Another fun thing to try is using peppermint coffee, which gave the cookies more of a christmas-y feel.

This was the first time I've tried making a chocolate-based cookie, but gosh, it tasted great! I like the recipe primarily because the cookies taste sufficiently chocolatey without being too sweet. I added an extra teaspoonful of espresso just for the extra punch!

VERY deep and dark on the chocolate, if you like that sorta thing, and the coffee taste is a mild one. It was basically a thinned out brownie, and although they are ultra-rich, we still enjoyed them.

Not sure about these; very strange batter for a cookie, making them turn out very flat.  Taste is great, very rich and chocolately.  When cooled I pressed a chocolate covered espresso bean in the middle.  Definitely gets your heart pumping!

I just finished making these and it's a really good recipe!  The only thing I did different was I didn't have baker's choc and used cocoa powder instead.  Also used pecans, not walnuts.  Terrific!!!

Every holiday season I attend a rather competitive cookie exchange with a group of fellow moms, and this year I was looking for a mocha-type cookie recipe being that I have been on a Starbucks' kick lately.  Well, this recipe is a winner, hands down!  For recipes that I find online, I try not to initially change things too much, but after reading the reviews, I made my first test batch with a full cup of flour.  The batter wasn't as thin as I thought it would be from the other reviews, and so I will continue to make these with 1 cup of flour (with so much chocolate in the batter, the flavor is still there, and with the three eggs, they still had a very fudgie consistency.)  For the 2nd test batch, I made them with a full tbsp. of espresso grounds (Starbucks' Espresso Roast, #9 grinder setting.)  This change seems to have upped the coffee flavor some, but going along with another reviewer, I feel these cookies get better after a day or more, so I will see after they are completely cooled and the flavors have had time to meld.  I can see how some reviewers used this batter to make brownies instead.  I probably never will, but I noticed that these cookies have to sit on the sheets (I use stoneware so the cookies do continue to cook even after they are out of the oven) for several minutes to set.  Bottom line, these gems are so fudgie and delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!

These were pretty good, but the batter was very thin. I had to add a lot of extra flour, so the cookies were a bit cake-like. Next time I might just pour the batter in a baking dish and make brownies out of it.

My cookies didn't "crack" on the tops, and unfortunately, I ended up burning the bottoms, which is not the fault of the recipe, but I couldn't give them a high rating on their own.  I made the rest of the batter into brownies, and they were awesome--perhaps the best brownies I've ever had.  If I'd baked the cookie versions properly, they might have been just as good, but from now on, I'll be using this recipe for brownies!

Does NOT work for cookies--the batter is much too thin, even after adding additional flour. They flattened right out and were dry within 8 minutes. Makes better brownies.

Made as written several times with excellent reviews....however, I roll the dough into balls, after refrigerating the dough, and dip them in powdered sugar. Makes for a nice crackled effect. Delicious either way! Thank you for the fine recipe!

I've made this recipe 3x.  The first time, the cookies came out  perfectly.   The next 2 times (when the weather was much warmer), the cookies were too flat for my liking.  The flavor is fabulous.  The only changes I made were using 1 1/2 tsp instant espresso powder in lieu of the beans, dark chocolate chips & mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The next time I bake them, I will increase the flour to 1 full cup & refrigerate the batter before baking.

I accidentally melted all of the chocolate chips  instead of saving half for later, but the cookies still came out pretty delicious! I'm going to try it according to directions next time, but either way, it satisfied my chocolate/coffee craving!

My 2 year old daughter and I made these and the only changes we made were using brown sugar, dark chocolate chips, and instant coffee (about 1 1/2 T) because that's what I had.  They are awesome!  Everybody loved them.  I love regular cookie dough, but this dough is almost like fudge!  I ate umm...a lot of it.
