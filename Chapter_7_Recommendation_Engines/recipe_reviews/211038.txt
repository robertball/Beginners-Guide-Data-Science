This was great. Easy!  I added fresh mushrooms, bell peppers (red & green), garlic, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning.

This was very tasty! I would def season the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking. I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of ones in a jar and they were so good! The thigh meat was tender too... My husband loved it! Will def make this again! Probably with more veggies and fresh herbs. Thanks! :)

3 stars as written but 4 stars w/ a little doctoring up.  Add garlic and onion and Italian seasoning to the sauce and salt and pepper on the chicken. This makes it much more flavorful!
