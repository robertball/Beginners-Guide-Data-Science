This was pretty good.  I used olive oil instead of grape seed oil (although grape seed oil would have been fine) It makes a fairly thin sauce but once tossed with the pasta it thickened up.  (Mind you, pasta isn't exactly 'skinny')  Some steamed broccoli and sauteed mushrooms were great side dishes.

I substituted a few items out; Butter instead of Oil, Almond Milk rather than Low Fat Milk, and Mozzarella instead of Parmesan. ( I did add an extra Tbs of flour) And it turned out amazing!!!!!

I would omit the salt because the cheese is salty enough.  I thought the sauce was a little thin, but it worked well when mixed into my recipe.  It's essential to use a good quality cheese - the green box from the super market isn't going to make the cut here.  A half teaspoon of cayenne added a nice kick.

I used the serving option to calculate for 60 people. I made the sauce and added it to cooked chopped up chicken and spaghetti for our church dinner. I had to do this 4 times to make enough to feed approx. 150 people. I got rave reviews. If you are on a budget, or have to work with what you have, this is excellent. I did use a tad bit more flour. I will be making this for myself at home now!

This was VERY good.  I opened a jar of Alfredo sauce from the store and it was nasty so I needed a recipe with ingredients I had on hand.  Voila!  This recipe was perfect!  Simmered cooked chicken in the sauce to soak up the juices.  Yummy!

I would definitely make this again it was great but I also added about an extra cup of whole milk, and an extra tablespoon of flour.

Quite yummy and flavorful! Fit into my calorie regime perfectly. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken just cause that's what I had open. Probably even better with chicken. Will definitely keep!

I couldn't get this to thicken. I used almond milk so maybe that was the problem. To thicken it, I cooked my pasta in it! I used probably 4oz instead of 12 but normally I cut pasta amounts in half anyway. It was just the right ratio at 4oz for our preferences. I forgot the parmesan and actually didn't miss it. It would taste better with it, but it didn't seem wrong how I ate it.

Excellent.  I love alfredo sauce . . . until I look at what goes into it.  This is an authentic tasting sauce that doesn't leave you balking at the fat content.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Fantastic! I searched for a recipe that does not use butter and I'm so happy I found this one. A few changes based on what I had on hand: I used EVOO, shredded Asiago instead of Parm (about 1/2 cup), and omitted the salt since the cheese and broth are already salty. Tasted delicious as is. You can change it up with a few other seasonings:
I added Cayenne and paprika to make it a little more cajun-ish. Could add basil as another option. But, again, it was great as-is. It is a thin sauce, but I prefer that to the gloppy store-bought alfredo. 
I served this over whole wheat pasta with roasted veggies (broccoli, carrots, asparagus, mushrooms), peas, and shrimp.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it turned out really good. With the exception of substituting olive oil for the grape seed oil, I followed the recipe exactly as written. The sauce does look a little thin as you’re cooking it but as it cooled down a bit and mixed with the pasta it did thicken up to a nice consistency. Have to agree with other reviews about watching the salt. I used freshly grated Parmesan and waited until the end to salt it. This one is a keeper.

Wow, this is so good and so easy.  I love that I can just use things I already have in the refrigerator and pantry. I always add more garlic than called for in a recipe so I probably doubled the garlic. I used 2% milk.  I will double the recipe  next time so there is plenty of sauce for a pound package of dried linguine. I will also probably use a little parsley to garnish. Thanks so much, this was delicious.
