AWESOME recipe, it was quick and easy and delicious. I would suggest adding a little bit of onion and some hot sauce to spice it up. Overall, really great idea!

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make! I have four kids and they all absolutely loved it. It's nice to come home after work and prepare a quick meal for the family that looks so elegant. I doubled the recipe because our family has six people, we had a guest over and my son and husband always want seconds. I had one can of cream of celery soup at home but when I stopped at the store to get another, I decided to grab a can of cream of shrimp soup. This was the only change I made and it worked really well with the recipe. This is definitely a keeper!
