In some Filipino recipes, they add dried banana blossoms. They also put a cup of pineapple juice to make it sweet. Depends on how you want it. :)

I'm giving this a 5 star review just from the reaction my Filipino hubby had when he came home last night and found that I had prepared this dish for him.  I am a Gma from the south and although this has been prepared numerous times with southern families, mine was not one of them!  DH had mentioned several times how much he would love to have pigs feet and told me I could cook them using the basic ingredients I use for a favorite chicken/pork adobo recipe that we both love.  When I found fresh pigs feet in our market, I knew the time had come.  Your recipe filled the need for the instructions. I got a great review from him and I only want to pass it on to you.  Thank you for making my DH a happy camper!!  He said it reminded him of home.  You just can't top that!!

My local store was out of pigs feet so I made this dish using pig tails.  Wow!  It was fantastic; a bit fatty but absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to try this using pork shoulder and pigs feet.  A solid five stars

We had been to a pig roast, Filipino-style, and came home with a leg and other meaty bones and some Mang Tomas All-Purpose Sauce. This easy stew recipe was just right for using our leftovers. Quite tangy from the vinegar, but tasty and so simple to make and serve with rice. You can order the Mang Tomas Sauce online.

The vinegar was too strong for this recipe and the sugar portion was too little as well ... so that being said ... I will be minimizing the vinegar content next time and I have added at least 1/2 cup of sugar to the mixture with some pineapple juice and it turned out better.

Filled the house with the most insanely scrumptious smells. Needed to boil it for about 2 hours to soften up the meat enough. Also delicious with chicken leg quarters added.

I followed the recipe closely except for the salt. For my taste, there's more than enough salt in the soy sauce. This recipe serves as a perfect hot and sour soup. I added carrots, but any crunchy veggies would work.

I plan to try it with tofu, shallots, bok choy, and shrimp.

I didn't have pig's feet available so i subbed pork neckbones. It was delicious! I also used a slow cooker. Cooked this on high for 4 hrs. My family loved it. It's a keeper. Thanks!!!
