This recipe is so easy to make and has a fresh vibrant taste from the lemon and parsley.   Instead of jarred pimento I used fresh baby sweet red & yellow peppers which gave it a nice crunch.  I also left out the pine nuts only because my husband doesn't like them, but, I am sure they would be wonderful.   Thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe as is and it was just okay. There was not a real taste to it warm. The next day I added some oil and vinegar, chick peas, and green onion to made it into a cold salad. I liked it much better that way.

Wonderful alternative to rice or potato side dishes. Great o a bed of fish. This is a go-to recipe for us. Made exactly as stated, no alterations. Delicious! Thank you.

Perfect fresh and zesty lemon flavor. I
served it over fresh saut√©ed spinach placing a salmon filet with lemon slices. 

Yummy!

I really liked the lemon. in this. I followed the recipe as written except I didn't have pine nuts. I also had to add just a little more water because it was sticking. will definitely make again!

Thanks redveeder for this recipe. This was my first time making couscous and it was great. I did not have the pimentos, pine nuts, or fresh parsley so I made it without and it was still great.

Delicious!! I will make this over and over. Served it with Tilapia. I followed the recipe closely, although I substituted some things using what I had on hand. I used fresh, diced red peppers instead of canned, and chives instead of parsley. Delicious and light.
