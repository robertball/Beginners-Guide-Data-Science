This was a good start to how I made my soup.  I used Virgin Olive Oil, minced garlic, diced celery & onion to my pan first, browned, then added the beef to brown.  I also add bay leaf and basil to my soup.  Turned out great.  Ate some and froze the rest!

Love this soup! I use Clammato tomato juice coctail and it tastes great.  Usually end up using 3 cups tomato juice and 4 cups water.  Also add cans of green beans, corn, and diced tomatoes at the end.

This was a great recipe! I didn't have tomato juice so I used rotel! I also added a little garlic powder and Tony's. Also added a vegetable bouillon cube along with the beef. We will make this again! Thank you

This was very tasty. I didn't have any vegetable juice so I used tomato sauce and beef broth. I had to add a lot of extra seasoning but that okay. Brought this to Sunday dinner after church and everyone liked it :)
