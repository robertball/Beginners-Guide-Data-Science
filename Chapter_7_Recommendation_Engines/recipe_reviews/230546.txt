Made a double batch with our own frozen corn for a football party.  Everyone loved it.  It was excellent with chili.  And those on gluten free diets were thankful they could have some too.

If people are complaining about the texture being gritty it is because you cant sub cornmeal, which is very coarse and needs to be cooked in boiling hot liquid to soften as a substitute. You have to use Masa, and i could never imagine favorable results being had, by sticking this in the microwave to bake!

Just like what we find in the restaurants! The family LOVED it! I have a family of six and we ate it all and the kids were asking for more.  Next time I'll be doubling the recipe. The only other change I'll be making is adding a tad more butter & cream to the recipe... I'd like it to hold it's shape from the ice cream scoop a little bit better. (It was a bit flaky and fell apart as soon as it was touched... but delicious anyway!)

This was really good! I mixed the masa with the water and let it sit while I creamed the butter.  I put the dough in an 8-inch round cake pan and cooked it in a pressure cooker instead of the oven (20 minutes high pressure; let pressure drop naturally for 10 minutes) and it worked well. I cut the sugar to 2 Tbsp, but it was still on the sweet side for me. Next time I might cut back to 1 tablespoon. Served it with black beans and rice.

I followed the recipe verbatim and it turned out pretty good. The next time I'll shorten the baking time to 45-50 minutes as baking it for 60 minutes turned it to a cornbread consistency.
