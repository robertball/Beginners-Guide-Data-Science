Excellent... Very tastey...** Ok a few notes.. I leave it up to you....

- I did the mix, all wet ingredients and then all dry
ingredients... A normal muffin like mixture. 

- I used brown sugar in place of regular sugar, taste
better..

- I also used 1 cup of regular flour and  1/2 cup
whole wheat.. I imagine you can use all whole wheat,
if you like. Up to you...

- I have to bake them for longer than 17 mins, I baked
them for 20-25 mins and they were perfect. 

- I also added 1/2 teaspoon NUTMEG, as I ran out of
ALLSPICE. :-)

Ok.. those my notes...

A quick easy muffin.  Few changes: Used all butter, all brown sugar, did half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, added 1/4 tsp. vanilla and 1 small finely chopped apple, raisens and 1 Tbsp. Wheat Germ.  This made 18 medium size muffins.  It's a keeper

Wow, this recipe was so easy and my 3 year old loved it.  I lowered the butter by half and added a touch more applsauce.  I didn't have allspice on hand, so I used cinnimon and ground cloves.  I also used cinnamon applsauce.  Very tasty and healty treat.

I used another reviewer's suggestion & made 6 jumbo muffins; I added 1/4 t. salt and a streusel topping, and they were delicious. My husband thought they were great and suggested I add nuts next time. I love the texture, and even though it is reminiscent of spice cake, it has a nice texture and that good old-time muffin flavor. I will definitely use this again as mini-muffins for my grand-kids and also try it as a coffee cake in a 9" baking pan. I gave it 5 stars for taste, texture, & versatility.

Delicious! Especially straight out of the oven! Due to personal preference I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flours and all brown sugar (this just screamed to me that it wanted a touch of molasses). To lighten this up, I might even try using 1/2 butter called for and subbing in extra applesauce. But some butter needs to be here--it completely adds to the flavor! YUMMY! Thanks!

Tried these out for my kids' school snack and they were great! Whole family loved the flavor! After reading the reviews & checking what was in my kitchen I made these changes: used 1/4 cup unsalted butter ~ substituted 2/3 cup brown sugar for white sugar ~ substituted 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for the allspice (didn't have any). 
For the batter: 1) mixed butter, brown sugar, eggs, and applesauce ~ 2) separately sifted together dry ingredients ~ 3) pour wet mix into dry mix and stirred just until blended. Recipe made 24 mini muffins. 
Next time I will: use 1 cup all-purpose flour & Â½ cup whole wheat flour ~ use either chunky applesauce or add chopped apple pieces.

I love this recipe for my picky one year old.  There isn't pieces of fruit for him to pick out, but he still gets the fruit.  I always substitute a third of the white flour for whole wheat flour (1/2 cup in this recipe).  It gives it more texture and nutrition.  The second time I made them, I used a packet of Kashi's instant apple and cinnamon oatmeal instead of the the spices called for.  Plus it adds the healthy oatmeal that my son won't realize is in there. They came out so good, he won't be the only one eating them!

these were pretty good, quick and easy, made with ingredients that I usually have on hand.  As for flavor, they were pretty good, but I think if I made them again I would add more spice.

I am confused...why rate the recipe 5 stars if you change it even a small amount? Some people almost substituted every item for their own. It becomes your recipe then, not hers. I made it exactly the way listed here and it was wonderful.

These are delicious!!  I followed recipe exactly and made no changes other than the addition of a little sprinkled sugar/nutmeg mixture.  The texture is wonderful.  My husband made the suggestion of adding some chopped walnuts and I agree.  There are many possibilities with this one as far as additions of fruit, nuts, etc.  Don't change the muffin recipe, it's perfect the way it is.  Not too bland, not too sweet.  It will be a regular around this house.  I actually made 12 reg size muffins rather than the minis.  I even frozen part of them and they are still delicious thawed and warmed.  Update:  I made these again adding dried sweetened cranberries and chopped walnuts.  Amazing!!!  I've made so many muffin recipes lately and this one has them all beat.

These came out just beautifully and not too sweet. Seemed perfect to me. I used brown sugar instead of white because of other reviewer's recommendations.

GOod base recipe but it feels like the main ingredient is missing. The applesauce was not strong enough. Next time I will add some fresh apple chunks.

Okay... I know I should be reviewing this recipe as is, however, it is impossible for me too follow one exactly.  I am also a bit of a health nut, and made the best muffins tonight.  I used:  1 1/2 c whole wheat flour  1 c quick oats  1/2 c ground flaxseed  1/2 tsp salt  2 tsp baking powder  1 tsp baking soda  1/2 tsp cinnamon  1 egg  1/2 c brown sugar  1 c apple sauce  1/2 c apple butter  1 tbsp apple cider  1 tbsp canola oil  Mix wet and dry separately; add dry to wet; DO NOT OVER MIX; fill a greased 12 cup muffin tin with all the batter, 17 minutes later at 350 degrees and you have created the best healthy breakfast ever!!

I halved the margarine and sugar, substituted brown sugar for the white, whole wheat flour for the AP, pumpkin pie spice for the allspice, added a grated Granny Smith apple.  It made 28 mini muffins, baked in 15 minutes. These muffins were really tasty, had a nice fluffy texture not dense at all.  A good healthy muffin!

I made quite a few changes to this recipe based on others' reviews. I changed the sugar to brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp vanilla. and melted the butter. I also changed the way it was mixed. First I sfited together the flour, cinnamon, allspice, baking powder, and baking soda. Then I made a well. Then I lightly beat the eggs and mixed with the melted but cooled butter, the brown sugar, the applesauce, and the vanilla. I poured the wet into the dry and mixed til just moistened. I made 12 and left them in for 24 minutes.  They came out moist and delicious, but I might try a little more spice to it next time.  Maybe some nutmeg?

Very good but butter makes the difference.  These are actually more like a cupcake than a muffin - they are rich and the texture more cake like.  Could be iced and served as a dessert snack.

Delicious!  My daughter couldn't tell me how it was because she kept stuffing the muffin in her mouth!  I followed others' advice and used brown sugar in place of white, 1/2 ww flour, 1/4 cup oil instead of butter, added 2 tbsp of wheat germ and 1 cup of shredded apple.  Also topped with streusel topping.  Even my sceptical older daughter gobbled them up!

I liked the texture of these muffins. the flavor seemed to be missing something. I doubled the cinnamon and omitted the allspice. I would make these again, maybe adding some vanilla.

For these muffins, I followed the recipe except for a few things. I used 1/3 cup white sugar, and 1/3 cup dark brown sugar. I also used salted butter and not margarine. Another thing, is that the recipe only made 12 muffins not 16, and i had to bake for about 20 minutes not 17. With these changes, the muffins were delicious! I would most definetly make them again.

This is a delicious muffin!  Only changes I made were to use melted butter for the margarine, brown sugar for the white sugar and I added in 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  These muffins are delicate and have a nice, not too sweet flavor.  Tasting them makes me ready for fall.

I did my best to cut the fat down in this recipe and also use up a monster container of oatmeal I found in my pantry. I used buttermilk instead of margerine, cut the sugar down to 1/4, used half oats and half whole wheat flour and my own homemade organic applesauce and added 1 cup organic blueberries. I did soak the oats in the buttermilk for 20 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. My kids thought these were great. My oldest remarked how they tasted like apple pie.

This recipe is excellent!  The right amount of spice!  It's also super easy to make with my three little ones! I just quadrupled the recipe and used chunky applesauce and mini loaf pans, baked them for 25 minutes and, WOW, my kids are eating them almost as fast as they can cool off!  I'll be making this for an upcoming Halloween party and many more events to come!  Thank you for an easy, super tasty recipe!

I'm not a baker, but I had a lot of applesauce to use up.  Found this recipe, gave it a try.  Stuck to the recipe except used 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar.  I was too afraid to use all brown sugar for some reason.  I had to bake for about 25 minutes (but my oven sucks). I like the way they came out.  Light and fluffy. Would make again.

Surprisingly light & fluffy for muffins. Nice spice flavor. I added a diced apple b/c I had one I wanted to use up, otherwise I didn't change a thing!   :)

I made no changes to this recipe, and was very pleased with the results.  My kids enjoyed these for their after school snacks for several days. I do like that these are mini muffins, and just lightly spiced, so they were perfect for my kids.

These were SO good! The only changes I made were to halve the recipe, since I live by myself, and I used twice the cinnamon since I didn't have any allspice. These turned out great, very moist and great flavor.

Right now I'm eating one of these muffins hot from the oven with a fresh cup of coffee, and it is delicious! Followed the recipe as is, omitted allspice because I didn't have any. So easy and yummy! Thank you, will definately make over and over again!

I liked these moist muffins; I did use unsalted butter; added nutmeg; use a mixture of sugar/brown sugar; wheat flour/all purpose.  I was out of applesauce but had plenty of Gala apples.  So I made homemade appleasauce; very easy...peel & chop 4 large Gala apples; dissolve 1/4 c. brown sugar in 1/2 cup apple cider with the chpd apples over medium heat till it boils; reduce heat and let simmer 45 min; stir occasionally  I did put the apples in a food processor to puree'  but you could add them to this recipe as is.  I sprinkled finely chpd pecans on top of each muffin prior to baking, then sprinkled white sugar on top of each muffins right out of the oven.  Will definitely bake again.

Very good and moist.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white and they tasted great.  I also added dried cranberries, which I love, and they were even better.

We enjoyed these.  I made 12 regular sized muffins and used chunky applesauce so there were actual pieces of apple in them.  I also cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup so they'd be a little less "dessert-like".

I love this recipe! Delicious!!! I did make one change, instead of regular applesauce I used Lite Cinnamon Applesauce. Gives it a little extra cinnamon.

The texture of these muffins was great and they're still incredibly moist a day and a half after baking.  However, I felt the taste was really lacking.  It seems other reviewers felt the same way, since most of them made some pretty drastic changes to the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, and as it's written it's pretty bland and forgettable.  Perhaps I will try some of the changes in the future.

Very easy to make. I didn't have allspice so I used extra cinnamon. I also subbed 1/2 the butter for an extra 1/2 cup applesauce to make it more apple-y. As per another reviewer I also added a bit of vanilla extract. It made 12 regular sized muffins for me, which I cooked for 20 minutes, but my oven usually takes a little more time then suggested. I also mixed wet and dry ingredients separately and then mixed them together. They didn't brown as much as I thought they would. I like how they aren't overloaded with sugar, but still somewhat sweet. I do think that next time I will use a mix in like diced apples, nuts, or dried cranberries. My 2.5 year old begged for more.

Very moist and light,but sadly didnt really push the envelope far enough for me.I was hoping for the apple to stand out a bit more from the spices.I shant give up on this one though and shall try again by adding perhaps grated apple.

These are VERY easy to make and produce a soft and fluffy muffin.  I added caramel bits (new from Kraft in baking section) to make "caramel apple" muffins, used 1/3 wheat flour and all brown sugar.  They taste more like a spice muffin, so if you want the apple taste to stand out I would suggest using chunky apple sauce or perhaps even chopping up apple pie filling and experimenting with that.  Very good though, will be making these again!

Yummy...I did make a few changes. I doubled the recipe and used butter.  I also added two diced mac's and a teaspoon of nutmeg.  The batch made 24 large muffins and 7 or 8 mini's.  These are perfect with tea for a quick breakfast and are good warm or cold.

These muffins are absolutely delicious!  I too added a little less margarine (soy margarine) and a little more applesauce, and I chopped up 1/2 of a pink lady apple and threw that into the mix.  I mixed the dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls, as recommended.  I'm usually not content with my muffins, but these ones turned out light, very most, and delicious!

Ohmygosh these are outstanding!  I took advice from other reviewers and added raisins and chunks of a Granny Smith apple to the batter (and got 16 cupcake-size muffins).  I also used brown sugar as recommended.  You know something is going to be good when you can't stop licking the batter.  These will be good with a schmear of butter!Thanks Lisa T.!

These were very good. I agree with a previous review that they tasted reminiscent of spice cake. I am puzzled by the method described. I reverted to a basic "muffin method of mixing" (Home Ec Grade 8) ie: add all wet ingredients to a blend of all the dry ingredients, & then get them in the pan quickly, so that you don't lose any of the leavening. So I melted & cooled the margarine & mixed it with the sugar, eggs, & applesauce.  It worked well & I think saves some of the unnecessary mixing of the leavening agents.  I also added raisins, because my kids would protest loudly if there weren't raisins in muffins. I think I am very stingy with my 5 star ratings.

Delicious! The texture of the muffins was great.  I doubled the recipe and got 18 generous standard sized muffins.  I used homemade applesauce and for the spice I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Mmmmm!

Delicious! Great spice and flavor. The only changes I made were minor - butter instead of margarine, add a splash of vanilla, use a mix of AP/whole wheat flour and white/brown sugar. I just greased a muffin pan and these made 12 large muffins. The texture is very moist and light; actually next time I'll try only 1 tsp baking powder because I wanted them a little denser. But they just smell and taste amazing!

I tried this recipe once as it was written using chunky applesauce - very good! Made a couple notes of things to change up next time I made them - less butter/oil, less sugar, some whole wheat flour. Today I was looking for a recipe using specific ingredients and couldn't find what I wanted - so I ended up using this as my base recipe and tweaking it to add shredded zucchini and carrot - amazing! No matter how I make it, this recipe is definitely a favorite & a keeper in my house!

These were good, but they are basically a spice cake and not a muffin. I used unsalted butter, so I added 1/4 tsp of salt. I also used natural, no sugar, applesauce. I highly recommend that, considering these are plenty sweet. I got 12 total and they took 20 minutes to bake. They get a good oven spring, but will drop to a normal size as they cool. I would consider some type of cream cheese, spice, or similar type icing for the top.

Made these last night and loved them! Used light brown sugar instead of white sugar, replaced half the butter with apple sauce, replaced half the flour with whole wheat (would have done all whole wheat, but ran out!), added a small chopped & peeled pink lady apple. Used a tsp cinnamon, tsp nutmeg, & a half tsp apple pie spice. So moist and delicious!

These are really good and are easy to make.  I added a cup of chopped apples to mine.  I think next time I make them I'll increase the cinnamon a bit.

Used the suggestion of others and used brown sugar and added some vanilla. This tasted like rasin bread without the rasins. I think this would be better as a loaf.

I'm not sure how I did it but my mix made 48 mini muffins! The only thing I did differently was I did combine all dry ingredients together in a separate bowl. I softened the butter prior by leaving it out of the fridge. Once I creamed the butter I then added the eggs (which I cracked and scrambled in a separate bowl first). After I completely added the eggs, I then added the applesauce and mixed completely. Once that was done I slowly added the dry ingredient combo and used my hand mixer to completely mix both wet & dry ingredients. My muffins are light, airy and delicious!

Probably the best muffins I've ever tasted!! So easy to make and even easier to enjoy! I chopped up one medium apple and tossed it in the mix, then I baked for roughly 20 minutes! Will definitely make again soon!

somewhat plain -- could be that I didn't have allspice and used cloves/nutmeg replacement.  would be better with sugar sprinkled on top.

These were quick and easy. I added golden raisins and chopped walnuts to mine. They became my morning breakfast - easy to grab on the way out the door. I suspect replacing some of the sugar with a substitute and adding in a little fiber/protein/bran powder would make for a killer snack after hitting the gym!

Mmm!  So good!  The top didn't get as round as I wanted it to and I definitely made some modifications and additions to the recipe, but it's somehow really irresistible.  I substituted: 1 cup of whole wheat for 1 cup of all-purpose flour; 1/2 cup of ground oats/oat flour (I put oatmeal through a coffee grinder) for the remaining 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; half of the butter for canola oil (1/4 cup).  I added: ~1/2 tsp salt; ~1 tsp vanilla; ~1/4 tsp cloves; ~1/2 tsp nutmeg; ~1/3 cup more applesauce; ~1/2 cup of oatmeal; ~1/8 cup ground flax seed.

This was a very easy recipe, and turned out great. Upon suggestions from other users, I substituted brown sugar for the white, and used one cup unbleached white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Family really liked these!

These muffins are very good in an understated kind of way.  I used 1 c. of graham flour (in place of some of the white), and that made the texture quite nice.  I also added chopped apples; 3/4 of a gala was just right.  Next time I'll decrease the butter a bit and probably add more cinnamon.

Okay, so since I didn't have a mini-muffin pan, I just made regular size muffins. Aside from that, the only things I did different was light brown sugar instead of regular sugar, then sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar. I love the flavor, and my extremely picky 2 1/2 year old (as in the child will hardly eat anything he's that picky) is gobbling up his 3rd muffin and I think he's going to ask for a 4th.  My 4 year old loves them, and she's never crazy about homemade muffins.  This recipe will definitely be a staple in our house!

I love this recipe.  I use less sugar and allspice, and add some nutmeg.  I've filled them with apricot, raspberry, and cherry jam, cherries, and cranberry sauce.  They are FANTASTIC!

I made this recipe for the teachers at my daughter's school. They were a hit with the school and with my daughter.My daughter wants one every morning for breakfast. When I made my recipe I made it for 40 muffins. I reduced the all spice, added nutmeg, added MacIntosh Apples, used 2 parts wheat flour and only one part white flour. I also used splenda instead of regular sugar and when I used the splenda I used 2 part white and 1 part the brown sugar splenda.
The other change I made was that I used butter, however when I did, I reduced the butter and used more applesauce. The muffins were moist and had a wonderful tast and texture.

A very yummy muffin! I took suggestions from the reviewers & used 1/2 cup brown sugar & threw in 1/3 cup Splenda since I have a sweet tooth. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. I cut the allspice to 1/2 tsp as well. I used 1/4 cup applesauce & 1/4 cup butter so I got a very moist muffin. I hope these freeze well; I have yet to find out! I used whole wheat flour & it worked fine. Thanks so much for such a great muffin; it tasted like a gingerbread cookie!

These muffins make a nice change for breakfast.  I enjoy them with a little slice of cheddar.  I added raisins to the recipe just to give the muffins a little something extra.

I took all previous reviews into consideration.  Very moist and pretty decent taste - not head over heels for it.  Has more spice flavor than apple. 1) I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. 2) I cut back on the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. 3) Added one medium chopped MacIntosh apple. 4) My applesauce was unsweetened b/c that is what I have on hand for my toddler.  I think the sweetened applesauce may make a difference and Granny Smith apples.

This one is a keeper!  These are usually gone the first day.  I did mix the liquid ingredients first, then sifted in the dry ingredients and mixed as little as possible.  Thanks Lisa.

These were ok....meaning the kids did eat them, But I thought they were bland. I really don't think I would make them again unless I made alot of alterations and then is it really the same recipe.

A keeper. Used brown sugar in place of white sugar for a little extra flavor! Also added 1 apple chopped up for some additional apple flavor.

I made these little muffins for Thanksgiving and all the kids and adults raved about them. They are very moist and a great consistency, not to mention very easy to make. Next time I will add finely chopped walnuts.  Great recipe.

These turned out great.  Instead of making  the 16 mini muffins I made 6 jumbo muffins and added 1 cup raisins.  They were delicious.  I will definitely be making these again.

Theyâre delicious! Because of the ingredients I had, I did change it. I subbed brown sugar and reduced to 1/2 c. due to: 3/4 sweetened applesauce, 1/4 c.  mashed banana, &  1/3 c. Finely diced apple. Added 1/2 c. Chopped walnuts.

Very moist and yummy. I used butter-flavored shortening  instead of margarine and replaced 1/2 c. of the white flour with whole wheat. I also added 3/4 of a chopped apple and a handful of craisins. I don't have a mini muffin tin, but this recipe makes a dozen regular sized muffins.

These are delicious! However, as a long-time baker, I believe the protocol I followed is more technically accurate: measure your flower in an appropriate measuring cup for dry ingredients; add spices, baking powder & baking soda to your flour, and sift all together into a bowl. Then, alternate adding applesauce and flour mixture to your creamed butter/sugar/egg mixture. A sifter is well-worth having for this very reason: it enables you to evenly mix spices and leavening agents.

I used best brown sugar instead of white sugar, grape seed oil instead of margarine.  I also added chopped walnuts , one half of a chopped Granny Smith apple, vanilla and raisins.   I made it using the quick bread method, adding the mixed liquid ingredients to the mixed dry ingredients instead of alternating dry and wet.

Excellent!  I used my crabapple sauce I made last year and froze - these are wonderful.  I did use brown sugar and only half a teaspoon of allspice.

I made these and theyâre super yummy!! I did 50-50 whole wheat and regular flour and then did 50-50 honey and white sugar. I also didnât have all spice so just used an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Delicious!!

Delicious! I cut down to 1/2 cup sugar, sub in 3/4 cups whole wheat flour, and add chopped walnuts. I live at high altitude so baking time is 18-20 minutes.

Very good very moist muffin.  Only thing I changed was I halved it and it made 8 muffins.  They baked for 15 minutes. My family loved it and asked me to make them again!

Yummy, it was a crowd pleaser.  I did half whole wheat flower and half all purpose.  A mix of brown and white sugar.  Baked at 350 in convection in greased full size tins for 17 minutes and they were perfect.  One batch made 12 full size muffins.

I was on the hunt for apple spice muffins and this recipe seemed easy enough. Thinking I had all the ingredients my 4 yo and I started making it. I had spent some time cubing 2 cups worth of apples. I must have gone past a recipe that called for, I thought  was this one. I decided to add them anyway. Thinking this was going to end up a mess because of the extra moisture added into the mix from the apples. They actually came out great! Only difference I did was I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of clove, I thought I had allspice but I didnt. I also added a mix of cinnamon and sugar on top. I love that these were not super sweet and sugary. My 4 yo approves too. Also I would like to add I used a big muffin pan and this mad 6 large muffins.

Totally a remake. I baked then for 9 mins in mini muffin cups, they are only about 1" wide and made 36. Perfect size and flavor for my kids.

Made a double recipe and it was really good. Put in a little less apple sauce... like just a couple table spoons less and then put in cut up apples. Also used a bit more spice. But seriously amazing!!!!

I made a few changes to make these a little healthier.  I used 1/2 white wheat and 1/2 white flour.  I cut the butter and sugar in 1/2 and substituted an extra 1/2 cup of applesauce plus about 1/3 cup honey.  They were very moist and delicious!  My kids loved them too!

I really like this recipe. It is virtually identical to "Applesauce Cake" in Joy of Cooking.  In fact, this is not a muffin, but a cupcake as someone else has already mentioned.  Easier to sSift together all dry ingredients.  Add to egg/butter/sugar batter alternately with applesauce. (flour-applesauce-flour-applesauce-flour).  Stir in 1 c chopped walnuts and fill 12 regular size muffin cups or one 8x8" baking dish (greased and floured). Bake 20 min.  Nice with confectioners sugar sifted over once cooled.  Delish!

Followed exactly and although easy to make did not find them high on the "spice" and "apple" flavor. I am thinking this is a personal preference. I did make them in a normal size cupcake tin so of course increased the cooking time exponentially (and watched them very closely).

I really liked this recipe.  I reduced the amount of muffins to 4 since there are just two of us.  Wonderful!

I changed the recipe somewhat. I made additions of chocolate chips ,raisins and walnuts. I also did not use margarine or eggs-just more of my homemade unsweetened applesauce. They were awesome. Today I am making them and using craisins in them as well--oh-used stevia as well. I figured about 55 calories per muffins when all the changes are considered.

I followed the suggestions of other reviews and used all brown sugar, real butter, and half whole wheat flour. My husband requested that these have a streusel topping like coffee cake and it was a great idea and turned out well! For streusel: Mix 2 TBSP flour, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and cut in 2 TBSP of butter. Sprinkle the mixture over each muffin before baking. Next time I will bake mine for one minute less as I have a hot oven.

I cut the sugar cut back by half and that was perfect for me. Other than that, it was fluffy and flavorful.
UPDATE: I've made this many times with these healthier modifications: white whole wheat flour, half the sugar, and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce with 1/4 cup unrefined coconut oil in place of margarine. 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg can be used in place of the allspice if you don't have it.

I did use brown sugar and would again...however it needs a bit more flavor for my taste.  I think I'll play around with the spices a bit...or even the type of applesauce that I use.  :-)

Amazing and simple recipe.  Used brown sugar instead.  Also, I used 2/3 cup regular apple sauce and 1/3 of cinnamon apple sauce.  These are delicious!  So moist!  Am making them again this week!  New family favorite.

These muffins were soft and moist.  I didn't have all spice so I used a bit of nutmeg and cloves.  I didn't quite like that flavor.  I think next time I will go with ginger.  I also used all whole wheat flour (this is fine if it is finely ground) and brown sugar instead of white.  I liked them and so did my daughter.  EDIT: I did ginger the second time and it was much better!  We liked this a lot.

Fabulous!  I used freshly juiced apples and the fresh pulp to make my own applesauce.  I think the richness of the fresh juice and pulp definitely added an extra zing to these muffins.  Very moist and bursting with flavour!  A very simple recipe, too, which is always a bonus for me!

I thought these were good. I used butter and I also halved the sugar half white half brown. I didn't have any allspice so I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Another thing I did to this recipe was add cinnamon to the tops of the muffin before I baked them. My kids liked them so that is an A+ for me. They made 15 regular muffins. Will be making again,  it was so easy to make. Thanks

I followed the recipe almost exactly and they really surprised me.  They were moist, easy, fast, very yummy and low cal. to boot.  My only changes were using 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, since I had no allspice, and I added some walnut pieces. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are quick and easy and really delicious! I made a few alterations though... I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, whole wheat flour instead of white, brown sugar (lightly packed)  instead of white, nutmeg instead of allspice, organic blackberry/applesauce (i was trying to avoid high-fructose corn syrup and all the mainstream brands have it), and 2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 gala apple, peeled and chopped. I got 6 big muffins or 12 smaller ones. I also only cooked the smaller muffins for 15 minutes; the big ones for about 19-20 minutes. SO GOOD!!!

While these were very moist and perfectly fine tasting, they just didn't do much for me.  I enjoyed trying them, but probably won't make them again.  I think that these would be a good choice  for kids, though!

These were good -- the only change I made was to add 1 T. of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and allspice because I realized after I already started this recipe that I didn't have any allspice.  I also used a chunky applesauce as a few others suggested.  I don't think that it was quite "apple-y" enough, though.  I'd suggest folding in some chopped apple before spooning the batter into the muffin cups to give the muffins a little more texture and stronger apple presence.

Fabulous recipe.  Instead of store bought applesauce, I substituted home-made cinnamon applesauce (a little chunky) and cut the cinnamon in half.  Came out light and fluffy.  Absolutely perfect :)

These muffins are very "delightful."  I used the recipe for "Delicious Apple Sauce," and that created chunks of apple in the muffin...delicious!  And I added crushed pecans, which gave it a nice touch.   I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who likes apples.

These were pretty good. I didn't have all spice so I just used nutmeg. I also threw in an extra pinch of cinnamon. I doubled the recipe and used regular sized muffin cups instead of mini muffins. I came out with about 32 regular cupcakes. I also sprinkled finely chopped pecans on top of the cupcakes right before baking them and then made a vanilla glaze-milk, vanilla, powdered sugar- and drizzled over the top of the muffins after they had cooled a bit. I really liked them, but next time I will add 1 cup of chopped apples. I would've like them to have more of an apple taste to them and I think the cup of chopped apples will help. Otherwise, definitely a great autumn recipe!

I doubled this recipe as I have four young children and knew that they would go fast... my few additions: added 1 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. allspice in addition to the cinammon.  Since I had a bunch of apples, I cooked the apples the night before and used the homemade applesauce for the recipe.  I also used the medium sized muffin pan to make approximately 20 muffins (I probably could have made 24, if I didn't use so much batter in each pan).  These muffins were nice to bring for a sunny day picnic at the park.  The kids loved them.  Very yummy, right out of the oven. I definately would make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

These were good.  I used 4 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs to cut down on the fat.  I will try adding a little more spices next time.

I woke up late on Saturday and made these bars with 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup.  They still turned out fine.  I put them in a regular muffin tin with liners and baked them for 20 - 22 minutes.  I let them sit (I realized half way through baking them what I had done, because I was trying to figure out why I had so much batter left) for about 20 minutes and they tasted fine.  Pretty greasy... but my family loves butter.  
I know next time they will turn out great when I bake them right.

Wonderful and flavorful muffins!  I made 6 large bakery style muffins out of these with a crumb streusel topping.  I used apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon and allspice, since it already had those plus nutmeg.  I also halved the butter and baked for 20 minutes.

These muffins are great.  My whole family loves them, even my three kids (ages 1, 3 and 6).  I substitute all purpose whole wheat flour for the whole wheat flour.  It makes the muffins slightly darker (and healthier) but does not affect the taste.

These are wonderful - nice and moist and flavorful.  I added a bit of salt and used Splenda instead of sugar and used them on a holiday tray.  Rave reviews!  I think I might use a little less butter the next time, though, and cut the fat just a little more.

These muffins were moist, tasty, and just plain terrific!! I don't have miniature muffin tins, so I doubled the recipe and used a regular muffin pan. They took about 20 minutes to cook in my oven. I don't have allspice so I substituted with equal amounts of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg and mixed them together to make amount needed. I also ran a little low on flour and used a little over 1 half cup of baking mix in place of it. I added 1/4th tsp. plus a dash of ginger to the batter. Wow! This really made the flavor pop!! Great with a cup of coffee!I also sprinkled sugar on top of them before they entered the oven. They were easy, and a big hit, I would like to make these again!
