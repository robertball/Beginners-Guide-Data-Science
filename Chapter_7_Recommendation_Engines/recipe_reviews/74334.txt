My husband refuses to eat beans.  He loved this chili.  I used worcester sauce instead of red wine vinegar the first time and liked it better.

My son's preschool has an annual "hot dogs with dad supper."  The only thing left on the sign up sheet was a crock pot of chili so I thought I'd better test this out before I subjected all of those 3 and 4 year olds and their daddies.  I made this for about 10 people for dinner. (to go with hot dogs)  It got nothing but rave reviews from everyone--young and old.  It's not spicy (which is really good for my needs) but had a lot of flavor.  My husband said this is the only chili recipe he didn't feel the need to add a bunch of ketchup to.  So a success indeed.  It will be making its debut at the preschool in a few weeks!!

I'm kicking Hormel chili out the door!  Home-made, healthy (no bugs or odds & ends to worry about down at the chili plant! ew!!) and my family really LOVED Frito-chili night.  SO FAST & EASY TO MAKE!!  Our daughter will be making us this for chili dogs, Frito-chili, and anything else we can think to top it with, spaghetti?  
We served ours in big bowls with Frito chips on bottom, then some shredded cheddar cheese, the chili, then some avacodos and onions, we were out of tomatoes so we omitted the thought for this time, the kids liked more cheese & some sour cream on top. Black beans will be there next time --on the side. VERY GOOD!  Put a bowl of condiments in the center for everyone to personalize theirs!

This is really good chili for my family. I have to feed 8 differant people with 8 differant tastes and sets of allergies every day, and(after I substituted shallots for the garlic) even the pickiest eater loved it. 

The defalt spicyness of the chili is quite low, but that is easily fixed. I also suggest adding a can or two of mild diced green chilis, and using balsamic vinigar instead of the red wine vinigar. It adds a really nice flavor.

I Love It! I substituted diced and whole tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes and mashed them with a potato masher and used 1/4 tsp of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and it turned out great with ingredients that I had on hand.  This recipe is one that I'll use again.

This chili turned out delicious! I didn't add the red wine vinegar and substituted it for 1/8 cup worcestershire sauce. I also added garlic salt, salt, and pepper. I used 1 1/2 lbs of meat because I like my chili with a lot of meat. Thanks for the recipe!

My family liked the chili, I am from Ohio and we don't believe that beans belong in chili...so I wanted to try your recipe.  The only thing we noticed was that it had a bit too much vinegar in it..I think next time I will just reduce that a bit.  Overall, really good and really easy to make!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. Lots of flavor. My kids hate beans so this was perfect for them. I did add some additional seasonings but this was a great start.

Because I live in Holland and haven't been able to find chili w/out beans in the grocery store -- I was so happy to find this recipe -- and I had all the ingredients on hand. Yum - Yummy -- tastes so good -- even better than canned Hormel chili in my opinion. 
The only thing differently I did was process the chili at the end - so that it had that good canned chili sauce texture. I served it on hotdogs and have enough leftover for our baked potatoes tomorrow night - Yippee!

Our new favorite!  Omitted the vinegar, added water in it's place - and instead of canned tomatoes, used 10 fresh, ripe, peeled & chopped tomatoes.  Wow!  Talk about delicious!  The flavor was so good, we didn't even care that the texture wasn't exactly the same as canned.  We didn't even wait to get out the stick blender to process it - we just ate it!  I let it simmer on low about an hour in a cast iron deep fryer.  I also added 1 T. brown sugar, 2 T. molasses (we like our chili a little sweet) and 1 T. homemade prepared mustard.  The recipe is very versatile and forgiving and easily tailored to one's tastes.   No more canned chili for this family! Thank you so much!

I don't like beans with my chili either, so this was great.  I prefer to use it with crackers, biscuits, etc.  I only used 1/8cup of the vinegar, but it still came out fine.

I used all the ingredients as posted. Then, after viewing other chili recipes added a can of green chilies(I minced in food processor along with onion at beginning), one small can tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and paprika.  This was delicious! I love Frito pies but hate beans! This has saved me! :)

Almost double the spices are needed and unless you like vinegar please omit the red wine vinegar, it's too overpowering.

This was a great recipe. My hubby can't stand beans, so this worked out very well. I cooked the meat on the stove with the seasonings and then put everything in the crockpot on low for about 4 hours.  Delish!!

Awesome!  I made minor changes. Cooked onion and garlic in olive oil until onion was translucent. Added ground beef and cooked till almost done. Added seasonings, stirred and cooked a bit longer then added balsmic vinegar to taste (not a lot) let that reduce down. Put diced tomatoes and crushed in crock pot with some green chilis. Then when meat was done added that to crock pot. Let simmer on low for several hours. Very delish. A definite keeper!!

this is great as is, but I use it as a base. Added bell peppers and use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and salt. Used a little less vinegar, .5 lb. more meat, and splashes of worcestshire, liquid smoke, and cocoa powder.

This was the worst tasting chili ever and I love chili. It had an overpowering vinegar taste and even prior to adding the vinegar the spices tasted off.

We did not like at all! What ruined it for us was red wine vinegar. Did not taste right to us, flavor overpower the whole thing. Might try w/o vinegar, but wont make again as posted.

This is a great chili recipe--easy and delicious!  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so used about 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/8 cup worcestshire sauce.  Served it over spaghetti and topped with chopped onion, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  Perfect for a winter dinner!  The chili had a bit more of a kick to it than I was expecting, so I think next time I'll cut back a bit on the hot pepper sauce just for the kids' sake.  Tonight we're using the leftover chili to cook up some chili dogs.  Thanks!

This review is based on EXACTLY how the recipe was posted. I made last evening on a cold night in Austin while friends were visiting. These meal is very simple and easy to make. All four of us were anxious to see how it turned out. And the three of them were quick to grab spoons and give a shot. I had to check facial expressions for a clear indicator. Immediately I saw one set of eyes slowly go up and into back of head followed by an "OH MY GOD...", then I simply say another set shut and simply heard a low moan with a YUM, and the third persons eyes got big and told everyone.. "Talk to ya later" and simply went to town devouring his bowl of this chili. I then took a spoonful and was instantly impressed from the first bite to the last scrape of my bowl! This recipe has four men who give it 8 thumbs up! Thanks for sharing this delicious homemade chili recipe!

I was looking for a bean free recipes with lots of flavor.  My husband hates beans and it's hard to find a good chili without them.  This recipe was just perfect.  Lots of flavor and no beans = happy hubby.  I did modify a couple of things.  I used one more clove of garlic because I just love garlic.  I used diced tomatoes with jalepenos  instead of crushed.  I also used 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of ground turkey.

I was so sure this would be great with all the rave reviews. I have to say I don't think I will be eating mine. As others have said, it is the consistancy of spaghetti sauce, has no heat (and I don't like chili too spicy--easily remedied though), and waaaaayyyyyy too much vinegar. I would reduce it to a couple tablespoons.

Yummy & easy! I had been looking for a no bean recipe, and tweaked this one a bit by adding  1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice, and a 4 oz can green chilies- fantastic! Don't usually do that on the first time I test -drive a recipe, but it certainly worked out this time. THANKS for the awesome recipe Gina!

5 stars for taste and simplicity!  After 28 years of marriage, I just found out my husband doesn't like beans in his chili! Who knew? Not me!  I found this recipe and it was a hit all around.  Perfect blend of sweet and spicy.  I used ground pork, and instead of red wine vinegar, substituted 1/8 cup each balsamic vinegar and Worcester sauce.  Served with cheese and sour cream.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did not have any red wine vinegar and realized it a little too late. So I just put about 3 tbs of regular vinegar in. Worked like a charm. this is a nice thick recipe that  is fabulous over rice. Kids and adults enjoyed it!!!

I choose this recipe because I love chili and based on the rating but I would have to say, I had to throw most everything away.  The vinegar was so overpowering. I doubled checked to see if I had gotten it wrong, but no.  I do like vinegar, but not like this.

It really could have used some green pepper. I didn't have hot sauce so I added more chili pepper and also red pepper flakes. Great with biscuits.

My husband and I are not big bean eaters (he doesn't eat any) so I was looking for a recipe that was beanless but still had that great chili taste and this is it!  We add more garlic & more hot sauce but that's just our personal preference.  When I make it for guests we make it exactly as stated and everyone likes it, even bean eaters don't miss the beans!!

Flavor was just ok -- really have to watch the meat stays in chunks, otherwise it turns out like a spread.  That is what happened to me.  Sorry.

This was a huge hit with my family. I substituted pureed tomatoes for the crushed, and added some beef stew meat. Didn't have any chili sauce on hand so used red pepper flakes. Delish!!

This was really good!  Neither my husband nor I care for beans in our chili and I needed a chili recipe for chili dogs.  This was a great start - it definitely needed more chili powder and hot sauce than called for (and we don't particularly like things spicy) - just had to add lots more to make it taste like chili :)  I had to substitute garlic for onion and it came out great.  I strongly  recommend letting it simmer for as long as possible!  The simmering time helps reduce the sauce from the crushed tomatos so it is not soupy at all!  We will definately be making this one again!!  Thanks!

Hubby doesn't like beans in his chili and this recipe hit a home run! The only thing I changed/added was 2 cans of Rotel diced tomates; added small can of V8; and 1/2C of beer for liquid. It was a HUGE hit with our dinner guests last night.  Served Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site as a side...great meal.  Thanks!

This recipe was not to our liking at all. I followed the recipe exactly. Tasted like vinegar mush, not good. I tried to make it edible with more garlic and added red pepper flakes and more chili powder but it didn't help.

I had to add another tsp of cumin, and 1/2 tsp of oregano to get the flavor I wanted.  I also food processed it a bit to give it more of a canned chili texture.

I made this for my husband since he won't eat beans in chili.  It turned out pretty good.  BUT, it would probably be a better recipe if used as a thick spagetti sauce.  The recipe isn't spicy at all and needs about double the spices of what the recipe actually calls for.  I have to give it 4 stars cause it does taste good.  I'll make it again but for spagetti instead ... not chili.

This Chili is the ABSOLUTE BEST!!! I followed the instrutcions exactly. It was quite easy, and my whole family LOVED it! The only problem is there were no leftovers. I'll have to make a double batch next time.

I didn't like this. After letting it simmer, it tasted like nothing more than a very acidic pasta sauce. The red wine vinegar was incredibly strong, so much that even the chili powder couldn't shine through. I had to counter it with beef broth, dark brown sugar, a squeeze of honey, Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, onion powder, cayenne, and extra chili powder and cumin for it to taste like chili. I cook for a man who does not enjoy food that is ultra spicy but he likes some spice, and before doctoring it up he tested it and felt it was too weak and acidic even for him. In the end, it resembled nothing like the original recipe.

Made it, loved it.  Served it over fritos - Texas style - and everyone gobbled it up.  It's super easy to make and would be great on hotdogs or even over rice.  My kids couldn't get enough!  Thanks Gina!

I think the red wine vinegar threw it off. Next time, I will try it without the red wine vinegar and I will use tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes.

I love chili but I hate beans. Simply omitting beans from most recipes results in soupy chili but this was SO yummy. Hubby loves beans but still liked this recipe.

Followed the recipe but added green peppers, half a can of diced tomatoes and a little extra chili powder for more flavor. My girlfriend enjoyed it more than I did but we both agree that we would make it again. Probably as good as it gets without beans and thats ok cause I hate beans :)

Delicious-same thing as some others have said-people in the family don't like beans.  Needed a good chili for a cold spring night.  I added a cup of frozen corn, topped with sour cream and cilantro.  Corn bread and salad on the side.  Everyone loved it.

I needed a chili recipe for chili dogs. This was good, but needed more spice - it didn't have enough of a real "chili" flavor. I substituted the vinegar for worcestershire sauce as some suggested, but I won't next time, as it made it taste more like sloppy joes than chili.

Very good! Hearty and no beans! I added extra tbsp of chili powder to make this even more spicy, and also subbed worcestershire sauce instead of vinegar (as someone else did). This looks like spaghetti sauce when you first make it, but after simmering for 1.5 hours it turns into a rich brown color that looks and smells and TASTES like real good chili!

This was a really tangy tomatoey chili. Mild as far as spice. I had to add a lot of hot sauce to mine at the table, but hubby liked his fine. I prefer a lot more spice and sweat in mine, but it was good nonetheless, and I don't mind adding hot sauce at the table to get it to my liking. This was good, but didn't make our favorites. Thanks for sharing your chili, I'm always up for trying a new chili recipe and I enjoyed this one!

I thought this was a very tasty chili, with only a couple of modifications on my part. I used about 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar (because that’s what I had on hand).  I had purchased chili-ready tomatoes, which already had some spices and seasoning in them, but I still used all the recommended spices from the recipe.  Because of this, it came out fairly spicy, but very good! I also placed it in the blender after it was done to give it a “creamier” texture and more suitable to top our hot dogs.

Maybe there is a difference in Texas Chili and others, but I just didn't care for this.  It was sweet and didn't have that hearty flavor that I look for in chili.  And as far as mixing it with rice, chili should be able to stand alone and be great.

This is unlike any chili I've ever had. It tasted kinda like spaghetti sauce with meat and I followed the recipe exactly. I grew up in the southeast. Maybe different parts of the country are use to a different tasting chili. I didn't care for it at all.

My boyfriend does not like beans but I love chili so I decided to try this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and my boyfriend and I both agreed it's more like pasta sauce with a bit of spice rather than Chili. As a chili it was terrible which is what I'm rating it for. I may actually make it as my spaghetti sauce next time though.

My wife and I both do not like beans in our chili.  This recipe was really easy and turned out fantastic.  It's got a sweetness too it that is very pleasing but might be better set off against a little more hot.  Next time I might add some more hot sauce.  Also I doubled the garlic.

I can agree with earlier reviews about the vinegar content... Way too acidic in the end. Although after a little doctoring (added a can of rotel w/habeneros and a lot more seasonings) it was good.

I did not like this chili at all.  It tasted like I was biting into a tomato.  It was so strong-I had to put some hot sauce into it to make it less strong.  Overall, I thought the tomato taste was very overwhelming.

The exact recipe (which I originally followed) wasn't the best for us.  However, it did become a great BASE for a no beans chili.  In the end, I had to add so many different ingredients that it became a totally different recipe.  Thank you for sharing though.

Love the red wine in this recipe.  Think it makes all the difference.  My recipe was slighty modified since I used ground deer meat - but the main change was that I added two pinches of cinnamon and used a purpose onion.  Ate over crushed Saltines with cheese and sour cream.  Yum!

This is good. To feed 8 people, I altered it with: 2 pounds of cubed stew meat, 1 1/2 onions, no pepper sauce, Worcester sauce instead of wine vinegar, two 28 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes, 2 14.5 oz cans of chili ready diced tomatoes, and 3 chopped green bell peppers. Everything else was the same. Optional cheese on the side was for sprinkling on top. I served the chili with corn bread muffins from the Dannon yogurt website, as they are the best corn muffins ever.

I love chili and was getting ready to make it for a family party. My husband says we don't like beans. So, I found this recipe and everyone LOVES it. I've made it so many times because its simple ingredients are always on hand! I will sometimes use balsamic vinegar and that's great as well!

Was very happy to find a chili recipe that my boyfriend (who won't eat beans) and I (who loves beans) could both agree we liked!  This was very easy and tasty.  We'll be making this again with the cold, winter months approaching!

This was absolutely fabulous! We don't care for beans, so it was great to find a recipe of an old favorite suited for us. I took the advice of other reviewers and only added 1/4 cup of the vinegar. Turned out great. Thank you!!

I have always hated beans in chili, and luckily came across this recipe.  I absolutely LOVE it.  I followed another reviewer by adding worchester sauce instead of the red wine vinegar only because I didnt have it in the house. Left everything else the same and its perfect!  I make this about once a week!  My husband, at first, threw a tantrum because the worlds ending "there are no beans in it."  But after he tried it, he really liked it as well.  Said it was a tiny bit spicy for him, but I thought it was just right.

Great recipe we really loved it. Although I really love chili I have never managed to make one that I like. That is until now. Even better my son liked it and didn't once complain it was to spicy. I love spice and have a hard time figuring out what is not spicy for him. I forgot to add the hot sauce to the chili and it was just right for my children. I can always add some to my own bowl. We do like beans in our chili. I ran out of time to put some beans on to cook and didn't have time to run to the store for some canned beans. So this was perfect for us. The only problem was it didn't make very big serving sizes. Next time I will have to double or triple the recipe so we have enough and maybe enough to take to work the next day. Wonderful recipe. Thank you!!!

Yum!  Although I did tweak it a little ... Opted for a can of diced tomatoes (undrained), and a can of tomato paste instead of the tomatoes called for in the recipe.  I also left out the vinegar, replacing that with 1/4 cup water.  I added 1 tsp of salt too, which made it a tad salty ... I'd try 1/2 tsp if I were you.  Followed everything else according to the recipe though and it turned out great! Perfect chili for the "anti-bean" crowd!

Very good! My boyfriend won't eat beans, so I was in need of a good chili recipe without beans. It was even better the next day, so I think I'll let it simmer even longer next time. I doubled the cumin, added 1/2 c chopped green pepper, and used worcestershire sauce instead of vinegar.

I kind of used this recipe as a starting off point for my own. I didn't use vinegar, as that seemed kind of odd to me. I did take advantage of a turkey chili recipe on this site, and used the seasonings suggested there. I added half a green bell pepper, most of a packet of hot cocoa, liquid smoke, worchestershire, chili powder, and ground red pepper. I kept everything else the same. Simmered for about two hours.

Great recipe. Although, I am leaving out the vinegar--it was too much and I had to had a lot of sugar to counteract it. But I am trying it without the vinegar and putting in a bit of cocoa and more hot sauce to make up for the vinegar. Thanks for the recipe!

It was okay, seemed to have too much of a vinegar flavor, but served over hot links was good. Next time I will probably cut down on the vinegar, also only made about 4 servings when I had it set for 6.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I don't like beans either so this recipe is perfect.  I omitted the red wine vinegar, however. It's not too spicy, which is fine by me, but you can adjust the spices to your taste.  This is a keeper.

Great flavor!  I added water to make mine more "soupy" and then used a hand-blender on it before serving to blend together the tomato pieces and onions and give it body.  

Also, I found organic fire-roasted crushed tomatoes at the store, and those really worked well in this.

I have a house full of picky eaters, but this has become our go-to chili recipe. I use Worcestershire sauce in place of the red wine vinegar and put the garlic in with the meat right away, as well as onion powder instead of chopped onions. I add a can of tomato paste for a thicker consistency. This is tame enough for my crew, but I crave spicy so I just add red pepper flakes and extra hot sauce to my bowl. We top with shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream and service with cornbread muffins.

Been looking for this recipe. My husband will not eat beans. Loves chili. Used to pick out the beans. Now we have a great basic chili recipe. I did not have the red wine vinegar on hand so used white wine vinegar which worked out fine. No vinegar overload in mine. This is simle, taste great and is flexible. Will be making it again using other suggestions for the vinegar like worstershire sauce or balsamic vinegar.

This chili recipe is awesome and super easy to make! I like mine a little spicier, so I add a bit of crushed red pepper, ground black pepper and Chinese Five Spice, as well as slightly upping the amount of chili powder and pepper sauce. I also discovered that there's no need to cook this stuff for an hour (more than 20 minutes is overkill), and it's even better heated in the microwave after being chilled in the fridge. I love to augment this recipe with Fritos corn chips. As somebody else pointed out, you'll never open another can of Hormel again after you make this.

I tried the recipe and read about problems with vinegar.  So I used my old chili go-to stale beer.  I used 1/2 a can (after drinking the first half) and upped the spices a little also adding 1 tsp. cumin and fennel.  I would think the same amount of red wine would also work as well - trying that next!

Too much vinegar taste. Should probably be made with diced tomatoes so you don't feel like you're eating tomato sauce.

Tried this recipe for the first time tonight. Family of six and everyone loved it. Next time I will have double the recipe wasn't quote enough so I had to make angle hair noodles with it so there would be enough for everyone. Little leftovers but not much so next time i will make more so there will be leftovers.

Red wine vinegar does not belong in chili.  We made this recipe in full.  Luckily, our grocery store is only two minutes away.  We ate pizza tonight instead.

Great starter recipe and you can add ingredients to suit your taste. My teenager will not eat anything with beans, so that caught my eye immediately. I added a stalk of diced celery, a little brown sugar to combat the acidity of the tomatoes, and I threw in a pinch of mesquite seasoning, just because. It turned out great, and we put it over Fritos and added shredded cheese, sour cream, and chopped red onions. This one's definitely a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe and I've been using it since I got married a few years ago. Both my husband and I hate beans in chili, so this was perfect. I've modified it a little just because of personal preference. I usually at least double the recipe to allow for leftovers. I leave out the cumin and vinegar, and I slice a jalapeno in half and throw it in the pot while the chili is simmering, pulling it out just before I serve it (whether I leave the seeds in or not depends on how spicy I want it to be). I also tend to use an Italian seasoning mix instead of straight oregano. Yum!

Simple. Excellent. I always modify recipes.  I used ground turkey instead of beef. I add chick peas, button mushrooms and big chunks of zucchini. I also add a smidge of garam masala. I always have it with perfectly steamed basmati.  DELICIOUS!!!

My husband doesn't like beans so this chili is perfect for us. I like to add veggies to this to make it more of a meal. Increase the tomatoes to 42 ounces (add another, smaller can of petite diced or pureed tomato) and increase the spice a bit along with it. I add a can of corn with the tomatoes and in the last half hour I add chopped green pepper, zucchini, and summer squash. We love this chili.

I am not a chile fan but this was really good.  I added 1  tsp sugar to balance the vinegar and served each bowl with sour cream (used cookie dough scoop for perfect "dollap") and a little shredded cheese.  Thank you, great recipe

Great recipe! For a healthier meal, I used 1/2 # of ground beef and a 1/2 # of ground turkey. Perfect for us diabetics.

I made this chili for my family in hopes of finding the ultimate chili recipe.... it wasn't what I expected... the vinegar over powers the meat and spices. It wasn't a horrible recipe... I found it tasty, but I don't know that I will be making it again it just didn't win the hearts of my family. If I do I will definitely have to make some changes

This was very good. It definitely needs the entire hour of cooking time. I tasted it the beginning and was worried it wasn't going to be good, but after it simmered awhile all of the flavors came together wonderfully. I served it over elbow macaroni which made it even better!

I really, really wanted to like this because most of us in  my family do not like beans.  However, to us, this tasted more like a spaghetti sauce.  I tried adjusting spices to taste more like chili, but I never really could. :(

I made this the other night.. It was just ok for me and the b/f.. I used about 3 tbsp of chili powder and about 3 tbsp of hot sauce too.  The flavor was there, but with the crushed tomatoes it had the consistency of spaghetti sauce for me.  So, i will use the recipe again, but i think i'll go with diced tomatoes next time.

This recipe is awesome! My husband hates beans, but everyone else in the family loves chili, so this is a win for all to enjoy! The only thing I changed was I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. We ate it as Belly Busters (Fritos), and I also baked some biscuits. The only problem I faced was that it wasn't enough! I will have to double or triple the recipe the next time to feed my hungry family and friends!!! Thanks, "GINAGINA"

This is a great chili recipe for those of us who do not want beans!  I do have to add quite a bit more hot sauce (I add almost 1/4 cup) and chili power (3 TBSP), and even then my husband adds quite a bit in his bowl.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just finished making this, but with many (what I considered to be poor) substitutions and it still came out great!  I had to use minced onion instead of fresh, and I used a can of tomato sauce instead of tomatoes and chopped up a few cherry tomatoes I had on hand.  I also used the Worchestershire sauce instead of vinegar like someone suggested.  We like spicy, so I also added a few Chipotle peppers I needed to use up.  It was so easy and tasted great, I didn't even miss the beans!  I was really expecting it to turn out badly since I didn't have some of the ingredients it called for, so I'm sure it's even better when you make it correctly!  We put it over hot dogs and hamburgers and it was very good.

I myself won't eat beans, and I love this recipe. However, I did make a few changes.  I use lean ground beef (hardly any grease to drain) and season it with plenty of onions and garlic before I put it in with the other ingredients. I also add green peppers and red onions, the extra veggies add a nice touch in the absence of beans. I also found that it gives the chili a little more flavor.   Yum!

I have been looking for a recipe to replace Hormel and I have finally found it! So far I have put it on my dogs with mustard and onions, my nachos supreme, as a dip for fritos and I am so excited to do so much more. As always I have made it as written but it the possibilities are endless- jalapenos, green peppers, ground turkey, love it, love it, love it!!!

I'm trying out a no-carb diet and I've been dying for some chili. The no-beans recipe caught my eye. I forgot to pick up the chili powder so I found a mix and added it to the pot. Had to add lots of hot sauce to the mix but it still seemed a little off... Placing a slice of cheese to each bowl made it perfect!!

I made this for a houseguest who doesn't eat beans, and he like it a lot!  It was very easy to make and tasted just as good as my usual recipe with beans.  I used organic Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes by Muir Glen that added a nice roasted flavor.  We sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and I used the Excellent and Healthy Cornbread recipe from this site to go on the side- also very good!

This is a very good, basic chili recipe. I made this in the crockpot. The longer the flavors can soak, the better they will be. We actually served this over hot dogs and tator tots. I wouldn't recommend this as a soup chili, not enough flavor, but you can very easily add to it. I prefer no bean chili, unless it is baked beans. This was exactly was I was looking for, a basic chili recipe that we can add what we like into it.

Very good recipe as published!  I mixed two proteins (ground turkey and turkey sausage) and added cinnamon.  A bit more exotic and complex.

The only thing I did different was use bulk sausage instead of ground beef, and crushed red pepper flakes since I was out of hot sauce.

I was a little turned off at how tangy it was with all of that vinegar at first, but after a few more bites I couldn't stop eating it. I really enjoyed the big tomato "punch" it had. It is great over rice. Thumb up!

My kids loved this chili.  I did end up adding a can of red and black beans to it and the flavor was fabulous.  I made it the night before and let it sit in the frig until the next night.  It was the best chili that I ever had.  I did not add the hot sauce, just because we don't like it hot.

This will be a regular meal for us!!!!!

This was the best no-bean chili I've made yet.  My husband wanted a beanless chili and none of my cook books had any.  It was great served like frito-chili pie: with frito chips, sour cream and cheddar cheese.  I cooked it for a rainy football Saturday afternoon and all the men that were over LOVED it!

This is a really good recipe. I made it with ground turkey instead of beef because I am trying to lose weight. I needed a low carb recipe and I was craving chili, this hit the spot. I served it with a side salad and a sour cream on top. Yum! Thanks!

I was searching for a chili recipe without beans to satisfy my husbands disdain for any thing "bean".  This recipe fit the bill.  I accidently tweaked it though by buying whole tomatos instead of crushed ones.  It added some bulk to the meal and gave some extra flavor.

This chili was a hit in our house.  We made it with fire roasted crushed tomatoes.  We served it over lime tortilla chips and topped it with sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. The chili powder and hot sauce gave it a lovely hint of heat without any real burning spiciness.

Good taste although not as spicy as I had thought it might be.  We're trying it again tomorrow as pasta as a sauce!  Overall, my husband and I enjoyed the mild taste and the fact that it could be used as sauce or a sloppy joe filling as well.

Pretty good. I added just about a 1/2 tsp more chili powder to give it a little more flavor. I think this is a great start to what I've been looking for. 4 out of 5 family members don't like beans but wanted chili, so this was a great start!

Pretty good.  I doubled the spices which gave it a nice kick and my husband who hates beans thought it was good.    The taste wasn't 100% what I'm looking for, but close enough that I can try to tweak it!

I tweaked this a bit by adding 8 oz. of tomato sauce and a bottle of beer, and omitted the vinegar.  Then I simmered it uncovered until I got the desired consistency, about 90 min. or so. It's delicious the first night, but even better the next day!

Delicious! I have always been a McCormick mix girl, mostly because I am not a big chili eater. This recipe is super easy with ingredients you would normally have on hand. I did add a beef cube and a splash of water. Will definitely just be using this recipe again.

I would omit the red wine vinegar. It was too overpowering. I had to add more spices to
Calm down the vinegar flavor.
It was good on chilli dogs with white onions and cheese.

I use this as a starting point to chili. After reading the reviews, I double the spices. I used what I had at home. 1 lb of ground turkey, a small can of diced tomatoes, two small tomatoes dice by hand, two small onions some , I did add some steak sauce and I left out the hot sauce and red wine vinegar. I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper for some heat. And that turned out delicious so I did make changes but the basics came from this recipe

I made this with ground turkey instead of beef, used fire-roasted canned tomatoes, sliced olives, cilantro, as well as salt and a bit of sugar to cut the acidity.  Great chili.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was so inedible. It was way too tangy with the vinegar in it. I really had high hopes since it had 4 stars but  after reading a lot of the ones who rated it high (of course, AFTER I made it!) , it looks like a ton of people DID NOT follow the recipe and made substitutions. The Vinegar is definitely an acquired taste I guess but everyone took one bite and spit it out. I feel kind of bad because I had high hopes and I don't want to offed the submitter but this was not good at all.

The only changes I made was using 1/2 cup chopped roasted red and yellow peppers that I roasted myself and had in the freezer and 2 tspns powerdered Worcester (from World Spice Merchants) and 1 tsp chipotle chili powder (also from WSM). Very, very good!

Absolutely delicious! It has wonderful flavors; it's spicy, and a little sweet. I can't get enough of it! I'm contemplating making it just a tiny bit more spicy the next time, but it's honestly extremely good as-is.

Bland, bland, bland. Firstly vinegar does not belong in chili and I have no clue where that idea came from. Also bottled hot sauce??? I also can not believe that salt and pepper are not in tne ingredient list. Just mind boggling. Vinegar? Out the window. For tne chili powder I used a homemade one which I am sure is far more flavorful than store bought. I used canned diced tomatoes with green chilis. Started with 1 14oz but it was too dry so I added another. Still puzzled why salt and pepper are missing from the recipe. Added a bit more cumin and chili powder but not much since it lacked little.  Still needs adjusting but the recipe as written originally is no where close to being edible. I cant believe the 5 star reviews. Simply just boggles my mind. Anyways....added 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper as well.......now it IS a decent Chili.  For those who put the vinegar and hated it, unfortunately there is no was to mask that harsh sour flavor. So things left out, Vinegar, , Hot sauce and crushed tomatoes. I did use diced tomatoes with green chilis.

This is the perfect chili!  I made it for our chili competition at work, and it won.  I did make a few changes though.  I doubled the chili powder, I grilled 4 large Jalapenos and three Serrano peppers (this was a triple recipe). I added a regular bunch of green table onions cut up as well.
Delicious! Thank You!

We did not care for this recipe at all.  I followed the directions as written and I tasted it and it was very bland and the tomato flavor was overpowering.  I adjusted the seasonings and added a bit of sugar and some green chiles and it came out good.  But as written it was not good.

Will make again.  Used Franks Buffalo Wing Hot Sauce instead of regular hot sauce.  I don't like beans but my wife who does said it was an 8/10 without beans and would be a 10/10 with beans.

This was ok.  Not great.  A little bland.  I did what some of the other reviewers did and added Worcestershire sauce and doubled up the spices but it still needs something.  I would add beans but hubby doesn't like them.

If I could I would give this recipe no stars. On paper it sounds delicious but once you add the vinegar it becomes fodder for the garbage pail. Too acidic and the meat has the consistency of mush.

I've made this a few times now and these are my personal tweaks to it. 

When browning beef, I add:
1/2 tsp salt &
1/2 tsp pepper.

When adding spices, I add:
1/2 tsp. paprika,
1 tsp. worcestershire, and
1/2 small can of tomato paste.

My wife doesn't eat beans, but loves this chili!

I made it exactly according to the recipe. It was decent, but a lot better when I added 1T paprika, another  tablespoon of chili powder, and 1t salt. My family ate it with cheddar and sour cream. I'm dairy free so I used a dollop of goat cheese. I'll definitely make it again with these changes.

Family loved it. Substituted worstershire sauce for the vinegar  and kicked up the heat by adding more hot sauce and diced green chile's. Topped with sharp cheddar cheese.  Excellent  week night meal.

Followed the recipe to the letter which is very difficult for me  with one very important exception!  The recipe left out salt...
Salt!  Tart things are made savory with salt!  I had read the reviews complaining about the vinegar thinking  a good portion of salt would balance this out...
It did!   We really like the result!

I changed this up with italian Sausage, added celery, red and green pepper, and Italian crushed tomatoes.  Didn't put the full 2 Tbs chili powder but did use the red wine vinegar.  It turned out great.  On a low carb diet and this is really tasty!

It's the first time I've ever made chilli without beans. My husband said he prefers it to the regular chilli I make! I added a bit of brown sugar- I found it a bit acidic- and also used balsamic vinegar! It's a keeper!

No beans for us! This has been my go-to chili recipe for the past 4 years.  I have made it with both ground beef and ground turkey. I usually transfer the chili to my crock pot to cook all day. To increase the yield of the recipe without doubling the recipe entirely, I usually double the canned tomatoes and use 1.5x the spices. I also add more hot sauce to our tastes. I like the taste that the vinegar adds.

Too easy and delicious not to make again. I did substitute worcestershire sauce for the red wine vinegar. I also used diced tomatoes instead of crushed because I didn't have crushed and because we like a little more texture. I served it with leftover corn pudding.

My wife does not like beans in her chili, so I tried this receipe last Saturday for a Chili Cookoff in our neighborhood.  We came in first place out of 12 other participants.   I used worstersher instead of vinager.   I added some more galic salt and a bit more chili powder.  I also let it simmer for four hours.  It came out great.

Fantastic chili!  I used cans of diced tomato and tomato sauce  instead of crushed tomatoes. Plus, I didn't use vinegar at all.  I made the chili and then put half in another pan.  I added kidney, pinto, and black beans (all rinsed first) so I could have my beans and my husband could have his meat only.  It went really well with my sweet cornbread. We will definitely be having this again!

I went pretty much by the recipe, except for the crushed tomatoes, I used canned sliced and fewer chopped onions. In no way would I call this chili. But rather it came out to be a pretty good Sloppy Joe recipes. If I want to make it again, which I think I will, I think it just needs a little more sweetness to be a proper Sloppy Joe dish.

My husband refuses to eat beans too, so I'm always looking for a good no-bean chili recipe.  This is a good basic recipe.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, I used a can of Rotel & about 6 oz. vegetable juice cocktail and simmered until reduced by half.  Served with sliced scallions, shredded sharp cheddar, and sour cream.  Hubby was very happy.  :)

It was excellent'I made it for our small group game night and everyone loved it. Added 1/8 cup of Worchestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon of sugar to sweeten it just a tad - I tasted it before the simmer time and it had a slight bitter aftertaste. The sugar dealt with it perfectly.

Very good spice combo. I used generous measurement of each spice (i.e., rounded rather than level spoonfuls). I used ground dark meat turkey.  I used worchestchire sauce instead of vinegar.  I added about 1/2 cup water to thin it down a little. Delicious. Served with Fritos corn chips, shredded sharp cheddar, a dollop of sour cream. Will make again.

I make my chili basically the same way, but I use ground bison, and add about 4 diced bell peppers to the mix.  Chipotle powder in there too!  Vinegar, hm.

This is now our go-to chili recipe.  Every once in a while my husband requests I add beans, but we mostly love it as is.  I do add extra onion and garlic and I use half crushed/half diced tomatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

My family can not do spicy or overly warm foods. Beans are also a problem.  I searched around for a chili recipe.  This one worked for us.  Not spicy or warm.  After reading the reviews I did not use red wine vinegar.  In my 1/4 measuring cup I added about two teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, and used red wine in the rest of the measuring cup.  The flavor worked nicely for us.  Thank you for the recipe and the reviews.

I agree that you need more spice and leave out the vinegar.

Awesome I have been looking for a beanless chili that's a fast week day dinner. Added some Jalapeños to it because I like the spicy but left the rest as is.  So good thank you. Added to the recipe box immediately.  This will make my regular rotation.

My roommates and I love chili.

Unfortunately, I am on a low/no-phosphorus diet, which means NO BEANS. So chili was out of the question.

So I found this recipe, and I couldn't be happier. This was very filling and flavorful, and went great with some of the roommate's homemade cornbread.

My "no bean" hubby and kids loved this! It doubled nicely and was great as is! I served with a small buffet of toppings, cheese, onion, sour cream, macaroni noodles etc. For my tastes, I would have added more spice and heat and definitely prefer chili with more texture.

Very tasty and easy to make (with ingredients I usually have already!) I left out the hot sauce (the chili powder I have is plenty spicy already) and replaced the vinegar with 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, since I don't really like vinegar. Turned out great- I'll definitely be making this again!

I used diced tomato's since I don't like them and they're easier to pick out and I used ghost pepper instead of regular pepper sauce.  I hate vinegar and didn't have any so used worcestire (Spelling?) as someone else suggested.

As a chili, is what I rated.  But as a meat sauce or put in tortilla's or something then it's great.  The taste is great.  I'll make it again, but not as a chili.  I'll toss some pasta in it or put it in a tortilla.  
 
I also added some sharp cheddar cheese afterwards (as I always do with chili) and it tasted great.

I tried this recipe last night and it was great! I didn't have red wine vinegar so that's the only ingredient I didn't use.  

I am definitely going to make this recipe again and again.

My husband likes a more traditional chili and thought it was a bit too chunky for his liking because I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed but I will make this recipe more for me and leave the other chili recipes for him.  I liked it exactly the way I made it.

This chili is amazing and very versatile. I am never buying canned chili again!!  I used diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the crushed tomatoes for more flavor. I also used a combination of worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar to taste, as well as my favorite hot pepper sauce to taste. As suggested by another reviewer, I used a potato masher to get the desired consistency.

Very yummy!! I added half worcestershire and half red wine vinegar. Next time I think I'll do all worcestershire, as I think the red wine vinegar made it a little too sweet for our tastes. However, ketchup lovers would love the red wine vinegar taste! Delish!

Omg! My husband thought I was crazy: chili without beans? Well, he LOVE, LOVE, LOVED, this chili recipe! I loved it, too. He made me save it and email it to myself. That's how much he liked it, and the funny thing is he doesn't really like chili! We will definitely be cooking this again!!

This was FABULOUS!  It's -20 (-4F) and I, thankfully, had all of the ingredients on hand.  I especially like the warmth the red wine vinegar added.  Thank you!

My whole family loved it. Though it was definatly a little to spicy for us I will be making it again but knocking it down a notch. I also used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, buffalo sauce instead of hot, apple cider vinegar instead of red wine, and added a half pound of sausage. It was amazing thank you for sharing.

Was great! I read some of the reviews and instead of 1/4 cup red whine vinegar I used 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/8 cup Worcestershire sauce. I also used 1.5 lb of ground beef to make it a bit more meaty. To add some crunch to the texture, I added 1/3 cup frozen corn. Probably the best chili my wife and I have had in a long time and so easy and quick to make. This will go right on our favorite recipe list. Can't wait to make it again although I still have two servings leftover in the fridge!!

This was pretty nice. I guess I usually prefer beans in my chili, but it's not a must. I was a little surprised that no water was used here, just a bit of red wine vinegar, and therefore the chili came out fairly thick. I made it exactly as written, except that I browned my ground beef on medium heat, since "medium-high" started to burn it. The flavor of this chili is quite mild, but I enjoyed the whole batch. Quick and easy!
