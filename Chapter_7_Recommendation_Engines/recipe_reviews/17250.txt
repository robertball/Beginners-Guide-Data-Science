This is an excellent bread. I used apples from our own trees and the aroma of the loaves as they were baking was delightful.

Incredible recipe. I can't give it the full five stars, but only because I had to vary the recipe a bit with the ingredients I had on hand. I made mine with two VERY large Gala apples, and didn't want to shred them so I just minced them really well. I also used cheddar instead of Swiss just because I had a bag of cheddar I had to get rid of. I didn't know how much 4oz. would be, so I added a good large 3 or 4 handfuls of the cheese. And I definetly recommend spraying or greasing the pan pretty well, in response to a previous reviewer. I did, and it slid out no problem.
Even with my changes, the flavours blended subtely and beautifuly, especially with the whole-wheat flour in there. I plan on making this again and again, and I'll definetly try with GrannySmith and Swiss, considering I put those on wraps for breakfast!

great recipe.....I too omitted the walnuts as I am not a nut fan, and it still was great...my family was surprised that apples and swiss cheese combined in a bread would turn out so yummy...great with a light white wine ;)

OK...WOW! This is by far the best bread I've ever had. I omitted the nuts, and I think that it would have been too weird with them. Definitely try this one!

I made the recipe as is except I chopped both the cheese and the apple and did not grate them. It is a wonderful bread and I would make it again.

I really enjoyed this bread.  Since I was going to give them away as a Christmas treat I made this bread in a mini-muffin tin which makes them great as a take-away breakfast meal/treat.

The only reason I didn't rate this recipe 5 stars is that I had a serious sticking problem. I ended up breaking both loaves in half removing them from the pan. 
It may be that apples and cheddar are a natural combination for me, it may be that I despise Swiss cheese in anything, or it may be that cheddar is what I had on hand, but I used sharp cheddar in this recipe. It was delicious. Also used a combination of apples on hand (Spy, Winesap, Johnathon) instead of Granny Smith which is bland when cooked.

This was OK. The combination of cheese & apple just did not work for us (I guess we're just more into apple & cinnamon). I can understand how someone with different tastes could appreciate it more, though.

I did not think this combo came together well at all.  In fairness, I used white cheddar instead of swiss.

This is a great option for a savory loaf.  Turned out perfectly.  I did use walnuts which were great in the bread.  The soup went very well with our squash and pear soup.

This is SO good!  I used gala apples and marble cheese as it was all I had, and it turned out great.

Very good. There is not a very pronounced flavor of apple or cheese, but it comes together very nicely.  I love the wheat and the honey with the subtle apple and cheese flavors.  I agree that it will be wonderful served with a nice wine.  I plan to do that this evening.  Great texture.  I'll be making this again. (an added bonus: the kids love it too!!)

I thought this was pretty good.  My daughter said "I would eat it again.  I would not put much effort into getting it."  I'd probably have gone with three stars, based on that statement, but it smelled SO good while it was baking that I threw in an extra star based on that alone.

I followed the recipe except for chopping the apples and cheese instead of grating. I also used one ripe avocado instead of butter. It increased the cooking time by 5-7 minutes but the recipe turned out great??
