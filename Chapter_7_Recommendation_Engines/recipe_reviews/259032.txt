7.15.17  Most certainly, this is delicious!  I used low-fat vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand) and omitted the sugar.  I blended without the sugar, tasted it, and since my strawberries were so sweet and there was a bit of sweetness from the vanilla yogurt, just didn’t think I needed it.  It’s super creamy, and the berries are the star in this drink (no tang from the yogurt).  Certainly would make this one again, really enjoyed it

Salam sister from the other side of the world! I omitted the sugar and just increased the strawberries to make it healthier- don’t think it needs the sugar. Delicious! Also substituted the yogurt to low fat plain yogurt. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe Serena xxx

Loved it. Used regular plain yogurt and it turned out not too sour and not too sweet. Just a tad on the thin side.
