Very interesting recipe. I used real peanut butter instead of Jif so I thought I might have to add more sugar but it came out fine without the extra sugar. I also used real butter instead of the cooking spray. I deleted the raisins because I don't care for raisins. A very unique and tasty recipe.

Used nutty bread (flax and sunflower seed) and peanut butter with flax seeds too. Deliciously nutty. Almost too sweet, will try cutting back a bit on the sugar.

I hate to break a string of nice ratings, but this did not turn out well. I adore bread pudding and thought a PB version would be heavenly. Unfortunately it came out very bland tasting. PB doesn't always make a dessert better, and I often forget that. I ended up serving this with some fruit compote to make it edible.

Great taste!  I changed the sugar to !/4 cup agave syrup, and added another 1/2 cup milk (I used soy milk).  This was sweet without being too sweet.  If I hadn't added the extra milk, it would have been too crunchy! This was a nice, warm breakfast!

I really liked this. I used blackberry yogurt so it tasted like a peanut butter and blackberry jam sandwich. I omitted the raisins because I don't like raisins.
