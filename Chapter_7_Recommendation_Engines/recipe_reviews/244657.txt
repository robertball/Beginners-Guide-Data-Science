Mine was not sweet at all. I used left over turkey breast that I had cooked in the instant pot. I will definitely make it again and will put in my meal plan rotation.

I did not make any changes. It was a subtlety sweet, not overbearing, I liked it.  I'll probably add more sour dough crumbs next time. I may have made it too wet with the zucchini because I like to process my zucchini twice through the processor.  So it was probably like I added a 1/2-1 cup of water.  This was a good way to use up the zucchini in our garden! Good recipe. I will make again.
