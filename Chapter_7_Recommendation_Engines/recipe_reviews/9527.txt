I made this cake for my brother, who remembered our mother baking it for Christmas - many more then 40 years ago!  The cake is good but the prep time is more like hours than minutes.

I had to make a Japanese dish for my son's international feast for boys scouts. I made this in no time considering the very little time I had after I got off from work and be able to make it to the meeting. It turned out great, easy and best part everyone LOVED IT! Thanks!

This cake gets a 5 star for presentation and taste.  But it is so dry I had to make a rum sauce and rum whip cream to go with it.  I don't know why it was so dry.  The recipe did not tell you how many cake pans to use or what size.  I used 2 -10"pans and it took forever for it to cook in the middle.  I even added a cup and a half of brandy over the cake before icing it.  Still a little too dry.  I will try again making thinner layers and more layers
