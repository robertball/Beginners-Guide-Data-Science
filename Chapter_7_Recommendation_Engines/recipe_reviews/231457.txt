I followed the recipe as is and it turned out excellent!!! The only thing I may change next time is adding some warm toasted pine nuts to add a crunch, but either way this is a 5 star recipe.

I never thought spaghetti squash could truly replace spaghetti, but this recipe is one of the best things I've ever cooked! I love a good kick with my veggies, so the 1 tsp of red pepper flakes suited my taste buds perfectly, though those with a lower spice tolerance may want to cut it in half. In the future I might cut the butter and salt in half to see how it tastes, but this recipe is definitely spot-on!

This was so good. I've never had spaghetti squash before, let alone made it. And this was so easy. I didn't have any kale so I used spinach. I also didn't use all of the butter. But I will absolutely be making this again and again.

This was my first time cooking with spaghetti squash. I loved this dish! I cooked a few strips of bacon and then sauteed fresh garlic and onion in the bacon grease, and substituted spinach for the kale. Otherwise used recipe as specified. VERY tasty and filling.

I am a VERY finicky eater and this was my first time trying to Spaghetti Squash and I'm glad I picked this recipe to make my "virgin" voyage on. I used spinach instead of kale, and olive oil instead of butter...I added bite size chicken that I pre-seasoned before cooking -- mainly because I thought if I didn't like the squash I could pick the chicken out and eat it. But, this recipe was AWESOME!!! I may add a bit more spinach the next time I make it, just for my own personal taste. I love my food spicy so the amount of red pepper flakes was just right...however I would caution that it maybe too spicy for young kids but AGAIN this recipe was FANTASTIC!!!! I've attached a picture of how mine came out.

We are spaghetti squash lovers so this was right up our alley. Had to leave out mushrooms due to an allergy but we don't miss them anymore. We did the squash in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours. It could have used less time but we didn't check it along the way. Otherwise the recipe was followed to a tee and it was amazing. Thx Shyla!

Loved this! I wanted more/different veggies in it, so I did my own twist to the recipe. I added the mushrooms, but also added zucchini, yellow squash, sun dried tomatoes and forgot the spinach. I also used only olive oil, instead of the butter and added about 1tsp of pepper.  It turned out super delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I made this recipe exactly how it was written. EXCEPT I did half the crushed red peppers because I was making for kids. A MAZ ING!  The next time I make it, here's what I will change. I will add more kale. I will also be adding some Italian sausage or spiced up turkey breast with this. I almost made the lasagna spaghetti squash also on this site. This has so much more nutrition.  I'm glad I gave this one a try. I will be making this again.

Tried to make the recipe as is but had to adjust.. we used spinach as many other users commented.  I cut the onion in half as it is not my favorite but there was still way too much onion.. had it in every bite and seemed like just as much squash as onion.  Cut the pepper flakes in half and was still too spicy.  Everything else was as written.   Just had way too much pepper and onion for us.... leftovers went to waste.  If we were too do it again I would omit the pepper flakes, cut way back on the onion possibly cook them until carmelized instead of translucent, add more mushrooms and spinach as wasn't near enough.

I usually only try recipes after reading the reviews.  This had no reviews but I tried it because my husband wanted to eat more vegetables.  It was excellent!  We love spicy and it was a bit spicy so you may want to cut back on the red pepper flakes.  We had 2nd helpings and I am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  Easy to make and well worth it.

This is a great recipe. I did change it up quite a bit to suit my taste. I used spinach instead of kale, two cloves of fresh garlic, Italian parsley, and scallions. Added 1/2 cup of moscato and a little heavy cream to make a richer sauce, also added sweet Italian sausage to make it an entree. Delish.

I tried this and it was a definite no. Way too much crushed red peppers which overtook the entire side dish. Sorry.

Wow! This recipe is really incredible. I added a little bit of chopped broccoli, a few plum tomatoes and some minced garlic; I really couldn't believe how delicious it came out. Also, it made quite a bit more food than I was expecting. 10/10 will make again.

A nice change for spaghetti squash.  I don't care for mushrooms so I subbed diced Roma tomatoes.  I had one very small spaghetti squash, so I scaled everything back.  I enjoyed this dish and will make it again, sometime.

Pretty danged good, but found the red pepper to be a bit much.   I think half, or less would have been better for us.

I over cooked the spaghetti squash a little, but it was still good. I would suggest less Parmesan to reduce the sodium, but add more kale, mushrooms, and red pepper flakes!

Yummy! All of my favorite flavors and so nutritious! I replaced butter with olive oil and didn't use as much. Also, since I'm not a lover of spicy foods, next time I would use a little less red pepper.
So easy and so delish!

Loved this, although I had no mushrooms so I used a red pepper. Gave it some color and crunch (sautéed with onion but kept it just crisp enough). I might add a bit more pesto next time.

Best spagetti squash recipe I have tried so far.  I omitted the mushrooms, as I have multiple mushroom haters in my family, used double quantity of spinach instead of kale, half the amount of red pepper flakes and added some saudage.  My two year old, who has the appetite of a bird, had three helpings.  Yum!!!!

This was my first spaghetti squash experiment and I was very nervous but incredibly pleased. As is, this recipe is delicious. I am however, on a paleo diet so I made adjustments based on my needs like cutting out the cheese, homemade pesto and I added a lot more mushrooms and italian sausage.

I doubled this recipe with the ingredients listed with the exception of a few suggestions from the reviewers.  I used half the amount of onion and doubled the kale; although, I think I should have tripled it.  It does cook down quite a bit.  I omitted the olive oil due to amount of butter and olive oil in pesto.  I used the whole jar of pesto (appx 1/3 cup).  I served this dish with grilled chicken.  Great recipe!  This is a keeper.

Recipe was very good...was tired of trying to come up with new versions for spaghetti squash & this recipe really hit a homerun w/family.  Didn't use as much butter as called for and used a little more kale (used baby kale & didn't chop)...did cook squash ahead in micro as it saves allot of time.  Will definitely being repeating this recipe as  it can be used w/so many different meats!

I didn't think I liked Spaghetti Squash until I made this recipe. I didn't have kale so used greens like spinach and arugula, then I put the finished squash back into the shells to serve.  Family loved it!

I used a bunch of swiss chard, chopped and an 8oz pkg of mushrooms, sliced to make 4 nice side servings.  Even with a double dose of our favorite pesto we though this was good but didn't really jump out for us.  I does compliant chicken with tomato type sauces very well.

This was SO GOOD!    Thank you for sharing this recipe Shyla.  I used spinach and added chicken, otherwise followed your recipe.  What a tasty dish!  Will make again and again I'm sure.

SO DELICIOUS!! I cut out the kale and put in the entire container of pesto. (I really like pesto...) It was my first time making spaghetti squash so I was very impressed and will definitely add to my recipe book and make again!!

We loved it.  Made it a bit different since I didn't have all the ingredients--that said,  it would still be just as good or better as is.  It is the type of recipe if you keep the same spices you can switch out different veggies.

This is what I did, which, I want to save changes so I can make again!  Did not use kale or mushrooms...didn't have.  Did sauté onions as stated and add spices called for.  I did add the full amount of pepper flakes and found it to be a good amount of heat, but, not too much.  Put squash mixture in bowl & added 3 cubes of frozen basil (from Trader Joes)...because I had no pesto.  Added more Parmesan cheese then called for.  Served with grilled chicken.  Next day cut up left over chicken into left over squash--warm and just as good or even better!

Spaghetti squash -- like all other squashes, in fact -- is a great vegetable.  My partner went for naked squash -- no butter, onion, garlic, kale, or other seasonings.  I stuck with about one TB of butter, one-third of a sauteed onion, one clove of sauteed garlic, salt, pepper, a dash of red pepper, Italian seasonings, cilantro, and about 1 t. of peccorino romano.  This recipe is infinitely variable.  The squash makes it great.  Good recipe.

This is delicious!!! I skipped the cheese and added sausage and green onions too. I'd eat this all day! The texture is surprising, but its filling and perfect re-heated for lunch! I'm going to make this again for sure :)

This was a great dish that lends itself well to adjusting.  I didn't have pesto, so I used about a tsp of dried basil, 2 large cloves of garlic, and an extra 1/4 cup of parmesan in place of it.  Skipped the mushrooms but added some sage sausage which balanced the dish nicely with a little heat and salt.  Great with the kale.  Will be making this many more times.

This was amazing.  My first time ever eating  or  cooking spaghetti squash.  I modified a little bit,  actually left out the  olive oil for the end,  only used two teaspoons of butter,  and one teaspoon of  pesto.  Little dashes of everything else,  and it was fantastic :) I think I'll make this for the next family reunion or get together

Delicious as is, we added a little more red pepper for an additional kick. I also boiled the spaghetti squash, cooled it, peeled and separated, then refrigerated it in Tupperware ahead of time.  It made prep-time faster as then I just threw the ingredients together for dinner.

Cannot remember ever having a dish w/ this combination of vegetables, and they played well together. Just the right amount of seasoning w/ a hint of heat. Rather than buy Parmesan cheese, used up open packages of Sargento 4 Cheese Italian and sharp cheddar. Great creation Shyla Lane, and keep stoking that innovative spirit!!

This was the first time I have ever tried spaghetti squash, and I must say, I was quite impressed.  I should have listened to the other reviews and cut the pepper flakes in half.  I didn't mind the spice, but my husband noticed it.  I chose to add chicken to this dish, but that was the only recipe deviation.  This was great and I will be trying this again with different sauces.  Thanks for introducing me to something new!

Made this with a package of power greens, 2 cloves of garlic, half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and bloomed the spices before adding the veggies.  Used enough olive oil and butter to get the brown bits up.

This recipe has so much flavor! I substituted scallions for the white onion and portobello for regular mushrooms. I left the seeds in while cooking by accident, so the squash didn’t come out as stringy as hoped. The taste was still delicious! I will make this again.

Oh my!  I am always looking for new veggie recipes and this one is a keeper.  I used spinach in place of kale (because that is what I had in the fridge), 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, an extra tablespoon of pesto, & 2 tablespoons of cream.  
Yummy!

I omitted the pesto and used just a splash or two of chicken stock when veggies cooked. It was good, I will make it again.

Saved some time by microwaving the squash.   cut a number of slits (I make at least 6) microwave for 5 minutes on high, rotate, microwave on high for another 5 minutes.   Should only take 10-15 minutes, mine was small so 10 minutes worked.
I know my heat tolerance, so I just sprinkled pepper flakes, no need to measure.  I didn't see the point in dirtying a bowl, so everything was done in a large skillet.   Oh, I also grated a large clove of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

This recipe was ok and I will probably try making it again but I would cut down on the spices.  I would cut the pepper flakes and Italian seasoning to 1/2 teaspoon each.  It was just a bit too strong for me.

This is by far the best Spaghetti Squash recipe I’ve ever made! I added no mushrooms because I didn’t have any. I did add tomatoes instead. I also used olive oil instead of butter. What really makes this dish stand out for me is the pesto. It adds a lot of depth to the flavor of this dish. Will surely make it again! Thank you for a great dish!

A nice change. Added 2lbs seasoned, chopped and cooked chicken breast.  Used Spinach, no mushrooms, extra pesto, and red onion.

Delicious and light tasting with a bit of spice! I doubled the pesto because I love it. As per previous reviews I halved the onion. I had no kale so I substituted spinach and added green beans when I sautéed the onion in the place of mushrooms. Yummy! As stated in other reviews, I think the pine nuts on top would be an added treat!

This is a very tasty and nutritious dish!  I only made two adjustments.  1)  Added a lot more mushrooms.  You can never have too many mushrooms!  and 2)  cut the red pepper flakes in half to accommodate the family.   I would definitely make it again.

Yummy!  The only changes I made was adding fresh garlic with the onions and herbed salt. I didn't have fresh kale so I used frozen chopped and it worked very well.

Temp & time for cooking squash are overkill. Squash turned out like mashed potatoes. 
375 for 30 mins max.

The rest was tasty.....

This was delicious and easy. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! My only comment is that it is not 6 main meal servings. The 6 must refer to using it as a side dish. There is really 3-4 servings depending on the appetites your dealing with. I will definitely make this again!

Pretty tasty but no 5 stars because the original did not call for spinach.   Spinach makes all of the difference and otherwise would make it just an okay meal.

Made it non-diary with vegan pesto, olive oil and nutritional yeast. Added extra kale and mushrooms, and reduced red pepper flakes. Served with a side of paleo mashed sweet potatoes. Next day I had the leftover spaghettI squash over a bed of field greens.  Another keeper!

Satisfying, healthy n delish. Picky vegan teen loved it. I browned the onions, used a lot more mushrooms, spinach instead of kale (had it), olive oil instead of butter (vegan kid). Easy will definitely make this again. And I am not into cooking.

I did add a pound of ground turkey .  I pre-cooked it and then added it in when you add the squash.  It was good but not super.  But for someone who grows spaghetti squash in the garden and currently has an overabundance, it was nice to find something different to do with the squash.

This was really good. I reduced the pepper flakes as suggested by others and was glad I did. I also sautéed 5 cloves of chopped fresh garlic with the onion and skipped the garlic powder. I also added salt and some fresh lemon juice. I'll make this again.

This was very simple and a very excellent meal. Next time I will leave out the red pepper flakes because I don't like hot spicy food even though the amount added is minimal.

I thought it was OK, but Kenny said he really liked it.  I subbed EVOO for butter in the recipe.  I also added kalamata olives and grape tomatoes.  I think it could have used  a little more kale.  I also didn't add any spices as the pesto had enough flavor.  

The 2nd time I sauteed garlic w/the onions.  I did add a little more kale and also added some mozzarella cheese along w/the fresh parmesan.  I actually made it all in the skillet I sauteed the onions in.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was delicious.    I  added 2 shredded rotisserie chicken breasts to make it a main dish, and followed the recipe but substituted spinach for the kale and 3-4 minced cloves of garlic for the garlic salt.  My spaghetti squash was large so as a result we will be having  this delicious meal again for another 2-3 days.

This was good.  I cooked the onions a little too long and they carmelized, leading to a strange sweetness that I wished wasn't there.  I also added significantly more mushrooms and spinach (sub in for kale).

DELICIOUS!  I used kale, Swiss chard and spinach because I doubled the batch and it turned out great....Even my twin 8 year olds loved it.  That's a great recipe :)

I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish. The only changes I made were to add garlic; omit the oil; and used spinach in place of the kale.  I will definitely be making this again - with more mushrooms. Yummy low carb dinner.

I followed the recipe and it was fantastic. I like the the cooking time for the squash, turns out like 'al dente' for pasta. I used half a large yellow onion and added marinated artichoke hearts. Will definitely make again and try adding spinach.

This was absolutely delicious ... until I added the pesto.  Before adding, there were hints of butter and garlic, onion and seasonings.  The pesto drowned all of these notes and masked the flavor of the squash and kale (I was out of mushrooms, so didn't add those).

Seriously, I just tried it again and it was like a mouthful of basil!  I love me some pesto, but it is out of place in this dish.

As a last note, I recommend shredding the kale by rolling it up like a cigar. That way, the kale provides a pleasant crisp texture without being too large or getting wadded up in the strings of spaghetti squash.

It was delicious. I did everything but the mushrooms.  I had to add extra seasoning because i needed a little more flavor.  I wasn't really sure what the olive oil was for at the end. that made it a little too oily for me. I'll leave it off next time.

This was an excellent way to try spaghetti squash for the first time.  

I diced the onion and mushrooms, and replaced the kale with spinach.  Added a  minced jalapeno and topped with slices of chicken breast.   The jalapeno was a nice compliment to the sweetness of the spaghetti squash.  

After this, I'm going to start growing my own spaghetti squash in my garden!

Instead of using the squash as noodles I cubed the squash and used regular spaghetti noodles. I didn't add the mushrooms r cheese. Don't like the texture of mushrooms and I'm lactose intolerant. I added turmeric into the spice mixture and it turned out fantastic! I might buy lactose pills for the next time I make this and bake the mixture in mozzarella cheese!

Very tasty! I hate mushrooms, so I added 1 small head of broccoli instead. I also put 1/4 of 1 small onion in. It was just right for me. I don't like spice much, but I put in what it recommended and thought it was fine. I would probably omit the Parmasan cheese, though, because it was a bit salty for my taste.

It was really good! Next time I will add chicken to make it a whole meal. I used too much garlic seasoning in mine but it was still good! Also I didn't have a lot of what was in the recipe so I used broccoli and green beans in place of kale, and no pine nuts, or red chilli peppers. It still turned out really good tho

Delicious. Undid use only half the red peppered and it had just the right amount of heat! I've never made spaghetti squash before, I baked it for just a bit over an hour and the "noodles" we somewhat firm. Texture-wise it didn't feel like spaghetti. Unsure if that was me, or just the normal texture.  I'll add more spinach next time.  But I'll make for sure again! But probably half the amount since the hubs wasn't too impressed. His loss!

This recipe is easy and it really covers up the taste of the spaghetti squash. Even my son who does not like squash liked this recipe. Makes you feel like you are eating pasta. Did'nt have kale first time I made it and substituted with spinach.

A little too salty, but I had a small squash, so I should have halved the spices. I'll keep this in mind next time.

Instead of kale and mushrooms I substituted with spinach and grape tomato halves. Instead of garlic salt I sautéed some minced garlic in with the onions and added some table salt. It turned out great! My husband and I loved it. It’s a keeper!

We really liked this recipe. I used spinach instead of kale and unfortunately I didn't have any pesto. My squash did need more salt than the recipe calls for due to the sweetness of the squash. Thank you!

Made this for my family today and even my picky niece ate it all up. I don't like kale so I used spinach instead and fresh garlic and parsley, other than that stuck to the recipe. Added some grilled chicken on top and loved it to the last bite!

Great recipe and love the addition of pesto to veggies! My men usually insist on meat in dishes but this one was filling as is! Keep watch on squash baking time--if it cooks too long the strands become mushier than desired. Overall this dish packs great flavor with low calories yet a filling dish!

Love this recipe!  It lends itself well to individual customizations such as lowering the heat, swapping out veggies, adding pine nuts.  I did not include kale or mushrooms just because I didn't have them on hand.  Added a chiffonade of fresh basil.  This will become part of my regular rotation!

I made some changes and the final product was worthy of 5 stars, but this recipe needed these few things to improve it.  I added 2 cups of kale and 8 oz of mushroom instead of 1 cup of kale and 4 single mushrooms and then cooked the mushroom and kale until cooked to my liking (about 7 minutes).  I cooked the onion until fully translucent (about 10 minutes) and diced it instead of slicing it so that it was blended in more.  I also used a mild sweet onion instead of a strong flavored onion.  I added shredded turkey breast (utilizing some left overs) to make it a main course.  I did use a bit more pesto too.  Depending on the type of crushed red pepper you use, this recipe may be too spicy for some people.

Excellent & will definitely make again.  I cooked the spaghetti squash on the stove top instead of the oven & it took half the time. The red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick.

Absolutely delish! I added a couple touches of my own though. I added some diced sautéed chicken, a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and mushrooms. Made it a hit in the house! My kids hate squash and they didn't have a clue!

Love! Love! Love! this recipe!! It definitely deserves 5 stars.  Served it with a side of sourdough bread, which complimented it nicely.  I noticed that some folks suggested using spinach and pine nuts. I will have to try it that way next time just for fun. :) Thank you so much for sharing.

I'm looking for squash dishes. I'll make this again. You can substitute any green vegetable, I put in collard greens. Go light on the butter as it gets a bit greasy with the onions. It helps to add a bit of salt or cajun seasoning.

I made a spaghetti squash and put the "spaghetti" in the fridge planning to make individual portions. I pared down the recipe to make one cup total, just enough for a good sized portion.

This was even better than I expected! My husband is a little picky and said he loved it! I made it exactly per the recipe but next time I think I'll try to reduce the butter and maybe add some ground turkey or turkey sausage and make this the main dish.

I felt it needed more flavor, maybe more cheese.  The onion was definitely the dominant flavor, so maybe just cut some of the onion and maybe add more garlic?  Not sure how to adjust it to make it better... I just follow recipes.

This was lovely. I'm not a fan of kale so like others I used spinach. I buy frozen spinach in cubes, reserving fresh spinach for salads, etc. So I defrosted 3 cubes in the micro and squeezed dry. I also browned up the mushrooms along  with the onions.  Can't really call those changes and I will certainly make this again!

I really liked this recipe.  I made some adjustments such as simply chopping some basil vs. making actual pesto since we are moving and I had already packed away my food processor.  I also did not have any kale at hand and I definitely did not measure anything (measuring cups are packed too).  I also added feta cheese to the pan for the last few minutes and served with parmesan cheese on top.  I think this would also go really well with some Italian sausage.

This is outstanding!! I reduced the amount of butter, used spinach instead of kale, and added shrimp to the cooked onions for a couple minutes before adding the spinach and mushrooms.  My husband even rated this a 7 out of 10 and he's sort of picky. Will definitely make this again!!!!!

Pretty good. We added chicken and substituted onion powder for the onion (forgot to prep). We also didn't use mushrooms and it still turned out great!

Excellent!  I am making it for the second time for dinner tonight.  I will use garlic powder, not garlic salt.  WAY to salty, especially when pesto is added.  Also, will use less than half of the butter.  No need for the olive oil when you are adding pesto.  First time around it was a bit greasy.  I'll also add a bit more pesto.  Hopefully 5 stars this time around :-)

Amazing! This was my first time making spaghetti squash and wow! I am in love with pasta but don't like what carbs do to me, and this has been a delicious alternative!  I changed the recipe a bit, using olive oil instead of butter and adding sun dried tomatoes. I baked for 45 mins to get a bit more al dente. You really can dress it anyway you like! This will be a regular!

I substituted kale for spinach, and onions for leeks and cooked bite-sized pieces of chicken with it... DELICIOUS!!! Next time I will add garlic powder and maybe a little more pesto sauce.

Really good!  I used spinach since I had no kale, and it worked well.  Also, I had no garlic salt, so I used 1 teaspoon minced garlic and a little more than 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Next time, maybe I'll have the mushrooms and can add them!

Absolutely delicious! Didn't have an onion so I subbed fresh garlic. Halfed the red pepper flakes as others suggested and it had the right about of spice. Next time I'm going to add toasted pine nuts and some vegan sausage for an added pizazz.

This recipe is a DEFINITE keeper.  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of not adding mushrooms (none on hand). It was delicious and had a kick level that my husband and I love.  If you are not a spicy person, cut back the pepper by half.  When I tasted the final dish, I realized that my squash was under cooked - not due to your directions - but because I made it the day before and had to shorten cook time to 45 min due to time restraints.  To compensate for, the slightly too al dente texture of the squash, I added  1/2 to 3/4c of chicken stock and put back on the burner to simmer.  This softened up the squash nicely, and gave me the opportunity to use up more of the kale that I had on hand.  A great dish.  I highly recommend.

I decided to try something besides typical sauce and meatballs and am in love with this recipe!! I split the recipe in half since it was just me eating and sautéed the onions in olive oil instead of butter. I also used spinach instead of kale and then topped it with nonfat Greek yogurt to cut the spice! I think I'll try it cold tomorrow. :)

Excellent! My husband is a big pasta eater and loved this as a substitute. I used fresh spinach instead of kale, grated fresh garlic, and just used the Parmesan as a garnish. This will definitely go into our meal rotation.

This was great! My husband and son loved it as well, though my husband needed more protein and made an egg to go with. Doesn't take long to make if you bake the spaghetti squash in advance.

Excellent! I didn't have mushrooms, and replaced kale with spinach (added almost 2 cups). It had great flavor, and wasn't too spicy for me, though I think the extra spinach helped cut the spicy-ness.  Could probably cut down a little bit on the garlic salt, or add fresh garlic to the sauteed onions instead to cut back on sodium. I also didn't add in the extra olive oil, as my pesto already had plenty. Will be making this one again!
