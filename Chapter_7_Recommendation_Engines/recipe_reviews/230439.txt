this is one of those hot drinks.....you totally don't want to screw up. I made this with the intention of using the SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend with the conversions of chart on the back of the package. 1st note, don't follow that conversion for this recipe. Use the full amount directed on this recipe when subbing with the SPLENDA(R) substitute, you will thank me for it. 2nd note, when making your cup of hot Christmas Coffee, please also note, that the hot water amount should also be 6 ounces. As looked up at the note, my eyes skimmed over it and thought it was a solid 1 cup measurement. That's not the case. It's 6 ounces of hot water and I used 4 tsp of mix. Now that I've got those notes aside. This was really comforting. I loved the overall taste right down to the last sip. I will be enjoying this completely during the holidays and after for sure. If you bypass my note advice you will find that your coffee will be weak and not slightly sweet. If you follow my advice, you will enjoy this recipe as I did....thanks again!

This is a very good recipe. I served it at our family Brunch last Christmas (for the adults; the kids got heated Chocolate Ovaltine topped with Marshmallows), and got complements from all around the table. I used Vanilla-Caramel Coffee-Mate because that was the only variety I could find that was sugar-free, Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and Folgers Classic Decaf Instant Coffee. I set out small peppermint Candy Canes on each napkin, too; both the Adults and the Children enjoyed those.

When I first tried this, I liked it very much.  However, the more I drank it, the less I liked it.  I can't explain why.

I added a bit more then 3 tsp to my cups since it tasted a little watered down but it might just be me I like strong coffee flavor. All in all it has good flavor.
