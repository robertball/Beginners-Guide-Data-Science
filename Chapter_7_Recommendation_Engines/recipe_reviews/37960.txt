This was very good.  I made two cuts about 2/3rds of the way down the cabbage so I could add some onions inside and let the foil hold it back together.

I love this! I spread a little bit of olive oil instead of the butter, and since I make one wedge at a time for myself, I don't need the ice cube. It still comes out great and I've made this many times since trying it the first time!

I didn't get to try this..but only because my husband ate it all. =0.  He loved it!  Well before everyone thinks that he is a pig (actually he is almost a clone of Nick Cage), I scaled the recipe down to use the 1/4 of a "small" head of cabbage that was left over.  He said that it was really good & to do a repeat, which is all good to me!  Thanks Gail!

Maybe it's our grill, but the butter and even the ice cube never melted after 30 min. on med-high.  Most of the cabbage is not even cooked, so we are putting it in the oven now as I write this review.  I'm sure the flavors will be fine, so I am giving the recipe 2 stars.  I will be sticking to another recipe on this site where you cut the cabbage into wedges, season, wrap in foil, and put on the grill.

I have been making this recipe for five years now instead of garlic i use about 5 beef boulion cubes, talk about amazing. We usually grill tri-tip so i put this on 30 minutes before the steak when the steak is done the cabbage is ready. I will have to try it with garlic because I am a garlic nut. Thank you!

have tried this recipes several times and love it. I also have made some adjustments for our tastes. I like using red cabbage, core it out enough to stuff with a fresh smoked saugage, leaving skin on or off (I've done both ways) grill heavily wrapped in foil for an hour...talk about nice flavor! Serve with fresh perogi. smiles

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did different was also wrap strips of bacon around the cabbage head.  You don't even need to slice it when it's done because it falls apart.  I also tried cooking the wedges in a disposable foil pan covered with foil.  This worked well also.

This was a tasty way to add a vegtable to your summer cooking or anytime cooking.  Its very important to modify the recipe for a whole head.  I did not have seasoning for the whole head the first time I cooked it.

This was excellent, whole family enjoyed.  Grilled some sausages and potatoes and this was the perfect side dish!

I think i put too much garlic, but it had a GREAT flavor. It was raining so we put it in the oven for 40 minutes then took it out cut it in four and stuck it in the steamer for 15 minutes. It turned out really good and I bet it would be better if I was able to put it on the outdoor barbeque!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I think I did something wrong.  I have recently bought a new grill and I'm not used to it yet.  My cabbage was slightly burned on the outside and just not done enough for my taste.  It was fun to make and an excellent idea, I just don't know if I would try it again.  I'd rather have mine steamed.  The flavors didn't get fully into the cabbage.

Just OK, on the dry side.  Needs flavoring.

I don't know what I did wrong because we did not like this recipe at all.  The butter never melted, and we BBQed this on med-high (and high) for 40+ minutes.  The outer half cooked enough, but the inside was still raw.  Thank goodness cabbage is cheap because I threw away a bunch of it!

Cook time needs to be increased but this worked well while grilling. Next time I will add different flavors, maybe even a rub.

Have been doing a cooked cabbage similar to this for many years.  Instead of the head, I slice the cabbage about 3/4" thick.  Add a slice a Vidala onion and layer together with butter, salt and pepper.  Wrap tightly with two layers of foil.  Cook on the grill or in the oven.  Make sure you keep flipping to get the most browning as possible.

Nothing outstanding.  Seemed like a lot of butter.
