I'm part Filipino and this recipe needs several changes. It's an easy dish to prepare and cooks in under an hour. For pork adobo, I usually use pork loin steaks, sliced or not. Brown pork in a skillet on medium high heat til nearly done. I've never needed oil to brown the meat. In a small bowl, mix 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1 2/3 cups water. Pour over browned meat. Season generously with garlic powder or granulated garlic. Add 2 bay leaves to the sauce. Cook uncovered on medium to medium high heat. The sauce will cook at a slow steady boil, and the flavor will absorb into the meat. You can save a little sauce or let the sauce evaporate.  I usually save a little sauce for the meat and steamed white rice. No need to use rub on meat. Do not add salt or pepper - it will be TOO salty! And no need to marinate. Chicken adobo is another recipe. Prepared correctly, adobo is a 5 star recipe! Family and friends devour it!

Too salty really. I am Filipino and this is something that might help everyone... dont knock it till you taste it because it will be good... 
-- same amounts of pork and chicken
-- mix the ratio of vinegar and soy with 1:1 meaning one cup soy one cup vinegar
-- do not crack the bay leaf... just put two whole bay leaves with pepper corn in it...
-- now here's the kicker... with all the ingredients together with 2 cloves of smashed garlic, soy, vinegar, the pepper and the bay leaf, add a tea spoon of Worcestershire on it... then shove it all into a pressure cooker
-- cook for 20 minutes and take it out... drain the meat from the sauce.. pick up the oil residue and put in a frying pan. Fry all the meats (Pork and Chicken) till tender and dry... Serve in a deep sauce pan and pour all the Sauce... This will taste great

Yap this recipe is kinda salty, because soy sauce is already salty.  Especially if you use asian soy sauces like marca pina or ufc.  My style of adobo is marinating it with vinegar, soy sauce, wine, garlic, bayleaf and brown sugar.  Simmer all of it then drain reserving the sauce.  In a skillet, fry garlic and little bit of onion, potato then add the pork and chicken by batch.  Then pour the sauce when done and bring it to a boil.

I did not care for this recipe. Soy saude is a must, salt, you can definitely do away with, and bay leaves? that is also a must.  i like salty, but this went overboard.

I like the combination of meats in this recipe.  I like the vinegar flavor and added some canned veggies to rice for a more balanced meal.  I accidentally decreased the salt to 3 tsp  and it probably made a huge difference.  It was very tasty with a good strong kick.

We did not care for this recipe. My kids wouldn't even touch it and my children enjoy many, many different ethnic cuisines.

I am not Filipino but my step mother is and an excellent cook at that. Her pork adobo was one of my all time favorite meals. I lost the recipe over the years and was hoping to find a similar version on here. This tastes nothing like it at all. Very disappointed.
