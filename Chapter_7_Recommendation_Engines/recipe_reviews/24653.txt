I didn't want this to be salsa-y, as other reviewers pointed out, so I did not put in the cumin, and instead used Italian herbs.  It is good.  I think less sugar next time (although I didn't put in the full amount called for originally)-its still too sweet.  Fresh basil is nice in it.  A bit more cooking to reduce it and maybe a splash of olive oil would make it more like what I was looking for.

I've made this twice now and really enjoy the taste - although I would call it SALSA, not a dip.  The first time I processed the ingredients in my food processor/blender as stated and found this step uneccesary (became too liquidy) .  The second time I did not use the food processor/blender - just chopped up the red peppers before cooking (everything else is chopped already) - the results were a mildly SWEET tasting salsa.  Easy and delicious.

This is a strangely addictive recipe.  It is a cooked salsa, rather than a dip, but I like its unique flavor.  The more I nibbled at it, the harder it was to stop!  It was a hit at my party.

I have been looking for a roasted red pepper dip to replace the one I lost and this is great although a salsa rather than dip. Next time I will cut up the peppers finer and not use the blender. Might reduce the sugar by a tbls.

very yummy salsa/dip.  I did chop everything smaller and use as a salsa rather than a dip to pile onto pita chips.  I made a few changes by using homemade roasted red peppers, only two tablespoons of brown sugar, and a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil.  DELISH!

This was good but not what I would call a dip.  A spread or a sauce perhaps.  I actually used it n some fresh pasta and it was quite good!  I skipped the cumin and used Italian herbs.  Some salt were also needed. I used 1 tbsp of brown sugar as I did not want it too sweet.  I also blended it right in the pot with my stick hand blender.   I would make this again for a quick and easy pasta sauce - but not a dip.

Following the advice of others I cut the sugar back to 2T and used a sweet red table wine.  I would definitely call this a sweet, cooked salsa instead of a dip, but that said we really enjoyed it for a change of pace from our regular cream dips.  Although if you like a bit of heat in your salsa wait to add the chili peppers until later in the cooking process.
