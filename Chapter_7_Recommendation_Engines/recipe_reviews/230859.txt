Sooo good! The star of our dinner! A few things to note. I doubled filling but it made nowhere near 40, honestly they didn't stick around long enough to count! I used water on my finger to moisten edge and pinch shut. This is essential to seal them. That being said I only had a tiny filling to leak out. I felt they needed a dipping sauce, made one out if about 3/4 cup sour cream, heaping T of ranch dip (not dressing) and a few good shakes of red hot sauce. Perfectly accompanied these gems. Not one leftover! Be aware they become less crispy the longer they sit and cool. Awesome recipe! Family raved! Thanks!

This is super easy and very good. I made it with egg rolls instead of wonton. I didn't put it in the freezer and it came out fine. I also doubled the recipe and it makes 6-8 egg rolls.

So yummy!!!! My husband doesn't like ranch or blue cheese so I substituted it with chicken stock to moisten mixture. Came out dry 1st time but added more stock my 2nd time. Came out perfect & I used ranch as dipping sauce. Delicious!!!

The original recipe is amazing, but the second time we modified it a bit...I put at least a quarter cup of hot sauce in (We like spicy), split the ranch in half and did the other half blue cheese dressing, plus I added a dallop of cream cheese in the center of each wanton. DELICIOUS!!

Was pretty good. Used Franks buffalo wing sauce in it, and made some with teriyaki sauce too for those who aren't buffalo spicy fans.

Excellent! I used Mozzarella instead of cheddar and a tablespoon plus a few drops of Franks hot sauce. Really a hit for dinner. Made the wonton wrappers from scratch as I could not find them locally. Served up with ranch dressing and bacon and cheese potato rounds.
