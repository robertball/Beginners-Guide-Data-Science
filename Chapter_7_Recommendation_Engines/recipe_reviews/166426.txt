I have made this a few times, and it tastes 10 times better if you let it almost totally defrost before serving.  (I let it sit out at least 1/2 hour after removing from loaf pan).  If you serve right out of the freezer, it is kind of tasteless, but is delicious when it melts a little.  Also, I made the mistake of using a store brand once, but real Cool Whip tastes much better.   Other points I discovered after reading  reviews and also making a few times: Get 12 oz. Cool Whip to have enough to use in the recipe and to be able cover the entire loaf at serving time. I use 10 oreos plus 1 1/2 tbsp. butter for a more substantial crust. This keeps well in the freezer.  You can make it a couple of weeks in advance so there's one less thing to do when preparing for company.   All in all, it's a good summer dessert.

I made this a few weeks ago for a family BBQ and it was a BIG hit! I used graham cracker crumbs to make the crust. Make sure to line the loaf pan with foil, as this helps it to come out easily. I quickly figured out that you could use almost any type of fruit to make this and it would still be super yummy! I'm going to make it again for Memorial Day, but I think I'm going to use peaches or mandarin oranges, with the graham crust.  UPDATE: Me & my big ideas! I made this for a third time, using mandarin oranges as I had threatened to do before. It didn't come out so well, but I think I know why: using a lg. can of the oranges, I did drain the liquid but I think they needed to be drained AGAIN after mashing. The flavor was terrific and after about a full day, it was completely frozen, but that was just the leftovers--we ate it without the fancy topping, anyway, and it was a bit more like a really oold, yogurt consistency but still very, very tasty. So, I think I will do it again, with a double draining for any type of canned fruit that I might use.

This was delicious, the whole family loved it.  I substituted fat free condensed milk, fat free Cool Whip and about 12 Nabisco Chocolate Wafers to lighten it up a little.  Freezes well.  Great recipe, can't wait to make it again.

This was a hit with my family. Thanks to the other reviews, I let it sit out of the freezer for a little while before serving. I also had to use extra cookies for this (12 total). Also, I think it wouldn't hurt to get a bigger container of Cool Whip to use for the outer layer (you can use the leftover Cool Whip with the extra Oreo cookies...mmmmm). 
Next time I will try something else, like raspberries.

This was so delicious my family requested we make this again! I followed the directions but did something a litle different since I made this several days ahead of when I wanted to serve it. Since I wasn't sure if the strawberries would last until the serving day I layered those in the pan first before pouring in the cool whip mixture. It didn't look as cute on top but it worked and the dessert stayed fresh until serving time! Chocolate graham crackers worked great instead of oreos.

Tasty and easy to make! I actually only had a ready made chocolate pie crust. So I followed the recipe exactly but used only 2 cups strawberries mashed and when it was ready topped it with a few other cut strawberries and whipped cream. Great dessert for summer time!

I served this to friends and they couldn't believe that there wasn't ice cream in it!  They left with the recipe.
This is the perfect make-ahead dessert for entertaining.  I now keep one stashed in my freezer for impromptu guests!

I made this for Hubby's bday and it was fantastic! Next time I will puree all the strawberries, and the frozen bits were hard to chew, I also want to make this in popcicle molds this summer.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful!  It is a perfect summer time recipe that I will continue to make.  Some comments said the lemon was too strong, but to me there was just a very subtle "hint" of lemon.  But the rest of my family couldn't tell at all.  And some reviews said you will need more cool whip, but I made this in the loaf pan, used exactly 2 cups in the filling and had the perfect amount left over for rest.  And the cookies were just enough to give it a nice bit of crust/texture w/out over powering it.  Oh, and on mashing, I just used a potato masher and that worked just fine.  As others said, it really does get better as it thaws.  It may not look as pretty, but as fast as it goes, it doesn't matter.  The initial presentation is beautiful anyway, lol.  It taste light & cool, perfect for summer.  Aside from the strawberries, its really not healty, but boy is it delicious!

This recipe is really delicious! I made it as a Father's Day dessert, and everyone loved it. I did substitute graham cracker for the Oreo cookies, and it was still delicious. You will definitely need more than just the one tub of cool whip, though, if you want to cover the entire dessert as shown in the photo. Spread the cool whip on quickly, before the dessert melts! Can't wait to see if this works well with other types of fruit, too.

This was a fantastic recipe and everyone enjoyed it.  I pureed the 2 cups of strawberries in a food processor before adding the other ingreadients.  I found that an 8 oz container of cool whip left "just enough" to frost the finished product.  I prepared this the day before and then removed from the freezer and frosted it just before my guests arrived.  I put the deocorated dessert in the refrigerator and served it promply after dinner. It was delicious!!

This was amazing, and so refreshing on a hot day!  I used Oreo cookie crumbs instead, and layered  strawberry mix, cookie crumbs and then some sliced strawberries and put mix over top with more cookie crumbs.  I also didn't have lemon juice on hand so I used some fruit flavoured wine.  It turned out perfect!  Next time I think I will experiment with some of the other readers suggestions with graham crumbs and kiwi.  Thank you for sharing this :)

This was a HIT ... my 12 year old made it, and Loved aLL of the attention He rec'd ... everyone left with His Recipe! ... thanks CooL Whip!  We made this the day before and kept it in freezer for 23 hours, and pulled it out as the potluck party started; and it was soft enough to cut after about 15-20 minutes!  Just in time for dessert! It's the Perfect 'take along' dessert!  It won't melt too quick if REALLY FROZEN!!!

I was surprised when we ate this because I felt like basically I was eating strawberry ice cream with crushed oreos. Not bad, just why go through the effort if I can buy ice cream that tastes the same?

I followed the directions to the "t" and they were horrible.  So I cooked the second sheet a little longer and didn't bother with the rest of the dough, when those didn't turn out much better.

I recently saw this recipe and made it today. Delicious! I took another member's advice and added a layer of crushed oreos, and used a 1/2 tablespoon extra of butter for the bottom oreo crust layer. I used cool whip for the inside filling, but made my own whipped cream for the topping. It came out awesome!!

This was a great, simple recipe!  We had lots of strawberries to use up and this dessert used them all.  My sister, a strawberry fanatic, absolutely loved it.  I suggest buying at least 12oz Cool Whip to make sure there is enough for the outside.  Also, next time I will add more butter to the Oreo cookie crumbs (I ended up using 10) so that they adhere better and don't go all over the place when I slice the dessert.  Overall a great recipe!

This dessert is very pretty and incredibly easy to prepare.  The downside is the flavor of the cool whip is prominent in the dessert.

This is delicious!   You can make it lighter by using Reduced Fat Oreos and No Fat Sweetened Condensed milk and it is still delicious.  It is our favorite go-to dessert in our house since it stays frozen until you want some.  Excellent!  Thank you Cool Whip!

I made this for our family get-together. The original presentation was awesome, but the longer it thawed, the less presentable it became. However, the taste was wonderful! I made this in a springform pan, as I was using my loaf pans for another recipe.

Mom made this, recommended putting more cookie crumbs on the bottom.  If you make it with the fat free sweet. cond. milk it will not set up, and people actually liked it that way better than when it was frozen!

It looked pretty when sliced but short on flavor. And allot of it was scraped off the plates into the trash can. I might experiment on using some strawberry extract or something to boost the strawberry flavor.

Imagine eating as much cool whip as a slice of cake. (Ew....). That is what this is. It does not taste as good as what it is raved up to be. Strawberry ice cream tastes 1000 times better. And, I agree with a previous review that said the 1/4 cup of lemon juice makes for an overpowering lemon flavor. The worst part is the whole thing is mostly coolwhip... and cool whip is mostly hydrogenated oil. After this was frozen, I felt like I was eating Crisco... and the flavor was not that great.

I had a difficult time with the foil because the sides of the foil are lower, so the mixture spills over the foil and freezes with the foil stuck inside. We  kept finding foil inside our mouths. Also, it is very hard and definitely needs to thaw out. I was disappointed with this recipe.

I made this for a potluck for my mothers of multiples group last night.  I made it and stuck it in the freezer the day before and took it out and put the cool whip and strawberries on right before I went out the door.  It stayed cold all thru our meeting which lasted about an hour and a half.  Everyone said it was really good.  I loved it as well as my 16 yr old daughter that got the last piece for breakfast this morning.  This was such a delicious and SIMPLE/EASY thing to make and I will definately be making it again.

Very good flavor. I substituted Cool Whip Free and fat free condensed milk and the recipe came out perfectly. Final product wound up being a bit too sweet, but I would probably make this again.

I have made this dish several times, and it's always popular. I even won a dessert contest at work!

I agree with the other reviewers: let it sit out just a bit before serving, just to make it easier. Also, you'll need a tad more than a tub of Cool Whip.

I  LOVE the idea of layers - definitely trying that this time!

I have tried another version of this without the strawberries and lots of whole milk and it did not turn out so great.  I was very impressed with the results of this using condensed milk.  I added golden oreos also since my daughter and I love them.  Turned out to be a big hit.

Excellent!!! Whipped it together while my wife was changing clothes and snuck it in freezer. Gave some after going out, after she changed her clothes. Point is, very little prep and finish time and she said, "WOW - EXCELLENT".

GREAT!!!  This was a perfect sumer desert.  I was worried because some reviewers said it was bland but I think there was plenty of flavor.  Made this for my boss's birthday and she and my coworkers loved it.  I will definitely  be making this again.  I wanted a good size crust so I ended up using around 18 cookies.  I might try a lighter version next time:  lite cool whip, lighter sweetened condensed milk and gramcrackers.    I took the advice of some reviewers and bought a 16 oz tub of cool whip but that was way too much.  12 oz, if you can find it, would be good.   Fabulous recipe!!!

I made this for my dad for Father's Day & he loved it! Since Oreos' are his fav cookie I crushed up extra cookies & sprinkled another layer on the top after inverting it onto a serving platter.  Also, to save a little time I sliced the fresh strawberries & threw them in a blender & pulsed them just until they were slightly mashed & juicy. It was a lot of work trying to crush them by hand! Overall fairly simple & very delicious!

Thought this was tasty and like the flavor combination of the fruit with chocolate crust.  I do have to say, that as with some other recipes made with the sweetened condensed milk, it was a bit too sweet.

Followed recipe exactly. SO GOOD! Be prepared to be eating a frozen dessert OR do what I'll do next time. Set it out about twenty minutes before serving so it has time to soften a bit.

Delicious recipe and easy to make.  This was a hit with my family.  I gave it 4 stars because you need a larger tub of Cool Whip than the 8 oz.  I used nearly 2 tubs for this b/c one tub wasn't enough for the middle and to cover it up.

I followed the directions exactly and I found that the recipe calls for way too much lemon as it took over the taste of the strawberries.

This was incredibly easy to make and was gone before I knew it! I used a chopper to finely chop the strawberries. I also used 12 cookies and an extra tub of whip cream for topping.

Oh my goodness but this is fantastic!  The recipe is great the way it is... I personally crumbled up brownies to use for the crust instead of oreos only because I didn't have any... very tasty and lite if you use reduced fat cool whip and fat-free sweetened condensed milk!

I have made this dessert twice and both times it was a big hit. Very easy to make and it tastes great--even before you freeze it! This is a great summertime treat. I'm sure I will be making this dessert again and again.

I've made this for years now! It is a great summer-time dessert with few ingredients and so fast to make.  The only change I ever make is sometimes depending on what is in season I will mix other berries in too.

Delicious! I used frozen strawberries and thawed then mashed them. Used homemade whipper cream and real vanilla extract. It took mine way longer than four hours to freeze. My family liked this better when it wasn't frozen all the way and more like mousse. I would like to try making this in an Oreo® pie crust. Filling it with the strawberry mousse then maybe adding a later of whipper cream to the top with strawberries to decorate! This was delicious and I highly recommend it!

This was fabulous!  Easy to make and no heating up my kitchen on a hot day!  I used down my frozen strawberries before we headed back north from Florida. I agree with other reviewers about increasing the Oreo and Cool-whip amounts. I used fat free versions where I could and it still tasted great to us. I'll be making this again at home. It tastes so delicious and it's so pretty that I won't mind springing for higher priced strawberries back home.

This was so good.  I made it the night by before and then simply took out out of the freezer to thaw about a half hour before serving and covered with cool whip.  Really convenient, and my family loved it.  Perfect dessert for a summer day eating out on the patio.

I used a food processor to mash the berries, and forgot to add the butter to the cookies, and it was really good, so if you want a lower fat content, emit the butter. If you make this cake, and your freezer is not very cold, maybe freeze longer than suggested. Tasted great  though, and was still fancy looking, even though it was kind of flat and spread out looking. I would make it again, quick and easy, and oh, so yummy!

Very good!  I made it for a dinner party of 8 and there was plenty.  Definitely freeze longer than 6 hours.  Overnight would be better.  I also doubled the oreos for a thicker crust.

This was a hit the first time I made it so now I make two of them because its the most requested dessert! Great for summer socials! To make it easier to prepare, pour into a ready made Oreo pie crust and freeze. I put fresh sliced strawberries on top before serving. It's better to thaw 30 min on the counter prior to serving.

Yummy tastes like ice cream cake.  I want to experiment with different flavors.  Next time I'll try to make a coffee flavored one by substituting the strawberries for coffee and kalua.  Good recipe!!

The crust enhanced this a great deal.  I tried it with frozen strawberries and again with fresh.  It's a good summer dessert but not sure I'd go with it in winter.

I'd give this 4.5 stars.  I mashed the strawberries with my (clean!) hands until they were very squishy.  I used 1/4 cup of key lime juice (all I had).  I tasted it in the bowl, it was sweet, tasted like strawberries with some key lime juice (probably could have used 1/2 cup of the key lime if I had it).  I figured that since we weren't baking it, the flavor would not change much, only absorb slightly more.  I used 2 C. real whipped cream slightly sweetened with sugar/vanilla.  This made it pretty sweet.  I think next time I'd skip the sugar and just add vanilla.  I used 12 oreos + 1 1/2 tbs butter.  When you taste it out of the freezer, it tastes like ice crystal ice cream.  Definitely let it thaw.  I wish I would have used 20 oreos for the crust, would have been better.  I'd also leave out the butter or reduce to 1/2 tbs.  I could feel the grease on my tongue after I had a bite.  Oreos have the inside portion which is creamy enough, so if they're mixed well I don't think there would be a need for butter.  Next time I will use double stuffed.

I took this to my church for the Lent service dinner and I didn't even get to taste this because everybody else loved it and ate it all!!!  But I am giving the rate of 5 since everybody else loved it.  March 5, 2010 I took this dessert to my work today and finally got to taste it.  It was good and light.  Everyobdy loved it and wanted to have the recipe.  Yummy!!!!!

This was OK the first slice, but I don't think it keeps very well in the freezer as we did not eat the whole thing right away.  It is very, very sweet.

It came out all slushy like a strawberry smoothie, and when I just tasted it, it was really bland. But I'm not sure if it was the whipping cream I used, and not the whipped cream.

This was good, but not as I thought it would be from the reviews. Seemed a bit tart.. maybe it was the strawberries or too much lemon juice?? I'll have to try it again in the summer w/ fresh strawberries from the fields, picked at the peak of freshness! :o)

have made this twice in the past month and have had no left overs either time! i had to use a few more than 8 cookies. also, if you use a store bought whipped topping, add about a tsp or so of vanilla flavoring to it to give it that homemade taste. on one, i put a layer of sliced strawberries before putting the oreos on for an extra suprise. really good! make sure you do it early so it has enough time to freeze and set.

Friends and family loved it. I would recommend getting the large tub of Cool Whip. Also, the recipe calls for eight oreo cookies. I recommend two or three more with a half tablespoon more of butter, gives you a little more crust.

I've made this twice now.  The first time using a store brand whipped topping; it was super runny before freezing.  The second time I made this, I used real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip (about 1 cup of whipping cream makes 2 cups of whipped topping), and this wasn't nearly as runny before I put it in the freezer.  Make sure your strawberries are quite ripe and crush easily, my berries were in large chunks and were really hard to cut through when frozen.  I love this recipe!

I used frozen blueberries and I didn't mash them.  I put it in the freezer for 5 hours and it was just right, not too frozen, not too soft.  I think I'd like to try peaches next.

Very good summer dessert!  I needed another recipe to use up strawberries we picked.  This is a keeper.  I was pressed for time and wasn't really using this for company (just for the kids), so I pressed whole oreos into the top instead of crushed.  I also just sliced the dessert and put a dollup of cool whip on top instead of frosting the entire thing.

I agree, this was a HUGE hit. I made it for easter. There were NO leftovers.  I did change one thing however, I am not a big chocolate fan so I used vanilla sandwich cookies (or golden oreos) instead.  A friend made it for us when we went RV camping this Memorial, and she used regular oreos.  I much prefer the goldens!

This was easy to make and tasty. I threw it all but the whipped cream in the food processor and folded in the whipped cream. I didn't have oreos so I used a package of graham crackers. Very good recipe, will make again.

Good but not great. It's super easy to make but he biggest problem I had was that if you serve it after being frozen it's rock hard. You need to thaw it out so it's softer but not too soft it gets soupy. Its flavor is good, it tastes just like strawberry ice cream. If you were to take a chocolate crumb bottom and add softened strawberry ice cream as the filling, freeze it,  and then decorate the top with cool whip and strawberries when serving it would taste the same way and be softer when serving. I think next time I will try it that way.

I followed recipe exactly and it was perfect. The only thing i didn't like about it was you only need a couple of sliced strawberries for the top or too hard to cut. I will always make 2 of these at a time because everyone loves it!

I have made this twice and both times it came out wonderful.  Just as a side note, the second time I made this I ran out of lemon juice and so I used half lemon juice and half lime juice and the flavor was a little more tangy and a refreshing twist.  This happy accident will happen again.

I've made this several times, to rave reviews each time.  People at work are still asking for it weeks later.  I made this right at the begining of strawberry season, and it was heavenly.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Used foil loaf pans, and they popped right out after sitting for a few minutes.

This was absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds. I'm going to have to make it again this week. This is an excellent summer dessert and one that can be made ahead of time so the cook can relax a little too. The only change I made is using 10 OREO cookies instead of 8.

I made this for Easter and it was a great hit with the kids! Only change I would make is to add a touch of red food coloring to the strawberry mix so it looks pink instead of off-white. This is a keeper!

I have made this dessert a few times and it's delicious! The last time I made it I used fat free condensed milk which definately tasted different but good. I will stick to the full fat version. This dessert is light and perfect for summer.

This was very good. I used more oreos than it called for and I had a hard time removing it from the pan but overall it was great.
