I thought this was really good! It was an easy and quick lunch using things I always have on hand.  I did add extra hot sauce to my bowl, but I think the recipe is intended to have a mild flavor so people can adjust the spiciness to their liking.  I would make this one again!

Not bad.  I wish I had added more hot sauce than called for.
I will definitely have to try the nachos mentioned in the footnotes, those sound even better.

Made into nacho's as the footnotes mention and these were good. They needed more pepper sauce than the recipe called for in my opinion to make them true buffalo flavored but other than that this was perfect. Stick them under the broiler for a few minutes in the end to get that nice brown crust you know you love!
