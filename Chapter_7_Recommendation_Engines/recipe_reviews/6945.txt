This dough is delightful to work with.  I kneeded in flour until it was like pizza dough.  Very pliable.  Don't try making large crescents with this dough, as they won't cook properly on the inside.  Kids loved them.

Dough was very easy to work with, but seemed rather dry after baking...

While these were very good, they reminded me of the "cookies" my mother used to make with any leftover pie crust scraps.  Granted, these were much prettier than pastry scraps sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, but the taste is similar enough that I don't know that I'll ever make them again.

Tender and slightly sweet, but rich enough that you can resist having several at a time. I selected this recipe for my eight year-old daughter to have charge over while I was doing other Thanksgiving baking. The simple ingredients and preparation made it perfect for her to handle.

I followed this recipe exactly and they were scrumptious. Make sure you roll the dough evenly and that they are uniform in size. Otherwise they won't bake evenly. Permanent addition to my recipe box. Thank you Carol!!
