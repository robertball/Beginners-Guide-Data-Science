I love these! Quick, easy, great for kids to help out with. I only changed one thing. I added 1/4 brown sugar and only 3/4 white sugar. Cookies came out very soft and chewy and stayed that way for days. Delicious!

I made this recipe last Christmas.  It is really a great kid-friendly recipe that my kids and I made together.  I added more nutmeg than in the recipe.  I would make it again, I think I would just doctor it up a bit. :)

Tasty little guys! I thought I would try this recipe as is, but I think that little extra spice and sugar the others mentioned would have made an already great cookie even better.

These were sooo good.  I omited the cinnimon and nutmeg and added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice!  They were wonderful!!

These are really good, and so easy to make, too! I took the suggestions of the other reviewers and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, and I also added more nutmeg. They go great with an afternoon cup of tea!

These were pretty good.  My husband didn't care for them at all.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp of nutmeg (per other reviewers) and wish I wouldn't have.  I did use both brown and white sugar which I think was a good call.  Worth a try.

These are good, and easy.  However, seems to be missing something.  Probably a good idea to follow other reviewers suggestions to add more spices or use brown sugar.  The only 2 changes I made were to use tub margarine (I don't keep butter as I can't have it) and rolled the cookies in sugar prior to baking.  I like the rolling in sugar, but I'd recommend not using tub margarine--too soft!  Thanks for the recipe.

These smelled pretty good in the oven, but they came out rock hard and I followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little disappointed.  I spread cream cheese frosting between them and made little sandwiches which made them a little better, but overall I was sad.

I used this recipe because I wanted to send my grandparents some Christmas cookies.  They always have their tea-time and I thought this recipe sounded perfect for them.  After baking ( which put the most wonderful aroma into the house ) my husband and I tried one ( which turned into three, each ) and now I am definitely going to bake some more batches!  This recipe will surely be a favorite of mine for years to come.

I love these! I think I might actually like the chilled dough better than the final cookies. So yummy!
