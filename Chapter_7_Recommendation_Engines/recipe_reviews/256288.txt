This turned out excellent and was so easy. I never had corn pudding before, but saw the recipe on Chef John's website before Thanksgiving and made it as one of our side dishes exactly as written.  On the video, he recommends using a blender to break up the corn as much as possible.  My blender was broken and I did the best I could with my old food processor to break up the corn, but ended up with plenty of fairly large sized kernel skins. Although it tasted wonderful, the skins didn't enhance the texture IMO. Despite that, the pudding turned out so creamy and moist -almost delicate- even with a lovely browned crust.  It just barely held its shape as it was scooped out of the pan, and fell apart in the mouth.  It would taste great with a summer BBQ and anytime really.

I made this exactly as written.  It was delicious.  Everyone at the table was crazy for it.  I had never made or eaten corn pudding and I'm glad I found this recipe.  It has been copied to my recipe book and will make regular appearances at my dinner table.  If you like corn this recipe is for you!

I made this and it turned out perfectly and exactly the way John shows in his video.  It tasted very good too. That being said, the ingredients with heavy (whipping) cream, butter, six eggs, 4 cups of corn, well, its expensive and calorie dense!   This dish although delicious, is simply not worth the effort and cost.  All I really needed was some corn bread and that costs 10 times less and the taste is as satisfying.   This is the only reason this is rated as 4 vs 5.  I think eggs, butter, and whipping cream are better reserved for a fancy soup or deserts.  I wont be making this again for that reason.

Terrible. So salty! I used 3 tsps kosher salt as directed. It should also be specified if unsalted butter was used.

I just made it! Delicious! I added three spoons of brown sugar to the mix; I like it sweet and it turned out just perfect.
Even though it is definitely calorie dense it feels light and fluffy.

This took me back to my grandmother's corn pudding. It was so creamy and delicious. I used a 9 x 13 pan without the pad and it turned out fine. The pudding took about 65 minutes to brown and set. Will make again next Thanksgiving.

Universally enjoyed at Thanksgiving dinner. I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream to reduce the saturated fat given my heart history.

This was delish! Chef John is right, it tastes very corny. Delightful comfort food. Made it with fresh sweet corn. Husbie liked it. We will try a savory version next. Thank, Chef John!

My first time making corn pudding.  My blender wasn't big enough so I had to blend in two batches.  It wasn't as sweet as other corn puddings I've had, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  I might up the maple syrup a little next time for comparison.  Even though it's rich, it turned out very light and fluffy.

I moved to NC this year and have had corn pudding a few times since.  I love it, but hadn't made it myself.   I chose this recipe for Thanksgiving  to be a new addition to the holiday spread and, while it was very tasty, it was too egg-y for my liking.  The texture and flavor was very reminiscent of scrambled eggs and not quite what I was looking for.  I would not make this again as is.  I'd either just try a different recipe or put probably 2 fewer eggs in it.

Loved this and so did everyone at the thanksgiving table! 
Some changes:
 Due to some poor inventory management, I made this without the maple syrup and had to sub the baking powder for a mix of baking soda and lemon juice. 
I also used an immersion blender instead of adding everything to a blender.
I also baked this in my toaster oven in an 8x8 which made the top closer to the top of the oven, next time I would bake it at a lower temp so the top didnâ€™t brown so quickly.

The resounding comment was, itâ€™s so corn-y! This isnâ€™t the same as cornbread, the flavor of grinding the corn results in an incredible corn flavor. In my opinion this was plenty sweet without maple syrup and Iâ€™d add more salt and cayenne next time. 100% would make again!

I made a 1/2 recipe for a side for 6 at Thanksgiving dinner. I baked it in an 8x8 pan. It cooked up well and was delicious.  It was sweet and creamy.  We ate every bite, and my son called me for the recipe. I added some corn kernels as in the Chef's notes and liked the addition.

I made the pudding the day before and kept it in the refrigerator overnight. I baked with the other casseroles on Thanksgiving day. I did not have a baking sheet under it due to other dishes being in the oven at the same time. That was not a problem.

I made a 1/2 recipe in 9x9" dish and it was wonderful!  My husband gave it a 2 thumbs up to have it again and told me to take it to our church holiday pot luck!  
The only change I made, since I didn't have 'heavy' cream was to use 1/2 and 1/2 cream instead.  It may have taken a little longer to bake/set, but it tasted wonderful.

I made this as written, using just a tad less salt. But even with 2 Â½ tsp. of coarse kosher salt, it was a bit too salty (and I love salt!),  and not sweet or creamy enough for my taste.

So easy and delicious, it tops all the other recipes.  Better in blender than food processor, which can't hold all the ingredients.

I make this every Thanksgiving by popular request! When I first brought it, I got some raised eyebrows, but it was the only dish that had zero leftovers after the meal, so the results speak for themselves. Last year, I had to use artificial maple syrup instead of the real deal, and no one seemed to notice the difference.

Wow, can't believe I have to resubmit this now, terrible website. Fix your bugs!

Anyway. The original recipe is good, but with slight modifications you can save a little more money, reduce the fat/saturated fat and increase the serving size to 1/12. Tastes exactly the same IMO, and I'm picky.

*Substitute 0.5 cups of Whole Milk and 1.5 cups of Heavy Cream with 2 cups of Half-&-Half.
*Substitute 0.5 cups (1 stick) of butter with 0.5 cups of your preferred butter substitute. I used a stick from a box of $0.99 "Imperial" brand margarine. It said "great for baking!" on the box but is also just really good.

I also substituted a 50/50 blend of agave nectar and maple syrup that I found at Trader Joe's, but you don't have to and I didn't think about it when I did the following calculation:

Serving Size: 1/12 output (2" x 4.5" piece from a 9"x13" tray)
21.00% DV reg fat
38.67% DV sat fat
17.50% DV carbs

This is my first time to have corn pudding, so I have no idea how it compares to other recipes. For me, the taste was too corny, and the texture  was weird - I kinda felt like I was eating baby food. BUT ... it was super easy to make and my guests liked it quite a bit, so I can't really rare it poorly based on the fact I just may not like corn pudding. :)

I loved this. I've never made corn pudding before. The recipe came out perfect. One note though-I measured carefully, and this was too much for my 8x11 pan, so i poured the rest of the batter in a smaller casserole dish and it was full as well. It probable
