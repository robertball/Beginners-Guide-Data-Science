It turned out great! I used sharp shredded cheese instead of processed cheese; about 3 big handfuls and it turned out awesome! I also didn’t process my asparagus and I liked the chunks. To each their own though. :)

Made as written and this turned out good. It's a little too salty thanks to the Velveeta so be sure and use low sodium chicken broth.

Made the recipe as directed, but forgot to add the cream. My husband is recovering from oral surgery so have been preparing a lot of homemade soup. This was a tasty change from the numerous broth based soups I’d been making.

I used half as much cheese as the recipe called for. I also used a premium cheddar cheese and about 2lbs of asparagus. Turned out amazing!

I think Velveeta is an inferior choice so I substituted equal portions of medium cheddar and mozza with garlic/herbs.  A real crowd pleaser.
