This is EXCELLENT. I made this right as I got home from the store today, using my own homemade dry ranch seasoning and doubling both the green onions AND fresh minced garlic (personal preferance, not a reflection of the recipe). I've been eating on this all afternoon, dipping both baby carrots and sliced cucumbers in it. This is one of the best ranch dips I've ever had.

Yummy Ranch Dip with a spicy kick.  I've had this recipe in my box for a while and finally made it.  I've made it again since my first batch.  Please note the recipe calls for "1 canned" chipotle pepper NOT 1 can of chipotle peppers as I almost did.  The first batch I made as written using 1 pepper.  The second time I added 2 1/2 peppers.  I think my can must have been pretty mild as it took the 2 1/2 peppers to get the added kick to the dip.  Although when I make it again with a new can, I will start with 1 pepper.  It definitely gets a little warmer after it is refrigerated overnight.  This dip is great and I know I will be making it many times over the summer.  It was also VERY tasty on a baked potato. I like that it uses light mayo and sour cream.  Thanks *Sherri* for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper.

Heads up!  This is NOT your ordinary (read boring) vegetable dip! What a creative and delicious blend of seasonings! I so wanted to try this but in deference to Hubs’ sensitive innards I had to modify it just a bit – I used just a teensy bit of chipotle chili powder and a drop of liquid smoke to simulate the chipotle chili.  Loved the chipotle/ranch combo as well as the addition of FRESH green onion and garlic rather than powdered or dried.  The lime juice was a unique plus, adding both freshness and flavor.  All and all it is a delicious dip, with all seasonings balanced, and will certainly get your guests to ask, “Hmmm, this is so delicious!  What’s in it?”

This was really good. I took the seeds out of my pepper and it was still plenty spicy! I used homemade ranch mix that had a lot of garlic powder in it, so the added garlic was too much, but that was my fault :). I used low fat mayonnaise and sour cream and served it with broccoli, thanks Sherri! BTW, if you refrigerate this overnight it gets even spicier! I had a hard time eating this the second day, yikes!

This is so good! Just made it and I added all of the sauce from the can and I seeded my peppers. I keep wanting to add more but don't want it to get too spicy after it sits a while. I also used more sour cream then mayo. So so good!

I'm so happy I tried this recipe we eat it with everything, chicken, sandwiches, salad, quesadillas, eggs, rice… We can't get enough of this spicy delicious heavenly dip. I make a batch every Monday.
Oh almost forgot I use the whole mini can of chipotles, turns out so spicy it makes us cry sometimes haha

Great recipe!  I loved the taste.  I made mine with the heavy mayo and sour cream, I don't like to skimp when it comes to flavor :)  Delicious!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years and it's always a huge hit. I love recipe more! The only thing I changed is I used 4 ounces regular mayo and 12 ounces fat free Greek yogurt instead of light mayo and light sour cream. As other reviewers have mentioned, the chipotles will vary in heat from can to can. I blend the chipotles in the food processor and add 1 teaspoon at a time until I get the perfect amount of heat, usually around 2 tablespoons. Freeze the rest in an ice cube tray for next time!

This is a tasty combo that utilizes ingredients most have in their pantry.  I did not add extra garlic as the brand of ranch dip seasonings we use is heavy on the garlic and I also didn't measure the lime, just used half the juice of a medium lime. One pepper wasn't enough for us heat wise but definitely start with one and then taste.  For those sensitive to heat but like the chipotle flavor, start with a half pepper.  We tried this with vegetables and it was way to heavy but on turkey burgers, it was very tasty.  We'll use this as an alternative to just flavored sour cream in some Mexican dishes and think it would be great on chili.

I used the seasonings for the homemade buttermilk ranch that I have been making for this recipe. I scaled it down to about 1/2 a cup or a little less of mayo/greek yogurt blend and used a whole, small chipotle. It was just about the perfect amount. Minced it was about 1-1.5 tsp. I didn't have any green onions so I added a pinch of onion powder. Very good on our burgers.

It's amazing what a few simple additions can do to a basic dip.  I used 1 part lite mayo and 2 parts fat-free sour cream (our personal preference) and a homemade dry ranch mix.  A touch of milk and it was perfect for dipping tortilla chips.

I followed this recipe to the tee....it was WONDERFUL!   We used it as a dip with chicken strips and also used it as a salad dressing.  This one is a keeper!

This dip was literally ready in 15 minutes! It was fabulous with a tray of fresh raw veggies and even tasted great on tortilla chips!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe, Sherri!

Delish. I ended up using 3-4 peppers but they were small.

Family and loved this. I don’t know if it was kind of chipotle in adobo that got, but, had a smokier flavor than anticipated, but was still delish!

I made this recipe to a T using one chipotle pepper in adobe sauce. I was looking for a southwest salad dressing because I love chopped bagged salads from the grocery, but I don't like the dressings.  I chopped white cabbage, purple cabbage, green onions, cilantro,  carrots, and tossed in some rinsed and drained black beans and corn. Also, I put in some sunflower seeds along with cranberries.  This salad was the bomb.  It took FOREVER, but I made so much I will have it for days.  Only add this dressing when I eat it, so it keeps well.  I'm thinking you could add something to this dip to make it more watery like salad dressing.  I had enough moisture in my salad I didn't really need it.  I'm thinking maybe some buttermilk or something along those lines.

A good dip. I used 3/4 nonfat yogurt and 1/4 light sour cream to cut down on the fat (also, I am not a mayo fan). I ended up tripling the chipotle peppers, and it was still very mild; I will probably add more chipotle to the leftovers.  It makes a nice dressing for a southwestern salad.

Definitely will make it again. 
I am not really a spicy hot food tolerant person but I put in 2 Chipotle peppers an added about 3 tablespoons of the adobo sauce. 
Very good. 
We use it on our fish tacos an anything else it sounds good with.

I didn't have any green onions so I added a little onion powder instead. I also didn't have any lime juice so I was going to add lemon juice instead but after taste testing it without the juice I decided it was yummy just the way it was.  It's a little salty so maybe I will try it with a homemade ranch seasoning next time instead of store bought. 
Overall a very good dip.
