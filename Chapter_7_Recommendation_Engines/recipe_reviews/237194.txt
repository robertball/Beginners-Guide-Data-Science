The only change I made was to grill the pork chops rather than cook them on stovetop. The onions were really good done that way but I felt that the mustard sauce was missing something---I can't really put my finger on what it was. It could be that the onion wasn't really sharp enough to add the needed flavor that I thought it needed. Maybe I've been eating too many full-flavored foods lately! We did enjoy our dinner tonight so thanks Shelbylyn!

Tried this tonight following recipe exactly. It was different for sure but not impressive. The sauce is ok but Dijon mustard is the flavor that stands out the most. I don't like onions so I didn't try them husband and son said they were ok. It was something different from our usual menu but not likely to make it again.
