I am so disappointed in this recipe. Not to mention the money I spent on cheese, milk, chicken broth and the cauliflower. The rest of the ingredients are relatively inexpensive. I ended up with a very big pot of a tasteless 'soup'. I added more spices and seasonings and then it was somewhat edible but the texture was that of grainy grits. If I could give this recipe a negative rating, I would do so.
