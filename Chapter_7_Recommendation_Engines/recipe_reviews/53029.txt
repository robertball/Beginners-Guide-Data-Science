I find that this recipe has too many ingredients. The typical spanish tortilla only consists of potatoes, onion, garlic and eggs.

The way I make this dish, I give it 5 stars, but the way this recipe is written, only 4.  The good thing about Tortilla de Patata is that there are as many different ingredient varieties as you like.  You can put in whatever you please.  It is good for breakfast, lunch or supper.  Sometimes I put a package of thawed chopped broccoli in mine, or I caramalize some onions to serve on top. I have added crumbled cooked sausage or bacon.  After I remove it from the oven and flip it onto the serving plate, I put a layer of shredded cheese (usually cheddar, but pepperjack would be good or whatever you like) on the top and allow it to melt. I like to serve it with a simple salad and some crusty bread.  Yummy!

Overall I feel this spanish tortilla contained all the flare of what an authentic "patata" demands: a delicious dichotomy of chrispy outershell and soft center. Recommendations: I suggest this spanish delicacy be enjoyed along with a toasted bagget with a spoonful of mayonnaise!

Although this can taste good is not really a Spanish Tortilla, keep it simple and will taste better.

I guess I'm rating the version of this that I made rather than this specific recipe though mine's not too far off.  I combined the suggestions of reviewers plus the other recipes for this on this site.  I sauteed an onion until nearly carmelized, then added one red bell & one yellow bell.  Sauteed until soft then added 5 yellow/yukon potatoes, sliced.  Sauteed over medium heat, stirring often but keeping covered to steam potatoes.  When they were done, I added 5 beaten eggs that had a splash of milk and a handful of cheddar cheese mixed in, let it set, flipped it, and let it finish.  My flipping needs work-may put it under the broiler next time.  It turned out fantastic!  Had wonderful flavor, a nice light supper with fruit and we will make it often!  Thanks for the recipe and all the suggestions!

This is not anywhere near authentic.  You need to encorporate the vegetables in the tortilla/"Pie"  this is one of the MAGIC dishes in Spain, I have visited there a number of times buying horses and get deep into their culture--they whip this dish out "TOOTS SWEET" I have tried it a number of times(9) at home and can get close but it always lacks some flavor in comparison the great ones in spain.  This is also missing Paprika which is the MOST important spice in spain

Fairly good recipe, but I think you should really not call it a Spanish Tortilla, as people get anal about these things! It works better with the potatoes diced and boiled first not fried (just 6oz not 6 potatoes!) 5 eggs and 1/2 cup of sour cream (no water) and also use olive oil not butter and no bacon drippings - then it is more like the real thing.

In the region of Spain I lived in, they wouldn't be caught dead using butter, they considered it a French concept.  For a more authentic (and healthy) recipe, use oil 
Thanks for posting, Monica!

I am Spanish. Sorry but this is not a Spanish tortilla at all, basically because it should never be baked, it should be cooked on a skillet on one side, flipped using a plate and cooked on the other side being able to cook it inside without burning the outside. I know this flipping part is what makes most non Spanish to feel nervous about, but that's the way it is. It is a matter of practice. Some other reviews also pointed the butter.... Yes, we never use butter but vegetable oil. The traditional tortilla de patatas is just made with eggs, potatoes and onions but as it is a national dish each family has  their own twist, adding fresh parsley, bell pepper, mushrooms... I knew a family that even added tuna fish in it which is kind of crazy even for me..And the trick on a good tortilla de patatas is that it should have  only the right amount of eggs to keep it together but not being too eggy, the right amount of oil to keep it moist and rich inside. Looks complicated but it is not. It is a matter of trying and adjusting up to the day you are an expert. Have a try!!

Excellent dish- we made it on the stovetop and then put it under the broiler until it was done.  Reminds me of my time in Spain- delicious.
