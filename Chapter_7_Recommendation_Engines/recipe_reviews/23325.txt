I made these pretty thin to get a really crispy outcome.  I also used cookie cutters instead of cutting in triangles.  Yummy crispy spice cookie!

I just have to add to this rating (7/2/06) - I've made this cookie more than 10 times and EVERY time I'm asked for the recipe, and not one person dislikes it.  It's such an unusual flavor.  They are terrific plain, and I've also painted them with colored chocolate.
