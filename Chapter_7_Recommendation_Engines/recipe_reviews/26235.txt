These cookies were really good!  They had a great taste and stayed soft and chewy after cooling!  I tried making this recipe with other cake mixes and without the strawberries and they still tasted great!

My mother in law makes this wonderful strawberry cake that looks horrible but the taste is out of the world. These cookies taste JUST like that cake! Wonderful recipe! Very easy to make and very easy to eat! Thank you!

these were so good! I cooked them on parchment and did not add grease to the pan that helped give them a little more solid bottom! So moist it was like eating cake, only I could do it in the car picking kids up from shcool!

My kids were dying for a strawberry cookie.  This site did not have much of a selection.  We tried these and the flavor was good, but the appearance - awful.  They flattened out like pancakes.  After cooling, I put them in a Ziploc bag.  They all stuck together, I had to peel them off one another - strange.  I added more flour to the end batches and had some success on the appearance.

After reading the reviews, I cut the egg to 1 and put in 1 1/2 cups of cool whip, the dough was thick, put a small slice of strawberry on the top of the cookie and baked for about 15-17 mins, they were delicious!  The recipe was quick and easy.

I followed the recipe using duncan hines strawberry supreme cake mix, except I used frozen strawberries and no whipped cream. The dough is very sticky and the cookies puff up in the oven, making the  cookies too cakey. I think whats missing is butter or oil. Also if you use this recipe, I'd make the cookies smaller so they cook all the way thru.

These are great 'old fashioned' cake-like cookies.  They will spread quite a bit, so if you want small 'normal' sized cookies, use a tsp.  I let mine spread out and then use a heart shaped cookie cutter to make them look prettier.  Kids love them and they are really simple.  (I have also used Cool Whip instead of the real cream with fine results.)

I made this as directed for a bridal shower. Except I poured the batter into a large jelly roll pan (15" i think) and baked for about 15 min. Then after cooling for 5 min in the pan, I used a heart shaped cookie cutter (about 3") to cut out about 18 hearts. It made less than I expected and they were kind of fragile. This was very easy! I will probably make again and just drop by spoonful onto the sheet.

Amazing!  I did add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and topped them off with some chocolate sprinkles!  I took them to work for Valentine's day and they were a hit!

Came out pretty well. After reading everyones reviews I did add 1 tablespoon of veggie oil. Also I made sure to refrigerate my batter prior to cooking.  After the first batch I decided they were too weak and added 1/2 cup of flour and they turned out perfect.

Ummmm, I have no idea what everyone else was doing, but I followed the recipe to the T and got EXCELLENT results.  Mine weren't sticky, fluffed up perfectly, and tasted great. I used Duncan Haynes (sp?) strawberry cake mix, 2 regular eggs, sugar free cool whip, and fresh strawberries.  I don't understand the flattening like a pancake part and the stickiness...  Anyway, they were a hit at my party and the only downside is that they were a little ugly.. but next time I'll just mold them a little better. : )

I used fat free Cool Whip instead of whipped cream.  These cookies turned out pretty much like I expected them to- a sticky, cake-like cookie.  They are very good, but not out-of-this-world good.  They are super quick and easy to make, and a good way to use extra strawberries!

Very Yummy cookies!!! I used 2 tbsp of oil & 1 & 1/2 cups cool whip and added just a little powdered sugar and they turned out wonderful. Just for fun I decorated with cream cheese frosting & sprinkles. Will definitely make again.

Thought these would be unique and great for a bake sale.....The first batch ended up in the trash...could not get them to cook all the way through.  Next batch I cooked 20 minutes and they are finally done, but golden brown....Not what I was wanting at all...........the dough tastes wonderful, but very disappointing.

After reading the reviews, I added some extra flour, and a half a stick of butter to try to stop them from flattening.  But they still did.  The taste was good, but I just couldn't get past the flatness.

I'm not much of a strawberry flavour person, but these were delicious. Only down-side was that mine turned out rather sticky.

Substituted white cake mix for strawberry, and used them as the shells for strawberry lemonade whoopie pies. Came out pretty well, but the cookies are a little stickier than I would've liked for this.

I am going to lovingly refer to this recipe as the crunchberry cookie recipe!  These look and taste exactly like crunchberries.  I followed the recipe exactly and as I always do I baked them on a silicon baking sheet.  I had no issues.  Good cookies, I'm probably going to dip them in the left over whipped cream that I didn't use in the recipe.

I was really disappointed when I finished the "cookies."  I thought the idea was fun, but after following the recipe exactly, the mix wasn't thick enough and they spread all over the pan.  I had to add more to it to make them stay, and they were basically cookie shaped pieces of cake.  I ended up with half of them left on my finger 'cause the tops were super sticky.  Maybe that's how they were intended to be, but I feel like I should have just made a cake, lol.

These had excellent flavor but were very gooey and sticky. Not sure if I just needed to bake them longer or if it was because I used fat free cool whip (maybe a little of both).

These didn't turn out for me for some reason.  I baked them for a lot longer than what the recipe called for and they were still soggy and mushy.  The flavor was okay, but texture was bad.  I probably will not try again.

I'm sorry, but these were not that good.  I followed the directions to a tee, but they never seemed to firm up (even after cooking them for much longer than the time suggested).  I realize they are a "cake" type cookie, but these turned out more like a goo type cookie.  And the taste was really nothing to rave about.

Really easy and very yummy!  I would suggest baking them for 10-12 minutes if you live in a high altitude state.  My first batch turned out gooey but after baking them for a little longer, they were great!

Nope. This recipe is flawed. Cookies came out looking similar to the way they went in. If anything this is a base recipe, I will add oil, perhaps more whipped cream. Try recipe in private first, not for guest.

I was amazed with the idea of baking strawberry cookies. I have gathered all the ingredients in correct proportions. My enthusiasm died away when I took the cookies out of oven. They were muffin-fluffy and unicorn pink in color. The texture was off and it almost tasted like strawberry flavored cough medicine. I and my fiance (who has a sweet tooth) did not like the cookies at all. They ended up in the trashcan.

These are so good! I'm totally making this again.They have so much flavor. The only downside to the cookies are that they are really flat. I added 1 cup of flour, more whipped cream and more strawberries(frozen strawberries).They melt in your mouth. Really sweet. I love them!!!!!!!!!!!!

I loved the cake cookies.  I added more fresh strawberries and topped them with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious.

Ehhhh. The batter tastes good and the end product has a decent flavor, but I wouldn't call them cookies. They come out more like muffins or cupcakes. Disappointed only because they weren't what I was hoping for.

These are pretty good in taste, but they bake really thin and look funny.  I put some icing on top and a small piece of strawberry to make them look a little better.  Very easy to make.

I only used the cake mix and eggs out of the recipe, and they turned out fine for me.  I sprinkled on some green sugar since I made these for Christmas, and everybody loved them.  
Will definitly make other flavors!

These were good, but not spectacular.  I will try again, maybe with more strawberries.
