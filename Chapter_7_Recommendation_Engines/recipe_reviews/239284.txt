Followed recipe exactly. Came out delicious! Custard-like, fruity, but not too sweet. Great for breakfast. Will add more pear next time.

Yummy!  I changed my previous 4 star rating to 5 stars.  Followed recipe exactly except I started the cooking at 425 for the first 7 minutes then turned it down to 400 for the last 23 minutes.

Baked it in cast iron skillet. Needed ~10 minutes extra cooking time. Substituted one thinly sliced apple for pear.

This basic German pancake recipe is a very nice twist using Pears. I diced 3 large pears because I like fruit in every bite. That's the only change I made. I will make this again. It's easy and so yummy!

I made this in a 9x13, so I increased the butter to a stick.  I used a can of sliced Peaches because it is winter in MN.  I increased the flour to 1.5 cups and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, I would even increase to 1 tsp of baking powder.  I would make this recipe this way again and again.  It was perfect.  Sometimes the oven pancake dish can be too custardy for my liking.

This was an oily flan- like floppy concoction. I followed the recipe to a tee and it just isn't something I find at all palatable.

This was very good but the lemon juice hid the pear taste.  Will make it with half the lemon juice next time.

This was most excellent.  The texture inside it was wonderful and it rose really well in the oven.  There was a good ratio of pear to pancake.  It was a little on the sugary side, and I will consider reducing the vanilla little bit next time.
I followed the recipe, but I did take out the eggs and milk to get to room temperature before starting.  I also halved the recipe and cooked it in a 9 inch pie plate.   Make sure you warm the dish in the oven as instructed or it will not rise properly.

I have an over-abundance of pears so I whipped this up. This taste good. I started it on top of the stove and finished under the broiler. Done in under 10 minuets.  Oh yeah. Should mention. I used commercial pancake mix to save time. No one was any the wiser.

used 3 pears instead of 2 and doubled the vanilla.  Perfect!  My family loved this and kids asked to make this a "do-over"

I had a few ripe pears so I looked for a brunch recipe to use them in.  This skillet pancake was perfect.  Very eggy and rich, I'll definitely make it again.  The only change I made was I added a dash of nutmeg to the batter.  Next time I may use less sugar in the pear mixture to allow even more of the fresh flavor to come through. This one's a winner for me!

I had just 2 pears and the oven going. Thought I try it. Very good and easy to make. I served it with maple syrup (homemade). Give it a try!

Excellent - was a great brunch dish and enjoyed by all.  Only change I made was to use peaches instead of pears, because that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again and next time will try it with the pears.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

awesome! I added a little cardamom to the batter and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top instead of sugar, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. my pears rose to the top of the batter during cooking so it didn't look anything like a pancake, but very delicious. definitely making this again.

This is an easy and delicious breakfast.  I love that it was a great use of pears from our tree, so I admit I used more pears than requested in the recipe and am very glad I did. I prefer the pancake to be very fruity.  The lemon zest gives it a nice boost, that makes it very flavorful.
