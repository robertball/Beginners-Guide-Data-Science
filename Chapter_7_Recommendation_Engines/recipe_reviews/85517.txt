Don't let anyone sway you from trying this recipe.  My mother was born and raised in Russia, I have friends here in the U.S. who are immigrants from the Ukraine and every one of them makes their borscht a little differently.  If you are on a quest for "authentic" borscht like it is the holy grail, good luck - there are many interpretations.  I tried this one because I am not pigeonholed into one type.  An open mind will yield many good things.  This was an EXCELLENT dish.  Very clean, very delicious.  It has that ethnic taste you are looking for when you want borscht.  Who cares what it's called?  I loved it and will make it again and again.  Thank you for sharing this!

Don't even bother.  This is NOT borscht.  I lived in Ukraine and Russia, and married a native Ukrainian.  If you're looking for authentic Russian borscht, keep looking and pass this one by.

Well, either the little old lady from Turkey bought the "Moosewood Cookbook" by Mollie Katzen, or Mollie borrowed the recipe from the little old lady. In any event, this is the Russian Cabbage Borscht recipe from the "Moosewood Cookbook" (with some minor variations) and, I agree, it is delicious.

This is the MOST AWESOME and the most delicious Borcht that I have ever tasted, such a brilliant recipe.  The cider vinegar and the little bit of honey, really does give it something special! Well done, it tastes just like my grandma and grandpa would make!! Well done and thanks! Cheers, Kate

Being Russian myself I have a courage to say this is a great borscht recipe with Russian flavor. Believe me. Remember the main thing: there is not the one authentic borscht recipe, every single family make this dish on its own way. There are thousand variations and interpretations of this dish. We have the main ingredients - beets, cabbage (not exactly red, you can easily use a regular white cabbage), potatoes, carrots and onions. And then use your imagination. Some people make borscht using pork or beef, some add mushrooms, I`ve heard of even adding prunes. As to this recipe I would change the proportions a little just for my taste. I would use 1 1/2 cups beets, only one large onion and less tomato puree (tomatoes are optional but the borscht will be tastier). Don`t substitute cumin for caraway seeds. Cumin has an oriental flavor that can ruin Russian flavor in borscht. If you don`t have caraway seeds just omit them, they are optional. And definitely serve the borscht with sour cream, very traditional. The borscht consistency ends on your personal preference, if you prefer thick, add less water or more vegetables, if you prefer watery, add more water. So if you want to try Russian borscht, this is a great recipe to start.

I'd never made Borscht before, but my Russian fiance was begging me to give it a try.  So, I made this recipe and he LOVED it.  
I did add some beef and change the veggie broth/water to beef broth.  I also put in red wine instead of cider vinegar.  Lastly, I used chopped steamed tomatoes instead of pureed tomatoes because I like the texture better.  And I probably put in way more dill than it called for.  
It was amazing.

For those of you who have trouble with your beets still being hard, try grating the beets for the soup rather than dicing them, that's how my Baba did it.

I made this and loved it.  It was my first time making borscht also but I've eaten plenty and this rates with the best.  The dill and caraway really make the flavour - I left out the honey and didn't miss it.  There's probably a different borscht recipe for every town in eastern Europe.  Who cares?  It's the taste that matters!

This is a really yummy soup.  Hearty, flavorful- who cares if it's not "authentic"?  I've traveled in Russia and several republics and it had just the taste I remember, except a little thicker (I did add some more liquid to this one) and sweeter.  I didn't have caraway seeds, so that might have given it a nice pungent offset to the sweet.  I would probably just put in a teaspoon of honey or no honey if you've got nice, fresh beets and cabbage.  I used Hungarian paprika to season it and that was very nice.

Easy and delicious.  I didn't have any tomato puree so I left it out.  The only thing I would do differently is dice the beets, potatos, carrots, and celery so that the pieces are all close to the same size, rather than thinly slicing some and chopping others.

Guys, I am Russian and I would say this recipe is ..eeeh..kind of ..just sounds like a Borscht, but...you know...I will try to add the original recipe in my recipe list in the next few days. Guys, I wanna tell you what! Make sure your borscht is red if its a red version, has enough garlic, herbs and lots of meat (if its not a vegetarian version). Make it out of pork short ribs previously baked up in an oven for 10-15 minutes! Add some mustard if you want to make the version of "borscht from the yesterday", this one is more tasty. Add some kidney beans (some people in Ukraine do this, I know), I don't like though=)) Nice combination of salt, pepper, vinegar, some sugar makes this dish incomparable. Lots of herbs-parsley, dill. You can add some cilantro if you like. I do all the time. Add garlic when the soup is done! There are million of variations of making this dish. What I do, I saute onions, celery, carrots, bell peppers( I love them to add), beet roots then, I add vinegar and set this mixture aside. Then, I make a stock and damp the mixture right in my meat stock. Don't be afraid in adding some crashed red chilies and some beef base as well.

Learned a borscht trick at a Russian restaurant in Castlegar, BC.  Sauté the onions, add chopped potatoes and beets; simmer till tender. Purée! Now return to pot and add rest of ingredients.  Delicious thicker, hearty borscht.

I have the Moosewood Cookbook, from which this recipe comes, and have made this soup to rave reviews.  Whether or not it is an authentic Russian borscht, it is still absolutely delicious!  Everyone loves it.  My grandfather, who always refused to eat vegetables in any way, shape or form, enthusiastically gobbled his down right to the last drop.

I followed this recipe as written with the exceptions: my red cabbage was too small, but after reading one of the other reviewers that mentioned his grandmother used the beet greens too, I chopped and included them.  After that I needed a bit more liquid so added 2 more cups of broth, increased the dill weed, cider vinegar & honey by half and used a 10.75 oz can of tomato puree.  After reading quite a bit about borscht I get the idea that it's a lot like beef stew is here in the US.  There are similar ingredients but probably a different recipe for every cook depending what they have available to use at the time – we loved the addition of the beet greens too.  This was my first attempt at making it (and eating it) so I can't say if it's authentic, but I can say we thought it was a winner.  Thanks Puma!

Mmmm! This was so hearty and delicious. I'd never had or made borscht before, so I followed the recipe exactly--except I realized at the last minute that I didn't have caraway, so I used fennel seed, cumin seed (according to Cook's Thesaurus--who knew?), and extra dill, and it turned out great. Also, I used fresh tomato puree, so that might have altered the flavor a bit from canned. This took some time to put together the first time, but it's really simple prep and comes together very easily. I'll definitely be making this again.

Really delicious recipe! Full of umami, sweet and a little sour. I end up adding more vinegar than the recipe calls for to achieve a pucker that offsets all the other flavors perfectly. I do end up using about three times as much beets as potato because that's the star for me. I've served it without sour cream and loved it just as much. My husband talks unconsciously about how delicious it is while spooning more in his mouth, which tells me he really loves it :-)

Fantastic! Give this one a try. We are part of a CSA and are getting lots of beets and cabbage. Now I know how to use them. Thanks so much for posting this. My husband even gave it an 8 out of 10.

Fantastic! Added cubed tofu to make it a complete meal. The recipe for 8 would feed 4 for dinner though.

This is very similiar to the recipe my german-russian grandma would serve every Sunday. I cut the butter back a little bit and left out the celery. I also replaced the sour cream with heavy whipping cream (which was added while still cooking). My grandmother also used the beet leaves and added barley to hers. I aslo added whole allspice and bay leaves as she did. Over the years I had forgotten the proportions of the recipe(it started tasting a little sour) and this got me back on track. Thanks!!

really awesome, loved it. we will definitely make it again. my only complaint is there wasn't enough of it haha. i would double it next time as one batch was about 4 servings for us. i used one yellow potato, one medium beet, one medium onion, probably 3 tbsp butter, crushed tomatoes (instead of tomato puree), omitted the salt, and used 1/8 tsp dried dill.

I have made this quite a few times now and absolutely love it. I do tend to add more veggies than it calls for (2 carrots, extra beets, more cabbage) and throw in another 2 cups of stock. I wish I had a HUGE skillet to make an even bigger batch. To me, the caraway seeds are NOT optional. I have no knowledge of authentic borscht, but this tastes wonderful. It's a mainstay at our house, especially in the winter! We sometimes add pork to it as well.

I love this soup.  So does the rest of my family -young and old alike.  I have requests to make it often.  I pretty much keep to the recipe, but use organic ingredients and low sodium chicken broth.  If I only have dried dill, I add a good teaspoon of it.

Loved this! I did not use honey or potatoes (for carbs!) but still came out yummy :) I used red onion  so the color and taste would pop. I recommend using Trader Joe's pre peeled beets (the whole package).

Enjoy!!!

This is a great recipe.

To "kick it up a notch," substitute a small can of tomato paste for the tomato puree. And if I have some, I toss in dried mushrooms. (Completely untraditional, but totally yummy.)

This is a great recipe - I've made it twice and plan to make it many more times in the future; it is delicious with black or pumpernickel bread. The second time I made it I chopped the vegetables quite finely - I find it makes the soup more visually appealing. Overall, a delicious healthy winter soup.

I'm glad I gave this a try - It was delicious!  I served it with Greek yogurt and sour cream.  I never used dill in Borscht before, and am pleasantly surprised.

Excellent recipe - flavor is robust and complex.  Only suggestion is to increase the liquid portion - by the end of the cooking process, and especially after adding the tomato paste, the soup is very, very thick.  Would suggest adding another 4 cups of liquid.  I also added fennel to the stock.

This is my first time making a Russian borscht. I've been feeling under the weather with strep, and am a major soup-lover. I decided to make this borscht for me and my two male carnivorous roommate's. They're not usually the easiest to please, but they both loved this as much as I did. :) The only changes I made in keeping with the red theme are red potatoes and purple onions. I also added a bit more dill. I recommend this recipe to anyone! :)

While I can't comment on the authenticity of this "borscht", as a soup, this one is great.  I'm eating in the next day and it tastes even better.   I think I added too much beets/cabbage/potatoes, as I just eyeballed it and threw it in.  As a result I added more broth, but got a lot more soup (which is fine with me).  Also, I didn't listen to the recipe by slicing my beets really thin.  I just diced them up and added them.  It may have been my beets, but they were still hard after 45 mins.  That was my fault though, as the taste of this soup is amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.

For the first time, I made an "all Russian" dinner in honor of my son who we adopted from Russia 7 yrs ago.  This borscht was definitely the best dish - it got rave reviews from everyone!  I wouldn't change a thing, and I will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the tomato puree, because one of my kids doesn't like tomatoes. It was still wonderful! My youngest children didn't like it because it was red from the beets, but everyone else loved it. Very healthy. Very good.

Delicious. Definitely hold the caraway if it's not a flavor you're a big fan of, it's pretty strong in this. One thing I'll change next time is adding more liquid, I prefer that it have more broth. At least another cup or two of veggie broth and a half a cup more of tomato puree would help.

Yum!  This is excellent.  I used purple cabbage and it was beautiful and tasty.  I also used the input of other reviewers to mash the potatoes with a fork near the end of the simmering time.  Also, I used beef broth and omitted the beets.

My family loved this soup. I invited our neighbours to try it,  they love it as well. I added a love of garlic, but other wise made the exact recipe. I want to thank Puma who posted the recipe. I will make this time and again.

This is pretty much like the borscht I usually make except I use beef stock and diced canned tomatoes. Mine did not have the apple cider vinegar or honey which I tried this time. Imo this is a delicious borscht.

Been living in Russia for 10 years, and this was one of the best I've tried. There are several types of borsch - sweet or sour, tomato-ey or beet-ey. This is a beet-ey, sweet one which is just the type that I love. Tasted very authentic. I put in two medium sized beets (more than the recipe called for), and about 1.25L of broth (also more). I also added 350g of cubed beef. Simmered for about 4 hours. I would say it could about 4 people. 

No need to debate the merits of certain ingredients and whether they should or shouldn't be in a "real" borsch recipe. The end result is that this tastes exactly as borsch should.

My husband I loved this soup.  I left-out the tomatoes and tomato puree cause I dislike tomato in my Borscht and added more fresh dill and less salt and it was just perfect to us.

It was great! I made it almost exactly like it said and loved it. The only thing I changed was that I used 2.5 big tbsp of tomato paste at the end instead of the tomato puree. Very much like my Mennonite Grandma used to make.

Oh my goodness.  This is so delicious and filling.  I absolutely love it.  I am fasting from meat for 21 days and this borscht is so satisfying.  I had some parsnips and turnips that I needed to use up so I also threw those in there.  This is definitely a keeper authentic or not.

I do like the big variety of vegetables used here. I used red onions, red wine vinegar, and roasted parsnips instead of potatoes. I also added bay leaf. Sometimes beauty is in simplicity, at times it's really best not too go crazy adding too many ingredients. I'm sure you've heard the expression "too many chefs spoil the broth", well, too many ingredients spoil the borscht! Just a few tweaks, swaps and maintaining the balance in between is all that's needed.

P.S. If you really want to blow your tastebuds off the next time you make borscht, top the borscht with a small halo of the freshest chopped watercress you can get, then drop the sour cream in the center. And add a sprinkle of freshly chopped chives along with the fresh dill. My mouth is watering already lol!

I diced all the veggies so they would all be about the same size, and used leeks instead of onions because that's what I had.  Not sure it needed the honey as it was a little on the sweet side, but still very good.  Will definitely make again.

I have always loved borscht of any kind.  This one was very good.  I had never used honey and thought it added a nice addition.  I love dill and used much more than called for.  I will add this one to my borscht collection.

I've had many different types of borscht, this one is very good.  I've made it twice and added ground lamb the second time.  If you add a meat, you should saute more onions, pepper, and caraway into the meat for extra flavor.

Wow!  This was fabulous! We all agreed that it was just as good as the Czech restaurant we go to. Next time I will be making a double recipe.  My family of four ate all but 1 cup of it for dinner tonight (the recipe says it makes 8 servings) and we are all want the  small bit of leftovers for tomorrows lunch.  Maybe well each get 2 spoonfuls?

This is a very good Borscht recipe! (And very easy to make.) It tastes just like my mother-in-laws, who lives in Russia. I wouldn't change anything with the recipe, it is good with the caraway seeds added... and lots of sour cream :-)

I haven't made borscht before but enjoyed this recipe.  I had chard and so added that instead of the celery.  We liked the vinegar/honey combo but would not like it any sweeter.

It was good, kind of difficult to make, lots of steps and careful slicing. We never had borscht before but like so many others got lots of stuff from our CSA that we are trying to be creative with. I was expecting the beets to make this a different flavor than I expected but it's very good. Will make again!

Very tasty. Made just enough for two, so if you're serving more or want leftovers, I'd double it. My husband, who responds to every vegetarian dish with a shrug, devoured this and asked for me to cook it regularly. I served it with lowfat sour cream and used the caraway seeds, which in my opinion greatly added to the flavor. Next time I'll make black bread to go with it!

I needed to use up some red cabbage and thought this looked really different.  I'm a vegetarian too.

Well, it is different, but really flavorful!  Tangy and sweet.  Not something I'd eat every night but a really fun change from the ordinary.

One change - I used canned beets and omitted the boiling step for them.

Awesome...I had borscht in St. Petersburg back in 2000 and I suddenly was craving it again.  This recipe hits the spot perfectly.  One thing: I had to use more stock than the recipe called for.  And I'd say it serves 4 rather than 8 if its the main dish... So good though.

I tried this recipe after eating borscht in a restaurant.  I did not add potatoes or chopped tomatoes.  I cooked the vegetables (carrots, onions, and celery) in large chunks with beef stew meat, in the crockpot, then removed the vegetables from the 
beef broth and added more beef bouillon for increased flavor. I added the shredded cabbage and beets and other seasonings as listed.  This soup is unbelievably delicious.  My husband doesn't like beets, but he loved this soup.  A MUST TRY IT RECIPE!!

This was so yummy.  I chopped the potato, beets & cabbage to a chunky dice, used chicken broth and diced a tomato and added 8 oz. of tomato sauce rather than puree.  It barely survived long enough to become leftovers.

This is pretty good and very easy to make.  It is a little too sweet for my tastes. I think maybe because of the honey and sweet veggies.  It needs a little kick.  Overall - not bad for my 1st attempt at making borscht.

This was a sleeper recipe. I had my doubts as I assembled it.   My husband LOVED it.  Once the sour cream and a little salt hit the bowl, we were SOLD.  

It was delicious.   We'll definitely be making this again!

My MIL has been raving about borscht she had years ago at Christmas since I met her. My husband had made his borscht once before and I was less than impressed. Disclaimer* that’s the only time I’ve ever had borscht. I also did not measure this exactly. That’s not how I cook, with the exception of baking. That said, this was absolutely delicious, once I seasoned with salt to my taste. (MIL has sodium restrictions.) A huge dollop of sour cream and this will absolutely be a routine dish in our house. I found my food processor to be invaluable. I shredded the cabbage and beets,  then sliced the potatoes with it. I also cooked it in the instant pot.

I never had Borscht before, but I loved it! I was looking for a recipe to use up some beets and red cabbage, and this was perfect. I used chopped fresh tomatoes instead of puréed from a can, dry dill instead of fresh, and beef Broth (made from the 4 cups water plus 4 cubes beef boullion) instead of vegetable stock. I wasn’t sure if the potatoes were to be peeled, so I decided to take the easy way and leave them on. I went heavy on the pepper. I ate it hot with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of dill. Healthy and Delicious!

Definitely use a food processor if you have one to cut the vegetables because it takes longer than 20 minutes to put this together if you don't!  I love Borscht (I live in Russia most of the year) and I'm trying to go meatless.  The flavor is still rich even without the meat!

I have only had Borscht once before and enjoyed it so I was happy to try this recipe as we have beets and purple cabbage growing in the garden. I had to substitute ketchup for the tomato puree so I will make sure to try puree and carroway the next time.

I added 2 more cups of veggie stock to make it more of a soup. Next time I will cut beets and potatoes into small, bite size cubes (slices are hard to eat). But the taste is fabulous. Having lived in Russia I think I can share that this is a wonderful, authentic recipe. So yummy!!!

This borscht is the best I have ever made. I substitute leeks for the onion due to an allergy. Instead of tomato purée I used a large tin of tomatoes. To improve the consistency of the soup I used a hand blender and blended it a bit so the soup was creamier. I omitted the honey as the farm carrot was plenty sweet. It is a fantastic recipe that you can modify to accommodate what you have in your pantry. Do make this borscht--you will be glad you did.

It was very good but not as good as my friend that is from Azerbaijan makes. I'm pretty sure she adds beef. I omitted the caraway and added more cabbage and onion. It seems like its missing some spice but not sure if it needs more dill.  I will be modifying next time or looking at other recipes to find what its missing.

So I was nervous to make this (despite the 5 star review) because I feared it wouldn't taste like the borscht my mom and (German-Russian) grandma made. Well I made it anyway and it is such a win! I even left out the potato and caraway seeds since I didn't have those things on hand and it still turned out just like I remember it. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

Very awesome. I used chicken broth instead and I added chicken sausage.  I used pickled beets and red potatoes in order to reduce the time to cook; that allowed me to add the beet/potato mix into the skillet immediately following the end of step two. Oh and I didn't have any dill weed.

Turned out amazing! I doubled the recipe because I had so many fresh beets, carrots, potatoes, and dill from my garden and I'm so glad I did because I can't get enough of it!

Good, but ratio is a little off.  I would do a lot more beets and less tomato purée: 4:1 ratio.  I also use the small (28 oz) cans (4) of shredded beets bc I'm too lazy to cook the beets.

I followed the recipe and it is excellent.  I was a bit unsure of the caraway seed, however it does add to the overall flavor of the soup. 
I agree with previous reviewers who wrote about the variety of borscht.whether or not one  calls the recipe authentic   May be based on the type your mother made!

Best. Borscht. Ever!  I've tried many different borscht recipes, but this one is the most flavourful and delicious one yet!  I changed up the method a little to simplify things.  I started with sautéing  the onions, celery and added 3 cloves of minced garlic (What?  No garlic in borscht!?  Unimaginable!)  then added the broth, potatoes, carrots and doubled the amount of beets and let it cook for about 30 minutes.  I then added the rest of the ingredients (maybe a bit more cabbage than called for) and let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  I will add a little more liquid next time, as the soup turned out quite thick.  Absolutely wonderful soup!

I have never eaten borscht before, so I can't speak to its authenticity, but this was an incredible bowl of soup! I have two picky kids, a pickier husband, and a roommate who doesn't like beets- We ALL loved it! Like, LOVED it! I modified the recipe slightly to fit what was in my fridge, but I mostly stayed true to the recipe. So, so, so good! And absolutely no leftovers (and I doubled the recipe).

Really enjoyed this recipe. Made a second pot this week with with my plentiful fresh ingredients! Three other tasters also gave it a thumbs up. As far as changes go I used pre shredded coleslaw mix ( mostly green) . Substituted white vinegar and dried dill. Omitted honey and caraway. Tasted like my Auntie Marie's. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious, this will be one of my keeper soup recipes. The apple cider vinegar scared me a bit as I can't stand the smell and I find it off-putting in salad dressings, but I couldn't taste it. I used homemade chicken broth instead of veggie stock, and used a bit less salt and honey than called for, but it still sings with flavour. I left out the caraway. Mine turned out more pink than red as my beets were a lighter colour variety. I didn't have tomato purée but used 1/2 the amount of tomato paste instead. Lately, I tore up the beet greens and threw them in 15 minutes before the end of cooking time. It was perfect.

This is absolutely delicious. I did not make any changes. OK, perhaps I had an extra deal and caraway seeds.

Oh my god, I don't care if it's not authentic. I wouldn't care if it was toxic waste, I've found my new favorite dish! It's amazing, very interestingly flavor and hearty. Only thing I noticed is next time I will increase some of the cooking times, my beets never really got tender, but they add a crunch.

Excellent! A truly brillant recipe. Served it to family and a bunch of friends with great success.

For those readers outside the USA, here the quantities in international units:

Potatoes and beets: 450g each.
Onions: 250g.
Carrots: 200g (a bit more than in the recipe). 
Celeri was not possible: used 170g leeks instead: very nice.
500g red cabbage.
1 liter stock (to be adjusted according to need).
Tomato purée: I used a 300ml jar of passata.
I'm not sure honey is necessary; I'll skip it next time.
Caraway seed: absolutely, and generously so! Just like the hacked chives on top of the cream. Lovely.

I did not add the Caraway seeds, as I don't like them. And, the can of tomato puree I bought was 10.5 ounces, so I just added the whole can instead of wasting the last 2.5 ounces, or trying to keep it for something else.
This recipe made my husband (who doesn't like beets) ask how I got the beets to NOT taste like beets. 
It was fantastic, and my first attempt at making borscht - I will likely make it again.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I highly recommend making this borscht.  We make it every year for Russian Christmas; it's quite the treat!  You can put less apple cider vinegar in it if you don't want it to be so strong.  I like it strong, but my children don't.

This recipe makes an excellent non meat borscht. There are a lot of ingredients that give a depth of flavour. I do think the prep steps are overly complicated. In the end it all goes together to simmer in soup for a prolonged period, so I don't really think all the separate preps for different vegetables is really necessary. I didn't bother with using a stock, with all the strong vegetable flavours, water works perfectly fine. But this will be my go to borscht recipe.

It was absolutely delicious!  
My grandmother made borscht, but it was nothing like this,  and frankly, as a child I never cared for it.  I used chicken broth in this because that is what I had, and I did use the carraway seed. It was great with both and I would definitely make it again.
 To say that one recipe is authentic and others are not is like saying your chicken soup recipe is the only authentic chicken soup.

I've made it twice in the past month.  I love this recipe, my husband doesn't like caraway seeds so I just omit them and it still turns out great.  I like to quarter my beet slices so that they fit easier on the spoon.  I forgot to get tomato puree the 2nd time and pureed whole canned tomatoes.   I use online recipes all the time but this was the 1st one I had to rate.

This was spectacular!  It will become one of my go to winter recipes.   I substituted three ingredients: organic grass fed butter for Land O Lakes, organic full fat yogurt (White Mountain) for sour cream, and purple sweet potatoes for conventional white potatoes.  Now I need to  find a good source of authentic Russian rye bread to accompany this outstanding dish.  Thanks, L J Hyde

I received some beautiful golden beets in my food co-op basket and decided to try my hand at Borscht.  Tons of different recipes out there,  people are vehement that theirs is THE best. Hmm. OK.  This was to be my first,  but I like it so much I will not make the others! 

I scrubbed and shredded all veggies, removed no skins. Shredding meant the pieces were all uniform,  I finely  chopped the onion and celery. My only substation was kale instead of cabbage. (I thought I had some, I was wrong!) O.M.G. this turned out great! With the golden beets, I have more of a yellow soup, but,  as I said, it's wonderful! Definitely will make this one again!

My mother used to make Borscht all the time and I loved it... This recipe is so close to how she made it... Being home sick with pneumonia i needed something to to get me through   the recovery process... and this hit the spot...  The only things I changed were I used Beef Broth instead of vegetable broth.. and eliminated the dill and celery...

It is so tasty. my husband is Russian and my mother in law always makes borscht, dare I say that this recipe is even better than hers! I put way more dill and threw in some lemon wedges yummy.

This is magic!! This was my first time making borscht, and even my very non-Russian mother, who is very dubious about beets and carraway seeds, confessed that she loved it. This is now my go-to recipe for snowy winter evenings. I'm so excited.

This turned out perfect! I followed the instructions without modification. It's a great combination of flavors that contributed to a pleasant, hearty soup. I also like that this recipe didn't call for heavy cream since the sour cream is enough.  We will definitely make this version of borscht again and again!

A Russian friend has introduced me to her cooking and now I have a new foodie passion.  This recipe is the first Russian/Ukraine food I've ever attempted, so I did not dare change a thing.  And it was fabulous.  I recently ate at a reputable Russian/Ukrainian restaurant in Chicago with this same Russian friend, and this borscht was far better than that which I paid $9/bowl for.  I will likely add another 1-2 cups of stock to help it go a little further. And definitely serve it with a dollop of sour cream. (And thank you to the reviewer whom suggested using Trader Joe's precooked beets.I will try that next time.)

I read over this recipe and it's ok.  I just posted a recipe for borscht on my website (www.revivingtraditions.com/russian-borscht) and it’s amazing how different borscht recipes can be. I think EVERYBODY’s borcht recipe is different. In fact, my borscht from week to week might even taste different! Borscht just has that reputation. Cheers from a true Russian.

This Summer we were in St. Petersburg Russia to attend a Wedding so I was anxious to try making my own Borscht. This is very good but what we had there was more earthy.I believe they must have used beef broth also and shredded the beets.Which I may try next time. Our household liked this very much as written and will add to our soup Sunday list.

This soup was easy to put together once you got everything chopped up.  I used beef broth instead of vegetable (and had to put in an extra too cups because there wasn't enough liquid).  My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty for my taste ... I would definitely omit the salt and just add it to taste at the end.  Or maybe replace some of the broth with water.

I made some changes for convenience and it turned out delicious! My first time making my favourite soup and this is a keeper! I added more beet (1 beet gave me 1 cup slices, so I used 2)I also added an extra stalk of celery and an extra carrot just for more veggies. Instead of red cabbage I used a bag of coleslaw mix (green cabbage with carrots)Didn't have cider vinegar so I did without it altogether. Also didn't have caraway seeds so I used cumin, though I only used 3/4 of a tsp because I was a bit nervous it would overpower, but it was fine! Had a package of fresh dill and added pretty much the whole thing. For the broth I used Organic PC vegetable stock. VERY YUMMY!

Fantastic!  Try this, you'll love it just as written!  Not sure the tomato garnish adds anything though.  Served with Ciabatta bread.  Made the recipe for 8.  But, I'd say that would serve 4 for dinner.  Go for it, we loved it!

I know there are a million ways that people think this recipe is the real way of making it..but here's what I think of this recipe...it rocked!
I happened to have red cabbage on hand that I needed to use and figured it was worth a try.  I had red cabbage a second time in my life by trying this recipe and had beets for the first time.  The only thing I didnt have was caraway and substituted the tomato puree for tomatoes and chilis canned.  I was leery of adding the vinegar and honey and was afraid my tomatoes I added would make it more "mexican" tasting but it was to die for! It gave it plenty of taste and a lil' kick and my husband and I devoured it all!  He asked me to make it again! Thank you for sharing this.  Im always into trying new "old school" recipes and this was perfect- and healthy too!

Maybe I misread the recipe but it doesn't say that you need a big pot to cook everything in.  You don't make borscht in a skillet.  Plus, you need more stock or water in that pot.  Typically, I shred onions, carrots, and beets, and cook it in skillet for 10 min or so, and then add it to the big pot.  I found that beets never really cooked and potatoes overcooked in the saucepan.  Also, at the end of it all, I had to add a lot more spices, like pepper, also added lemon juice, more paprika, and pressed garlic.  Not a true Russian borscht, more like a beet soup.

Good recipe.  For a different flavor try dill pickle juice instead of vinegar.  I made it a day ahead because "yesterday's borcht is better than today's borscht" (Russian axiom). :)

Made this for the first time yesterday and am still eating and loving it! I didn't have any tomato puree, so I added a can of diced tomatoes instead. I also added a lot more vinegar and dill, but only because I really really love those flavors. Don't leave out the caraway seeds--they really add another great dimension to the dish! I had difficulty slicing my beets thin enough and some still came out hard, but that's a problem with me, not the recipe. :) I will try grating them next time as another reviewer suggested.

This was a first time for me. I liked this recipe. A little chicken in it would make it a meat lovers casserole or soup. Thanks for the recipe.

The soup seemed a little bland, so I added some chili pepper to it to spice it up.

My beet- and cabbage-hating husband liked this quite well!  It was a welcome change from our standard fare, and I will certainly make it again.

I didn't follow amounts exactly, as I hardly ever do... so I might've added more tomato than needed, but everyone still raved about it! I've never had borscht before, so I can't compare it. But nonetheless, it tasted great! I added some sausage in it too!

As I kept tasting the soup, I added more vinegar and more honey than it called for.  Really really good flavor and a beautiful color.

This is probably my 3 grandsons favourite soup recipe - and these are children who seldom want to eat what is good for them.  I make the recipe as stated but for the tomato puree (because I was not sure what was meant) I puree a jar of my canned tomatoes. I double or triple the recipe & feed the crowds! Pampered Chef has a "simple slicer" which slices the potatoes, beets & onions easily & evenly.
Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Good. I liked it better the day after and so did my daughter. However, my husband did not care for the caraway taste (said it was too strong)

Delicious!  Before adding the stock, I sauted beef cubes that I marinated in white wine, salt and worchestershire sauce, with diced onions.  I also served over white rice to make the meal a little heartier- and similar to cabbage rolls!

This was very good, but next time I'll leave out the cabbage or greatly reduce it, and finely dice all of the veggies.

My 10 year old daughter is a soup lover so she wanted to try this.  Husband really liked it and kept going on and on. 10 yr. old ate the entire bowl!! (small victory for Mommy)  I really think the caraway seeds and dill are essential to this meal. Very hearty...will make this again.

This recipe is awesome!  My whole family gobbled it up.  I used more beets and even some greens.  Put in some beef gravy I'd made from pan-seering some steaks instead of broth.  Used 1/4 c. tomato paste.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  I'll make this again!  DELICIOUS!

Amazing!  The onions sauted in butter with caraway seeds form a rich base to this soup. I had excellent farmers market beets and didn't bother to put in the honey.

Loved this borscht!  Used all organic produce from our CSA farm share.  This was a great way to use our potatoes, beets, carrots and cabbage.  I didn't have caraway so I substituted hungarian paprika.  And I used 4 cups turkey stock for the initial cooking of the beets and potatoes. I left out the honey since my beets were already sweet, but I did add the vinegar because I like tang with my beets. Topped with sour cream...very yummy!

great! but i changed it a little. I added homemade beef bone broth. I eliminated the honey and tomato and replaced it with 1 can of brown beans in tomato sauce for a little more depth.
