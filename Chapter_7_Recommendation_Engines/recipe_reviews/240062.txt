Very, VERY nice dressing, bursting with fresh flavor.  Perfect pairing of lime, poblano peppers, and cilantro, with not one dominating.  Used half of this on a taco salad and mixed the rest with some sour cream for a tortilla chip dip.  Isabel, this one's a keeper.

This is so good. I did omit the poblano peppers because I did not have any on hand ...added a little more cilantro. 

I used this for salad...nachos...quinoa bowl...ect... it is much better than el pollo loco..I could eat this by the spoonful.

Thank you for the recipe....

Very tasty. I used serranos instead of poblanos, because I wanted spicy, but tastes close to the el pollo loco dressing for sure.

We really like it, we swapped the Mayo for sour cream and it still tasted great! Definitely will do again with salads, tacos, and quesadillas.

I feel it really needs sour cream to temper the mayo.  It was a great dressing for tacos
