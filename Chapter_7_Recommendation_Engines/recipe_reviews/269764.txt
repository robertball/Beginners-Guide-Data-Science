I used applesauce instead of oil (saving it for my friend's popcorn later) and these were easy, moist and very flavorful. Great additional way to use ripe bananas!

Love these!!  Made this recipe twice both times using wax paper instead of muffin wraps- more cost effective & just as appealing. My entire family love that they are not as sweet as store bought muffins. Plus I use dark chocolate chips which adds even more decadence! Substituted double baking soda both times instead of baking powder. Turned out amazing!!

Moist, indulgent, dessert-like.  This one is a keeper.  I followed it exactly except I ended up using 3 medium bananas because they were all going bad. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top before serving.   Next time I may try subbing in some whole wheat flour or oats to make them more breakfasty. These were a hit with kids and adults.

This one is a definite keeper. I generally cut the sugar anyway so this was perfect to me.  Very moist. I put in a tsp of cinnnamon but couldn't taste it. These are great as they are!

These were delicious! Very moist and flavorful! I added 1 tablespoon of honey and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I will definitely be making these again! Oh! And don't get thrown off by the thick batter, it is correct ??

These were terrible.  I added an extra banana because mine were smaller and I still couldn't taste banana at all (or chocolate for that matter). These were very heavy, dense muffins. Even when I was pulling the toothpick out to see if they were done, I was able to lift the muffin out completely from the pan because they were so dense and the toothpick wouldn't free itself from the muffin. I bake multiple times a week, and I will not make these again.

These were very very good and very very easy to make, which is a combination I LOVE! I actually halved the oil and put double the bananas in and they were great. Both hubby and daughters loved them. The mix was a little dry at first but after putting in the bananas it was just right. Definitely will become a regular in this home.

I made this recipe to use up our over ripe bananas. Muffins were moist and not too sweet with 1/2 cup of sugar (make sure bananas are very ripe and sweet). Exactly 23 mins in my oven.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I had one very ripe banana so I cut the recipe in half and got exactly 6 muffins. They were chocolaty with a faint banana flavor and not too sweet. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made these today and my family and everyone loved them. Doubled the recipe and used 6 bananas, so the banana flavor came through with the chocolate. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly as written. Will be making again in place of banana bread.

These are tasty! I used slightly under the recommended sugar amount and substituted baking soda and lemon juice because I had no baking powder. Also used melted butter and a splash of olive oil to bring it to 1/2 cup. Will make again I think.

I used Olive oil instead of canola oil and citrus extract instead of vanilla. Also added an insert of orange curd. It turned out great but needed to cook longer for us. I also didn't taste the bananas so much.

I used 3 medium bananas, substituted plain non-fat yogurt for the milk and added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts for some crunch, then topped them with a brown sugar, cinnamon, oat, walnuts, and butter streusel. They came out moist and delicious. Will definitely make these again.

These are super delicious!!!

I divided the recipe in half because I'm not sure if it will be to my liking, and now I regret not making a full batch!

These are super moist, tasty, and most importantly, these are not overly sweet!

I swapped the egg with a chia egg substitute and used almond milk instead of regular milk to make the recipe vegan. They turned out super great!

These muffins were moist and chocolatey with  just the right amount of banana flavor. I really liked this recipe because it uses less sugar  (I prefer them to be less sweet). I subbed some wheat flour to make them a little healthier and threw in some chopped walnuts.  Super easy, will make again!

Pleasant muffins. I made these twice this week to share. Some people said nothing, and others were extremely positive in their feedback. My husband loved them so much he requested the second batch as soon as they were finished. He said the second batch were better, likely because the bananas were more ripe. Both times all cups were almost full and I still got 17 muffins.

Made it exactly but added a few chopped walnuts. Turned out amazing! The chocolate flavor definitely doesn’t overpower the bananas. Was super impressed with these!

No changes,  delicious, moist, and easy to make.  Loved them,  will use three bananas next time,  more chocolate than banana flavor.

With the cocoa and chocolate chips these are very rich muffins.  I agree with another reviewer that you can't really taste the banana because of the overwhelming chocolate flavor.  I added 1/4 pecans because I wanted to use them up and I'm glad I did.  The nuts helped to cut the richness. Next time I will add more nuts. This is a perfectly good recipe to use up over ripe bananas, but NOT if you are looking for the banana flavor.

DELICIOUS!  My 14yo and 11yo grandsons devoured them!  I liked that it was made with so much banana and so little white sugar. (Yes, I know it has chocolate chips but I used top of the line dark chocolate chips.)  I’ve been asked to make them again before I leave.

I was expecting a moist muffin but was disappointed in how dry the muffins turned out.  The texture was too dry for my taste so the next time I make these, I will try adding apple sauce or substitute yogurt for the milk, as suggested.

Loved them! I tossed everything but the bananas and chocolate chips in the KA and gave that a whirl, folded in the bananas, I left some larger bits to allow the banana flavour to come through, and baked them for exactly 25 minutes. It's a keeper!
