This was a very good and simple recipe. I didn't have a lime on hand so I just skipped it. The title indicates this as a relish but I would consider it a sauce since it is cooked on the stove. But yummy nonetheless.

This is the best recipe EVER!!!  Thank you for posting.  I've used this recipe before and then, moved to another country where I didn't have access to my recipes because they were in storage.  I"ve been searching for something online that was identical.  This is identical.  No alternations needed.  It's perfect. :)

Great flavor! Loved the addition of lime. Don't skimp on the sugar. I only used a cup and one half and it wasn't sweet enough.
