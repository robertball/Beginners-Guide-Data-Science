This recipe was super-yummy, and I found that I was able to prepare it, start-to-finish, in far less than 55 minutes!  The sauce comes out super-thick. I added quite a bit of water to get it to mix with the pasta and veggies, but consistency is all about personal preference.  I also added some extra salt and pepper, as well as broccoli. The zucchini was delish, but I imagine most veggies go well with this entree.   All-in-all, great. I will be making this again!

I used lemon pepper & lemon juice in place of the lemon zest. I also added 1/2 red bell pepper & onion, 1 shallot, 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes & hint of lemon pepper in the veggie saute. The cheese sauce was way to thick so I added 1/4 cup of hot water to the mixture before blending it with the pasta. I also used 1/2 the box of pasta and sprinkled it with olive oil & s&p before blending everything together. It was very enjoyable!!

I enjoyed making and eating this dish.  I gathered every ingredient required, except for the mascarpone cheese.  For that, I found a substitute using 4 oz. cream cheese, 3 T sour cream and 2 T heavy whipping cream. Also, I did not use the pasta cooking water in the sauce; I used just plain water instead. This recipe made a huge batch of pasta, so I froze some of it.  I've since eaten the frozen leftovers, and they cooked up well in a little bit of milk.

Agree with others this recipe needed a bit of a nudge; but there is beauty in simplicity.  I think the flavor hinges on the quality of ingredients used.  Specifically, the quality of the parmesan.  Did not have basil, so used oregano (sparingly). Sauted the garlic, added some white wine once the cheese sauce was added to the garlic, then the pasta.  Also, cooked the pasta in boiling water with a few chicken boullion cubes added.  Used that to add to the sauce.  Also, used a bit more pepper.  Next time, will saute shallots and garlic.

Based on reviews, I made the following modifications: 
zested 2 lemons, reserved lemon juice and mixed with 1/3 pasta water, and instead of basil (did not have any), used 2 Tablespoons of pesto.  I used the lemon juice/pasta water mixture to thin as desired.  A stronger lemon flavor came through and the pesto added more body.  
I would also try using Asparagus next time too.

I just made the pasta--no veggies. The texture wasn't very good, and the flavor not quite there.  I was expecting more lemon flavor, less ricotta flavor/texture of the sauce.

I thought this recipe was flat.  It needs more flavor.  I added goat cheese as a garnish, which helped.

I wanted to give this a great rating because it sounded good but it really lacked something.  After making it according to directions it tasted very bland.  I added a pinch of nutmeg and some steamed broccoli. It helped a bit but it was still very bland.  Sorry.

Just finished eating this - delightful, fresh, summer pasta dish. Easy to make and quick. It lacked a little something however - not sure what. Will make this again as it was a lovely change to my pasta recipes. Thanks for sharing!

My husband: “we have to have this again!” Made as directed - I probably added a full half cup of pasta water and it was a great consistency for covering all the pasta and zucchini.
