This was tasty, and DH approved, so it was a success!  Better start these chops off at medium-low, because once the skillet gets hot, the coating will burn.  I made the recipe as directed, except I left out the sugar so it would be Whole30 compliant, and I used avocado oil for its neutral flavor.  The coating was more than enough for 8 large chops.  Cooking time is dependent on the thickness of the chops.  Overall, good flavor, and I would like to try it on chicken, but it's not quite like the famous restaurant chain.  Satisfyingly brown, much better than a "naked" chop!  Thanks for the idea!
