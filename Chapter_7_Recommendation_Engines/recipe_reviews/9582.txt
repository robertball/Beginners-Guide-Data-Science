I chilled and rolled the dough as instructed--yields a pretty good cookie.  If you're going to roll it, chilling it is necessary otherwise the dough will be too sticky to work with.  These are most like cinnamon sugar cookies when rolled. They are very good--great for decorating too if one is so inclined.

I thought this was a strange little recipe (3 egg yolks? milk?) but it turned out very well.  I did not refrigerate the dough.  There was no need.  I rolled it into balls, then rolled in white sugar, then pressed them down slightly on the baking sheet.  This recipe didn't make anywhere near 6 dozen for me, but then I didn't roll out the dough.  I'd say they were like big, soft cinnamony sugar cookies.  Yum.

I loved these, especially paired with fresh berries. They were a hit with the whole family. The only issue is that these cookies should be taken out of the oven before they're brown, since they are burnt at that point. I baked mine 9:30 at 325 degrees.

Great cookies and soo easy to make. They were soft and fluffy. I followed the original baking times but checked around 9 minutes (they weren't quite done).  I usually time it by smell anyway.  

I did split the sugar into 1/2 white 1/2 brown. I love the rich flavor of brown sugar and as many cinnamon cookie recipes call for molasses or brown sugar I figured it would be a good addition.

I made these cookies for my boyfriend (who has the maturity of a 7-year-old at times) and he loved them! Really easy to make though I coudln't see why I needed to leave them in the fridge for a couple hours...definitely going to make these again!!!

These cookies were great.  Everyone loved them.  My husband couldn't get enough of them and wants me to make more.  I put in only half the sugar it called for to make them not overwhelmingly sweet.  Only haff the sugar also brought out the taste of the cinnamon even more

Pretty easy to make, fun, and messy!  My husband is the cinnamon lover...so I made them for him.  He liked them, but said it could use more cinnamon.  I on the other hand, thought they were perfect...but again, I am not really a "cinnamon" kinda gal. He also thought that these would be great for ice cream sandwiches. One last thing: I also put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes, then the freezer for 10. It was fine, no problems working with it.  YUM!

Thanks for the share the recipe. I´m going to make a lot of cookies during next days to give them as a present.

Love from spain

I make these cookies everytime I make Meringues to avoid wasting the egg yolks. Very yummy and super easy! I like to add a little cardamon for extra flavor.

My husband asked for a cinnamon cookie but had no clue exactly what he wanted it to taste like except "cinnamon" (as if that helps a lot).  I found this recipe and tried it - he LOVED it.  I used a round cookie cutter and sprinkled a little red decorator sugar on the top immediately after they came out of the oven since I baked these at the holidays.  I will definitely bake these again.

A nice simple cookie! Instead of chilling the dough, I used a cookie press. The dough was the perfect consistency for the cookie press, they turned out beautiful.

These are YUMMY! The kids and I just made them for daughter's Christmas concert tonight.  Followed directions up to refrigerate and roll. We were in sort of a hurry so we just formed balls patted them down a little and smooched on red and green sprinkles. LOL  They were super easy!! Will be making to give away.  And we got exactly 24 probably because we didn't roll them thin and cut.

4/9/09 I am dating this so that I can update it in the future. I halved the sugar and used brown sugar. I left it in the fridge for 1 hour. THESE WERE POOR CHOICES. The dough was too soft to roll out. It tastes great, but I wanted to make rolled cookies (and hate sugar cookies passionately). Hand rolling these cookies into balls produced: 24 cookies. I'm going to try this one again sometime when I can leave it in the fridge overnight. In the far back. 5 stars for flavor and concise directions! (The troubles I'm having rolling them are my own fault :P)

Yummy!  I will add more cinn next time. Not too sweet, great with frosting, my kids love them. MUST use a great quality cinn like Penzey's Chinese Cassia Cinnamon.

My daughter had to submit 2 recipes for her Kindergarten's Cook Book. I decided to give this recipe a try and I am so happy that I did!
Not only are the cookies absolutely delicious but, they are so easy to make. All the ingredients were things I had at home and it was simple enough that my daughter could help me make them. She got to use the cookie cutters to cut the cookies (her favorite part)! :)
I followed the recipe exactly including the baking time. It was perfect. I got almost 4 dozen cookies from this. And they taste wonderful with a tall glass of cold milk!
I hope you won't mind that your recipe will be included in a Kindergarten Cook Book. I'm sure the kids will love these.
Thanks so much!

This was my frist time making these cookies and they are so easy!  I cut back on the flour to 1 2/3 cups and then added about 3/4 cup of rolled oats.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  They turned out so soft and chewy.  They're a winner!

Really good cookies! I made these because I had left over egg yolks from a meringue recipe.     I used this cookie as a dough base and made my own oatmeal scotchies!    Here's what I changed:  .5 cup white sugar  .5 cup brown sugar    1.5 cup all purpose flour  .5 cup oatmeal    then all I did was add chopped pecans and butterscotch chips!  It was great!

These had a very nice flavor, and were soft and fluffy. I added 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon and cooked for 10 minutes. They were a little lighter in color than the ones in the photo, and they were a tiny bit dry. I'm not sure if that was because I used fat free milk instead of whole milk. Nice tasting cookies though.

I did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar which I think I will stick to because they were yummy. Just be cautious in cooking. I cooked mine for 9 mins at 350, but felt like they didn't look done, but 1 min longer was way too long.  They ended up crunchy.  My second batch at 9 mins was much better. It made about 3 dozen for me rolling them out with cookie cutters.

I had a little trouble with some of the cookies sticking and breaking when removing them, but others in the same batch came out beautifully. Go figure. The taste was absolutely delicious! They only lasted a day in my house!

these cookies were great! i was looking for an alternative to a plain roll out cookie and these were it.  they dont loose their shape while baking.  they stay moist and chewy. and have just the right amount of cinnamon flavor.  I did find i didnt need to refrigerate for long they were very easy to work with after a short time in the refrigerator.  thank you for this recipe.

I wasn't impressed by these cookies. They didn't have a lot of cinnamon flavor for me, which was what I was hoping for. And I was hoping for a soft cookie, and they were soft straight out of the oven but upon cooling became hard. They weren't good, but they weren't bad either. I won't make them again.

Very nice cookies when you want a cookie and you don't have a lot of different ingredients around.  These are very tasty and easy to make.  I didn't put the dough in the fridge, mainly because I had a craving right at that moment for cookies, and didn't want to wait. They turned out wonderful without the fridge time.  I want to add, instead of rolling the dough out, I rolled about a tablespoon of the dough into a small ball, and flattened it a bit.

I replaced some of the white sugar with dark brown sugar for it to have a molasses flavor. Turned out pretty good and kept its shape well. The only thing that I disliked was how it turned noticeably harder after a few hours. Best while warm and served with milk.

I made these twice to accommodate a cookie baking and decorating for a group of toddlers. Dough was just fine without chilling it... I gave them a bit of flour to dust the dough but even my 3 year old was ok to cut. They were a BIG hit with the parents though! Even friends who don't like cinnamon cleared the trays full of badly formed christmas trees and stars that looked as they had been hit by meteorites and they ate them all over a cup of tea. All of them asked for the recipe! So, I was a happy mommy. Thank you!

This recipe is awesome! My little sis and I love to make cut out cookies around the holidays, but no one in my family is a big fan of sugar cookies and it seems like a waste to make cookies no one will eat. So we decided to try this recipe out and everyone loved them! They have a mellow, not too sweet, cinnamon flavor. I could see where some might find them bland without icing, but with icing they are too die for! We made a cream cheese icing and it was perfect because the spice leveled out the sweetness from the icing :)  They rolled out nicely after refrigerating the dough, although I would suggest using lots of flour on the rolling surface and the dough as your rolling it out. As an added bonus they made the house smell great as they cooked! Overall, a great recipe! Wonderful to eat with coffee or hot chocolate! Will definitely make again!

I am not a big gingerbread cookie fan, so I thought I might like cinnamon better.  My first impression was so-so. I made a crean cheese frosting for it and liked that better. And they did turn out pretty crunchy when they cooled, when I would have preferred a little softer.  But everyone at work told me they were delicious. So I'll try it again, maybe decide on a few alterations to see if I can make it more to my liking!

This turned out AMAZING!  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and a heck of a lot more cinnamon, but these have just become a family hit!

Easy recipe and great taste.  I rolled individual cookie dough slices in the cinnamon mixture instead of just the whole roll.  Very nice texture and taste.

Sometimes I think I will run screaming into the night if I have to make one more chocolate chip cookie so I am always happy to find a nice, simple  non-chocolate chip recipe that my family enjoys.  I let the dough chill for just 20 minutes to firm up a bit.  I rolled and cut the cookies as directed and got only 2 dozen, not 6.

These are great cookies; whenever I make them and my friends figure out, they demand to have some! Then again, I love all things cinnamon.
Is there some way to make more cookies with less ingredients? There are a lot of egg yolks.

Had absolutely no trouble with this recipe.  I added 1 cup chopped toasted pecans to the batter.  They taste amazing, especially to anyone who loves cinnamon.
