Yummy!  Our family has agreed that this one was a winner!  We added 12 oz of white chocolate chips and cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hrs since we don't own a bread machine.  It turned out beautiful.

Turned out similar to Banana Bread, but with Blueberries instead of Bananas.  The very top middle didn't cook all the way through. Definitely let it cool in the pan before removing it!

My bread came out without any problems.  My machine doesn't have a CAKE setting so I just used the Batter setting instead.  At first I was a bit worried that there weren't going to be any blueberries left after the kneeding paddle got through with the dough but despite the blue color of the dough there were plenty of blueberries still intact.  Yummy bread.  Great with coffee on a cold winters night.

This bread didn't get cooked through in my bread makers cake cycle. I had to cook it for longer. It was very crumbly.

I would have never thought that this recipe would have turned out to be so very popular. I've made it four times in the last two weeks! It vanishes! People wake up in the middle of the night for another slice. They stick it in the toaster and smother it with butter and blueberry fruit spread. I put 1/4 teaspoon lemon oil in and I think it overpowers the blueberries, but everyone else adores it. I also use chopped almonds instead. The whole thing goes into the breadmaker, no pre-mixing nonsense, and I have to cook it for an extra ten minutes.

Very good.  I used all the ingredients but instead of frozen blueberries, I used fresh.  I also added everything right into my bread machine and put it on quick bread cycle.  I forgot to spray the pan but had no problems getting the bread out of the machine when it was done. It did the mixing right in the machine and then at the very last minute of the mixing cycle, I added the blueberries.  Everything mixed together with no problems and the blueberries were left intact.  Will defintely be making again.  Very moist and the taste is wonderful.

As soon as I saw this recipe I jumped up and made it. I diden't have a cake cycle on my bread machine so  I set it on bake for 1 hr. With the inserted stick method I decided it was gooey in the middle. So, I cooked it on the bake cycle for another 15 or 20 min. It was wonderful warm right out of the machine and it was also wonderful toasted, the next day.

I loved it. My boyfriend loved it. Oh man. I'm going out today and buying more blueberries to make it again! Only thing I changed is I bought fresh blueberries (they were on sale and cheaper than frozen) It's a little heavy, but a nice dessert type bread. YUMMY!

This recipe tasted great but OMG! do not worry about gently blending blueberries into dough. Once you turn on bread machine it demolishes buleberries. My bread was BLUE!! I thought maybe I did not read the recipe correctly but it even said on it "Check in 1 minute to see if mixture is well blended." It was well blended allright! Is there another way to stir in blueberries?? If you can get past the presentation the bread was delicious. Would not serve it to guests nor give as a blue gift!

This bread tasted good.  It was just moist enough to not be a dry bread.  The need to mix the ingredients before placing them in the machine was a slight pain - since I like the ultimate convenience of the bread machine - but the results made it worth it nonetheless.  I would definitely make this bread again.  This is a good sweet bread to use for brunch or to give as gifts.

I made these as muffins - got 12 full muffin cups our of the batter.  I added 2 cups of berries as 1 was just too little in my opinion.  It is not very sweet but I like it that way.  Just a few things to remember - cream the butter and sugar first.  Then add eggs, then milk.  Also use fresh berries if possible.  Frozen will make the batter too cold and it wont cook thoroughly.  Clean and rinse the berries, drain and toss in some flour.  This keeps them from sinking to the bottom of the muffin.  Gently fold them in the batter.  These were perfectly baked at 375 in 20 minutes.  Excellent, excellent muffin!

This is a nice tasting bread & easy to make.  I ended up cutting it in half & placing into an oven ready pan & baking at 375F oven for about 10 minutes to finish cooking it as the top & down the centre didn't cook.

The texture is nice.  I added shelled sunflower seeds instead of walnuts.  I'll make it again but maybe just mix longer & bake in the oven.

OMG, this totally ROCKED! It could have used slightly less sugar, perhaps, and maybe two packets of True Lemon instead of just one. But man!  The only real deviations I made were: * 1 c. whole wheat flour + 1.5 c. bread flour for the 2.5 c. all-purpose flour * 4 T. butter instead of 1/3 c. margarine * 1 packet of True Lemon instead of .5 t. grated lemon zest  My only real complaint about the recipe overall is the recommendation to mix it in a bowl prior to loading it into the bread pan, so the only advantage to using the bread machine is that it just doesn't heat up your kitchen like firing up the conventional oven would. In the fall/winter/spring I'd likely just throw this in the oven - I'd dirty the same number of containers, and a conventional loaf pan could go in the dishwasher, whereas the bread machine pan has to be hand washed. Still, a winner!

i made this for my family today and it was a hit! I didnt want to bring out the bread machine though because I was in such a rush, so I just baked it in the oven for 50 minutes on 175. It turned out great, even though the blueberries bled a lot into the batter, you could hardly tell in the final product. It was moist, sweet (but not too sweet) and nutty all at the same time

This recipe came out well for me. As suggested I used 1 TB of poppyseeds. I omitted the walnuts and added extra blueberries (I used fresh). To keep my bread from turning into a blue mess I didn't stir my berries in the dough. Instead I folded them into the bread machine between layers of dough. During the cycle the bread appears to be bluish. But when I waited until after it had cooled to take it out, the bread was brown and delicious

Delicious, and not too sweet!  I used dried blueberries and substituted the walnuts with 1 T. of poppy seeds (could use more).  I think I also used a little more lemon zest, but only because I love lemon.  With the dried blueberries, I didn't have to do anything by hand...I just threw it all in the bread machine and used the cake cycle.

This recipe states MIX BY HAND. As such, the blueberries turn out fine. I had no trouble removing the bread from the machine, either.
This bread was very moist, flavorful, and I will make it again!

This recipe DID make a great tasting bread, but it didn't work at all in my bread machine.  The paddle just smashed the blueberries and we had a yummy bright blue treat.  I'm new to the bread machine game, so it could have been user error.  I ended up baking it in the oven and I will make it again.  I also substitued 1 cup whole wheat flour for part of white flour and I added some  wheat germ.  It was still light and tasty.

This bread did not really turn out for me in the bread maker.  I think it might have worked in the oven.  It was not cooked in the middle, and stuck to the pan despite spraying it with oil first.  I do not have a cake option on the machine, so I used light.  Perhaps a different setting would give better results. It did have a good flavor though.  Might make good muffins too.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight.  I followed the directions exactly, and set the bread machine on quick bread.  It smelled FABULOUS while it was cooking.  When the timer went off, I went to get some of the bread that smelled so great, only to find out that when I opened the machine, I could see the bread jiggle.  It was not cooked.  The outside had started to form a crust, but the inside was still very much NOT done.  When I inserted a toothpick, just for kicks, I got a huge glob of dough.   I ended up having to turn the oven on and stick the metal "basket" in the oven to finish cooking.
