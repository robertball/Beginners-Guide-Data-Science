This is an awesome spread recipe! The flavors meld beautifully.I made half the recipe exactly as it was called for, and the other half I left out the olives, substituted celery seed for celery salt, garlic powder for garlic salt,and added a teaspoon of white wine for my friends with salt restricted diets. They loved it, and I loved both the original version and the lower salt one.PS- I used Dijon mustard for the prepared mustard. Both versions will delight your tastebuds. Many Thanks, Jennifer. This won't be reserved just for holidays at my house! This is definately going on my New Years Eve Buffet this year! I'll probably use it to fill my mini cream puffs or puff pastries.

PLEASE DISREGARD THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND LOW RATINGS ON THIS RECIPE!!  I made this over the weekend for a football party that had 22 people at it and asked them to rate it from a 1 to 5.  EVERYBODY rated this a 5 and most of them said they would give it a 10 if they could.  We tried it on crackers, all kinds of veggies (Beleive me, they weren't picky!) and when I had ran out of all the veggies, they were scooping it out by the spoonfuls and eating it right out of their spoon.  It wasn't strictly all men either.  By the time the evening had ended, everybody had asked me why I hadn't made a double batch.  I didn't change a thing when I made this recipe and I won't in the future either!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It is the exact one my grandma used to make every Christmas.  Definitely use celery seed and garlic powder instead of their saltier counterparts.  And I use 1/4 tsp of cayenne and it is perfect.    This makes a HUGE cheeseball, so I make it into four little balls and freeze them and take them out if company's coming.  They are even better after they've been frozen.  :-)  OH, and I use old Cheddar.  Can't lose.

I really wanted to like this, but both me and my guests felt it was rather boring.

So many distinct flavors, and they each stand out individually even when blended completely! This is a delicious spread, and perfect for celery boats, as another reviewer noted. My family was surprised by the spicy kick but heartily came back for more and more! We had it on crackers and on celery, and gobbled up a whole bowl (I made half the recipe and it made a large bowlful). I recommend this spread for those who like their hors d'oeuvres rather spicy.

This was a waste of time and money.  I think it tasted like potted meat AFTER it was finished.  Too bad, the recipe looked real good....but it wasn't!

This was way too salty, probably with an adjustment to the seasonings it would rate higher.
