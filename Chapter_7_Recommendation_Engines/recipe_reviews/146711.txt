Don't let my initial 4 star (WAIT.. it is a 5 star but, 4 star as a result of my OWN lack of ingredients.... rating detour you from trying an exceptional recipe.

I followed directions EXCEPT I used marinate artichokes! 

Guess what, VERY GOOD but not perfect as I imagine the recipe should and could have been.

I used 26 ounces of drained, marinated, artichoke hearts and the result was very good. It would have been FANTASTIC if I had compensated for the marinated artichokes by eliminating the white wine and lemon juice due to the marinade!

This is a great recipe; just make sure you follow the directions and, as the first reviewer suggested, you may want to reduce the artichokes by half but, if you LOVE THOSE ARTICHOKES... go for it!

Thank you for a great recipe!

I liked the flavours and consistency of the soup but would consider adding only one can of artichoke hearts next time and maybe a potato or two instead of the second can. I found the soup too salty as well, even though I used reduced-sodium chicken broth. I would consider making my own broth next time, but the recipe already requires a lot of prep time.

I did not care for this recipe. I like to make a point of following each recipe exactly the first time, and this was no exception. Since it did not specify marinated, I bought simple canned artichoke hearts. 
In Step 5, there is absolutely no way all these solid ingredients with so little liquid will produce something that will boil.  It turned out as a big, dry glob I could saut√© for a bit, and then add to the broth. The final product was one unsatisfying meal.
