Wow!!! This cake had my house smelling amazing!!! A simple cake with such an amazing flavor. It crisped up very well on the outside. The Hubby wants it coated in frosting. The Boys want it cut up and made into a fruit trifle. I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn t change anything.

It was terrific! I added a 1/2 pack of vanilla instant pudding mix which made it a little less heavier than most pound cakes and it also made it moist. I frosted it with red orange yellow and chocolate frosting and swirled them to give it an autumn effect. My guests raved over it!

This was tasty for desert after dinner with some tea. The family loved it! Also. I used a square baking tin. I am always concerned on the amount of sugar noted for recipes overall. I modified the recipe by only adding 2 cups of sugar and it was just right.

I checked the recipe 5 times to make sure it called for 3 cups of sugar. I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was way way too sweet. Every other pound cake recipe I've come across it calls for at most a cup and a half of sugar. What should shine through is the buttery taste and unfortunately all you taste is sugar. If I decide to try again I'd definitely cut back on the sugar content and stick to just butter instead of Crisco.

I made this cake in the shape of a cup cake for my daughters birthday. It was a hit! I certainly will follow this recipe again.

I liked this recipe, I substituted the Crisco with cream cheese and it was great! Gave it a mild sour punch that took it over the top. I added a orange sugar glaze topping to decorate. I will try it with Crisco next time to measure the creaminess side to side but all in all, I truly recommend this recipe!

This is the 3rd pound cake recipe and by far the best.  We served it to friends, and they loved it also.  We served it with strawberries on top and - wow.  Delicious!
