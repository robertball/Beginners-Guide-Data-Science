What a unique way to use cottage cheese. I chose this recipe as part of my Ethiopian dinner because my husband has throat cancer and cottage cheese is one of the things he can eat with no problems. I love the citrusy-earthy flavor of the cardamom in this dish. I'll be making this again...thanks for a wonderful recipe!

The flavor using fresh ginger is far superior  to the dried.  If you don't use much ginger, cut it in chunks & keep it in the freezer in bags until needed.  I have sensitive fingers so I either wear rubber gloves to handle hot peppers or my husband, who is not bothered by the capsaisin, chops them.   It's delicious when made according to the recipe.

Interesting, but not for everyone.

I love Ethiopian cuisine and my wife is an eater of average American tastes.   I found this recipe interesting, but unbalanced in its flavors.   While edible for me, I think there was too much ginger and the ground cloves "took over" the cottage cheese.  I do not feel compelled to make this again.  

My wife did not care for this. I rate this two stars because this is not a recipe I would use UNLESS I was serving people with very tolerant and esoteric tastes.   Cardamon, if you don't have it, is quite expensive.  Now I am left wondering what else to do with it.

On the plus side, it was original and it did look good on the plate.  But this should be targeted towards a very particular audience.

An interesting use of cottage cheese!  The spices used are very unique, albeit expensive.  Changes to the recipe include 1/2 tsp. of powdered ginger instead of 1 Tbs of minced fresh ginger and less spinach.  Due to my inability to handle anything with capsaicin, I also skipped the green peppers.    Overall, I call it a success with its ethnic twist on boring 'ol cottage cheese and unique use of flavors.

this came out pretty good.. i scaled the recipe down to one serving and didn't find the 1/32 tsp of ground cloves to be overwhelming (yes i literally measured that out).. i kept everything the same except i used a baby red jalapeno for the green chile pepper which i de-veined/de-seeded half of.. i was using up the rest of the spinach in my fridge and only had 4 oz but i continued on anyway.. i tried a bit of this on a bite of toast but preferred it without.. ty for something very different

Great flavor...just too much cottage cheese, i had a lot of it left over after the spinach was gone. Also i changed the green chile pepper for a jalape√±o. Its a good recipe :) You can also try this recipe with turnips, i found it to be very useful for when you have picky eaters that dont like their greens...

My husband gave it a 2 and asked me to never make again. "Uninspiring" was the word he used. I liked the flavor just fine, but it took forever to wash & dry 2 lbs of spinach. If I ever make this dish again, I'd probably use frozen spinach to cut down the time.

I wanted to try this for the cottage cheese lovers in the family, but even though everyone ate it no one particularly liked it.

Saw this and thought it would be a nice change to normal greens. I was surprised at just how wonderful it was. Served it with blackeyed peas and the flavors went perfectly together. Will will be adding this to the recipe box. So delicious.
