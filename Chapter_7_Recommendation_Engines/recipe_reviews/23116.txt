I normally follow the recipes to a T the first time I make them but this time I added a few things to spice it up a bit. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I used a dark stout and added chopped onion, fresh minced garlic and some low sodium soy sauce. The result was DELICIOUS! I'll be serving this at the next Superbowl party.

I've made this a couple times for gatherings and I never have any left over.  I think cut up hot dogs work better than cocktail weiners because they absorb more of the sauce, since they don't have the casing to go through.

These were actually a huge hit with our friends.  We did follow others suggestions and thickened the sauce with some corn starch at the end.  I might even next time pop them in the oven for a few minutes to carmelize some of the sauce.  Will definately make this again.

I served this to my Bunko group.  I really liked them a lot and two people commented they really liked them..however, I still had over half left at the end of the night. I used Ballpark as that is the hot dogs my family likes, but they really plumped up so had to double the sauce.  I might make these again, but I'll use regular size dogs.

So yummy and so easy to make! These drunken dogs were such a hit that they have been requested over and over again. I did add a bit of asian sauce to give it an extra layer of flavor and it made the sauce a bit thicker! Excellent recipe!

Fantastic! Served it to a large crowd. It pleased everyone's taste buds and I had to immediately share the recipe! Sauce could be a tad bit thicker, but overall it was sensational!

I made these right before the first game of the World Series while we were waiting for pizza delivery. Needless to say, they were a hit! Never before have I eaten hot dogs and gone back for more... Plus everyone thought I was some kind of extraordinary cook because they were so delicious! Three ingredients baby!

As other reviewers have indicated, if you want any thickness to the sauce, you must add corn starch. I cooked the dogs on high in my slow cooker for at least two hours, maybe three, and the sauce still had not thickened, so I broke down and added the corn starch. I used the big Fairbury Brand dogs, the kind sold at Nebraska games, which are easily the best mass produced dogs around. I used a bottle of Blue Moon, which provided a exceptionally rich taste experience.

This was terrific and oh so easy!  I used cocktail smokies and they split lenghtwise, probably because I let the liquid boil too much.  I will be more cautious next time.  To thicken the sauce, I let it simmer uncovered for about 15 min.  It turned nice and sirupy, yum!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

I made this for a childrens party, my hope was that it would be something that most of the kids would like.  What I didn't realize was that it would be a huge hit with all the adults too!  A++++ for taste and ease.

THESE WERE JUST OKAY. I USED LITTLE SMOKIES INSTEAD OF HOT DOGS. IF SOMEONE COULD TELL ME HOW TO THICKEN THE SAUCE I WOULD GIVE THEM FOUR STARS.

Recipe was great! These hotdogs were a huge hit, and they were gone before I knew it. Next time I will need to make more. I did add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce because it was kind of runny but after that they were to die for!

I sliced up a beef polish kielbasa and simmered it for 2 hours and the sauce did thicken on it's own.  Very good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Based on the smell alone while cooking I couldn't wait to eat later for our cocktail party.  These were definitely a hit for all.  I also took others reviews in hand and thickened with a little bit of corn starch

I prepared this for an appetizer for a backyard barbecue. It was simple to make. I served in a shallow tray with toothpicks with a little bit of the sauce. I drained off most of the sauce into a small bowl and used it as a sauce for my barbecue sandwiches.

I myself did'nt like the smell of the beer in the sauce, as far as the sauce going thick--mine did'nt also but I don't think its meant to;  however I took these to work and put them out and everyone of them were eaten, so I would say it was a hit.

Good recipe. I use 16 oz beer, half bottle of ketchup, half bottle of Worcester sauce, and 2 cups brown sugar. The SECRET is Nathan SKINLESS hot dogs cut up into bite size pieces. The skinless dogs let's all that flavor soak into them.  Into the crock pot on high for about 5 hours and you will have ZERO leftovers. :)

This recipe is awesome! Couldn't ask for easier, but with a fantastic taste. I'm not sure why some others needed to add corn starch - after simmering for 1 hour I had a beautiful, thick glaze. I will definitely be making this again!

I just tried this recipe. I broiled the Hot dogs. I warmed the beer and the brown sugar on the stove. Placed the hotdogs up kind of chunky. Added them to the brown sugar and beer mixture. Simmered for 55 minutes. Turned on the high the last five minutes. Did not add cornstarch. Cooked  on high the last five minutesto thicken it. Turned into a glaze.
