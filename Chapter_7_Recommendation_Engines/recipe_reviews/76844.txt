Wonderful and easy.  I used green & red peppers instead of zucchini and mushrooms.  I also added a few pineapple chunks.  I only used about 3tbsp total of oil.  My young kids thought it was a little spicy, but it was perfect for the grownups.  Next time, I may tone down the red pepper flakes for their benefit.  I saved this one to my Recipe Box for future use!

Excellent. Followed recipe to the letter and served over hot white rice. It was a crowd pleaser. The only bad thing and it was my fault, I might have added the zucchini too early because it turned out kindda slimy...but still delicious.

Yum!  I used no oil and All Fruit spread and put it over my regular stir fry veggie mix I like.  A little sweetness that I thought was just right.

This was awesome. I used beef and chicken and had a selection of different veggies for people to choose from. It was a big hit for sure and will be made again.

My family LOVED this recipe and it will be a regular at our house from now on.  I did make a few modifications....I didn't have cider vinegar, so I used rice vinegar. I used olive oil instead of canola, and I did not use pea pods, but did add bell pepper, broccoli, purple onion and water chestnuts. You pretty much can add/use any veggies on hand.   I cooked the chicken first and set aside.  Then I cooked all of the veggies until just barely tender, then added the chicken, water chestnuts and the sweet and sour sauce.  Mixed until all coated, then served over long grain brown rice.   LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe!

First things first: I had to improvise. I followed the sauce recipe exactly, used just over 1 lb chicken, and used a bag of frozen stir-fry mix veggies. As a matter of personal preference, I used 2 tbsp canola oil instead of the recommended whopping 1/2c! I heated the oil on MED, put in the frozen veg first & let it thaw for about 5 minutes before putting in my chicken. Turned up the heat to between med & med-high & kept tossing everything together until the chicken was cooked. Added sauce mx & let it reduce down for about 10 minutes on med-low since the frozen veg had added some water. Stirred occationally while reducing. THE RESULT: Home made, low prep AWESOME! I cooked the rice while the chicken was cooking & sauce was reducing a bit, so total time from prep to plate was about 30 minutes, and could be tweaked to less. VERY GOOD & A KEEPER!

This turned out OK in my book, my husband LOVED it.  I guess my main peeve was that I used the "low sugar" apricot preserves but I didn't buy SMUCKERS, I bought an off brand and it had that weird diety, saccharin, aspartime after taste that diet sodas have.  I will make this again but next time I am buying just regular apricot preserves and we'll see how they turn out.  I served mine over a bed of white rice and once I got past the weird taste of the apricot low sugar stuff overall the meal was very tasty.   EASY enough to make.

This was ok, but not spectacular.  I liked the addition of the red pepper to give it a little kick, but I'll stick with Sweet & Sour Chicken II from this site for my sweet & sour chicken needs.

This was a good recipie...I did modify it by adding 1 can of pineapples and juice to the mixture I also added some corn starch to thicken it up...I omitted the red pepper( so my kids could also eat it) also I used carrots and green pepper for my veggies...I liked it, my hubby thought it was ok and my kids didn't like it so that is why I'm rating it 4 stars

Being that my husband doesn't like zucchini, I made this with fresh broccoli. That was good, but we did think that the recipe really lacked flavor.  I think those who added red peppers, pineapple and sesame oil had the right idea. I think that would have made for a more "authentic" sweet sour stir fry.

We loved it - following changes - used red, green peppers along with mushrooms instead of zucchini. Threw in a little sesame oil & pineapple chunks into the apricot sauce. Served on chinese noodles - very nice!

Had to omit zucchini, added yellow bell pepper.  Used peach preserves (not low sugar) as that was all I had on hand.  This was reallllly good.  Thank you very much for this recipe.

LOVE this Stir Fry. The sauce is sweet but not too sweet. It's just great. i omit the garlic salt and add fresh minced garlic instead. I also added some red onions. It was wonderful.

It was really good!  Though of course I cooked the mushrooms and zucchini in 2 cloves of chopped garlic and added pepper.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper too before I cooked them.  I served it over arborio rice which is pretty sticky and Joe loved it!

This was fantastic, and I didn't even make it right.  I had used the mushrooms and zucchini when we made kabobs and forgot to replace them, so I just used the pea pods and added pineapple chunks at the very end.  Plus I used apricot pineapple preserves.  Was so delicious, I'm sure using all the ingredients will make it even better!

I didn't have any apricot preserves so I used Orange Marmalade instead and it turned out great.  We served it with rice and it made a nice meal for the two of us and some left over for my hubby's lunch the next day.

I made some changes to it to suit my tastes and my dietary requirements, but overall it wasn't bad. It did have a pretty good taste. The one problem I did have with it was that it didn't make a tremendous amount of food and the serving size is way to small and calorie loaded. Just not what I was looking for.
