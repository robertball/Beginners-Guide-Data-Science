Fantastic fondue. I served it at my book club meeting with many different types of fruit and some shortbread. I used the darkest chocolate I could find (Lindt 85% cocoa). The combination of the sweet fruit and the orange/bitter of the dark chocolate was outstanding. For me, milk chocolate would have ruined this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. As an added benefit, the darker the chocolate, the better it is for you health-wise.

This was good.  It was not nearly sweet enough for my sweet tooth, which may stem from the fact that I for once had high-quality dark chocolate on hand and used it.  I ended up adding quite a bit of corn syrup.

Edit: tried it again using semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the fancy stuff.  Worked very well and was finally sweet enough for me.

This was excellent. It was a bit more liquid than I would like but the taste was phenomenal.

Awesome!  Everyone who has tried this has loved it!  I increased the amount of orange liqueur to boost the flavor.

Very good, and easy. I used a bag of Ghiradelli semisweet chips. The fondue was thin at first, but thickened over time in the fondue pot.

This was very tasty.  The flavor reminds me of the chocolate oranges you buy around Christmas time.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate, and I substituted orange extract for orange liqueur.    We dipped strawberries, raspberries, mandarin orange slices, graham crackers, and marshmallows.  Wonderful!

UPDATE- Looked in the fridge later and discovered I accidentally used half and half instead of heavy cream. That would be the cause of my failure, both the curdling and the thinness. Half and half NOT a reccomended substitute.
This didn't turn out at all for me. First of all, adding the orange juice to my heavy cream managed to make it go sour and start to have little clumps in it. Then when I added the chocolate, it melted but you could still see the white globs from the cream. The texture seemed grainy and yet it was quite thin. There also was not much orange flavor and overall it didn't seem sweet enough to me.

This was AWESOME! And EASY! I did not have orange liqueur, but used orange extract that I had on hand. I cooked it on the stove and then transfered it to the fondue pot for dipping.

I used milk chocolate (that's what I had on hand.) Quite thin, but very tasty. Will make thicker next time.

I thought this was pretty good, but I really like dark chocolate. I added a little more zest than called for, and thought it came out perfectly. I wouldn't serve it at a party again unless I knew there were others who would eat it. It's obviously not very sweet at all.

Wow, this is rich but delicious!  Super simple to make but why tell anyone?  I served it with coconut macaroons, pound cake, bananas and pieces of pastry.  Add whatever is on hand because what doesn't taste better with chocolate?

This is really delicious, just the right amount of sweet without being over the top.   I increased the orange liquids, to help the citrus flavor shine.  A little extra chocolate kept it from getting too runny.  It was also nice at room temperature as it cooled.  The ganache-like texture kept the chocolate on the fruit instead of our shirts.

I've used this for the last two years as my Valentine's Day dessert.  It is very good and very rich.  I cut the recipe down for two adults and one child.  I used 4 ounces of Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa and added 1 ounce of Baker Semi-sweet which added a little sweet but kept the dark chocolate flavor.  Between the semi-sweet chocolate and the orange juice, it was just right.  The second time I made this I forgot heavy cream, so I just used some half and half.  It was thinner, but still coated the dippers.  I wouldn't use it to cover strawberries at that constancy though.

My family (including young kids) absolutely loved this fondue.  Hubby loved the orange kick.  Used regular choc chips since I didn't have dark on hand.  And omitted the orange liquer since I was serving it to kids.  Turned out great, though it is a little thin as noted by other reviewers.  Still a keeper in my "impressive and easy" file!

Fantastic! The whole family loved it, including all four kids (ages 11, 8, 3, and 2). Getting them to all like the same thing can be a challenge.

Sooo good.  I used half dark and half milk chocolate chips. I didn’t want to buy a bottle of orange liquor so I used orange extract that I happen to have on hand. I also only used 1C of heavy cream instead of 1.25C and it was still slightly thin. I could of used either less cream or more chips but I left it as it was and it was very tasty....I wanted to drink it lol.  I had Strawberries, Graham Crackers, bananas, Apples, Pound Cake and Pretzels.  Apples were my favorite.  I didn’t use a Fondue Pot, just a small chocolate Melting pot

After reading several comments, I omitted the orange juice added more orange liqueur. I used Lint Dark chocolate, country style cream and Triple Sec and the result was a silky smooth texture. This was a huge success with my guest! Happy I had the foresight to make a double batch!!

It was great.  I did not have orange liqueur, so I use orange extract instead and it turned out nicely.
We had some left over so we drizzled it on waffles the next day.

A delicious chocolate with a subtle orange  flavor that even the kids loved. Thin, as others noted, but it did thicken a bit as it cooled, and as a result made a lot (plenty for 3 adults/2 kids  with about 1/3 leftover). I used one package of Ghiridelli semi-sweet chips and served with bananas, strawberries, apples, pound cake, pretzels, graham crackers, and marshmallows.

Omitted orange liquor and added a bit more OJ and cream. Served with pound cake, bananas, apple, pineapple, strawberries. Very good!
