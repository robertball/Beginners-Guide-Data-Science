Simple and quick if you assemble/prep all the ingredients early in the day.I made this exacly as directed and we both thought it was very good. I kicked it up a bit when I reheated the leftovers by adding some of my preserved lemons to it. That made it divine. I might add some sundried tomatoes next time around too. Thanks for another winner Chef John.

This was really good, after I improvised a little.  I reduced most thing by half, since it was only for the two of us.  There are a few things missing from the ingredient list.I cooked the shrimp shells in  1 TBS butter (butter wasn't listed in the ingredients)  I only used 1 TBS of olive oil (instead of 1/3 cup). I used about a TBS crushed garlic. (in directions but not listed in ingredients). I also cooked it all in one pan (except for the shell broth). We loved it, and will make it again.

Followed the video instructions since the garlic and butter quantity were not listed in the "ingredients." I had prepped all the ingredients before cooking- good thing! The flavor was wonderful!

My dish turned out dry.  I think it was just too much couscous.  I would cut it in half if I made it again.

Overall a healthy and easy to make dish (just prep ahead). I only used a tablespoon of butter and 2 pounds of shrimp. I upped my zucchini. I doubled my tomatoes but they cooked down too much. Maybe I’ll add some fresh on top next time. I didn’t have fresh herbs, so I used dry and added Italian seasoning blend. It could have used more kick, but I’m attributing that to my choice of seasoning. Next time I’ll throw in some fresh herbs. Lemon is a must!

I made an approximation to this today, but for the vegetables I used sautéed onions, shallots, celery, and mushrooms, along with diced Roma tomatoes that I didn't caramelize. I particularly like the trick of making stock from the shrimp shells. Chef John also included that technique in his recipe for paella on this site, which I've used with success. The other changes I made are 1) I included some lemon zest, and 2) I used dried basil because I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand.
It was a big hit at the potluck, and I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious and my family gave it a thumbs up! My beef with the recipe is the incomplete ingredient list. First off, I didn’t know to get shrimp with the shells on. The video helped me figure out he to use a tablespoon of butter with the shrimp shells. The video suggests using 4 cloves of garlic, pressed (missing from the ingredient list). SIn the video John stresses the importance of having 2 cups of liquid. After simmering it for so long, I measured the stock and found I was a full cup shy! I added an extra cup of boiling water to make sure the couscous would be fully cooked.

Ingredients are hard to follow due to missing list items. If I made again I would add less dill.

Some ingredients are missing on this recipe. The recipe felt like it was going in the right direction, but was missing flavor. I made it with pearl couscous which changed the texture a little bit and added roasted butternut squash which kicked up the flavor a bit, but still not enough. Would not make again.

I didn't have couscous and my shrimp was already shelled so i made it on sticky rice instead. I also replaced the eggplant with mushrooms since one of my friends is not a fan. It was delicious though probably very different from the original. I will definitely try it again with all the right ingredients.
