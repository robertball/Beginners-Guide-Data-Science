I had a craving for gryos last week but have never attempted to make them at home. This recipe is really easy and very good. They tasted very similar to gyros I have had at greek restaurants.  The prep is a little timely and I actually didn't have the time to let the meat sit in the refrigerator before putting it in the oven and I was impressed at the flavor the meat had.  The only thing I did different is I added 1/2 tsp. allspice per another recipe and did not use thyme. Another recipe called for 1/2 tsp coriander but I didn't have it and will probably add that next time. My picky husband loved the meat and actually ate it leftover and he NEVER eats leftovers. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Excellent!  I made this recipe using a few modifications.  I deleted the marjoram because I didnt' have any and I upped the garlic to 4 cloves.  I know that it sounds like a lot, but I love garlic and it totally worked.  I also upped the salt as well.  Not sure exactly how much I used, but it was more than the recipe called for.  Not much, but I actually wanted it to taste salty like the gyros that you'd get from a restaurant.  One more thing I did was grill it on the barbeque outside.  I started it wrapped in foil and after 20 mins ( I turned it to ensure even cooking during this time) I took the foil off and grilled it on the open grill.  It was WONDERFUL!  Not exactly like what you'd get at a gyro place, but pretty close.  All of my friends couldn't believe that I made them at home. To answer the reviewer who wondered whether or not the food processor makes a difference, I have to say that it definitely does!  Processing the meat till it's paste-like makes a HUGE difference!  the texture is completely different than it would have been if I'd just left it as it was. I gave it 4 start because of the mods I made to it, but I really liked this recipe and I will definitely be making this again!

This was excellent!  Easy to make.  Didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Sliced it on an angle, very thin and it looked almost like we had just cut it off the "spit".  Found a good recipe for pita bread also on another site so made that to go with it.  Sure beats the store bought pita bread.  Also used the easy cucumber sauce from this site.  All in all it was a grrrreat meal.

We thought this recipe was a little bland.  I used a whole onion (since I hate having half an onion lying around) and doubled the garlic and thought it could use even more.  I think the biggest problem of this recipe was the salt.  1/4t. for 2lbs of meat is not nearly enough.  Healthier, yes, but not as tasty. I wanted to be a little conservative with the salt since I was serving it with Tzatziki (a little salty) and feta (quite salty), so I only doubled the amount.  It could have used even more.  Sure, you can add salt to the pieces later, but I think the flavor would be better if the meat was salted throughout.  Next time, I think I’ll try 1.5t. or 2t.  I cooked it in an 8.5” loaf pan and it took about an hour.  I also had to leave the mixture in the food processor for much longer to get a tacky texture, so if your processor is older or cheap like mine, you may have to do the same.  All in all, I thought it did resemble gyro meat and would resemble it even more if you tossed the pieces on a grill before serving.  It was moist, yet not greasy.  I will make it again, but will try to spice it up a bit more.

I have made this gyros meat several times and Love it!  First time could not find ground lamb in grocery store so I used 1-lb ground pork with 1-lb ground beef.  Subsequent times I used the ground lamb/beef combo when a local grocer started carrying ground lamb and it was fabulous.  I followed the directions for ingredients, but I do the following things differently, when I take the loaf out of the oven, I drain off whatever grease, then place a cold loaf pan on top, inside the 2nd loaf pan I placed 2 small hand bar-bell wieghts ( I didnt have a brick) this compresses the meat even further as it cools.  I then place the loaf into the freezer.  I happen to have a cheap meat slicer and slice the loaf as thin strips.  Making sandwiches, I take the strips of gyros, then fry them lightly oiled skillet (your oil of choice).  I like doing it that way, seems to replicate the texture and also a nice warm meat in the sandwich. Have had nothing but compliments on this receipe!  Thank you sooo much for sharing this!!  10-stars if I could give it that many!!

This was easy to make and also tastes very close to what I get at the restaurant.  I upped the salt to a teaspoon, though, as I thought 1/4 tsp would have left the meat bland.  Mine took longer to cook than the directions stated.  I found that a paper towel was an excellent way to squeeze the water from the onions.  The onions came right out and did not stick to the paper towel and then I only had to throw the paper towel away for easy clean-up.  The next time I make this meat, I'll save the juice that bakes off and cover the meat with it in the fridge to keep it moist.  Live and learn!

We can't get decent Gyros here in the suburbs of Philadelphia since moving from NY, so I tried this recipe and found the flavors very very close to the real thing. The only change I made is I now add a little more salt.  Also make sure to pan fry the slices for a minute or two per side to get a little browning going before putting on the pita. This for a more authentic "gyro joint" experience, as the real "from the spit" gyro meat has a little bit of a crust on it.  Good stuff - kudos!!!

Really really good.  My fiance and I had been craving gyros and love to cook and try new things, so we decided to give it a shot.  Only thing we think we'd change is more garlic and more salt.  Other than that-- excellent! We ate it ALL!

This recipe is the real deal! So flavorful and moist. My first time making gyro meat. The smell and taste are dead on. I used a 7x13 shallow glass dish so that the pieces would be more like what you get at restaurants (see photos). I did much of the recipe as stated but did add an extra lb of beef and an extra half batch of spices to make more at once and I was worried about it being to "lamby". Turned out fantastic!! This amount was PERFECT for the 7x11 pan. I let mine cool overnight in fridge and then cut it into thin slices using an electric carving knife. The slices came out perfect. I have added 2 photos - one is while I was cutting (you can see the loaf and some slices), the other photo is when I had them crisping up on the flat top. I will make this over and over! Thank you so much for this recipe.

This ended up tasting very much like the gyros I used to eat in Cicero/Chicago.  Since lamb isn't available in my area, I used venison and beef, it came out drier than it would with lamb, but the taste was excellent.  I doubled the recipe and I also did not use a food processor, I mixed mine by hand.  I followed the cooking directions but will try something different next time.

Coming from the Detroit area and missing Greektown, I've been searching for a good gyro, but I can't find one.  So I figured I’d make my own. This was a great recipe, which I modified a bit by combining with Alton Brown's version to create what I'm looking for. - . 
Taste: 9 out of 10; 
Texture: 9 out of 10 ; . - .
Modifications: 
1 whole medium onion; 
All Lamb; 
No Oregano (might try a bit next time); 
1 tablespoon dried marjoram; 
1 tablespoon ground dried rosemary; 
1/4 teaspoon Thyme; 
1/8 teaspoon Cumin; 
2 teaspoons salt; . - . 
The end result didn’t suffer from some of the problems others are reporting (dry, loose texture, etc). - . 
Recommendations: 
After letting the meat rest (10-15 minutes), Slice the Gyros meat and place it under a HOT broiler to get the meat nicely browned/caramelized. You won’t regret it! . - . 
Save the drippings from cooking.  This can be sprinkled over the meat while broiling. 
I used to gauge a good Gyro by how much it made you stink after eating it—literally, could you smell it coming out of your skin?.  That’s Greektown Gyros!  This modified recipe was excellent, but it needs a small kick from one of the ingredients to take it over the top.  Just a bit more tinkering and I think it will be there.

This was fantastic but I made several alterations : 1) I used 1 lb lamb and 1 lb buffalo (the buffalo is leaner than hamburger and the lamb is fatty enough to compensate), 2) we added lots of extra seasoning and 3) we baked it in an 8/8 pan with an X cut on top, this brought the cooking time down to 30 mins and made slicing thin long pieces much easier 4) we pan fried the slices to get a rich browned flavor DELICIOUS!

I followed the recipe. All I have to say is this ended up being a really weird way of making a meatloaf. After taking it out I tasted it. Tried cucumber sauce on it and it did not taste like gyro meat. I took some catch up and brown sugar and threw it back in the oven. Luckily I like meat loaf. Now I have to go buy a Gyro to feel better.

I grew up next to a Greek restaurant and this is the closest to what I knew to be authentic.
 WONDERFUL combo on spices. I added a smidge extra salt. The cumin and rosemary meld to give it that smokey/flowery flavor that many Gyro recipes are lacking.
I did add One pound of ground pork and it came out better than without. Many traditional Gyro recipes use pork so I thought I would try it. Awesome idea, adds bulk and the fat emulsifies the rest of the meat and spices into the desired paste consistency you need.
We put ours on Naan bread w/ lettuce, tomatoe, feta, onion and tzaziki sauce.

My family cannot get enough of this..I've made prob 6 loaves in the past month.
So good I had to go reheat me one while writing this review  lol
Oh and it makes really easy, fast leftovers. Sear in a pan for a min and assemble...Viola !!
Thanks for the deeelish dish !!

This is the 3rd time that I've made this recipe, and I keep reminding myself that I need to double, or triple, to freeze some for later, b/c truthfully, it is a little time consuming to prepare. Of course, I add a 5th step by either grilling the gyro slices or browning them in EVOO in the skillet prior to serving them. The only thing that I've ever changed is subbing ground turkey for beef, and up'ing the salt; otherwise, same ingredients, same directions, same outstanding results. We eat ours over baby greens w/ feta, tzatziki, olives, red onions, tomatoes, and cucumber slices, w/ warm pitas on the side. /drool/ Keeps me from having to drive 15 miles to the nearest Greek joint for gyros! Thanks Dread Pirate, and p.s. love your profile pic!

This recipe was decent, but needs a little tweaking.  The amount of salt called for makes it VERY bland - I doubled it and it still wasn't enough.  I would use 1 tsp next time.  I ended up salting the outside before grilling and it made all the difference in bringing out the flavor of the other spices.  I also think I will skip the step of squeezing the liquid out of the onions next time since most of the flavor is in the juices.  If you aren't going to leave the juices in, there isn't much point in using the onion at all, and that probably contributed to the blandness.  Also agree that grilling the meat before serving is a must.  It also cut more cleanly after being in the fridge overnight, so I would make this a day ahead next time.  Overall a good recipe, just needs a few adjustments.

Pretty decent. Spices are a bit strong, but certainly still okay. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be, and made a great substitute for eating out. Only slightly more involved than making a meatloaf, really. Also, I subbed dehydrated onion flakes and grilled the slices before serving.

Remembered that SNL skit, "Hub's Gyros" today and immediately craved these.  This is WONDERFUL and DIVINE meat!  Like others, we left out the marjoram, as our local Kroger didn't have it and used an extra clove of garlic and 1 tsp kosher salt.  **The most important part of this recipe is to food process/blend up the meat.** It gives it a texture that is tender and to die for and makes a perfect loaf.  Do NOT skip this vital step.  We used the blender, small amounts of meat at a time and it came out outstanding.  We also did let it sit in the fridge for about 2 hrs (was only going to do one hour, but forgot about it) and the sauce (see other recipe for Tzatziki Sauce) chilled in the fridge while the meat cooked.  This meal couldn't have been timed out any better.  It was super easy (we are in our early 20s) and I will definitely, definitely make this again.  Once it began cooking, the smell that filled the house was exactly what I was craving.  I got so high off this meal and we only ate one a piece.  Very, very filling.  We ate the meat with the tzatziki sauce, fresh tomato, sauteed onions on Kangaroo pita flatbread.  I am so happy we have leftovers.  I will be eating this again tomorrow.  **make sure to process the meat to get the texture!!**

We loved this. I used 1/2 lamb & 1/2 ground venison. Also, I cheated. I replaced the dried spices with a total of 3T greek seasoning (which has all that stuff in it) plus more salt. Used paper towel to drain onion, then combined & baked as directed. After cooling, I sliced thinly then browned slices in a skillet to serve. Looks & tastes just like the gyro places we frequent and my friends are super jealous that I can make my own! Thanks so much!!

This recipe tasted like gyro meat from my favorite restaurant.  I modified the method a bit based on what I have available to use in my kitchen.  I grated the onion rather than processing it, and didn't strain them at all.  Unfortunately, it's extremely hard to find lamb where I am located, so I used a pound each of ground pork and ground turkey, which seems counterintuitive, but ended up tasting very good.  Instead of letting it sit and baking it as instructed in this recipe, I actually shaped the meat into 2 meatloaves and put them in my slow cooker on high for 3 hours.  The result was marvelous. Yummy on flatbread with tzatziki. I did up the salt to a teaspoon, and it actually could have used a little bit more, maybe 1.5 teaspoons.  I will use this recipe again.

My husband and I have no need to visit a restaurant for gyros any longer!  This was really good, but I did make some changes.  I used a whole onion and just threw in about 3 cloves of garlic.  I also used greek seasoning instead of the individual spices.  The spin in the food processors really makes the difference in the texture.  It was also better when it sat overnight and was then sliced thinly and pan-fried for a minute or so on each side.  It is a bit dry, yes, but with plenty of tzatziki sauce (I use my personal recipe), and chopped tomatoes and onions, it was fantastic!  Next time I'll try with  homemade flatbread, too.

This was good.  I had to cook the meat for about 30 minutes longer than what was stated- and I am not sure why.  For the last 10 minutes I increased the temp to 345.
After slicing, I fried the meat in a skillet until browned so it was more like the restaurant version.  The flavor was really good.  Goes great with Greek Tzatziki from this site.

I have tried cooking this recipe at the temp and time suggested and the meat is no where close to being done.  Also, I am not impressed by the flavor profile nor texture - it is nothing like restaurant gyros I have had.  I used the measurements for all ingredients as given in the recipe.

I would have given this five stars, but I didn't have any lamb, so because of MY substitution, I didn't feel that it was right to do so....that having been said, this is an excellent recipe for gyros!! I made it as directed (minus the lamb) but instead of putting it into a loaf pan, I used my cookie scooper to make them into  small balls, cooked them in a non-stick ceramic pan on med-high, flattenening them with a pancake turner and a measuring cup - I used the pyrex measuring cup to help flatten the patties into almost lacy-like 'things' not a pattie, not a slice, but the family loves them like this! It is a little more time consuming than making the loaf, but two of my children and my husband don't like the loaf slices (could be because they don't like meatloaf??) So, to keep peace, this is how I cook them.  I make a tzatziki sauce with yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, and dried mint leaves, slice an onion and tomatoes, cut some pita and move out ot the way!!  This makes a LOT of patties, so lunch for the next day is already made - that is if the leftovers don't disappear during the night.....

Excellent recipe!  After baking we drain and put a foil covered brick on the loaf for about 30 min. then slice, fry and serve.  This is very close to Alton Brown's version. PS, If you can't find ground lamb, see your butcher would double grind your beef and mix with ground pork.

Not exactly like the gyro from a restaurant but I'll take it - since we don't have any gyro joints where we live!   to cook it, we lined a roasting pan with a kitchen towel in an inch of water and put the loaf in it.  then fried it in a pan to make it a little drier.

This is not how gyro is made. Being Turkish I think we make  a mean gyro!!! I used some of the ingredients but  not all. Along with the ground meats you are supposed to layer it with a very thin layer of beefsteak and lots of oregano! I added most of the spices into the yogurt sauce that accompanies this and also served it with peppy's pita bread from this site.

I have made this a few times now.  The first time I followed directions exactly and found the flavors just a bit too intense and also too greasy.  I liked combination of spices and didn't want to mess with it so instead I used 1 pound of ground lamb, 1 pound of ground turkey and 1/2 pound of ground chuck.  This extra 1/2 pound of meat resolved my issue with the intensity of the spice mixture and substituting the ground turkey and leaner ground chuck reduce the fact to almost nothing.  Excellent recipe.

Amendment:  I was making this a few days ago and my pyrex dish cracked and the water bath leaked and killed my oven.  So was faced with this raw loaf of stuff.  I took the wet towel and placed it inside my oval 5 qt crock pot and placed the loaf pan on top of it.  I covered the loaf pan with foil and set the crockpot on high for several hours.  It cooked perfectly.

I tried this recipe with my son while he was home from college.  He'd become an aficionado of gyros and was looking for a way to make the meat himself.  We agree with others that cooling the loaf, slicing it thinly, and pan frying it brings out the true taste we wanted.  My hubby couldn't tell they weren't real! Thank you The Dread Pirate Paramour!

For those who wish the consistency was less meat-loafy try pressing the meat once out of the oven and resting in the refrigerator. One can use cedar planks that will fit the inside of the form, wrap in plastic, set on top of the cooked meat and set a heavy object on top. Be aware that this will push some grease over the top so have something underneath to catch the over flow. Leave overnight in the fridge. This is will compact the meat and make it nice and tight. This is a traditional technique for making pate/terrines.

Wow, this was sooo good! I'm really glad I found this recipe.  I never imagined I could make a gyro as good as a Greek restaurant and this really turned out great.  I did add more salt to the meat, though because that is what our taste is accustomed, but the spices were spot on.  To complete the meal I made a good tzaziki dressing and homemade pitas (easy with my bread maker) and served with lettuce and tomato.  What a great meal!  I've made this twice so far and it will be a regular in our kitchen.

As the recipe is, I found the seasonings were a little bit overpowering, and it needed more salt & pepper. But, it's a great base - next time I know what to add, and what to hold back on.

I've been craving really good beef Gyros since I moved from Detroit, MI. (Greek Town - oh my yumminess!) The closest thing we have down here in the Desert of CA is the mall place which is a 45 min drive, so I decided to give this recipe a try. Boy was I surprised. It was really really good. The flavor is almost spot on.  I did add a lot more salt - maybe 2tsp, and to be honest I think it could have done with some more. I also processed all the meat and refrigerated it overnight so the flavors could combine.  I didnt have a meatloaf pan so I just shaped it and put it on the rack inside my roasting pan and covered it with foil.   Kudos to DPP for a recipe that is as close to the restaurant as one can get. Probably a quite bit more healthy at that.

Wow!  My husband and I love gyros,  but I've always been more than a little intimidated by the big hunk of meat on a spigot and have never thought of making it at home myself.  Well, last night I did and it turned out wonderful!  After the two hour resting period and one hour cook time, we were too hungry to let the meat cool and pan fry (we will do this to our leftovers for dinner tomorrow), but the taste was still almost exactly what we were hoping for.  I did double the salt (as others suggested) and added another pinch to the slices before serving to make it taste more restaurant-y.  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks, DPP!

I made it as shown except at the end of the cooking, I put a weight on the top of the gyros to make it flat and squeeze more of the fat out of it.  It also made it more rectangular in nature instead of humped like meatloaf. I had some problems mixing the meat in my blender.  I had to do it in small batches so that it would not overheat my blender.  This made the prep more time consuming, but the meat had a very good consistency.  My three year old ate it right up.  He thought it was a new kind of hamburger....  I think next time that it would be better grilled or sauteed in a little oil.

This dish is among the best flavored gyro meat I've tasted. However the texture was off and nearly impossible to slice thin. After I sliced from the cooked loaf, I browned the slices in a pan with EVOO. This made a more familiar texture. Everyone enjoyed this dish!

Made this for a greek dinner party for tonight with friends.  I got Leg of Lamb and ground it up to use with the ground beef.  As another reader suggested I used greek seasoning mix.  (there were several to choose from but I only got the one with No MSG)  Other then that and adding a little more salt and some garlic power, I followed all of the directions and  It was FANTASTIC.  Got excellent reviews from all the other families at the dinner.

This is very close to what you get in restuarants.  I used only lamb; add some cardamon and left out the thyme.  Also gound the spiced meat and formed it into a log shape wrapped tightly in plastic wrap & put in fridge for 3 hours.  Then I put it on a kabob skewer laid it across a pan, tented with foil, baked it slowly .  Perfect!

Very good, mine tasted 80-90% like the real thing.  I did what people suggested and pan sear each piece of meat prior to making each gyro.  If I do again I will make 4x the amount of meat and slice/freeze it, as it is a little time consuming.  But worth it!

This was off the hook!  Im a big gyro fan and hate paying an arm and a leg for it.  I added extra garlic and salt per other reviews, and subbed onion powder for onion for the kiddos.  I also did not process the meat.  Flavor was spot on...even my 9 and 15 year old were highly impressed.  Served it with tzatziki from this site, and a greek salad.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  I made Peppy's Pita and Tzatziki Sauce II from this site.  Kinda a lot of work for a gyro, but it was SO worth it!  I let the leftovers cool overnight in the fridge and portioned out meat and pitas into freezer bags for future meals.  DEFINITELY will make again!  Thank you for the amazing recipe!!

Tasted ok. What I liked was that it did have the flavor of a gyro. What I didn't care for was the texture. Since it had no breadcrumbs, I didn't think it would be *that* meatloaf-ish, but it was. I also pan fried the pieces (as some reviewers suggested) but it didn't do it for me. 

I don't think I'll make this another time, but if I did, I would use a smaller amount of lamb meat - probably .5 lbs and 1.5 beef - because I felt like the lamb was a bit strong. Also, I thought it could have used more salt. But that could have been because I used sea salt.

The seasonings for this were dead on, the meat combination wasn't. I did the lamb and ground beef combo, the lamb taste covered some of the seasoning taste and the hamburger taste. But I do think if I used 3 pounds of hamburger rather then 1 pound that it would fix the problem. Gyro meat does not have the over whelming lamb taste to it, if anyones had lamb it's a strong meat. Might be fine if you were to use just hamburger since most non authentic gyro places do use thin slices of beef instead. Just wanted to let people no that the meat combo doesn't work, the lamb takes over the taste of everything.

It is almost impossible to find ground lamb in my area, so I had to settle for lamb chops.  I cut the meat from the bones, and ground it up in the food processor before continuing with the recipe, and this worked well.  Followed the recipe except used plain table salt instead of sea salt.  The big key to final texture is processing really well in step 3.  I couldn't tell you whether it was truly "traditional" or not, but it was really really good, and have made it several times for my family.  Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box!

This is awesome! Very easy too! Originally from outside of Detroit, home of Authentic Greek Town,my husband took one bite of this meat and said he never had to eat at a Greek restaurant again! He said it tasted the same as the restaurant only fresher. It was one of the best compliments on my cooking I've gotten! Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!!

This was ok. Did as some suggested and cooled the meat and then sliced and pan fried. We did drain the meat, which ended up drying it out. If I make again, I would do the same, but not drain. Flavor was tasty!

So delicious! The aroma out of the oven reminded me of the Greek restaurants we miss so much! Make sure you salt to your own taste is my only suggestions. Make fresh taziki sauce and good pita bread too of course.

This wasn't even close. The meat tasted and felt like a dried meatloaf with no flavoring. I followed the recipe exactly - I even bought expensive ground lamb. I wasted my money. I used it for gyros, but even the other flavors in the pita didn't help. Gyros are a family favorite and I thought this recipe might be one that would let us make them at home. We'll stick to restaurant gyros from now on - it's cheaper, easier and tastes a whole lot better.

Didn't use marjoram, rosemary or thyme and instead added allspice and coriander to the recipe. Very similar flavors to what we eat here in Europe. I shaped the ground meat mixture into oblong shapes and bbq'd them instead of cooking on a loaf pan.  Saves much time and mess. Served with thinly sliced red onion, crumbled feta, sliced tomatoes and tzatziki sauce on flat bread.

I looked everywhere for ground lamb, but came up empty. I ended up using two lbs of ground chuck. While the flavor was great and did in fact remind me of gyro meat, the ground chuck just had the wrong texture. It was like meatloaf with gyro flavor. I'd like to try it again with lamb, hopefully it would give it the right texture.

This worked fantastic!  I suffered through with my little 2 cup food processor, but it cooked up like a dream and was super easy to slice and had great flavor!  I did use 1t of salt and my grocery didn't have any ground lamb so just used all beef.  YUM.

Made this exactly as written, except we only let it sit in the fridge for about an hour.  We forgot that it needed to sit and started making this at dinner time, so we couldn't really wait the full two hours. Served it on flat bread with tomatoes, onions and tzazki sauce...was wonderful! Really hit the spot!

I made this tonight for dinner.  My son and husband both liked it, although my picky husband said that he thought it tasted like meatloaf on pita bread (haaa... I will keep trying with him.)  My son and I thought it tased like the gyros we buy here in the bay area.  Did use an electric knife to slice it really thin and browned the slices in a  skillet with a very little bit of olive oil.  I brushed the pita bread with a very light coat of olive oil before I heated them in another skillet.  We ate with red onion, lettuce and tomato.  I used a recipe from this web site for tzaziki.  Great dinner.  Oh, I doubled the recipe so that I could freeze one loaf for another dinner.

this was fabulous! the whole family loved it including my 5 yr. old who asked for 2nds. The only thing i did different was to add the extra salt (per other reviewers) and to form the meat onto skewers and i grilled it. I would use a leaner ground beef next time, the recipe didn't specify so i got the 80/20, i will try a 90/10 next time.  excellent seasoning blend!

My wife and I have been craving gyros lately and have been thinking about how good the ones we used to get at The International Festival held in Lorain, Ohio(my hometown) every year. So when I came across this recipe I knew I had to try it. Came out just like the festival. The only thing I did different was to up the salt to 2 tsp and since I don't have a food processor, I mixed all ingredients and passed them thru my meat grinder 3 times on the fine blade. Very tasty. Neighbors even came over and ate with us because they smelled the potatoes I had cooking on the grill. LOL. Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe! A bit time consuming but well worth the effort. Found that your hands will smell with the spices for days after making so if you don't want stinky hands wear gloves. Another way to get rid of the smell is to wipe your hands with lemon juice!  The best trick to these is to slice the meat as thin as you can and fry up with some olive oil. Also, use 1 tsp of salt like other reviews. Don't worry, the meat can handle it.

I used the spices from this recipe, reducing the thyme to a scant 1/2 tsp, and the flavors were great, very reminiscent of gyros.  Marjoram was the only spice I didn't have, so I used a little extra oregano, and used fresh where I could.  Instead of the meatloaf I made 6 thin hamburger patties, and we ate them instead pita pockets with fresh tatziki sauce, also fro this site.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Good flavor. I press the meat firmly into the pan before cooking. After cooking I let the meat rest refrigerator for 1 day then slice the meat into 1/8" thin strips with an electric knife.

The flavor is pretty much spot-on.  The texture of mine wasn't what I expected though.  I think I need to follow some of the other tips and process it a little longer, and perhaps pack it tighter in the pan.  Also, the 1 hour cook time does seem to fall a little short, but that's why they make meat thermometers.  My son and husband also suggested the pan-frying or grilling after slicing...to make it more authentic.  I think with a some tweaking in my techiques, it would be a 5-star!

Awesome!!!  I can't wait to make this for our Sunday family dinner (I married Greek.)  I took the suggestion to grill slices after baking--next time I think I will just chill and grill.  Also I'll add more salt but that is just me--I love this recipe thanks (and also I love your picture--great!)

This is, by far, my husbands favorite thing in the entire universe to eat.  He would eat this every day if he could.  After MONTHS of using this recipe and perfecting for my family's needs, I have only made two minor modifications.  The first is to use a teaspoon of onion powder instead of actual onion.  Makes it a bit thicker because of less liquid, I find it gives it a better texture, and my husband never gets indigestion like he does with fresh onion.  Second, as with most the other reviewers, is to up the amount of salt- generously.  I've found 1 teaspoon to be a decent amount, but I've gone up to 1.5 teaspoons before and had it turn out well.  Otherwise it's a perfect recipe.  Thank you for keeping my husband (and surprisingly, my kids!) happy.

I didn't change anything except for the salt and it was a terrible result. I was super excited and very patient. It was smelling so wonderful throughout the blending and preparation. Meat was dry as a bone. Even after not draining and frying in extra oil. It had a terrible texture as well. I hate meatloaf and would honestly rather eat meatloaf than a failed gyro that tastes like a failed meatloaf. I am usually not this critical but I am not a reviewer that made a bunch of changes and then complained that something went wrong. I followed the directions to the T and I do know what a real Gyro tastes like and would have been happy with a close home version. The seasoning was close, not 100%, but Close. Sadly though that was not enough to get past the horrible texture.  This was a waste of time, effort and expensive meat. So very sad but I truly will not be risking my food budget to try this again.

I can't give it 5 stars because I changed it!  I wanted to make it a little healthier, so I used ground chicken breast and added an egg.  I also just blended everything together in the food processor after the onions were squeezed dry and let it rest in the fridge for a few hours.  I baked it in the water bath, and was so excited that it came out just like a chicken gyro from my local Greek place.  The meat was not dry at all, which I was concerned about using chicken.  It had a great flavor and my husband loved it too.  A real winner!

This is the real deal, if you ever want to make your own gyros.  Well worth the time. I used my meat grinder attachment on a Kitchen Aide instead of a food processor. Worked great!

It wasn't perfect (a little dry), but I give it 5 stars anyway because it was the closest I've ever come to traditional gyro meat at home. Very tasty, and the seasoning is spot on.

This recipe is perfect. A nice way to make gyros at home and not use the "not so good" processed gyro strips.

Absolutely amazing, this was my first try at gyros and it turned out identical to, if not better than, the ones I've had from food trucks. I'll be making this a lot more often to satisfying the cravings.

Changed a few things after reading ALL the reviews. 2lbs lean meat and 4tsp salt was too much.
I used 2 tsp Italian seasoning 2tsp of Oregano 2tbsp garlic, no onion.
I didn't use a food processor...don't have one.
I pressed the meat in to a square pan VERY firmly.
Baked it for 45 min.
After cooling completely I was able to slice it fairly thin.
Far less hassle, despite it being too salty, it was very good.
I paired it off with the sweet sauce and it was as good as take out.

This was a great recipe for American gyro meat. Make sure you use all of the spices otherwise you won't get the correct gyro flavor. It'd be like making spaghetti sauce with no oregano. My wife does not eat lamb so the beef/lamb combo was out. I risked it all and used 1 pound of turkey and 1 pound of pork. It turned out great, but be warned, gyro spices are the same used in breakfast sausage. Since I used turkey/pork I basically made breakfast sausage sliced like gyro meat. I also did not hand mix and let sit then for 2 hours and then process it in the food processor. I just tossed everything in the food processor, processed it, stuck it in the pan and then let the pan sit in the fridge for two hours so that when I went to cook it everything was already cleaned up. When it was time to cook I followed the instructions of placing it on a towel in a bigger pan with water. This is required to keep the temperature on the outside of the gyro pan not more than 210 degress. If you want more of an authentic gyro meat you need to put in chunks of fat and some meat cubes after you process the meat in the food processor and then fry the slices after you cut them.

Just ate this and goodness, it is pretty darn close to what you can buy from a vendor!  I made the meat mixture as stated, but DID NOT blend in a blender, and the meat "loaf" was fine after baking.  I let the loaf sit for 2-3 hours, then baked at 325 for just over an hour (until the internal temp jived with the meat thermometer at 77 degrees F).  Baked in a water bath (pan underneath my small loaf pan had hot water in it--this was per another recipe and seemed to keep the loaf from getting a hard crust).  Refrigerated the baked loaf overnight.  Sliced into thin slices and heated the meat up in a frying pan with 1 tsp. of canola oil, browing the meat.  

Served with grilled pita bread (did this in a separate frying pan), tzaziki sauce, and a mixture of chopped lettuce, red onion, tomato chunks, and chopped cucumber slices.  Sprinkled a little spice blend on top of the prepared gyro (1 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1/2 tsp. sage).  Added some feta, then rolled the gyro up!  So YUMMY!!!

The tzaziki sauce I used is from the Easy Chicken Gyro recipe on this site (by KarenCanCook), which was awesome!

Not too bad, although a bit dry. I used ground pork in place of the lamb (Can not get lamb in Mexico). Tweaked the seasoning a bit by frying a small patty, tasting, adjusting. Did that twice til I was happy with the taste. By the time the sauce was added to the sandwich, it tasted great, just too dry.

A++  I'd never made gyro meat before, but thought I'd like to try.  I follwed the recipe using beef & pork, but I didn't have marjoram, and I did increase the salt to 1/2 tsp as other reviwers suggested.  When I baked it, I placed a piece of foil over the meat and put another loaf pan full of hot water on it for about half of the baking time, since some of the reviews stated that it was important to keep it compressed.  Half way though I took the extra weight and the foil off, to let the meat brown up, seemed to work perfectly for me, I didn't put a weight on it after I took it out of the oven.  My husband had this for dinner on Sat night, breakfast on Sun morning and also lunch on Sun... I'd say it was a hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fresh is best! For those who thought this recipe was bland, use fresh ingredients and use garlic, salt and pepper to taste and you wont be disappointed. 
I recommend using Greek yogurt topping with tomatoes and pitas as well!
The only thing I changed about this recipe is that I formed my loaf into 2 smaller loafs that were formed around skewers and cooked over a pan to catch the grease on the grill, (traditional Greek-style) turned out awesome!

I used Italian seasoning to replace much of the herbs because that's what I had.

This was wonderful and low carb!  I made it as listed except I doubled the salt as stated in other reviews and it was perfect.  I processed it all and pressed it into an 8x8 baking dish and then let it rest in the fridge for 2 hours, it came together quicker this way.  Then I baked it on convection setting for 30 minutes and it was done and very easy to slice into strips.  Froze half after slicing for a quick dinner later.  One loaf is 6-8 dinner sized servings, perfect to portion and freeze. I will be making this gyro loaf a couple times a month now, SO GOOD!

This was delicious and passed muster with my husband who had a hankering for some mediterranean fare the other night.  My one critique would be that it was a little dry, but then, maybe the meat I selected was a bit lean.  All in all, a great recipe though. Thanks!

I NEVER rate recipes or leave comments on here, but I LOVED LOVED LOVED this.  I had a serious craving for gyros and this really hit the spot! Plus, I was able to cut back on a few calories here and there with my own little changes.  This I will definitely make again and again!

The picture was so gorgeous I had to try these.  Couldn't find lamb here anywhere, so I decided to try just using beef.  Turned out great anyway!  I don't like cumin so I skipped that. I also didn't regrind and process the meat before i cooked it.  I will do that next time so that it hopefully will slice better.  I put in a little bit of Italian style bread crumbs because all the commercial recipes use it. It was just great. tasted just like every great gyro always tastes. Thanks for a great recipe.

really good. tastes just like the greek restaurant down the road. After I sliced the meat, I placed it in a hot skillet and kind of fried it a little to give it a crisper texture. Will make again!!! I also used 2lbs. ground lamb vs. the beef/lamb combo.

I am not from Greece, but I visited there once. The meat they use in the gyros there is rather dissimilar to what we get here in the US; basically simple, flame broiled pork. Also they put french fries on their gyros. All that has nothing to do with this recipe, which was delicious and tasted just like US restaurant gyro meat. I followed the recipe just as described and it was worth the effort.

I never thought that we could have homemade gyros! My daughter, the gyro expert, LOVED this recipe. I'm so happy I took the time to make it. . . I followed the recipe as written. My only question is, why do we put the towel in the pan with the water?

The flavors are spot on--delicious! The texture wasn't exactly like that in my favorite Greek restaurants. I'm not sure if that's because I used a blender to puree the meat (I don't have a food processor) or if it's just not possible to re-create that texture at home without a spit to grill the meat. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the blender. I will double the salt next time I make this. I served with homemade pita and tzatziki, both recipes from this site. My husband raved, and begged me to make this again.

The meat was very bland and the texture was not even close to what you get in the restaurants. I'm sorry.  I was not impressed.

This recipe was sooo delicious.! I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was still amazing. It does need a bit more salt. I learned that it tastes best when it is frozen after being cooked and then sliced the next day and pan fried. Since there wasnt enough salt I had to pan fry it in a bit of olive oil and then add a couple of tablespoons of water that had 1/16 tsp of salt in it. I just wish I could have perfected a sauce to place over the meat.  Placing the meat in the processor does wonders to its texture and tastes. Aside from the lamb (I try not to eat red meat) I think that I have a recipe for the books!

I omitted the step with the roasting pan and boiling water.  I just baked the meat mixture in a meat loaf pan with a towel over the top.  The flavor of this meat is dead on for what I expect Gyros to taste like.  If only something could be done about the texture...

I felt this tasted like dried out meatloaf and the amount of cumin made it taste like a mexican dish. Followed it to the letter except using pork instead of lamb...have a ton of leftovers I don't know what I will do with.

I have to say, after making this I just couldn't eat it.  My husband, however, loved it.  I did take one bite and it was really flavorful but just too gamey for me.

Eh I had problems with this recipe. I followed it exactly but in the end it resembled meatloaf, not gyro meat. I put it in the food processor and let it do its thing but it kept wading up into balls and not chopping...I dunno why I had problems with this...it was good...but not gyros :(

Bland to my tastes, and I Followed the recipe to the letter.  (Odd for me).  I think adding fresh ground coriander, doubling the garlic and rosemary will fix it.  Deli Gyro is much richer and more savory.

I am so surprised how well this turned out and how close it is to restaurant-style. I used 4 cloves of garlic (4 tsps of minced garlic in the jar) and 2 tsps of all other spices. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and used Alton Brown's tzatziki recipe.  It is delicious!

This is such an Awesome recipe, we enjoy this once a month, either as a sandwich, lettuce wrap, in a salad, even as a breakfast roll cant believe how good this IS with just about everything. We enjoy slicing, then reheating on a grated pan with its juices mixed with sage infused olive oil. I too also increased the salt to a tbsp and 2 tsp each of cumin and oregano. Let it meld together overnight then process in the morning, once cooked let cool cover with foil and do use the brick, finally slice reheat and enjoy.

We love garlic and onion, so I did add the whole onion...and maybe a 'bit' more garlic! :-)  I was pressed for time, so I did not do the 2nd run through the food processor. Next time, I won't skip that part- the taste was perfect, but the texture was more like a meatloaf. I think a 2nd whirl would have changed that. Served to half Greek hubby and our full Greek friend...got the seal of approval from both!

There is a key step that is left out to make it restaurant quality, broil it for 10 minutes on a baking rack. To make the outside crispy. Then refrigerate it till it is solid enough to  slice thinly. Take the slices and grill them like bacon and serve in a pita with tomato and tzatziki. Absolute perfection. Or crisp it up and slice it fresh and hot  off of a rotating rotisserie if you have one.

First time making gyro. Turned out great but I just used the recipe as a technique guide. I added way more onion and garlic, salt, oregano... Basically doubling all the flavor.
I also used venison because that's all I have. It's a GREAT way to use gamey meat.
Will add this to my repertoire. My family loved it.

I agree the prep was a little time consuming. Everyone loved it BUT I expected more flavor and will  tweak the spice next time. My ONLY issue with this was attempting to shave the loaf rather than slice hunks of meat for the gyros. Does anyone have suggestions to shave the loaf more like a Greek restaurant does from the cone of meat?

I made this with the ground meat and didn't turn into the meatloaf style.  It was great! I made it with the lamb and ground turkey but cooked it with the spices and beef broth and a bit of green onion.  I left the rest of the recipe the same.  Delicious!

Perfectly delicious. I cheat a bit by substituting beef with Italian style sausage, for a flavor boost. Even my picky eaters ask for seconds. And thirds.

I made this tonight and it was wonderful. The only thing I did different is added more garlic and after slicing the meat,I fried them before serving. It was very good and tasted just like what you would get in a restaurant. I think letting the meat set longer then 2hours would be even better. I will try that next time.

Great recipe! I've been eating homemade gyros all week and loving it. I made the recipe exactly as written (but added a bit more salt based on reviews). Prep was simple. My food processor is small so had to do that in batches, but the consistency is worth it. Sliced it thin, and browned it in a non-greased, non-stick skillet. Perfection! You get a ton of meat if sliced thinly -- I will take this to my next party and serve on mini pitas for an appetizer to share, served with tomatoes and Tzatziki Sauce II from this site, which was also good (but if you make it, halve the recipe).

The recipe was good, my meat was a little dry inside but a lot of fat on the ouside and I double the amount of salt and still felt it was a little low, don't forget to grind all your spice and next time I will try only with lamb like alton brown to see the diferents. I didn't get the street flavor from New york that I was looking for but not bad for my first gyros at home.

This was slightly bland I agree with the rest of the reviewers. I didnt have the marjoram either so I used 1 tsp of poultry seasoning since it has alot of the same spices, upped the garlic, salt and a good squeeze of lemon juice. It took me quite a while in the food processor to get it mixed well and paste like too. I baked mine for 1 hr and 15 mins, drained and then let it rest and cool down..sliced it thin and since I didnt want to fiddle with a grill I then fried in some butter in a pan and it was nice n crispy :)

I didn't have any marjoram so I had to leave it out. Will try it next time. I did follow some of the other recommendations regarding the salt. I ended up putting 2 teaspoons of sea salt and I liked it. The texture isn't quite like the gyros I get at the restaurant but overall it was quite tasty. I'll make it again and put it in my favorites list.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time it was very bland. The second time I doubled all the spices and increased the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons. After chilling and slicing I put the slices under the broiler until they started to crisp. It was much better the second time around.

wow, this turned out really great.  it was easy to make in the food processor, and I was intrigued with the baking method but followed the directions and it turned out great!  I wish I could slice it as thin as you get it at Greek restaurants, but even though I couldn't, it did stay together well while I sliced it as thinly as I could.

Very yummy!  I couldn't find ground lamb, but lamb stew meat worked.  I "ground" it up with my food processor after I did the onions.  Worked like a charm!  I just wish that I could slice it as thinly as they do at the restaurant.  My electric knife did a better job once it had cooled, but it still could have been thiner.  No other complaints, though.  I will definitely make this again!

I didn't care for it, but my mother did. I thought the spice combination was odd, but other people liked it.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I added more salt) and it tasted wonderful but was very dry.  Next time I will cook to medium, slice and finish the browning on the grill.

never in my wildest dreams did i think i'd find a recipe that so closely resembled street cart gyro deliciousness. this NAILED IT!!!!!!!!! Agree with other reviewers that food processing the meat, and straining the onions is key to good texture. we only let it rest a couple of hours before cooking, that was plenty of time for it to rest.

This was not my cup of tea. I live in area where there are lots of greek and arabic resturants I have Gyro's from all different places, to think this recipe did not taste like any I have had. The thyme and rosemary over powered the taste, that was all I tasted even with tzatzki sauce. My husband loved it, he thought the flavors were awesome. If I made this again the thyme would be left out, the rosemary and cumin would be cut in half. I did like others and add 1 teaspoon of sea salt. I would also use 1/2 pound of lamb to 1 pound of beef.

Decent recipe. I put in a whole onion and used two pounds of lamb instead of a beef/lamb mixture. I also added a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to give it a meatloaf texture.

This is pretty tasty - I thought it was a lot of work at first, and slightly (just slightly) dry.  But the flavor is wonderful.  The fact that my I had terrible quality pitas definitely did not help.

I really enjoyed this recipe... the flavor was kinda lacking but the texture was really good. I ended up using some different seasonings recipe but I am cooking it in the water bath, which I think is really the key! Thanks for posting!

Made exactly as written, but despite the amount of spices it was still somewhat bland.  Texture was also not as expected.  But overall, it was pretty decent especially considering you're making a "pressed meat" at home.

I gave this 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used pork in place of lamb and I did not have marjoram so I used a little oregano instead. It was ok but nothing like you get at a Greek restaurant. I wouldn't make it again maybe just once to try it using lamb to see if that makes all the difference.

I increased the salt to 1 tsp (as suggested by other reviewers) --- it is still not as salty as restaurant gyros meat (this is good!!!).  I didn't squeeze the liquid out of the onion, and I added all of the spices and pulsed on the processor before adding in the meats.  Left it in the fridge about 3 hours before roasting.  Mine took a little longer than an hour in the oven, and I love the idea of baking it in a water bath --- this really cuts down on the crutiness of the loaf.  I found a recipe on YouTube for "GyrosBread"! (at 3FDK8mZnMng) that are made fresh ---- WOW!  I will put some of the meat and pitas into the freezer and see how that works.

Very good recipe....I will up the spices to fit our taste preference in the future. I will also likely use Greek seasoning and Canadian steak seasoning.  I did squeeze lemon juice on top of the loaf before cooking.

Very tasty! Even after throwing it in the food processor, the texture was a little "air-ier" than the meat you'd get at a gyro place, but that could be a result of my technique, or the density/quality of their meat. Beats any gyro we could get around here, so I won't complain.

Couldn't find ground lamb so I ended up using ground chicken and ground beef.  I found it really really really dry.  We ate it...but it had to have a TON of tzatziki sauce on it.

I love, love, love Gyros!  This was pretty darn good.  The ONLY thing that this recipe lacked was a little extra salt.  I would probably bump it up to a 1/2 teaspoon next time.  I never knew I could make the meat for a gyro!  Thanks for sharing.  Now when I get a craving I wont have to wait for the fair:)

This was so much better than I had hoped!  It isn't as solid or dry as the meat I am used too but it's great to be able to make such a close proximity when there isn't a gyro place within 300 miles!  We used the grill and it was perfect!

I tripled the spice amounts. And after it cooked and cooled I cut it into thin slices and layered them between wax paper and froze them. Easy to pull out a single serving. Threw the frozen slices into a hot pan and by the time the defrosted and got hot they was also a beautiful moderate char. Made weeknight meals super easy especially cooking for one or two.

I really like this recipe! It's nice to be able to make something that's more traditional instead of ordering take out 
When I make this I put it on a cookie sheet so it's nice and thin and gets a bit more of a crust on it. SO YUMMY!!! my whole family loves it and loves the homemade cucumber sauce I make to go with it.

Per other reviews, I increased the garlic and salt. Tastes wonderful! I also pan fried slices before serving. Texture was spot on, I wrapped and weighted down the loaf overnight in the fridge.

Used Beyond meat. Came out excellent. Could use a little more salt and garlic.

This recipe is fantastic! I did change the salt amount to 1 teaspoon and added a couple extra garlic cloves after reading the reviews and it turned out absolutely delicious. Unlike a lot of people who left reviews, I went out and bought majorem because I did not have any either (LOL) so I could follow the recipe exactly where the spices were concerned and the flavor was off the charts

I had a wonderful outcome making this dish even though I doubled the recipe. However, after the meat had cooled I cut a couple of slices and then pan fried them in a little oil so that the meat had a bit of a char. By going the extra mile it tasted even more like the Gyro meat that is sliced off the spit.

This was awesome! Everyone really enjoyed it. I don't have a food processor and I nearly broke my blender trying to turn the meat to paste. In the end I just chopped the heck out of the meat with a cleaver and the texture was nice. I'm excited to try this again and to tweak the spices.

This recipe disappointed, was not as moist and flavorful as I had hoped.  I did not have a roaster so used a dutch oven with a ceramic loaf pan and water inside.  Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty much as written.  Did not overcook - checked with a digital thermometer.  I found it hard to do the food processor steps with a consumer grade Cuisinart food processor.  The suggestions to up the garlic and grill the slices might have helped.

Not sure what went wrong, but it was the driest meat I’ve ever cooked in my life. And there was not much flavor either.

Love gyros! Lived in Germany and our village had a great Turkish vendor who made the best gyros. This recipe was very reminiscent,  however, had to add a little more salt/garlic to the seasoning to make it more flavorful.

Great recipe! It is not exactly like eating at a Greek restaurant, but definitely comes close and is way better than "gyros" at a festival or event.  I followed the recipe as stated except for marjoram, because I did not have it. Do not skip putting the meat in the food processor, it makes a difference.  Served the meat with homade Naan and tzatziki also found on this site.  Everyone was happy happy happy!

I loves me some gyros, and while this won't replace the genuine article I have to admit this meatloaf definitely scratched an itch. Might have gone heavier on some of the herbs. Did NOT use a food processor, just worked it a bit longer. Sprinkled bread crumbs on top and sides prior to baking. Served with Cous Cous, Greek Green Beans (also from Allrecipes), pita bread, and fresh made Tzatziki Sauce. Drop the mic - dinner is served!!!

Made this with the beef/pork  combo.
It did turn out very well, but is a bit dry.
I did 'brick' it overnight  in the loaf pan after cooking and think it is worth the effort. You can buy a brick at home depot for under 50 cents if you need to. I recommend washin it prior to use as I did find some cold fat under the foil when I removed it and was happy I had washed the brick first.
I used the tzatziki recipe from here as well.
It does need the extra salt added.
I found it easier to slice it thin by turning it on it's side while cold and using a sharp carving knife to cut the slices.
It made quite a few slices and will make a several sandwiches.
My husband was rolling his eyes when I was prepping it as he thought I was wasting my time and his money.
He said it was 'okay'.  He has taken it 2 days in a row for lunch and had it for dinner twice, the second night was he's suggestion! I guess he really does think it's 'okay'!!!
I have tried it fried in different ways from butter to coconut oil, olive oil and kraft zesty italian salad dressing. I can't say which is a favourite as they were all good. We did prefer Naan over pita or tortilla for the wrap.
I may try lamb next time as I checked the grocery store and they carry ground lamb, but I've never cooked with lamb before.
Try it, I think you will like it!

I've made this a couple of times, very tasty.  This time I processed the meat with a paddle in the mixer and then ground it in the food processor,  vacuum sealed the loaf and I will sous vide it after an overnight in fridge then torch it brown.  I hope it cooks up a bit more dense this way.

Definitely needs more salt. I am disappointed that I did not read more reviews. Many people said so. I too found this a little bland. Smells incredible when cooking so I had high expectations. This is not as good as cafe NEO gyros.  However i can not figure out what spice it is missing.

I liked it very much, but couldn't find my processors metal blade so I used the dough blade, and my onions weren't finally chopped enough and texture was all wrong. I think This would certainly be a 5 star if i used proper blade. Will make again with proper blade in future.

I minced fresh herbs from my garden and tripled the amount called for in exchange for the dried. The recipe took a bit longer to execute than I would normally plan for, but the work & the wait was definitely worth the results! Delicious and more healthy than going out for gyros! Even works great as a Gyro Salad.

This is a delicious recipe.........for doner. This is not a traditional "Greek" gyro recipe, it is a Lebanese/Middle Eastern recipe for ground meat served in slices like a meatloaf, called doner. You can't call this gyro.

So if you like ground meat the way they do in the Middle East, then yes, use ground lamb and/or beef with these spices to make what is called a doner.

If you like the classic gyro you got to enjoy in Greece which is slabs of pork and/or lamb, then use a REAL gyro recipe, a Greek recipe.. 

Sadly, not many in North America know the history of food when it comes to the difference between gyro and doner. The term "gyro" has been watered down to mean any type of Greek sandwich with meat. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Recipe is good, we ate it 2 nights in a row and my husband never eats leftovers. I did set a loaf pan on top of the pan the meat was baking in with 2 bricks in it to help compress  the meat some and it really helped keep it dense.

Great gyro meat. I made this ahead of time, sliced it, and froze the slices for an easy weeknight meal. I just reheated the slices in the microwave.

The only change I made was to use ground pork instead of the lamb since I could not find any locally.

Make this ASAP! Only thing I do different is let the loaf cool, then slice and bake a tiny bit so every bite has a slight crunch (I suggest parchment for this). You do not need to take the extra step, I just like it that way, just like I twice cook my taco meat:) make this recipe and enjoy every wonderful bite!!

I made it exactly per the recipe. Very good flavor... just like the flavor of the restaurant gyro meat but mine was VERY dry. I did use very lean grass-fed ground lamb and beef so I added some olive oil to the meat mixture so it wouldn't be dry. Maybe I should have added more. With the onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and tzatziki sauce it wasn't too bad. Very excellent flavor!

Almost 5 stars! Based on reviewer suggestions, I doubled the seasoning and added extra salt. Used a brick during cooking to make sure meat remained compact. Not sure if it made a difference, but it didn't hurt. Perfect texture and got rave reviews on it.

I originally found a recipe for Gyros on Pinterest bc I’m on a limited income and wanted to make them at home. I thought I’d check Allrecipes.. and glad I did!  It had some of the same ingredients but this recipe added a lot more spices to the meat. It turned out AMAZING. I did add more salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I did not purée onions bc I’m lazy lol and I did not purée the meat in a food processor bc I don’t have one. I added dried minced onion and onion powder instead. It just came out of the oven and I can’t wait to make gyros! I’m on a limited income and wanted to try to make them myself. 5 stars! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I doubled all the spices except for oregano, cumin, and salt - for those I used four times the recommended amount or more! I let it marinate in the fridge for about 90 minutes and had to put it through the food processor in batches because I have a smaller, less powerful machine. Baked in two loaf pans in the manner described. After baking I sliced and seared in olive oil until crisp. Wonderful in gyros, in salads, or plain! Will make again for sure.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with one exception, I made a half batch. With all the positive reviews, I had a high expectations. Unfortunately, not a fan of this recipe at all, the flavor Was blah and the texture was like meatloaf, And yes I processed it in the food processor.

Followed the recipe exactly and the meat was very bland. I had to slice and pan fry in olive oil to brown a bit to get the texture I'm expecting. I eat at Coney/ Greek restruants at least twice a week....this taste nothing like the gyro meat I get there. It wasn't horrible, just tasteless.

I made it as the recipe stated and it was pretty good. These adjustments I made afterward to suit our tastes: 1. After slicing meat -brown the slices in a pan with some oil. 2. The spices were too lite for our tastes. Next time  1/2 tsp for salt, pepper, and cumin  and increase all the other spices to 1 TB.

Very, very strong tasting! More so than gyro meat at a Greek restaurant. The texture of the meat is different too. I live in an area with no Greek restaurants. I will have to wait to visit a big city to enjoy gyros the way I love them.

Wow, this was great! It tasted just like gyro meat from our the greek restaurant we ate at when I was a kid. Delicious! Blending it up, like she says really gives it that gyro meat textures, unlike meatloaf. I made a couple changes which may or may not have improved the original recipe. 
1. I used 50/50 Lamb and Turkey
2. I added an egg to the meat mixture, as a binder
3. I sprinkled a Tablespoon of cornstarch into the meat mixture as a binder.
4. I added a lot more salt as reviews had mentioned, probably 2 teaspoons, maybe more.

This came out great. I followed the recipe and the only changes I made we're to the amount of salt and garlic.  I tripled the amount of garlic and used 4 teaspoons of kosher salt. I used 1 lb of 90 / 10 ground sirloin and one pound of lamb meat.
I also let the meat mixture sit in the fridge for 4 hours to let the seasonings meld. Instead of using a food processor, I used the tenderizing side of a meat mallet and pound it out the meat mixture for a couple minutes on one side then scooped it up, flips it over and pounded it out for a couple more minutes on the other side. I then put it into the loaf pan and cooked it as directed to 165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature. I saved the loaf pan juices and put it to the side. I then let the meat rest for 10 minutes before cutting it. I then sliced the meat about a quarter inch thin and pan-fried it in just a little bit of olive oil to slightly crisp up the edges. I then served it up on a lightly pan fried pita bread with homemade tzatziki sauce, tomato and onion. 
It turned out to be very good.

seems over-herbed when you eat it by itself, but once on flatbread with tzaziki, excellent!  i did use a suggestion from a diff recipe to slice some off after cooked and cook a few minutes more at high heat to crisp up the edges, and that made it even better.

My first time making gyro meat. I didn't have a deep roasting pan to do a water bath so I flattened the meat out onto a cookie sheet and baked it that way. It still turned out moist and very flavorful. Thank you for the recipe.

Many reviewers mentioned that they doubled the spices and still didn't care for the gyro.  I think the taste and texture of this recipe is based on the meat being put into a food processor to achieve the proper "look!"..  I like to put small amount of  cold meat at a time (about a tennis ball size) into the processor and make it into a PASTE, then follow the cooking directions.  Let meat cool and refrigerate several hours.  Slice into strips, using a thin knife blade.. That is the secret.  The raw meat looks awful but, tastes delicious.

Very authentic Greek! Had to add a little salt however. And the tip to press out the extra cucumber juice was good. I used reg cucs not ENGLISH that would have been less juicy. Family loved it!!!

This is a 5-star recipe with the essential modifications noted by other reviewers:  SALT. I used nearly 1 tsp based on reviews and found it still needed a very light sprinkling after slicing.  Will mix more into the meat next time. Also, saving the drippings from the loaf pan and using them to fry the slices prior to serving is what made the final result a real success. The loaf comes out compact and dry (as expected) which makes for easy slicing but not a texture that is lovely on the palate. Browning slices in the drippings is the finishing touch. Save drippings in the fridge to brown the leftovers also. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was very good... Let me tell you what I did to make it great. First, and this is just a small thing, I added about triple the seasonings in the recipe so it had alot of flavor. Second, and this was great but everyone might not have the ability do do this: I only cooked it as described in the oven for 20  minutes then took it out and put it on my skewers for my indoor rotisserie (showtime) and cooked it for another hour. It turned out great and looked just like the gyro meat on the stick at the local Greek deli. The reason I cooked for 20 minutes in the oven was the keep the ground meat together for the skewers.

This was my first time making gyro meat and i'm so glad I used this recipe! The only changes I made were the garlic (used 4 grated cloves) , added like 1/4tsp ground allspice and 2tsp salt. The method worked perfectly, I let it sit in the fridge overnight to really let the flavors marry. 

I made wheat pita, baked some fries. used a greek dressing from the site and made a tzatziki sauce to go with my platter. Everything was delicious! It would be enough to feed 4 hungry people but any more, if they like meat, make another loaf! Thanks for the recipe!

Fried slices - loved it. Used half beef and half pork b/c local store did not have lamb. After baking, refrigerated overnight with weight to compress, but not sure it actually compressed. However, it may have contributed to ease in slicing.

I made this again just the other day.  Good Grief, you'll never want a gyro at a restaurant again.  It takes about an hour to prepare.  Make sure you have a LOT of onion!  The cucumber sauce is easy.

Hello!!! I used this recipe a number of times. I recently made a change. I place a fire brick wraped in heavy duty tin foil that fits my loaf pan on the meat.  It gives the baked meat a denser texture.  Thanks for  being out there!! Semper Fi! Godspeed!!

We end up with several pounds of ground venison this time of year, and it works great in this recipe. I use an egg, but maybe two would be even better, otherwise the lean venison doesn't bind together very well and it falls apart when you cut it. I've also used bison in this recipe and it's really good, too. The trick is definitely in the slamming the meat on the counter or in a large bowl. I use this recipe 3-4 times a year and my family loves it. Thanks!

This was fantastic! I must say the meat turned out a little dry, but I think that was cooking error on my part. Combine this with homemade pitas, and everything else, it makes for a lovely meal.

This  was not the same flavor and texture as what I have come to expect in good Greek restaurants.  I'll try it again because my wife loves gyros, but I'll double the spices next time.

This recipe was so off i created a profile on this site just to share. Alton Brown has one that actually tastes pretty close. For the sake of always trying new things I used this recipe instead of alton ' s . It turned out like a dry meat loaf and the thyme was not balanced to the other flavors .  The only thing that made this a 2 stars and edible was the homemade pitas, vegetables and tzatziki I put on it.

We really liked this! I followed other reviewers' recommendations to finish by broiling the thinly sliced pieces, and it was wonderful. I did also increase salt. Great recipe!

The flavor was too complicated and weak, and didn't like the cumin.

Very good, used lamb and very necessary to process it. Towel and water to keep it from drying out. When done I drained the juice and pressed the loaf with a foil wrapped brick and put in fridge with brick. Neat day, sliced thinly and crisped up in skilled. Heaven. Drained juice in fat separator and used this to add flavor to meat.

I made it I did 1 lbs of beff and 1.75 of lamb.. Added extra of every seasoning since I had more lamb. One thing a say don't be shy on the sea salt. But don't over do it. Not sure what the towel and water thing was. So I just made it into a meatloaf after putting it in the pros. And just just put it on 325 heat for 1 HR and 40 min. Came out soo good. The sauce was also easy. 1 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, I whole cucumber. 2 table spoons of lime juice fresh. 1 tablespoon dill, and salt pepper to your liking. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Cut up those tomatoes and lettuce and some red onion and make your gyro. Hope this helps. Again, idk bout that towel and stuff I just made it into a meatloaf and baked

I love gyros and the combination of the meat and the other flavors. I decide to try for that at home and really had low expectations especially since I could not locate lamb..which I believed to be the star of the show. But to my surprise this recipe is awesome and I had to sub pork for my lamb. It was great. The rest I followed exactly. I cant wait to try it with lamb.

I found this recipe quite easy and pretty close to an the gyro meat taste without the spit. I only made a few of the modifications as others had mentioned. Additional salt and a bit more garlic and I think the food processor is critical. I finished this off pan grilling a thin slice of the meat with a fresh Pita, homemade tzatziki and the usual toppings.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. The house smelt amazing the whole time it was cooking. In my opinion, they were just okay to the taste. The flavour definitely needed to pop more in your mouth. After reading more reviews I would have to agree with the others as far as adding more salt and garlic. Slicing the meat then placing them in the oven under the broiler is a must, to get that authentic texture.

Came out dry although i did not overcook, it actually had a pinkish center so on the contrary. The thyme and oregano are overwhelming for the amount of mea I omitted rosemary and marjoram. I put 3/4 Tsp and that was ok but could have used more.

This recipe is really pretty close to the  stuff you find at the fair.  I like the mix of spices, but agree, it needed more onion and garlic and salt.  I'll probably be making it again, though I will spice it up more.  Not sure if I will go out of my way to find the lamb, may substitute something else, it didn't seem to add as much to the flavor as I thought it would.

Over the top. I added 4 fresh garlic cloves to the onions an extra tspn of kosher salt. Once the loaf was cool, sliced up, placed on the griddle to crisp up. Warmed the pitas on the griddle with olive oil fetta and red onion, placed thre meat , sliced tomatoe and shredded lettue with a a couple splases of ranch dressing.

This is a keeper.

Followed recipe exactly. Smelled really good, but after cooking, then slicing and frying the next day it was rather dry and not very flavorful. Kinda a bland, very blended meatloaf. Disappointed as I had high hopes after all the positive reviews and tips.

Didn't taste like gyro meat I got from restaurants, but even without that comparison it was pretty bland,  and I doubled spices.

It took mine about an hour and 15 minutes to reach 165 degrees.

It tasted too much like taco meat to me, probably because of the cumin.  Also didn't like the texture of the meat itself, but that could be because my food processor is terrible.  Came out too much like spicy meatloaf for my taste.  Either way, probably won't make these again.

Wow! This is insanely delicious! I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and used a whole onion. I also went rogue with the spices and almost doubled the amount suggested, especially the salt and pepper.  I let it be in the over for 50 minutes but honestly I probably could have taken it out at 40 minutes. I will be making this again. And again. And again!

Made these yesterday with homemade tzatziki and homemade pita bread.  This was my first time making gyros.  I deviated from the recipe by adding a whole onion instead of 1/2, went with 1 tsp. sea salt and did 3 good size heads of garlic that I minced up.  Since I have sweet marjoram and thyme growing in my herb garden I did a Tbsp of both which equals 1 tsp. of dried herbs.  Also, I mortal and pestled my rosemary so it was a fine consistency and mainly to wake the flavors up which go dormant when dried (you can do this by mashing the dried herbs up in the palm of your hand, except for rosemary...ouch).   For meat I used 1 lb of ground lamb and 1 lb of 90% lean ground beef.
The flavors were outstanding, could taste all the herbs... wow... impressed with that!  But even though it was in the glass baking dish sitting in water with a towel in a roasting pan as it cooked and shrunk (got so much smaller) in it's own fat,  it was horribly dry, I can't express how dry it was.  I will definitely add 1/2 cup of plain breadcrumbs to this recipe as a fixture, it really needs something inside the meat to help hold onto the juice especially since we've strained the hell out of the onion.  Which makes sense since we're not wanting the taste of the water in the onion but the taste of the juices in the meat.  Once it was sliced up for sammies I wanted to put each slice in a pan to give a little crisp on each side but I couldn't because it was already so dry.  Overall my man liked it.

Mincing the onion in the food processor and wringing out the water was sheer genius. I made some minor alterations because it's impossible to find lamb where I live and because my oven is broken, but I tried to keep as true to it as I could. I had to use straight beef. Next time, I'll look for meat loaf mix, as the recipe would benefit from a little more fat in the meat, I think. I used 3/4 onion, 1 clove of garlic, 1 pound of 85% lean ground beef, and the remaining ingredients the same... kinda. I used a lot less black pepper because my husband is sensitive to it. I used the recommended amounts of oregano, marjoram, thyme, and cumin, but I started with dried herbs, not ground, and ground them by hand in a mortar and pestle. I also added 1 teaspoon of ground coriander because I always use coriander and cumin together. I don't have a working oven right now, so I shaped the mixture into a flattened log and grilled it over propane. The end result was absolutely delicious, and everyone in my husband's gaming group wants me to make it again soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made exactly as recipe states. Will try pan-frying or grilling the leftovers to get a crisper texture. Good flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly using beef and pork (no ground lamb available).  Used the exact proportions and the food processor as instructed.  This was a bland meatloaf at best.  Not very flavorful, crumbly and the wrong texture.

I was kind of disappointed. I had previously tried a different recipe and I guess I should have stuck with it. I did not read the reviews before I made it. Mistake. I use very little salt but this definitely needs more. I wish I had skipped the thyme. Way too much. Definitely should have taken it out before 165 degrees. I hate we'll done meat but I know that many people like it well cooked. I like the recipe with the egg, this was too dry. Granted I did not use beef and lamb but still very disappointed.

My family loved it (they didn't want to try it since they haven't liked gyros before).  I ended up using 93% lean ground beef and ground turkey.  Made homemade tzatziki.  This is a keeper...

This was my first attempt at making Gyros at home, and I wasn't able to get the clean slices, it came out in crumbly pieces like a meat loaf. It tasted like a meat loaf too, Of course I didn't let the seasonings sit in the meat, and I have a junky food processor, although I thought the meat seemed tacky when I put it in. 

Next time I will let the seasonings sit longer and use a better food processor, also will add more salt as that seems to be a running suggestion here. Still a decent meal. 4 Stars because it was still a good meal, even if I am way far off from actually having tasty Gyros because of my own faults. :)

The flavors are definitely there but for some reason I thought mine came out a little dry (maybe the type of burger I used) and it did take a little while to make. Because of this and the fact that hubby is not really a big gyro fan I probably won't make it again but I would suggest that others try it as it may be worth it for you make instead of going out for it.

First let me state that I do not have a food processor, so it was chopped by hand (a tedious process) and this could be part of the reason to my dislike of it. It was flavorless, dry, and I would never make it again. If you have a food processor, maybe the taste will be better.

Very good recipe - but agree - needs some more salt for sure ~ I will certainly make this again and I will definitely be adding all sorts of yummy spices! I really had to drain off the liquid a bit more, but well worth it. I used a loaf pan, so the cooking time was longer, but it worked just as good. I will be making this with pita and tzatziki for dinner - BUT I will definitely take the advise of others an grill the meat quickly first! :) Yummy!

Very good. I stuck to the recipe with a few exceptions. I only had 3/4 lb of ground lamb, so I also only used 3/4 lb of ground beef, but left measurements on the seasonings as the recipe calls for. The end result was tasty. This had a slightly different texture than restaurant gyros off that gigantic spit, a little more like a meatloaf texture, but it still held together when slicing it. Also, this seemed to be far less greasy than restaurant gyros, which is a plus. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will be making it again.

I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe a lot but don't have a food processor so the onions were too large. The consistancy would have been perfect if the onions and possibly the meat had been food processed too but it was still very good. I had to pour off the liquid several times but the "lamb" was actually from a ram that had had to be processed due to a broken leg so for obvious reasons was fattier. I didn't have a problem with the amount of salt but almost never cook with salt due to water retention. All my spices were very fresh so the spicing was good.

This is GREAT! Tastes traditional to me. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the baking temp. I had to raise it to 375 to get the internal meat temp to 165. I paired it with Tzatziki Sauce from Debnjames from this site. So good!

Fantastic! The only thing I added was a little more salt to it. Traditional taste, and I made home-made tzatziki and pita's for it to go on. Slightly time consuming, I would make this the day before and re-heat.
My husband and kids loved it, I had a difficult time slicing the meat because hubby's fingers were in the way stealing my "imperfect" pieces - meaning anything he could get his fingers on.

It needs a lot more salt than the amount listed in the recipe and I had to cook it for about 1.25 hours. I also substituted the lamb with ground turkey for health reasons, and it was very bland but moderately tasty when covered with tzatziki sauce and greek salad in pitas.  I wouldn't recommend substituting turkey.
