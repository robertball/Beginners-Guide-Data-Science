These were at hit at our beer tasting last night!  I made per the recipe, though I did leave my cucumbers a touch bigger than "minced" and used white pepper in place of black pepper, per personal preference.   The only person who didn't care for these was someone who doesn't care for goat cheese, which is to be expected.  I can see myself making these again for a last minute snack for unexpected guests.  THANKS for the recipe!

Make sure you use an English (seedless) cucumber!

I left out the salt because I know what it does to cucumber, but even so it resulted in a soggy mess and had to be thrown out.  Won't make it again.

This was my first time having goat cheese so I was a little worried about not liking it, but I was pleasantly surprised at the fresh burst of cucumber and dill that helped tame the tanginess of the cheese. The thin Pretzel Crisp underneath helped ground it and add an extra touch of salt, while also providing texture. My entire dinner party enjoyed this!
