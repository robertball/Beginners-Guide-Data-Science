Great combo with the salt and the sweet sugary caramel. These are different from the usual and looked pretty too. Only you have to work fast because the caramel hardens and the salt wouldn't stick. I dipped all apples first then did the salt, and the chocolate last, but like I said the salt didn't stick and I kind of had to press the pieces into the caramel. These are even better tasting than the plain caramel apples. If you like the contrast of sweet/salty you'll like these. Thanks for the great idea!!! I had so much fun making these.

Hands down, most DELICIOUS way to eat a caramel apple.  The combo of sweet, crunchy, tart, salty is to die for.  We prefer to omit the chocolate.  You really just need to strategically place a few large grains of the salt on the caramel.  That is A LOT of salt on the apples that are pictured.  Fleur de sel is always a treat, if you have it.  And always use a tart variety apple, NEVER Red Delicious.

This is soooo much better rolled in pretzel pieces than just plain coarse salt. The pretzels paired with the chocolate and caramel made these wonderful!

It was better than I expected.  I'm a classic carmel apple guy, this was a nice variation.

Good caramel apples but I suggest much less salt on the ingredients list.  All you need is a couple pieces per apple.  I wasn't thinking and made the mistake of using dark chocolate chips and they just don't work with the sweet, salty, and tart of the apples.  I bet these are great with semi-sweet chips.

I normally love salty sweet combo's but this one didn't do it for me.  I found the tart/salty/sweet combo to be strange in this case.

These were great.  I made them for a Halloween party and used a melon baller/ice cream scoop to make smaller apples.  Only problem was that caramel slid off and pooled around the bottom.  Followed directions completely.  They looked ugly but tasted great!

Great texture for dipping apples! Make sure to get the waxy coating off your apples and chill them before dipping to help the caramel stick and cool quickly. The salt is fantastic.
