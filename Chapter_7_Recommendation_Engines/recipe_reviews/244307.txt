I didn't have time to go get limeade concentrate so I just used some frozen Bacardi margarita mixer I had in the freezer and it came out just fine.  I did add a drop of green food coloring to make it a little more green.  Also used "neufchatel" cheese since my daughter is on a low cholesterol diet and a gluten free graham cracker crust since my son has celiac.  And skipped the cherry pie filling topping since it just seemed weird.  Instead of refrigerating it for 4 hours, I put it in the freezer for an hour and then moved it back to the fridge until ready to serve.  So basically, I used the recipe as a "suggestion/guideline" but it came out great.  My stepson said it tasted like key lime pie.
