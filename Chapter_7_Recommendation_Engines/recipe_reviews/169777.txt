These were very good.  Was looking for a new recipe for Kale and found this.  They are definitely spicy and the Kale cooks down quite a bit.  Seems critically important to toss and coat the kale leaves evenly with the oil and spices.  Note that ours were a bit salty as I overdid the salt.  Probably something you want to experiment with in terms of exact seasoning amounts.

I was very excited to try this recipe with some leftover kale.  I made the mistake of over salting...I didn't have kosher salt and just used sea salt and should have decreased the amount.  Like another reviewer, I used about 1 tsp of chili powder and the flavour was great. Next time I will be more watchful during the last few minutes of cooking time since I came close to burning the whole batch--I'm looking forward to correcting my mistakes and trying this again!

Wow!  This was so so good!  I had no idea what to do with the kale in my green grocer box last week.  I didn't want to make a soup or stew, which seem to be the most common recipes using kale.  I was careful to very lightly but evenly coat the pieces in olive oil.  It was so good, I'd buy kale at the store just to make it again!

Fantastic and I am new to kale. I was out of chili so I used curry powder and a little garlic salt. Also added a little parmesan cheese. I think you could add any spice. Cumin sounds good. A friend said she uses ground flax seed or sunflower seeds. It was pretty much gone before it reached the table.

This was delicious, except that i decreased the chili to one teaspoon. The kale came out crispy and reminiscent of roasted nori. I will definitely make this again!

I really like these and, like a previous reviewer, think they are a bit like toasted nori. And they're low carb which is a definite plus!  Since kale is so sturdy I simply used my hands to get the pieces well coated with the oil. Drizzle and then rub 'em down. I also think only 1 tsp of chili powder is sufficient, and watch the salt; it's easy to overdo it.

OH MY! This was so good and was getting skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but it was so good that my husband and i stood at the stove and ate it before we even got a chance to put it on a serving platter!  I did put a bit too much salt but otherwise it was great!!  This was also our first time ever eating kale....yum!  My toddler tried it after i told him it was leaves.  he ate it.  i also didn't expect it to be so crispy, nice surprise....it was similiar to a potato chip crisp. great, thanks for sharing!

This was interesting to try. My chili flavor did not come through at all. And some pieces came out too salty. But it was interesting to try the kale all crispy. It kind of just dissovles in your mouth. It was not good the next day. It was way too tough and chewy.

Ok, I have to admit I didn't really measure anything.  I probably doubled the chili powder and used less salt.  We loved, loved, loved these kale chips.  What a great healthy snack.  Thanks for sharing.

I rate this with 5 stars because it did turn out just like the recipe stated. The kale was crisp - which totally amazed me - but I am not a kale eater and I really thought it would taste totally different - like a potato chip. Boy was I wrong! My brain still deciphered that I was eating kale! but it was crispy! My husband loved them, but he loves all his veggies like a good boy!

Oh so delicious!  I was looking for something crunchy but healthy.  This fit the bill.  I was making it as a side dish for an italian meal, so I used garlic powder instead of chili powder.   Next time I'm using chili powder as written in the recipe, maybe to accompany spinach and black bean enchiladas and rice!

This was my first time cooking kale, so I didn't have much to compare to but I enjoyed it.  It cooked in the exact time as specified which was great and was crispy on the edges.  Definitely do not add too much salt as other mentioned.  I layered the kale with oil and seasonings in the bowl and then stirred it to evenly coat which worked out great.

Chili powder adds a nice kick! Careful with the salt, too much is just gross but that was my mistake. Simple and tasty recipe!

Amazingly easy and amazingly tasting.  I think these might be a staple in my household.  I'm gluten free and this is healthier and safer than regular chips that can include flour.  YAY!!!!

I baked at 350 for a total of 15 minutes, 400 seemed way too high .I reduced the amount of chili also. Very tasty snack.

Love this!Use about half the salt called for though, otherwise it's very salty. Good with other seasonings too.

Interesting way to prepare kale, but it was delicious and easy! Agree with the other raters on putting in 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp chili powder. I'd make this again!

Tried this recipe at night with sweet chilli sauce and chilli powder. It roasted nicely and tasted great.  Chewy and crunchy with an explosion of taste, much grateful to the creator of this dish.

Yum!  I didn't have chili powder and used smoked paprika instead. I served it over red rice, with a side of grilled chicken breasts.  Thank you. My husband told me this recipe is now in his top three.  I can't wait to try nori, like other reviews have mentioned.

I'm not sure what went wrong. I used less than the recommended chili but it still seems too over powering. I did reduce the amount of salt but they just taste kind of funky.

Really enjoyed as a side dish for grilled steak. I used salad tongs to stire and toss it numerous times.  I used a cajun blend that had salt. Really simple dish to prepare that had alot of flavor!

I had been wanting to make crispy kale and found this recipe. It is wonderful. I love it. I did change the recipe slightly; I added a little cumin and just little garlic salt, to the chile and the sea salt. Tossed the leaves in olive oil and then really toss the seasonings on the leaves. Spread thin on a cookie plate at 400 degrees. What a tasty way to use your kale. Note: Alot of leaves dry to to a much smaller amount.

Delicious just as written.   My "I don't eat kale"ers loved it.  4 cups becomes a pretty small amount.  I'd call it two servings.  Good with chili flakes, too.

This was pretty good - the kids didn't like it at all. I would have liked mine a tad crispier so next time I'll cook it a few minutes longer.

Maybe I just don't like kale, but this didn't work out for me.  I've never tried making it before, so maybe it wasn't done enough, but I couldn't eat it.  It tasted terrible.  I tried putting it back in the oven, but that didn't help.  I'll try another cooking method next time.

This is the only good kale I've ever had.  Added red wine vinegar on the second round for a little acid.

I loved this recipe and idea!  I went with my preferred amount of spices and added a little lime juice. Cooking temp and time was on spot! Great way to cook kale.
