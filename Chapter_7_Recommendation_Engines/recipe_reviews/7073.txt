Just made these buns today, wonderful. I didn't want to wait to add the raisins, (not a currant in the house)so they went in with everything else, didn't seem to hurt anything except to maybe make the buns a darker color, if you want whole raisins don't do this. A quick tip to make the frosting,  put your powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla in a heavy plastic sandwich bag, mix by kneading the bag gently when all the ingredients are mixed well cut a tiny hole in one corner of the bag and squeeze to make the crosses.

Since I was short on time, I decided to try this bread machine version over my 'traditional' recipe....and these buns were awesome!  The even tasted just like my regular recipe! I did make some changes as my standby recipe was a bit different and you may want to try this too:  I added 1 tsp. each vanilla extract & butter flavoring, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1 tsp. each dried lemon and orange peel and 3/4C. mixed candied fruit. So good with a cup of tea.....

My husband says that the traditional hot cross buns have a sweetened dough cross rather than an icing one, so I made a sweet dough out of an egg white, some confectioners sugar, all purpose flour and some vanilla and put it on after brusing the tops with the egg yolk mixture - turned out great!  Our guests loved them and asked for the recipe!

Absolutely delish!  Instead of using the warm water and powdered milk, I used 3/4 cup of warm skim milk.  I ended up leaving off the crosses, so that it's easier to heat them up, toast them, etc. and we loved them.  So easy!!

To make the buns more traditional (and toastable) make a paste of plain flour and water (you can add a tiny bit of sugar and spice to make it more tasty) and pipe the buns with crosses of paste before baking.
Then, brush buns with a swwt glaze (sugar, water, gelatin, spice) when they come out of the oven.
Also, try using rasins and peel.
YUM!

This is a great recipe!  I added 2/3 cup of candied fruit and 1 teaspoon of Vanilla to original recipe.  I used rasins instead of currants and unbleached flour because that was what I had on hand!  I love them!  The house smells wonderful!!! I think I could make a double batch in my bread machine next time.  I made two individual recipes for Easter and I am sure they will be a hit tomorrow!  Thanks Sue!  I love using the bread machine to make the dough. They are quick to throw together!

Really good recipe.  They turn out a little heavier than store bought HCB, but I'm an unexperienced breadmaker and have had this happen with other yeast breat recipes. Also, I didn't use a breadmaker(just kneeded for 5-10 minutes)  Maybe they would end up fluffier if I used a breadmaker.  I put a sweetdough cross on it as well instead of icing and found this to more like the store bought ones.  I used 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup icing sugar, vanilla and 2 tsp or so milk to make it the desired consistancy.  The second time I made them I tried putting the sweetdough in an empty milkbag with a small hole cut in the corner and piped the crosses on the buns.  They definately taste better with cloves and allspice(1/2 tsp each) added.  I also used raisons and found them fine.

These were really very nice!  I was pleasantly surprised to find a recipe for this Easter treat that I could make in my bread machine.  Fancier models of bread machines that have a dough cycle that includes a rising time can omit the rising in the pan described in the original recipe. I also would go ahead and add the currants/raisins and cinnamon with the rest of the ingredients, rather than waiting.   The taste is much like very light white bread with a hint of cinnamon and raisins.  If you prefer more zip, add the allspice, vanilla, butter extract etc as recommended by a previous reviewer.  However, the recipe as it stands is really very good.  The buns come out huge and golden - picture perfect.

The BEST recipe for Hot Cross Buns I've ever had. I've used this recipe for years and had many people request the recipe. The only change I make is to add mixed dried fruit and peel as a substitute for most of the currants AND I remove the dough to a bowl sprayed with Pam and let it rise (covered with a towel) in a warm place. This frees up the machine to start a 2nd or 3rd batch!! Thanks. YUMMY!

Absolutely a keeper! I'm an Asian and believe it or not I never even knew what a hot cross bun looks like before I saw the pic on this site! My hubby mentioned that his mother used to make killer hot cross bun and too bad he cannot find anything that good at store anymore! So, after reading all the raving reviews, I decided to give it a try!  I substitued white flour with unbleached bread flour, used about 1 and 1/3 bags (2oz per bag)of active yeast, also added extra 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1tsp cinimmon,1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1tsp fresh orange zest and 1/2 cup of raisins to the dough base. For the icing, I used 1 cup of confectionary sugar, 2 tsp non- fat milk , 2 tsp orange juice and 1/2 tsp lemon zest. The sweetness with a twist of citric taste, yum!  I put the icing into the cross before the buns got completely cool, so that the icing will be melted into the center of the bun! It may not look that good, but really tastes better!  My hubby cannot stop complimenting how great the buns taste! Thank you so much for posting the recipe! Big thanks to all who spent time sharing their experiences and tips!

This is an awesome recipe! My husband loved it! It is soo easy! I added raisins instead of the currants and I liked that the raisins (being added in the last 5 min) didn't get chopped up but stayed whole and added a nice sweet flavor. I will definately make these again. This was my first time ever making hot cross buns and I will do it again! 

Review Number 2 on this recipe--I made this again but I got lazy and didn't want to make all those rolls so I made 12 and put the rest of the dough in a loaf pan. I let it rise as per instructions and baked it for 30 minutes. I took it out after 15 minutes because the top was golden brown. I tested it using a metal skewer. The inside was still gooey. I covered the loaf with foil and baked for another 10 minutes. Not quite done. Back in still covered for 5 more minutes. Done! I let it cool and frosted it with a carrot cake frosting of 8oz cream cheese, 4 tbsp butter and 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Now granted, it makes way too much for a bread ot rolls, but I also made a carrot cake that used most of it. My kids raved about the rolls! The bread came out good too although it was hard to cut and the individual slices  didn't hold their shape as I was slicing it. An awesome recipe!!!!!!!!

This is a keeper! Perfect, quick & easy. I did follow advice about the cross though...  Mix 1/4 cup icing sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp milk, and enough water to make a thick paste & pipe on after brushing with egg...before baking. They turned out PERFECT. We are on our second batch.  And I used raisins instead of currants...don't think it would change it too much.

This recipe's a definite keeper! I don't have a bread machine, so I added 1 pkg of active dry yeast to the warm water for 15 mins till frothy, and added that to the rest of the ingredients and mixed till I got a sticky bread dough, adding the cinnamon powder at the last. 

I also prepared the dough on Thu night, and after the first rise, I shaped the dough into small balls of 50g each, placed them in a baking paper line tray, covered the tray with cling wrap and placed the whole lot in the fridge. I took them out this morning and heated the oven while waiting for the dough to return to room temperature before brushing with egg yolk. I live in a tropical climate, so 190C for 15mins was just right.

This recipe got me 15 buns.

This was an excellent recipe. I didn't add icing as I wanted a raisin bun. I did add 1 tbsp of vital gluten to make it really light and fluffy. I think next time I would add more spices, it smelled great but didn't taste as cinnamony as I thought it would.

Great recipe! I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves and they were absolutely delicious. I used my Cuisinart mixer with dough hook, because I don't have (or need!) a bread machine. I sprinkled the yeast on top of the water pus a tbsp of the sugar. I let it sit until foamy. Then I added all of the rest of the ingredients and mixed for 3 minutes at speed 3. Then, I scraped the bowl and kept mixing for 2 more minutes at speed 2. They came out fluffy and delicious! Thanks!

I wanted to make hot cross buns for Easter, but I am not a fan of the traditional currants and spices.  I enjoyed this recipe and made the following changes to suit my tastes:  (they came out very good and I got compliments on them at a pre-Easter party)  I substituted 3/4 cups dried blueberries for the currants and 1 tsp lemon zest for the cinnamon.  For the glaze, I added a drop or two of lemon extract to the other ingredients.  These changes made the buns have a nice spring flavor - if you are willing to break with the traditional.

I accidentally added the cinnamon when I put in the other ingredients and it didn't seem to hurt it a bit. Baked for 15 minutes instead of 20 because I don't like dry rolls. Might meke them into 16 rolls next time because they were big.

I didn't use a bread machine.  I used milk instead of the water and milk powder, heating that to 110° and added some of the sugar to proof the yeast.  Also, I used 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/4 chopped citron which is reminiscent of the buns I had as a child.   I completed the dough in my KA mixer.  Perfect.

I don't have a bread machine.  Instead, I mixed the ingredients in my Cuisinart--it did a great job of mixing and kneading--even with the metal blade.  I think I will add lemon peel to the dough next time, but all in all this is a five star recipe.

Yummy.  I used raisins instead of currants and I think next time I might try it with a bit of candied fruit too.

These were super easy to make and turned out fantastic!  I had not had hot cross buns since I was a teenager and my mom would bring them home from the bakery she worked at.  For some reason I kept thinking about them so looked for a recipe and chose this one.  Boy - am I ever glad I did!  They taste best slightly warmed up - I put them in the microwave at 40% power for about 35 seconds.  The icing does not melt but the bun gets warm and soft.  Yummy!!  I can't wait for my mom to get here to try one of these!

I think this is a good starter recipe, but it needs some more spice to be like a true hot cross bun.  next time I make this I would add more cinnamon (2 tsp), some ginger (3/4 tsp), a bit of nutmeg (1/4 tsp) and definitely more fruit - I did 3/4 cup of a mix of raisins, cranberries and blueberries - next time I'd add more like a cup and a half.  I think a bit of orange or lime zest would really get this recips up to 5 stars!!  Worth a try for sure.

This is a great hot cross buns recipe! I have two suggestions for making dough in a breadmaker: 1. Proof the yeast first in a bit of water and add a teaspoon of sugar. 2. Never add all the flour at the beginning, and never measure the flour! Here is what you do: Add all dough ingredients except sugar, flour, proofed yeast and currents to bread machine pan. Dump about 1 1/2 cups of four on top of the liquidy mixture. Top this with sugar and proofed yeast. Start the breadmaker, and let the glutton form as the machine mixes the mixture.  As soon as the machine starts to really mix, start topping up with additional flour, about 1/4 cup at a time, until the mixture is smooth, moist, but not sticky. If you reach in and some comes off in your fingers, add a bit more flour until you can touch it without any sticking. This way you have added just the right amount of flour.  Flour gets compacted so easily, so many times if you "measure" flour, you end up with thick, dense buns. This method takes a bit more "watching" but will always result in better buns.

awesome...did them on convection and they looked like they came from a bakery....used the piped on sweet dough rather than the icing....1/2 cup icing sugar, 1/2 cup flour, vanilla and some milk to thin.....mix it in a sandwich bag and pipe on just before rolls to into oven

These are very good. I have been baking my own buns for probably over 30 years and have had many good recipies, but this one has become my newest best recipe for both as is for Easter and without the currants and cinnamon and icing for plain buns for other occasions. I use a heavy duty food processor for mixing the dough and I let it rise in my oven with just the oven light on to keep it warm. I prefer smaller buns, so I make 18 out of one recipe, but I always make two batches while I'm at it and freeze most of it for special occasions.

Made these for Good Friday and they came out great. I substituted raisins for the currants and it was delicious! I also made the recipe by hand as I don't own a bread maker. My dad isn't a big fan of sweet buns but he said he enjoyed them so that's good enough for me:). Thanks for the recipe.

WOw they are PICTURE PERFECT, this is the first time I make hot cross buns and they came out so nice,fluffy and golden. Substituted the currants for chocolate chips as my sister prefers choc chip hot cross buns. I'm glad I tried this recipe, but I prefer my hot cross buns sweeter, so next time I'll add a bit more sugar into it. THanks for the great recipe :D

Tried this recipes for Easter and the buns were soft and delicious.  This is the best recipe ever.  The only ingredient I substituted was white sugar and used brown sugar instead. This will be the recipe that I wiil use for hot cross buns in future.

This recipe reminded me of the delicious hot cross buns my mom brought home for a treat.  I added chopped citron in place of 2/3 of the raisins.  Using the bread machine made this whole recipe a snap.

These were delicious and very easy to make. I used 3/4 cup of warm milk instead of the water and powdered milk. I didn't have currants or raisins so I just left those out. I used one envelope of active dry yeast which was slightly under 1 T. Still worked great.

I use half a cup of mixed dried peel bits with half a cup of raisins to brighten them up a bit inside.  I also found I could substitute half a cup of white flour for half a cup of fine whole wheat flour and it added nutrition without changing the texture or taste.  Super yummy!

I never made these before, but I love them so much so  I thought I'd try.  They were delicious! I do think that I'll add a little more sugar, since I like them a tiny bit sweeter. I made them the day before and after making them into balls I refrigerated them until morning and then baked them. It worked out just fine.
Thanks for a great recipe.

These are delicious.  I add 1 tsp orange zest, 3/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  It adds just a little bit more to it.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  These rolls were wonderful!  I had made the traditional hot cross buns for Easter and then decided to try these, too, at the last minute.  These were WAY better than the ones that had taken me hours of mixing, kneading & rising!  I heeded a previous review and added allspice, butter flavoring, vanilla and raisins.

You NEED to give these a try.  Very easy and very yummy!

very yummy!  I have a smaller bread machine, so I made 2/3 of the recipe, 8 rolls total.  I added 5-spice and 1/2 cup of candied fruit, and changed the currants to raisins.  Delicious, and perfect for Easter.

These were exactly what we wanted for Easter breakfast - delicious!! I used real milk instead of powder (didn't have powder) and skipped the currants, but did everything else the same and this bread was light, fluffy, and just sweet enough. I made them without a bread machine by proofing the yeast in the water and sugar first, then adding the rest of the ingredients and kneading. I'll definitely make again!

I just made this recipe tonight & it turned out very good.There was a spice missing to give it that true hot cross bun flavour,perhaps allspice. I used margarine & raisins instead of butter & currents. Make sure to grease the pan generously or use parchment paper.I will definately made this easy recipe again once I discover the missing spice.

Lower on flavor than I had hoped for, and somewhat dry.  Also, they were already overcooked in 18 minutes and stuck very badly to the bottom of the pan despite it being well greased.

This is a really great recipe.  I followed it to a T except that I made 16 rolls, not 12.  Really good....and good HOT right out of the oven.

These were okay. Not nearly as light and flavourful as my usual recipe. I think the main difference is that my recipe uses milk; it also calls for creaming the butter and sugar first, then beating in the egg. My husband and I ate them; I just wouldn't give any to my Mother-in-Law!

This recipe turned out just as good as earlier reviewers said it would! And it reminded me of my mom's hot cross buns! I used a "tropical medley" of dried fruit from Sun Maid and it was wonderful! Also added the 1/2 tsp. all spice and 1 tsp. cinnamon as earlier reviewers did. I needed to find a good recipe for hot cross buns as I need to bring the rolls to an upcoming social event and I don't need to look any further! Thank you all for your suggestions and Sue, for your recipe!

Yum!  These were great!  Only tweaking I did was to use almond milk in place of the water and powdered milk.  Just like we would buy at the local bakery - well - not anymore we wont!  ;)  These are too good not to make from scratch.

This is a fabulous recipe! I've tried other recipes for hot cross buns in the breadmaker and they came out like rocks. These are light and fluffy and golden brown. I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe was good. I tweaked it a bit. I doubled the butter, added a bit more sugar, added the other suggested spices, and did craisins because I live overseas and couldn't get the suggested fruit.

the BEST! Made these w/o bread machine: scalded and cooled 1/2c milk, yeast with 1/4c warm water, currants rinsed, added 1/2 tsp allspice, half all purpose flour and half hard white (organic). Delicious recipe for today, Good Friday, or any occasion

Great flavor, I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice but kept everything else the same.  The dough seemed very wet and I used a lot of flour when handling it and it turned out good in the end.  I made a big change to the cross, though.  I mixed 2 tbs all-purpose flour, 1 tsp confectioner's sugar, 1tsp cornflour with enough water to make a paste.  I piped the mixture on from a sandwich bag before baking.  Not like shop bought, but really good.  Thanks for the recipe.

We used to have Hot Cross Buns every Easter back home. This is the first year that I have missed them. I thought the flavor of these HCBs was absolutely spot-on - my grandma would usually add finely chopped candied orange peel to hers, which I didn't especially care for - but they weren't as light and fluffy as the ones I'm used to. However, I am by no means the world's best baker, so that's probably my fault. Anyway, thanks for a nice reminder of home!

I didn't use my bread machine as I wanted to double the recipe. Definitely should have added the cinnamon & raisins with the other ingredients! I'll make this recipe again but will spice it up a bit by adding orange zest or substituting Sun Maid Tropical Fruit for the raisins. I also like the idea of piping the cross on the buns as my pastry brush did not work well.

This recipe couldn't have been easier.  I forgot to add the currants (raisins) before the end of the kneading cycle so I just mixed them in by hand and let the dough rise in a covered bowl.  Like others have suggested, I'm going to add some candied fruit next time.

Very nice recipe. Turned out just fine even though I cheated and only made nine instead of the twelve. I like bigger buns...sue me! The only thing I wish I had done is add a bit of vanilla as I see now someone else did. Next time. Also, didn't have any instant milk and just used the water. Turned out just fine.

Great recipe.  I don't have a bread machine, so I just made it the regular way, following the recipe exactly.  They turned out delicious.  Next time I'll add some citron and a little more cinnamon.

Recipe printed out 1 cup of water instead 3/4 cup. Was fluid instead of a nice puffy dough. Had to add flour and knead until I got the correct consistency. I believe this made dough tougher. The taste was good but wanted a lighter bun. Not sure if the print was incorrect or the fault was my own. Had to add 1 cup extra of flour.

The buns taste great! I made them for my dad and I'm sure he'll be asking for them again. My only issue was that the bottoms were a little too dark and crunchy. I don't mind that, but my mother would have had plenty to say about it. Other than that, they were wonderful.

It sure would be helpful to know how many minutes of kneading come before the "5 minutes left" point!  They turned pretty well, but not overwhelmingly.

I tried this recipe to take to an Easter party and I'm sorry I did. The recipe was easy to make. I made one recipe with raisins and one without because it was a children's party and I figured some would rather have no raisins. The raisin rolls were dry and didn't rise as well but I attribute that to a bit too much flour. The others came out very pretty. The taste was just not what I was hoping for. They are nearly tasteless. I even doubled the cinnamon and added some nutmeg per other reviews. I couldn't believe it. I even went to the store to buy cream cheese to make a more flavorful frosting and put thick crosses on them to try to make them more appealing. They are edible but I will not make this recipe again.

First let me say I did not use a bread machine, therefore, i had to do the order of things differently. I did not change anything. Good recipe makes a dozen, taste was good.

Tastes just like raisin bread, only with sort of the texture of an english muffin. I added about 1/4 tsp of cloves. Pretty good!

These came out good.  The were so light and fluffy.  I think I would have liked them a little sweeter, but that is just my preference to sweet breads.

Great recipe! I made it as directed the first time, and love the crumb. We don't really like raisins so I plan to adjust this recipe to suit our tastes and make it without raisins next time, maybe put in some extra sugar to compensate for the sweetness lost by eliminating raisins. Thanks for sharing!

first time making, used hand method, turned out nice.  Used Orange extract instead of vanilla, clear and bit more flavor.

Somehow these came out too light and fluffy. I followed the recipe - or thought I did! My boyfriend loved them, but they weren't quite right for me. I would make them again to see if it was me, or the recipe!

Wonderful.  Made 2 batches yesterday.  Added 3T cinnamon, some ground cloves, nutmeg & allspice & 2T lemon zest and used 2% milk instead of water & powder milk.  Made crosses out of flour,water& icing sugar paste .

They were a little dry and I missed the orange flavoring of more traditional hot cross buns.  Unlikely to make again.  Make sure they have fully cooled before putting on the frosting to prevent it from running all over.

Excellent , in terms of the buns.  The only reason it's a 4 is that the frosting is brown, not white, when you put in the vanilla as directed, so the crosses aren't visible, and the frosting is way too runny.

These were easy to make and nice enough to eat but didn't have the spicy hot cross bun flavour I was hoping for. Very much a personal taste but if I made these again I would probably triple the spice and the fruit.

These are easy, light and really yummy :) I put extra cinnamon and added a little clove, ginger and nutmeg (because we like our hot cross buns tasting of spice) and used sultanas instead of currants (none of my boys like currants lol). Will definitely be making a ton of these for Easter ;)

Not impressed with this recipe. Came out dry and lacking in flavor. The only thing that kept them edible was lots of icing.

This is a first time for me.  The buns turned out great.  I made them the evening before Good Friday so they were ready in the morning for my family.  Everyone loved them.  My son, who came home late at night on Thursday said the house smelled wonderful and wanted to eat them all.

These were really good! I made them for Good Friday, and my family really enjoyed them! I made the dough the night before, and put the dough in the fridge. Then in the morning, I took them out and put them in the oven. They came out smelling so good, and yummy that as soon as I put the icing on, everyone devoured them! Yum, Yum! Will definitely make them again! Look at my picture!

I have to rate this a 5 because I've never made buns before and even though I screwed up a little they still managed to turn out!  First of all, I used just water as my milk powder was rancid, and I had already started adding ingredients to my bread machine.  Then, I forgot to add the raisins while it was kneading, so I tried adding them in at the end but that didn't work so well, most of them just fell off!  When they were done baking, they were really nice and golden.  The trick of putting the icing for the crosses into a sandwich bag worked like a charm.  I discovered at the end that I forgot the cinnamon as well!  They still tasted good.  I didn't find them to be heavy at all, however, my buns turned out pretty big, next time I will make 15 buns instead of 12.  I was worried with my mistakes that it would be a flop but it was fine.  I think next time I will use just water again without adding the milk powder - I have used other bread recipes on here that didn't require milk/milk powder and they had the best results in my machine.  Thanks for the recipe!  Update:  I made these a second time.  I put the raisins in at the beep (instead of the last 5 minutes) and it totally pulvarized my raisins and made the bread look brown. Definitely follow what the recipe says! I also made 15 instead of 12 and although they looked nicer, this batch was definitely more dry.  I will keep just using water though.

These were very good, and not complicated. I used craisins instead of the currants, to good effect. This year (2008) I used the currants, and they were better. I got requests for the recipe from 70-year-old ladies at church, which to me is a high compliment.

These are really good hot cross buns.  The only change I made was I added some candied cherries.  I also made the cross with a flour and water paste before baking and then just put a small amount of glazing on the buns when they are finished baking, this way the icing doesn't run off into my toaster when I'm toasting them for breakfast.

These looked very impressive. I substituted candied fruit for the currants which I would definitely recommend and I used some pumpkin pie spice as well as the cinnamon. The only thing I didn't like was the icing cross. The only way I like hot cross buns is toasted. Aren't hot cross buns supposed to be hot? Anyway, I tried putting them in the toaster oven and the icing dripped off and made a mess (even though I kept the icing side up the whole time) and forget about putting them in the toaster, that's a disaster just waiting to happen. I even tried the microwave but it was very difficult to not get the icing all over my fingers as I was eating it. I think I will look for another recipe that makes the cross the same way as the buns I get from the grocery store.

I made a mistake with my first batch (totally forgot to add the yeast--Yikes!), but after cleaning up after that, I started over again, checking off the ingredients, and they turned out really nice.  We took them to today's church potluck, and I didn't bring any home, and the kids asked me to make more.  I did add a few things to the recipe.  I added a half teaspoon of the "Fiori di Sicilia" flavoring (from King Arthur Flour), a "dash" of cloves and a "dash" of nutmeg to the cinnamon to zing it up a bit.  The "Fiori di Sicilia" gave a hint of citrus and vanilla to the dough, that made it taste very much like the ones my Mom used to get at the neighborhood bakery when I was young.  I didn't have currants handy, so I used golden raisins and dried cranberries for the fruit.

I'm in the middle of making a new batch and I decided to try what another reviewer had suggested:  adding a Tablespoon of Vital Wheat Gluten to the flour.  

I'm going to try to make the crosses from the piped sweet dough next time. This recipe is definitely a winner from my perspective.

I made two batches of these.  The second was definitely better than the first as I forgot to add the spices and currants in at the end of the second knead so had to knead a third time myself to incorporate the ingredients.  I made the second batch correctly and the buns were definitely lighter and more flavorful.  I would try this recipe again but I did feel they were a bit dense in texture overall.  The family and my English boyfriend loved them though, so they must have been pretty good :o)

I added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and I substituted semisweet chocolate chips for the raisins.  They were great!!

These were great! I did use 1/4 cup sugar instead of 2 tbsps and also added some orange zest. To make them shiny I used an egg wash. Next time I will add candied peel. They reminded me of Hot Cross buns I used to have as a child in England.

Very good!  I also made a cross on top with icing sugar, vanilla, flour and water.  It looked so good and professional my husband is starting to think I know what I'm doing.  I think I would use more raisins and dried candied fruit next time.

FANTASTIC! I used golden raisins b/c that's what I had on hand. I also added the zest of 1 orange to the dough...YUM!!!!! These were too easy and soooo delicious. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really good. Made for Easter dinner.   I only know of these from the children's song so I didn't know they'd be that sweet. We think they'd be a good Easter morning pastry. Kind of reminded me of cinnamon rolls.  I used cranberries instead. Only took 15 mins in my oven and that was a little too long.  So watch closely.

Great recipe! Next time, I will make them without the icing because I found it difficult to work with and the taste wasn't worth it in the end (I didn't find the icing had much of a taste at all).

Making these buns was the first time I've ever used my breadmaker on the 'dough' cycle.  I'd never worked with dough before so I was a bit nervous.  I'm happy to say these hot cross buns turned out great! I added the icing sugar criss/cross to the top but, to be honest, I preferred the taste without.   A nice easy recipe for a rookie baker to try :)

Made these for Easter dinner and they were a hit!  I love hot cross buns and was looking for a recipe that I could make fresh in the time I had in the morning, and these fit the bill.  I don't usually use my bread machine, and have never used the dough setting, but the only problem was the timer was for 1.5 hours, and the kneading cycle ended maybe 15-30 minutes in, so I had to do  little kneading by hand for the raisins and cinnimon better incorporated, though they still turned out very light.  I will deinitely make this again and recommend them to anyone.

yummy! great recipe. Like others, I made sweet dough crosses, with left over flour, yolk and water mixture, along with a tinsy bit of cinnamon (I love cinnamon - also used it in the glaze), icing sugar and vanilla essence, which I piped on with sandwich bag before baking, ending up a wee bit crispy. Had oven at about 30 degrees for the rising, as I have no bread machine. Used low fat milk and a little bit of water instead of the milk powder and water, and turned out fine. I will be using this recipe again for sure.

It is a pretty simple recipe, but I did something wrong, because mine rose the first time, but didn't rise the second time. If you want to raise this dough in the oven, what temperature and how long do you do it for? Mine kindof came out OK, but they tasted kindof bland and were a bit hard, which I'm sure is entirely my own fault. Can anyone help me here???

Very good, soft dough and buns, not too sweet.  Lacked something of the 'bitter' taste I expect in the store-bought buns, though; maybe because I subbed dried candied fruit & some raisins for the currants, but if you added about 1/2 or 1/4 tsp mace/allspice/cloves (some mix of them) it would add a slight 'zing'.  I too skipped the crosses, they're sweet enough as is - if you want sweeter just spread with jam or honey!  So I threw both whole eggs in the machine and increased the flour slightly.  Oh, some machines include first rise time, so keep that in mind.

We made these hot cross buns yesterday and I thought they were a bit flat when I had one still warm, but today they are so good, we will definitely make them again.
We love raisins so added some instead and I'm on a bit of a cast iron kick so we used a 12in cast iron skillet to bake them and they turned out great.

thanks for posting this recipe :)

Great recipe! 
I didn't have skim milk powder so I just used 2% Milk in place of water, they turned out perfectly. I also did not put on icing it's just too messy. Thanks for the recipe.

Best Hot Cross Buns ever!  Truly delicious.  I made one change in that I used only 1/4 cup of currants but added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  Definitely will make these again for Easter!

I made hot cross buns for the first time today using this recipe.  The only change I made was to add 1/4 tsp of allspice to the recipe.  Buns were very light and tasty though next time I will add more fruit.  The ratio seemed reasonable while the dough was being made but after the second rise the volume of fruit seemed very low compared to the volume of dough.  Next time I will watch the oven a  bit more closely and reduce baking time by a couple of minutes.  This is more than likely a temperature issue with my oven and not the recipe.

Added orange zest, mixed dried berries, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Followed a cinnamon roll frosting recipe with addition of butter and cream cheese.

I used 1 and 1/2 TBLS of instant yeast, heavy cream in place of the powdered sugar in the same measure and I didn't use a bread machine. I let the dough rise for 2 hours, shaped the dough and let rise for another 1 hour.  Results: light, fluffy and flavorful buns... And I added a CROSS instead of an x.

Very much enjoyed this Easter treat after making modifications based on suggestions from other reviews. I don't care for very sweet breads and I knew I was adding extra fruit so I stayed with the original amount of sugar. I added 1 t vanilla to the liquid in the bread machine. Then I took 1 T of the original 3 c flour to dredge the fruit before stirring 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t cardamom, 1/4+ t cloves, 1/2 t nutmeg and 1+ t lemon zest in with the remaining flour and adding it to the bread machine. 

I used about 1.5 c of fruit including currants, raisins, candied mixed peel and candied cherries (cut into thirds or quarters as I didn't want them too large). The floured fruit was added to the dough at the end of the knead stage as per the original directions. 

After the buns were shaped and risen, I brushed them with the egg wash and then used a dough cross made from 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c icing sugar, 1 t vanilla and water.

The buns were delicious. I packaged up half the batch to give to a friend so that I can make another batch tomorrow, guilt free! I'm going to increase the seasonings: 1.5 t cinnamon, 1/2 t cardamom, 1/4+ t cloves, 1.5 t lemon zest, and 3/4 t nutmeg. I have some dried cherries so I think I'll chop some of them up and increase the amount of fruit slightly as well.

These buns were nothing short of magnificent!  I tossed finely diced candied fruit and currents in flour, (totaling 3/4 cup) and put it in at the last 5 minutes of kneading in the machine. For spices, I used 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp freshly ground cardamom, and 1/4 tsp clove.  I just added it to the flour.  These remind me of the HCBs of my youth...Thank you so very much for this recipe.  What an excellent product.

So, because it did not say until a bit into the instructions that this recipe is set up for a bread machine and I do not have a bread machine ...I had to kind of hope for the best with winging it.  

I mixed the first set of ingredients together holding back the yeast water and sugar part, which i mixed together in a pyrex cup measure.  I had too much water so I had to compensate with more yeast and sugar, but only by a little (less than 1/2 cup too much water).

I had no dried milk so I used vanilla.

I had no currants so I used craisins minced with about a 1/2 tablespoon of orange juice concentrate and cinnamon.  I added these after the first raise.

Because I had a slightly larger amount of yeast mixture, I added about 1/2 cup more flour and perhaps a little more than that.  In retrospect, after tasting them, I believe less flour is better for these.

In order to handle them and get them into equal parts, next time I would roll out the dough a little onto a floured surface and then use a glass or a cup measure to cut uniform sizes of them, as my buns were not round but all stuck together in the pan and had different sizes.  

I used an 8x8 pan and that made them all run into each other, so not round. 

Don't frost them warm or else the frosting will melt and drip.

cut a large enough hole at the tip of a zip bag so to get that nice uniform line, too small a hole will make one squeeze more and the line will do curlycues.

they tasted beautiful, I made them for new years.

These rose beautifully.After the second rising I popped them in the fridge and baked them the next morning. I brushed with apricot jam while hot to make them nice and sticky.Only complaint was they smelt a bit yeasty .... maybe more vanilla next time.

My family LOVED these buns. I made them for Good Friday. I used whole wheat flour and skipped the powdered milk because I didn't have any. They were really sweet and delicious, although more like cinnamin buns almost. I had to add more sugar to the icing because it was too thin, I don't know if it made a difference that it was organic. Overall, I highly recommend these!!!

I've never eaten Hot Cross Buns before so I have nothing to compare these with but I thought they were very good!  I would definately make these again.  I did use raisins instead of currants (didn't have any).  Like the fact that they were very easy to make with the help of my bread machine.  Thanks!!

It's been a while since I made this, but from what I remember it went over very well. I made it for Easter. It took longer than what I expected. I made the mistake of making it the day of Easter...The currents were very good!! If asked, I'd make these again.

I made the buns as directed.  How easy the first part was, using the bread machine!  After the hour and a half of bread machine time, I let the dough rise in a bowl on the counter.  Then, I rolled out 24 buns (to make just 12, as in the recipe, yielded buns that I considered too large), set them to rise, and baked them for a total of 15 minutes.  After cooling, I froze them on a cookie sheet, then transferred them to a bag in the freezer.  All ready for the Easter table next week.

Very good did not change anything. Reason being this is your recipe. Hate when people give there 2 cents. You either liked it or not. What they changed is irrelevant to your recipe.

The flavour was good. Made it with a combination of raisins, dried apricots and dried pineapple instead of currants. They were a little heavy, perhaps leave them to rise a bit longer next time.

Instead of 3/4C of currants, I used 1/2 C and 1/2 C stem ginger chopped fine. I swapped out some of the cinnamon for cardamom, I prepped a little of the flour according to the tangzhong technique, and I used lemon in the icing instead of milk. Everybody here was thrilled with the result.

I made the dough in my bread machine. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the powdered milk-who even uses that anymore? Still came out with perfect texture and taste.

This recipe is great!  I missed the last 5 mins of kneading in the bread machine so I added raisins when punching the dough down.  Forgot to add the cinnamon.  It's so good!  It's 10pm and am tempted to eat another!  I may use this without the nuts as rolls.

This was so easy to make in my bread machine. My two issues were that 1 tbsp seems like a lot of yeast, and they rose much higher than I would have liked. I also found them a bit dry. However, my family loved them, and so did the kids at my child's school when I sent them in for a class party.

EXCELLENT. I mostly followed the recipe except I replaced the water and powdered milk with warm 1% milk, and instead of the icing, I made a pipeable sweetbread dough as suggested by JGILL2002 to be more like the hot cross buns I'm used to. Other than that, this recipe is BETTER than any bakery hot cross bun which always have big chunks of citrus peel in them that I always remove before eating. NO MORE. Peel-less and perfect hot cross buns!

I made this in my bread machine. I forgot the extra egg white in the dough, but it still turned out beautifully. I might recommend just a little less cinnamon, maybe only 1/2 or 3/4 a teaspoon, but that's just my personal preference. I also like hot cross buns with mixed candied peel as well as raisins/currants, which I added at the beep of my bread machine. Because I forgot to separate the second egg, I didn't have the egg yolk wash to put on top before baking. Instead, I mixed a little powdered sugar with milk to make a  thin glaze that I brushed on the buns straight out of the oven. Then I piped the icing on later, when they were cooled. I'm definitely making these again next Easter!

I made in my stand mixer, and added a tablespoon of milk instead of milk powder.  The dough seemed a little too wet then, and would not stick to the hook, so added more flour, a spoonful at a time, about half a cup total.  But after the first rise, the dough was soft and springy and rose beautifully.

I processed the dough using dough hooks in the stand mixer and noticed from the start that the dough was too dry. It caused the bowl to pop off the mixer while it was running. Have gone over the recipe several times and I followed it accurately. Any ideas how to compensate in the future?

Made twice, first w/o out currents and other batch with. Instruction confusing, as 1st part is for a bread machine, but adapted to the way I make yeast rolls using less liquid. Same result each time, dough doesn't hold it shape, "rolls" spread into a pan of yeast bread to be cut into portions. Best if eaten right away.

I read through the reviews and added the allspice. I also tried both ways for the Cross but wasn't too keen on either. Also, mine were the size of baseballs! So....next time, I will make them smaller and after brushing with the egg wash and baking, I will let them cool completely and use either a confectionery icing or a cream cheese for the Cross. Also plan to add candied dried fruit.  All I had was dried pineapple, raisins, and dried cranberries. Overall, for my first attempt, I'm pleased.

I don't think these are flavorful at all. They smell very yeasty and they are heavy. I don't know if the intention is for them to be heavy. I'll try them again and maybe add some orange zest, add the cinnamon and cranberries (didn't have currants on hand) in the beginning (instead of the end) and maybe add a little vanilla to the dough.

This recipe is the perfect balance of spices and fruit. I followed the recipe exactly, then I varied it a bit as well.  For instance, for one batch, I eliminated the first rising. There was no difference in quality.  For several batches, instead of icing the buns after baking, just after glazing, I piped on a dough cross then baked the buns (1/2c. flour, 1/2c. icing sugar, 1/2tsp vanilla, 1/8c. milk - put it in a ziplock bag to pipe on).  My photo shows the piped on cross.

WOW! I made these tonight with my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook. I'm happy to say that I'll never have to buy another hot cross bun from the bakery again! Delicious, fluffy, beautiful. The only thing I did differently from the recipe  was to use mixed fruit and raisins rather than currants. It's just a matter of taste - I don't care for currants. Next time though, I think I'll double the fruit. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe was great! I used whole milk in place of the water and powdered milk. I also added 2 tsp of my spice mix. For those who said their buns came out heavy, make sure you allow enough time for rising. Mine were light and fluffy. I ate 3 before they even cooled off. Lol

Very good, I made as stated and they turned out great. I had them with Easter dinner and they were a hit!
