Great, easy recipe.  I found that tossing the pork with seasoning in advance caused the pan to burn unless I added oil, so next time I'll add the seasoning after the pork has cooked.

Good jumping off point. I used leftover pork roast from last night, my homemade fajita seasoning, doubled the onion,  and used three peppers. We garnished it with sour cream, sharp cheddar and milk salsa. Filling dinner and not the same dinner we had before.
