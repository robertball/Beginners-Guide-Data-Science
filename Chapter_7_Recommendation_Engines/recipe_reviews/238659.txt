I made a keto version by using almond flour and 1 cup of Swerve.  I had 4 yolks leftover from another recipe, so I only used 2 cups of flour.  Oh, and I used 1.5 tsp of baking powder and lemon zest (didn’t have lemon extract or cream of tartar).  They were delicious—we ate 4 while waiting for them to cool!  I would probably use even less sweetener next time, but this recipe (with keto changes) is a keeper.  Thanks!

These were good! Very sweet and a little thinner and crispier than I expected. I had to add a tablespoon of water to keep the dough from crumbling too much.
I would definitely make these again if I had six egg yolks to use.

Fantastic use for egg yolks after making meringues. Texture was much like a snickerdoodle, but the taste was citrus. I substituted lemon zest for the lemon extract.

My 8-year-old son actually found this recipe on his own. I was making an angel food cake for my older daughter's birthday and needed only the egg whites. I made the comment, "I'll need to find a recipe that uses egg yolks," and also noted that I had accidentally added the cream of tartar to my bowl of egg yolks instead of my mixing bowl for the angel food cake. He googled recipes that use 12 egg yolks and cream of tartar and found this. We doubled the recipe, I went out to get orange and lime extracts, the two of us mixed everything up, and it was a hit!

I didn’t have any lemon or orange extract even though I swore I did. Used almond extract instead. A great base cookie. I bet you could flavor however you wanted.

I had 12 egg yolks to use up, so I doubled the recipe. Kept the batter in the fridge between baking to keep dough firm. They baked up beautifully and larger than expected so I made them a tad smaller. Even my husband, who if he became president would make all cookies except chocolate chip illegal, loved them. I love the citrus flavor.

These were so good. On my last batch I ran out of flour so I substituted almond flour and noone knew the difference.

I was looking for ways to finish my extra yolks and found this recipe. The cookies taste nice, but I couldn't taste any citrus, so next time I think I would at least double the citrus. The recipe seems to make a dough but when I made it it was almost gooey, I could only JUST pick them up with my hands to roll them into balls (I made 20g each) and rolled them in white sugar before placing them very spaced-out on the tray to bake for 12 minutes (my oven takes a bit longer than others) loved the crispy texture and the sugar coating I did added a nice layer.

Bakes up easily with baking powder as a substitute with a bit of baking soda.
     If you are out of cream of tartar, yet have on hand baking powder and baking soda, then simply locate a conversion chart for an accurate substitution.
     As for sweetener, I used Truvia cane sugar blend, and decreased the overall amount, which yielded tender, lightly sweetened cookies.

These cookies were very good! It was a great way to use up some egg yolks. They ended up very thing but still delicious. The only thing I changed is I left out the orange extract. They were plenty citrus without it.

Super easy and tasty. Nice crisp edges and soft inside. Sweet, but not too sweet. Perfect with a cup of tea! Only change I'll make next time is to add some lemon zest to bring out the citrus flavor a bit more.

I made candied pecans and had 3 yokes.... so I made half a batch. 
I only had lemon so I doubled it.  I had to add a touch of milk. I also put dough in freezer so that dough was easier to work with. 
Cookies have a great flavor. I dusted some with powder sugar. 
Would make again if I only have yolks.

Had to use lemon juice instead of extract and didn't have orange anything, and the flavor wasn't particularly strong -- still good cookies! :)

Great recipe to use up egg yolks after making angel food cake. I doubled it since I had 12 yolks. I also added 1tsp ground ginger to give it a little “spice.” Ginger went well with the lemon-orange flavor.
