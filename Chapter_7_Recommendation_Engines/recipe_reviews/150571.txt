My husband and I really loved this dish! It's so hard to find gluten and dairy free recipes, this one will make a great summer dish for us and also a great potluck dish. We didn't make any changes but you can change it up and add any veggies you like really, fresh red bell peppers would be great in it or some fresh zucchini/summer squash. The sauce is delicious!
