Way too SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!!  But the next time I changed the proportion of ingredients and it was really good.  Here is my revised recipe:
1 package yellow cake mix.  I use 
Duncan Hines Butter recipe.  1/2 cup butter,melted. 4 eggs. 8 oz cream cheese, softened.  3/4 cup powdered sugar.  And this is not a mistake; only 3/4 cup. 1 tsp each vanilla and lemon flavoring. In a large mixing bowl, combine yellow cake mix, melted margarine, and 2 beaten eggs. Pour into a greased and floured 13"x9" cake pan.   Please note that the cake mix mixture will have the consistency of a dough more so than a cake, so it will be kind of thick. You can use a spatula to spread it.   In a  blender or food processor, combine softened cream cheese,  powdered sugar,  2 beaten eggs; vanilla/lemon .... flavorings (to taste).   Pour over the cake mixture.  Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden. 
You can use a 13X9 pyrex  or 2 squared foil pans (about 8x8) .  You can also cut into small squares and serve.

Did I do something wrong? The cake was tasty,but
the top had a crisp crust, and the center was
too gooey. It had the consistency of uncooked cake batter. Yuck! I made it exactly as instructed, and baked it for the appropriate time.
I had to throw it away!

This was pretty good although it was more like a brownie than cake. Be sure to let this cool COMPLETELY before cutting or it appears to be gooey. Otherwise, it's great!!! Enjoy!

This is an amazingly versatile recipe, and a big hit whenever I bring it into work.  Experiment using different flavors of cake mix such as chocolate sprinkled with mini M&M's (DECADENT!) lemon, or even strawberry as I tried today. You'll love it!

The kids loved this bar...not to mention they were bouncing off the walls on a sugar high for the rest of the day.  I am curious, is the cream cheese layer suppose to be runny or set up more like a cheesecake consistency?  Mine was runny and I'm wondering if I needed to bake it longer.  The taste sure makes it worth trying again.

I would cut back the amount of sugar in the cream cheese mix next time. Otherwise, everyone loved the combination.

I have been using this recipe for a long time. I can't remember where I first got it, but here it is. It is so good and everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe. It is VERY sweet so I only make it for company or if taking somewhere. Also, I cut into small squares, instead of bars since it is so sweet. FYI, this will not have the consistency of normal cake. It will be gooey inside and crusted top.
