Excellent.  Quick and easy to make and delicious.  I'm a Chinese food nut, having eaten at hundreds of Chinese food restaurants through the years.  This recipe ranks right up there with the best of restaurant egg drop soup I've had anywhere.  I may decrease the vinegar slightly next time, but other than that - I wouldn't change a thing.

I am an EGG Drop Soup NUT!  I think this is a very good recipe considering I am pretty picky!  I am not much of a soy sauce fan....but I think this is pretty good.  I did cut back on the full amount of soy sauce though.  It was an A+ in my book.  I have made it twice in the past 4 days....that says enough there!  YUM!

Very simple recipe makes an impressive soup.  I've found that using only egg whites makes a better "swirl".

This soup is really good.  i made a few changes and substitutions and it was excellent.  First, I prepared the boullion in the morning and let it sit most of the day.  I substituted cooking sherry for the vinegar and left out the onions.  it tasted just like the soup you would find in any Chinese restaurant!!!!

This is quick and easy, but can be overly salty.  I use low Soium soy sauce and cut back on the quantity.

The soup would have had a good taste except that the vinegar taste was very strong and my son, who loves egg drop soup, could not eat it because it was too "sour"

I initially made this as written, and found it to be very salty, a little too vinegary, and lacking in some of the flavors I expect from egg drop soup. I ended up adding more water, a few drops of sesame oil, and a tiny pinch of dried ginger. With these tweaks, it turned out great.

This was good, but WAY too salty.  I would proably use 1/2 the soy sauce and match water with cubes.

This one is great! It was my first time making the soup. The only thing I might change is a touch less soy sauce and a bit more cornstarch. I added some shredded carrot too. Awesome!

Really good! I added some sauteed mushrooms and garlic - trying to get over a sore throat. Then I just added splashes of soy sauce and vinegar, and lots of ground black pepper. Very comforting when you're feeling under the weather. I halved it and just used one extra large egg.

This isn't what I was expecting at all. Way too much vinegar. I like egg drop soup that's kind of on the sweet side i guess. this was tangy. Unlike anything I've had before.

With a couple of slight modifications, this was outstanding...for four servings I used 3 cups hot water and 2 of those extra-large Knorr bouillon cubes, omitted the vinegar completely, added 1 small sliced clove of garlic (slicing the garlic doesn't render it as intensely garlic-y tasting as mincing it) added 1/4 cup canned corn with the green onion and used 2 eggs beaten with 1 egg white. Also (and I think this may have been the key here), I added a good shake of ground white pepper (this is an essential ingredient in many Asian dishes). It was thick and eggy and broth-y, rich with flavor and the added corn was superb. To go along with it I fried up some wontons (basic wonton wrappers cut in half and fried in hot oil for about 10 seconds on each side) and served with our favorite Chinese restaurant's housemade sweet & sour sauce. Try this, I don't think you'll be disappointed!

This soup is fantastic for any time you crave Egg Drop Soup, but don't have time to go to the store for ingredients. (We don't normally have green onion laying around the house so I don't use it every time) Yes, it is a "salty" soup, but if you like the salty soy sauce flavor, then it's perfect. I add soy sauce to my egg drop soup when I get it at Chinese restaurants all the time, but this has enough for me in the recipe. An extra chicken boullion cube or two makes this recipe divine. Cut back a bit on the vinegar if you don't like the taste, but I like it just like it is. :)

Very tasty soup! The only thing I would change is the number of bouillion cubes. Next time I will match the cubes to the amount of water. Other than that, it was good. Thanks!

This is so simple and so delicious!  I made this for our family get together with "oriental" theme and everyone wanted the recipe.  And the grandkids request it when they come for dinner no matter what type of dish we are having.

This is a decent recipe....yeah, it is too salty, but that's to be expected, looking at the ingredient list. To make mine more interesting, I julienned 1/2 a zucchini, about 10 fresh mushrooms, and 1 stalk celery in addition to the green pepper.  I also pressed 4 cloves of garlic into the soup and added a smidge more cornstarch.  Mine turned out a little murky, but that was because i stirred the eggs in too vigourously.  Using egg whites only will give the soup a clearer broth and more classicly restaraunt style "swirl."

I used less bouillon as others suggested, I upped the vinegar to suit my taste, and I used 6 green onions instead of one to make it a bit more interesting. It was really, really yummy and my husband and I both loved it. But the sodium content! It's not that good for you. Other than that, it was excellent and I'll probably make it again.

I love this soup. I think it will become a lunchtime staple for me and it's so low calorie! I started out using some of the adaptations suggested in the reviews, mainly cutting down the amount of vinegar. I am not a vinegar lover, and I used cider vinegar because it is all I had. Originally I used 1 tbsp. of soy sauce and 1 tbsp of cider vinegar. I later added the extra tbsp. of soy because it needed it. The soup was very salty, so I added another 3/4 cup of water. It was still very salty so I added more cider vinegar until I felt it tasted very good. If you don't want the soup to be overly salty DON'T BE AFRAID OF VINEGAR. The vinegar helps cut through the saltiness of the bouillion and soy sauce and I thought the cider vinegar added a nice balance to the soup. I ended up using 2 1/2 tbsp of cider vinegar to balance out the other flavors in the soup, almost as much as the recipe originally called for. I think the other 1/2 tbsp. would have added, I just don't like vinegar. As a finishing touch I also added a pinch of ginger.

The combination of bouillon and soy sauce makes this too salty. Next time I'll make it with some real chicken broth. Otherwise this was an awesome soup!

excellent soup.  I rarely get to eat egg drop soup because I can't eat gluten, and this is fantastic and super easy.  I cut the vinegar in half and used a little bit of regular onion instead of green onion and added a little black pepper.  I think next time I will add some carrots too.

I thought it tasted good, but it wasn't typical egg drop soup(at least what I've come to know as egg drop soup).  Definitely too much soy sauce and vinegar.

Sooooo Good!! I didn't know that I could make this and that it tasted so good. I took the 3 TBSP of Vinegar to 1. I am not a big fan of it. Otherwise it was great. A real staple for Oriental night in my home. Thanks so much for the Recipe!

Very tasty & easy to make. Gave it only 4 stars cuz I modified recipe. Used 6 C low sodium fat-free chicken broth and low sodium soy sauce as recommended by another reviewer. I used rice vinegar in place of white vinegar, and 2 green onions, with more for garnish. This is rich & eggy. You could cut the eggs down if you like it more brothy.

I thought this was the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever made! I did goof up, I halved the water/boullion and left the egg the same, a big mistake on my part! We were overwhelmed with egg! But it still tasted great!

If you like salt, this recipe's for you. Bouillon is loaded with it, which is why I used a good, low sodium box of chicken broth. This was just fair in taste. Didn't taste like our local Chinese restaurant so I'll have to keep looking.

I thought this was really great.  I used just egg whites and loved the effect.  My husband does not like anything that might be chinese food, however, this will be a great simple meal when he can eat leftovers.  Also think this is a great luncheon idea.  Thanks!

This soup was just ok.  Kind of bland and boring.  I know egg drop soup is simple, but this one needed something.  I added peas, more soy sauce and some garlic to perk it up some.  I also used really good chicken stock instead of the bouillon.

The good news is that it's very easy to make.  However, I should have followed my instincts and pass by this recipe.  Instead, I made it based on the reviews, and was disappointed.  Sorry.  The taste of the soy sauce and vinegar were too strong for my tastes.  I had to water it down to make it edible.  Amazingly, though, my picky 2-year old ate it.  Go figure.  I'll stick with my old recipe.  Thanks anyway.

Very good recipe.  Extremely easy to make.  I added a touch more vinegar for a little extra bite.  Also added a little more soy.  It was most excellent and I will make it again.

Very easy!  Very good!  MUCH better the 2nd day.  I added some browned, ground pork that I had left over from the egg rolls I made the same day and threw it in while the boullion was cooking.  Threw the green onion in as a garnish on individual bowls since some of my guests don't like onion.  Will make again, and again!!! (Did cut vinegar in half, but not soy!)

I’m an egg drop junkie. I halved this. I took one star away only because the eggs ended up looking cloudy instead of egg streams etc. i probably stirred too much while adding. Next time I’ll swirl the broth while streaming the egg into it. Delicious soup! EASY

I have found a much better recipe that is authentic and just as easy to make....without vinegar in it. Have you ever had vinegar in egg-drop soup? No, because it doesn't belong in it. It gives this soup a very weird taste.

Not a bad recipe by any means, however the directions are severely lacking and quantity of ingredients is not accurate enough. 'One green onion, minced' is very unclear into how volume of onion is to be added. Half of one small onion would be plenty, it is somewhat overpowering and tastes too much of french onion soup due to this. As well as two tablespoons of soy sauce lending to this, perhaps two teaspoons or holding on it would be more appropriate. The timing is incredibly difficult without a decent frame in which to act and wait regarding the cooking. Aside from that, however, it was a moderately simple recipe that uses common ingredients in a swift manner, and is with little cleanup. There was more than a little guesswork and compensating, but I did enjoy the bowls made from it.

This soup was too salty. It's not from the soy sauce.  Its too many chicken bouillons.    When I put in the 8 cubes, I saw that the broth was getting too dark hence its gonna be salty.  I will try it again with less cubes and see how it comes out!!  I added more water and cornstarch and it tasted better.

I love this recipe for the simplicity of it.  However, the vinegar and soy sauce threw the taste off for us.  So I just left the vinegar and soy sauce out and it was spectacular.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe, without it, I'm not sure I would have ever tried to make it.

OMG! Finally no more Chinese take-out. This is fantastic and tastes just like our favorite restaurant. One changes were to use 4 cups broth and water with bouillon for the rest, and low-sodium soy sauce because that's all I ever buy. This will definitely be made over and over. Thanks Brian!

I loved the vinegar in this. I do prefer the chicken broth to the bouillon but it was still very tasty. My onions sunk so I garnished with some fresh chives but other than that I followed it exactly. I did use some food coloring as I was told by a good friend that most restaurants do. It didn't add or take away from the flavor at all but it made for one pretty bowl of soup.

I have yet to find a good restaurant that makes Egg Drop Soup since we moved to Southern California from WA state.. so I set out to make my own, and this recipe is unbelievably good! I left out the vinegar though, we didn't have any in the cabinet, but the soup was still the best I've had in a long time! Thank you for posting this recipe!!

I made this for my lunch today and it was GOOD. I also heated up store-bought egg rolls and made a meal out of the two together. Will be making this again the next time the flu bug hits our house!

I cannot make any Chinese-themed dinner without this recipe. I actually tried the other night, making a stir-fry, and my 3-year-old asked me where the egg soup was. So this recipe is a winner in my house, especially if my daughter asks for it by name. Thank you!

This was okay.. it wasn't what I was looking for. I'm trying to find something similar to my fave local restaurant. My husband and I thought it was too salty. I only used 4 cubes, 1T reduced sodium soy sauce and 2T vinegar. My 2yr old daughter thought it was delicious though!

After having my wisdom teeth out I was desperate for a soft soup recipe (and one I happened to have all the ingredients in house for) - this one was AWESOME!
Followed the directions to the letter and have now made it 4 times since. Very simple and great taste/consistency.
Thanks!

Next time I think I will use less soy and less vinegar. Its not the egg drop soup that we're used to but I loved it and defintely will make again.

I was looking for something good that didn't require chewing since I just had all of my bottom teeth pulled and I came across this recipe. It was very good with a few minor adjustments. I didn't have the bullion, and only had 4 C of chicken broth. I like salty so I went ahead and used the 2 TBS of soy sauce. I wasn't so sure about the vinager and all I had was balsamic, so I cut it to 1 TBS. I also added a dash of ground ginger and a splash of sesame oil. I left out the onion and went ahead and used the 3 eggs and it turned out very tasty. I cut the corn starch back to 1 1/2 TBS because I didn't have the full 6 cups of liquid, but I think next time I will use the 2 TBS. Very tasty! Thank you!

I didn't have chicken bouillon so I used canned chicken broth (I know bouillon would have been better...) and I didn't have any green onions, and to top it off I forgot the cornstarch!  But it was still great to eat.  My oldest daughter asked for a bowl and finished it and my youngest (16 months) would say "more mease (her version of please) after every bite I took...Next time I will make it with bouillon, and probably try adding red peppers and garlic to give it a good kick!

So good! This soup was fantastic- the egg was so light it barely tastes eggey at all, like savory marshmallows. I will make this soup again.

I changed a few things and it turned out fantastic! I cut the boullion/water in half and added chicken broth instead. Then right before serving I sprinkled in some toasted sesame oil (regular would be fine too) and some more green onions just for color. It was wonderful with fried rice.

Well I cut short on the bouillon and didn't use vinager. But the soy sauce was well on. Used also some ham cut into small pieces with vermicelli. With some toasted bread to dip. Simply delicious!

Like most everyone else, I used 6 cubes & 8 cups water and left out the soy sauce.  The soup turned out with just the right amount of salt.  My eggs didn't form the way I wanted, so it didn't look quite right, but the flavor was right-on!

Delicious and easy!  I made this according to the directions and it was quite good.  I had to put in a bit more cornstarch to change the consistency at all though.  I really like this recipe as written, but I'm going to tinker around a bit until it's just right for us.  Then it will be 5 stars!  We had this with the steamed barbecue pork buns and fried rice with cilantro, both recipes from this site.

I was expecting something different-I always order egg drop soup in the restaurant and I knew this would be a variation, but it tasted awful. It looks disgusting with the soy and all you can taste is white vinegar. I will stick to going to Wong's.

This was the first time I've ever made this kind of soup. It was very tasty. I'd had this before in restaurants and never paid much attention to it, but I think this was a pretty good replication of "the real thing". I accidentally put a little too much vinegar in it, so it was perhaps a tad too tangy for my taste, so I'm sure if I made it properly, it'd be even better. I guess I also got lucky in that the egg-drop part turned out well, since I read in articles on other websites that this can be a hard technique to do correctly.
