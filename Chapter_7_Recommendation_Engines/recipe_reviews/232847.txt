I liked it but I would have liked more with a different vegetable. I will try mixing in spinach next time. Also, I was not really familiar with Tarragon. Kinda on the sweet side. It was ok.

This was SO good ! I made a few changes, instead of heavy whipping cream, I used half n' half, diced up half a red bell pepper and used Tony 's seasoning ( Louisiana people use it in everything ) My mother just couldn't keep eating ! Makes a cook's heart feel good.

I donâ€™t see how simmering heavy cream is supposed to be a sauce, it turns out to be a spiced milk liquid kind of thing. I would make with a light Parmesan Alfredo sauce. The cayenne was also unnecessary. That being said I will make again accounting for these details. The idea is 5 star, execution as written... not so much...

Tasty! Used leftover thanksgiving turkey cooked on a smoker grill, which is really where all the flavors came from. I used half and half instead of heavy cream (it's what I had) with some cornstarch for thickener, makes the recipe a little more runny but less fatty and still delicious.  If you substitute with half/half, you can't boil the sauce as it will curdle.
