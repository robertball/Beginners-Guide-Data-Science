I was very disappointed in this.  I followed the recipe except only had fenugreek seeds so ground 1 tsp.  The onion flavor the next day was overpowering, and it was too sweet.  Definitely not just like what is served at my favorite Indian restaurant; not even close.

I modified this recipe slightly to get fairly favourable results.  Firstly I used the juice of a whole lemon, mixed with the onion and left to stand for about 8 hours at room temperature.  I then washed the lemon juice off and prepared as directed with the exception of the use of sugar and fenugreek.  I might consider using paprika rather than chilli powder next time for a less aggressive heat.

As written, this didn't work. Cut back on the sugar and chilli, and it's pretty good. I liked the contrast of the ketchup and the lemon juice. This was ok for a change but I won't be making it again. Thanks anyway.

Just put onions in vinegar (preferably malt vinegar), add a little salt and 2 split green chillies. Leave overnight. Its ready to eat when the onions start turning pink.

I made this and also another very similar recipe on the same night. I started out making this one exactly as written but there were things I liked about the other recipe a little better so I ended up adding cayenne pepper and Hungarian paprika to this one too and that bumped it to a 5 star! Good as written but I recommend adding some heat to it.
