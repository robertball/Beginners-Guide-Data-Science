This has become a family favorite! I did use a whole pack of taco seasoning and put into a bag with the chicken so the entire breast was coated. I have also made in a foil lined 9X13 and also covered with foil to make 1 big foil packet. Take cover off 5-10 minutes before done and sprinkle with some more shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips. Awesome!!

OK, so I had chicken thighs and homemade taco seasoning. But I am on a diet, so I substituted thinly sliced onions for the potatoes. I also only had sliced jalapeno peppers which I diced up and put on top of the chicken. Then I had white American cheese which I sliced up into thin sticks. I had tomatoes so I diced them up, and put them on top of everything, sprinkled a little more taco seasoning on top, sealed the whole mess up and baked it. OMG - what a great meal. Sour cream didn't fit into the diet, but when I am skinny, stand by as I am going to have it on top. So, good.  I think made according to directions, using onions instead of potatoes, the whole family would love it.

I am going to give this a 5!  Wonderful, but I did not use the potatoes.  My husband asked if he needed a knife, no way- fell apart.  Gives me other ideas.

I have a hard time keeping with a recipe, I had no other ideas to do.  I served this with the Mexican Sour Cream Rice- also, on this site.  See my coments there.

I tried this recipe because I was in a hurry tonight and didn't want a bunch of cleanup. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, just edible. Boy, was I surprised when I took a bite and loved this meal! My 4 year old who won't eat chicken devoured this and wanted seconds. I couldn't believe. It seems so simplistic that it wouldn't be that tasty but the combination of flavors is deeelish and the chicken was super moist. I used frozen chicken tenders (not thawed) wrapped them in the foil and threw them on the grill for an hour on indirect med/high heat. Perfect!

I thought these were ok - the taste was good but it turned out a little watery inside the foil packet, which translated to a mess. But flavor-wise alone, very good :)

This recipe was a big hit at the dinner table tonight!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I used generic ingredients) and it turned out perfect.  I did slice my potatoes pretty thin, though.  I don't think slices thicker than about 1/8 inch would get done in time.

Edited to add that I did not peel my potatoes.  I used size "B" (around 2") red potatoes and just scrubbed really well.  Tasted Great!

These were easy to prepare and easy to clean up! They got an extra star just for that.  I wanted to get a head start on dinner so I parboiled the potatoes after peeling and slicing them.  That way I could pop the packets in the fridge without worrying about the potatoes discoloring. Potatoes seemed like an odd choice for the taco theme . . . though they turned out well, I'll use cooked rice next time.
I was pleasantly surprised at how good the packets were.  I let them bake the full 35 minutes and think that I'll take them out closer to 30 minutes next time.

Absolutely delicious!! Made as written for the most part, I just added some bacon bits. The kids don't like salsa so I replaced their salsa with Ranch dressing and that turned out fab too!!

Good, simple and tasty.  Alleviated the undercooked potato problem by using shredded hash browns instead.

The chicken turned out quite moist and tasty. I did not put the potatoes in the pack with the chicken because of what I read from other reviewers but I will definitely make the chicken again. It was soooo easy!

Very tasty!  I omitted the salsa as my husband does not like tomatoes. I used shredded cheddar cheese. I added 1/2 cup frozen corn to the packets - layed the corn on one side of the chicken and sealed the foil per instructions. Delicious!

It was OK, the potatoes didn't cook all the way through, but I may not have cut them thin enough.  If I make this again I will cut them thinner and maybe add some olives or veggies to "up" the flavor.

this was super good and super easy. the only issue i had with it was that the liquid from the chicken mixed in with the potato/cheese mixture, making it a bit gloppy. still, delicious.

I have made this several times after finding it on the Kraft website.  I have made some alterations because the potatoes have never been done enough for my family cooked that way for that length of time.  I have used canned sliced potatoes (already cooked so no problem there) or I pre-cook my own potatoes (with or without skin) all the way and slice.  I have skipped the potatoes completely and placed slices of red pepper underneath the chicken (I think it makes for better heat circulation if something is under the chicken). Then I make spanish rice & corn as my side dishes.  I top with much more salsa than is called for or have used stewed tomatoes (with or without chopped jalapenos on top) or spicy diced tomatoes if I am out of salsa.  My husband loves this & I just keep experimenting everytime I make it.  The best thing about this method of cooking is the chicken is always moist!

My Dh and I loved this recipe. Very simple but great flavor. And no clean up!  The kids didnt want to try it b/c it was new...but they are grumpy girls. One of them gave it a try and really liked it.

This has potential - I'd give it a 4 or 5 for easiness but the flavor was a little flat. I used a med salsa. The bottom of my foil packets were watery - the potato slices sat in a bit of watery juice either from the chicken or the yukon golds I used. Maybe better with plain idahos? Loved having no clean up and nothing to do while they were in the oven though! Next time may top with black olives, sour cream & more salsa after they come out of the oven.

My husband didn't like this at all, I thought it was ok. I realized halfway through eating it that I forgot to add the taco seasoning...maybe that's why we didn't care for it.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare chicken and this quick and simple recipe is great! I didn't have taco seasoning so I made my own using a variety of spices. Next time I would cut the potato even thinner because they weren't quiet as done I would have liked. Still tasty though!

MmmMmmMm... THIS IS GOOOD chicken! I didnt think something so simple could be so juicy & delicious! A little pointer though, make sure you spray cooking spray under the potatoes cuz they stick to the foil. I used Light sour cream and 2% cheese and it still came out so, sooo good. I cooked for 35-40 min. and VOILA! I made it wityh yellow saffron rice. Cant wait to make it again! :)

My husband made this because it was an easy clean up recipe!  We all were appreciating the easy clean up and the great tasting food!  He will be cooking more often!!  Our kids really liked this dinner.  They asked for it again the next night!  He'll be making this again!
