I made this dish for a Christmas party and my family did not want to let me out of the house with it.  It was a beautiful AND tasty dish.  I recommend using 12 oz of cream cheese rather than 8 oz. which was not enough.

I made this for a party it was outstanding. I added artichoke hearts to the parmesan cheese layer and Vegetable  recipe mix to the cream cheese. I used yellow bells instead of red bells.
