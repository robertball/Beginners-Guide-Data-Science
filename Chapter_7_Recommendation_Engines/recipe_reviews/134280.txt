I made this the other night and it was a big hit.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it took way longer to cook because of the potatoes.  I think that I cooked the veggies for an extra 20 minutes.

This was very good. I cut the potatoes rather small and put them in the oven with the herbs/spices & oil for 10 minutes. While the potatoes were roasting I cut up the rest of the veggies (I added carrots rather than the onion & peppers -- personal preference). Added them to the pan and put back in the oven for 15 minutes. The proscitto I have was rather wide so I wrapped it around the breasts without using toothpicks. Added the chicken to the pan when the veggies were done and finished baking for 20 minutes. When the chicken was done I took it out to rest & turned the broiler on to brown the veggies the way we like them!

This is really good.  I didn't have parma, so I wrapped the chicken in slices of bacon that I had cooked for about a minute in the microwave (helps the browning process).  Thanks for a great 1 dish recipe.

We enjoyed this dish quite a bit. I thought I was all set to make it, but my thyme smelled a little musty so I subbed rosemary, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. My proscuitto slices were almost exactly the same size and my chicken breasts so I just laid them on top instead of wrapping. I quartered the potatoes, but they were still a little firm compared to the other veggies. Next time, I will take other reviewers' suggestions of putting only the taters in first, then adding the veggies & chicken. Next time I would also add baby carrots. All, in all though, this is an easy weeknight dinner and a great way to get a couple of servings of veggies in. Oh! I almost forgot, my sister and I were able to make 4 not 2 meals out of this. Thanks for sharing Betty!

Potatoes take longer FOR SURE, even if you cut them in smaller pieces.  I added pitted Kalamata Olives and they were a delicious addition.

As previously mentioned, the potatoes take quite a bit longer to cook than the rest of the veggies.  I ended up starting them 20 minutes before everything else than adding in the rest of the veggies and chicken.  I used Roma tomatoes instead of cherry, much better flavor, tossed 1 spring of fresh rosemary.  Next time, I might try bone-in chicken breasts.  I've always loved their flavor better than boneless but boneless are easier to serve.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I added provolone to the chicken and prosicutto wrap which I thought was delicious. You could even make this a good low carb meal by leaving out the potatoes and doubling the zucchini.

Aside from struggles of getting the veggies and chicken cooked properly which involved a lot of adding one thing first, then something else, then removing chicken, and too much work for what should have been a one pan put it in the oven and forget about meal prep really the problem for us was that although we  loved all the ingredients we found the final result rather dull and bland.   Great for using up what was in the fridge, but not worthy of a repeat performance.

The potatoes and tomatoes were excellent. The zucchini was way too overcooked, and the chicken was very bland and dry.

I agree that the potatoes need to be baked longer than the rest of the vegetables. I will add this to my rotation. Husband gave it a 10

The flavors were fantastic!  I had to vary the cooking time- the potatoes did not get soft in 30 minutes. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will par boil the potatoes then add them to the rest of the veggie mix.

This was a great recipe! I sliced gourmet fingerling potatoes and baked them with the other vegetables for a little over an hour. The chicken took about 30 minutes. It was delicious!

This was delicious!!!! Next time I will make less veggies than recipe. There are only two of us and there were way too many.  Definitely a keeper.

I added 1 can artichoke hearts, 8-oz mushrooms, substituted 1/2 lb. cubed sweet potato instead of the red potato, and sprinkled veggies with shredded Italian cheese blend.  Excellent and easy!

This is a winner, for sure!  I sprinkled a little shredded asiago - romano cheese over the roasted veggies to dress them up a bit and used red and yellow bell peppers for colour,  but those were the only revisions.  Will definitely make it again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

i used this as a base for what i had available in the house.. green beans, green bell pepper, russet potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, and regular bacon.. i wanted this to be more herbal, but i stuck with just the thyme.. i steamed the potatoes a bit to ensure they would be fully cooked along with the other veggies.. this is somewhere between a 3.5 and a 4, but given the fact that i didn't use the exact ingredients and bf enjoyed the meal, i'll stick with giving it a 4

This was a good recipe, great flavor combo! I gave it 4 stars because baking the potatoes/veggies takes way longer then stated. I fry them in a large skillet with the olive oil until they are about half done then add the other veggies and seasonings, we grilled the chicken and this turned out great. Thank you!

This recipe was really good - I made this with bacon and canned diced tomatoes since that is all I had on hand.  I will def used prosciutto and fresh tomatoes next time.  The only other changes I made was to use brown potatoes and added 3 garlic cloves.
