Definitely kid-friendly (except for the zucchini.)  Lots of chopping, but it's worth it for a great mid-week meal.  Makes tons of leftovers especially if you add extra ingredients (such as 3 half chicken breasts 0 then you don't have to freeze one), the whole pound of sausage, and the entire jar of spaghetti sauce!  One problem:  slicing raw sausage is difficult and the sausage oozes out of the casing.  The bits get burned when browning.  I recommend browning them whole and then slicing them.  Also, I recommend cooking the onion and pepper mixture uncovered so the meat doesn't steam.

I will definitely make this again with some changes in preparation!  Thanks, Mary!

Excellent!  I wouldn't change a thing!  The only thing I did differently was to cook the sausage and chicken up separately, then cut it up.  I then cooked the onion/green pepper mixture in a large pot in a small amount of oil.  Once that was done, I added the cut up meat and the rest of the ingredients and simmered on low for approximately 30 - 40 mins.  I then cooked the pasta and dished it up seperately then spooned the sauce mixture over top, instead of mixing it all together.  Awesome recipe, Mary!  Thanks!

My husband is a very picky eater. Wasn't sure if he would like this. He called it very addicting after his second helping. I made a few changes to the recipe, added fresh mushrooms, more garlic, used chilli ready tomatoes, added one Tablespoon of sugar, and left out the green peppers (yuk!) This recipe is a winner!

I liked this recipe....I really did.  Just didnt love it. I dont see the need for two meats unless you happen to have some leftover chicken from the night before because it still tastes like a marinara pasta dish...The italian sausage will dominate any chicken flavor.  Plus - why thaw two kinds of meat when one will suffice??  However - I had a ton of zuchini from my garden this year and I'm glad I tried this.  Would make again and use one (or the other) meat.  Thanks Mary

This was very good....I did make some changes for my family's taste.  I did not use the zucchini or green pepper and I used some fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned and a little more garlic.  I also followed the advice of another reader and cooked the sausages whole and then sliced them, I may do that next time with the chicken as well.  I used only one jar(26 oz)of sauce, which was plenty.  When serving, I tossed about 1/2 of the sausage/chicken mixture with the pasta and served the remaining mixture on the side.  With a loaf of italian bread and a salad and some parmesan cheese, this was a very nice meal.  My family loved it.  Thank you for sharing, Linda.

I was running low on groceries and did not feel like going to the market. I searched with what ingredients I had and BAM, an amazing quick dinner. I keep frozen green peppers and onions in my freezer, so it kept the prep time down. I added fresh garlic and a can of mushrooms. I also used whole grain pasta. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I found this recipe because the only vegetable in the fridge was zucchini!  I followed the recipe with these exceptions; no green pepper, no sausage, no can of mushrooms.  I used 3 chicken breasts.  It was a surprisingly light meal.  We were full but not stuffed.  I think the lightness was due to the can of tomatoes mixed with the sauce.  Refreshing hot meal!

Was okay but nothing special. Seemed like things were just globbed together without an overall "theme" for the flavor.

Excellent meal! Used hot sausage for some kick, but otherwise prepared as listed. We had unexpected dinner guests and there was plenty for 2 more people, and everyone raved over it. "It's a keeper" was heard more than once. Thanks for a new twist for a quick, delicious dinner option!

This was a really great recipe that I will definitely be making again!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I took the sausage out of the casings (I only used three) and I cooked the sausage right with the chicken.  I had previously frozen about 2 cups of zucchini from the summer harvest - it was already peeled and cubed, so I just mostly defrosted it and added it in at the end.  This was a great meal!

We loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to leave out the spaghetti sauce and add just a little (1/3 of a cup or so) tomato sauce instead.  Oh, and I also cooked the sausage separately at first, and drained out all the fat I could.  Delicious!

Very Delicious. I made a few changes, I used sweet italian sausage, chardonnay wine, added cut chicken breast (cooked in the same pan as the sausage), and added corn starch and more chicken broth to thicken the sauce. I was helpful to read a few reviews before making it. It turned out great. I wish I made more!

Pretty good. Not much in the way of flavor though. I used like 12 times as much garlic and still found it lacking for flavor. O well!

This recipe was very good! Just added a couple banana peppers from the garden. Not your normal pasta and tomato sauce. Very tasty.

I'm sorry for the revisions but as i was preparing this I felt not only that it was bland and dry.  I added some tomato puree (I didn't have any more diced tomatoes), my other adjustments were the 3 fresh garlic cloves I used, some red pepper flakes, 2T of Italian Seasoning, and 1T dried basil.  I served it over whole wheat pasta.  I shared it with some friends and haven't heard any overwhelming comments so I assume they feel the same as I did.  It was okay, made plenty but don't think I will make it again.

Chicken, Sausage & Zucchini Pasta Haiku: "Halved the recipe, quite a bit of work to prep, doesn't need chicken!" Much easier to brown the Italian sausage first before slicing; also felt like the chicken was totally lost in this recipe, as the sausage provides enough protein flavor. I actually wasn't expecting to like this all that much, thinking that many ingredients, 2 proteins, and several veggies, would all compete with one another to be my tastebuds' victor, but golly, we all ended up really liking this! Halved the recipe for 2 adults, 1 child, used the full 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes (Italian-seasoned ones), and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of opening up a jar of spaghetti sauce for the amount called for. My only complaint was that it felt like alot of prep work, but I suppose if I made it again and dropped the chicken, that would save some time, and certainly using the canned mushrooms and tomatoes reduced that chopping time, so OK, I take my complaint back, this WAS good. :)

I had all the ingredients for this and it was perfect!  I guess depending on what spaghetti sauce you use is how you should season with salt and pepper to taste.  I used Ragu traditional.  I only had a can of whole tomatoes so I just chopped them up and added them. This was a great recipe to use up some of my pantry and fridge!  Thanks!

I made this tonight, without the chicken (and my sausage was not spicy). It was so good! I modified it a little. I doubled it because I have a family of 10. Instead of the onion, I used cans of sweet onion diced tomatoes and I added onion powder. I didn't use bell pepper, I was out. I used 1 jar spaghetti sauce rather than measure it and leave an open jar. I only used a little bit of fresh sliced mushrooms that I had that needed to be used up. I sliced, then quartered 4-5 large zucchini. I also added extra spices, Redneck Pepper and 2 TBSP sugar. I put all (except pasta) into a 5qt crock pot and it was very full. I cooked it on high for about 4 - 4 1/2 hrs. It was really simple and easy. The longest part was chopping all the zucchini. My kids ate it with shredded cheese and grated Parmesan. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was excellent!  I made it with the listed ingredients, but you could probably use whatever vegetables you have handy.  Used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2 and there was enough food for 4 or 5. Used the whole jar of spaghetti sauce since there was only a little bit left.  It was a lot of chopping, but the meal cooks up quick once everything is ready to go.  Great dinner, we loved it!

This is a good recipe. Nothing particularly special, but good, and I did like the zucchini in it. I sprinkled it with shaved Parmesan cheese for the last ten minutes of baking.

This was SO GOOD. One of my favorite pasta dishes I've had in a long time. I used Johsonville ground Italian sausage (since that's what I had) and otherwise followed the recipe pretty much as written and LOVED it! Leftovers reheat great too. I did omit zucchini since my boys don't eat it - but I would have liked it in this a lot. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned to use up what I had.

Grilled the chicken til barely pink yesterday, then cut it up last night so it was ready to add today. Will precook the sausage next time as well, so it is easier to cut and will speed up the time needed to complete this dish.  We loved the finished product, and it will be one of our go-to recipes in the summer when our garden is overflowing with zucchini, peppers, and onions.

YUM! This was really good!!! While I prefer Michelle's Italian sausage & zucchini a *tad* better (literally, just by a slim margin), this was super yummy too! I LOVE sausage and pasta, so this was right up my alley! :) I do think you could get by using only one meat tho.... The chicken was a nice addition, but totally not necessary IMHO (if you don't have it, don't sweat it). TIP: As DMM104 mentioned in her review, slicing uncooked sausage can be difficult. The sausage oozes out of the casing, making quite a mess. As she did, I also cut my sausage PRIOR to cooking it. I browned all four links in a little EVOO to start. Once nice and brown on all sides, I removed my sausage links, allowed them to cool a bit and then sliced. I added my sliced sausage BACK to my skillet and finished cooking it along with my chicken - perfect! Other than adjusting how I cooked my sausage, my only other change was to use an entire package (3 breasts) of chicken instead of just two breasts. I'm not sure I'd have noticed there was chicken in this had I not increased it. A warm loaf of Italian bread was all I needed to complete my homey meal. All in all, this was SUPER tasty and 100% hubs approved (hooray!)! Thanks for sharing your recipe with the AR community, Mary! :-)

Although this was a relatively easy recipes, I did not like it. I did use homegrown tomatoes, and a jar of my favorite sauce but this was not a very well received dinner. I also substituted cremini mushrooms [my favorite kind] but I am very unlikely to be bothered to make again. Just not what I expected at all. I love pasta but will pass on this.

Very easy and delicious recipe. My kids and husband loved it. My 3 year old rated it a 5 star dish. My 14 son ate 3 serverings. No left overs. With my busy schedule this is very easy to make. Thanks for sharing. I would make this again and again.

This was WONDERFUL! I didn't use chicken or zucchini, but I added carrots and used fresh mushrooms, added at the beginning. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Pretty good and it makes a substancial amount. I used bulk ground sausage and chicken thighs since I had them on hand. I did feel like it was a bit bland, but that's an easy fix.

I used one large zucchini (each slice quartered, with the seeds scooped out).  We also removed the italian sausage (hot) from the casings, cooked it up then drained off the grease.  Makes a ton!  Kind of goulash like (and I don't usually care for goulash).

This was very good.  I did substitute diced ham for the chicken as I had that left over and didn't feel like defrosting a chicken breast.  I also removed the sausage from the casing and crumbled rather than just slicing. I used fresh mushrooms and didn't have any zucchini so increased the peppers and mushrooms.  The end result was yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe. I used tomato sauce and chopped tomato because I had them on hand. Johnsonville Italian sausage Mild.I put a few squirts of hot sauce in after tasting it. This is a lot of food and it is really healthy and full of flavor. This one goes in the recipe box!

This was great! All five in the house loved it and it's hard to please my 7 and 9 year olds with anything other than mac and cheese or chicken nuggets. Instead of the spaghetti sauce I used oil butter and garlic as my sauce. I also used breakfast sausage which gave it even more flavor! YUM!!

Super Yummy! This recipe is great. When I made it I decided to skip adding the mushrooms and green peppers (didn't want to compete with the zucchini) and used sage sausage. I also added a pinch of cinnamon and some fresh Thai basil along with the other seasoning. Yum... It was a very tasty and satisfying meal.

Doubled the recipe and used turkey sausage and a bit more seasoning.  Whole family loved it.  Thought it was a great alternative to everyday pasta sauce.  Made great leftovers.

I can't believe I've been making this for 2 years and haven't bothered to write a review! DO NOT make this if you don't want to get addicted! You will eat too much of this because it's soooo good! I've made it exactly as the recipe says each time except omitted the green peppers because I think they're nasty! Oh alright, I did change one thing - instead of a regular can of tomatoes, I used the Italian tomatoes and didn't bother with the Italian seasonings! But both are good. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Mary, my tastebuds salute you!

Very good!  The tastes mixed together very well after letting it simmer.  I couldn't find sausage in the casing at my store, so I just used bulk Italian sausage and it worked fine.  I froze some for a quick midweek meal.  Thanks for a tasty, hearty dish!

Since we don't like Italian sausage, I used country sausage instead. Also used fresh, sliced mushrooms in place of canned and only 1 zucchini instead of 3. Used about 2 1/4 cups of sauce and sprinkled in some oregano. I thought it needed a little more flavor. Very good!

The recipe was pretty good--I used hot Italian sausage and so had to use a liitle bit of oil.  I love garlic so I used garlic cloves and garlic salt.  I also did as others suggested and used more tomato sauce.  My husband LOVED it and that's saying something if you know my husband!

I was tired of making the same things and took a quick peek to see what I could make with chicken and pasta.  I found this recipe and ran to the store for a few of the essential ingredients I was missing.  Took a while to prepare (lots of chopping) but well worth the time.  Everyone loved this, even my picky 5 year old.  This was great tasting and will be added to my meals to make at least every month!

I tried this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  We were all surprised it turned out so so well.  We also added our own herbs and used hot Italian sausage.  Cutting everything up into smaller bits makes for a more uniform texture.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe. My boyfriend and I loved it. My family all went back for seconds! Delicious! Makes lots of pasta. Much more than just 6 servings!

This was an excellent recipe.  I used beer bratwurst in lieu of ground sausage.  Also, I grow my own herbs, so throwing in fresh basil, thyme, oregano and parsley really added to it.  My 4 and 2 year old scarfed it.

My husband is usually finicky about trying new recipes, and he REALLY liked it.  We used hot Italian sausage for a little extra zip.  We will definitely have this again.

This was really good. I didn't have diced tomatoes so I left them out  and I used peas instead of zucchini. I served it over whole wheat pasta instead of egg noodles.

Tasted great.  I had a ton of frozen shredded zucchini from the fall I wanted to use and it worked well in this too.  I feel sneaky, my boys won't even know it's there!  I left out the sausage, didn't have any, but I added extra salt and a Cajun spice mix to make up for my lack.  Also a Tbsp of Truvia (Stevia sweetener) per another review.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OH my goodness! This is WONDERFUL! I followed recipe as is except I accidentally forgot to add the garlic, I had minced it and set it aside but forgot to put it in.  And I didn't add chicken but only because I didn't have any....this will INDEED be in our line up! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe

I was looking for a recipe with zucchini, sausage and pasta. I searched the site and decided on this one, glad I did. I made some changes based what I had. I did not add chicken or mushrooms but I would add mushrooms if I have them for the next time. Also, I used corkscrew pasta. The whole family loved it, even got my boys to eat zucchini. I'm adding this to the meal rotation.

I omitted the spaghetti sauce, sounded like overkill with the can of diced tomatoes to me, and added a 1/4 cup of white wine.

It was really good...I did leave out the chicken (pure laziness on my part).  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was really good.  My son was happy because it had sausage, my daughter liked it because it had noodles, my husband liked it because it reheated well and I liked it because it was easy to make, had vegetables and was tasty!  I call that a win.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to follow recipe. The only time consuming thing was cutting the vegetable but I did that ahead of time to ease the prep. Both my husband and my daughter gave this dish the thumbs up!

My boys loved it and didn't even pick out the zucchini, no left overs at my house.  I did add more spaghetti sauce as we like our food saucy.  I also made a vegan version with Tofu Italian sausage for my DH and he loved it too!

Nothing like fresh veggies from the farmer's market! I too took the advice of cooking sausage in its casing 1st I used 1 large link of hot & 1 of sweet Italian & 1 large chicken breast. After futting up sausage, i added to onion, 3 cloves garlic & added can of tomato paste to my mother in law's home made tomato sauce. Wow! I swear using farmer's market fresh meats & veggies: onions, garlic, zuchini etc. this dish is a repeater for sure! My hubby the picky eater loved it!

So I followed the recipe the way it was written, except changed out the pasta for white rice, and put in less sausage and more chicken.  I had only two pieces of sausage left over from another night, so that is all I threw in.  The flavors together were good, but I do agree with some other comments, why thaw two meats if one will suffice.  This meal is fine the way it is written, but you could also cook it with either meat and it would be fine too. My husband doesn't like zucchini, but in this I got him to eat it so that was a plus for us. It's worth trying
