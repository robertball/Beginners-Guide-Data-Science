Very good shrimp!  Rather than marinating these in a bowl, about an hour before dinner, I threaded the shrimp on wooden skewers that had been soaked.  I put them in a baking dish and poured the marinade over, turning to coat both sides.  I covered the dish and let these marinade in the refrigerator until dinnertime.  I think it is so much easier and less messy to do it this way.  Both Hubs and I enjoyed these!

Wow! This was so good even my husband enjoyed it and he's not a huge fan of grilled shrimp. Very easy and takes practically no time at all. I opted for a couple shakes of tabasco vs. cayenne pepper and let it marinate for a couple of hours. I skewered these on wooden skewers that I soaked in water to avoid them burning. Great recipe and one that you don't have to feel guilty about!

Had this today. Used tomato paste instead of sauce (that's what I had on hand) and it came out delicious.

Made this last weekend and everybody loved it, I had 2lb of large tiger shrimp and marinated 50% in this and 50% in a marinade of lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, garlic , freshly chopped basil and a generous pinch of cayenne pepper. Both were devoured rapidly. Will make again. (I forgot only had tomato paste so I used a little less to replace tomato sauce and added a little water, I can't imagine this changed the flavor)

So very delicious! I doubled the recipe and used half to marinate the shrimp and half to baste shrimp while grilling. Marinade coated shrimp very nicely...very delicious and fresh flavor! It may have been a tad on the salty side....i tend to think that when vinegar is used, the amount of salt needed is decreased. But, other than that, definitely a keeper!

This one is going to be one of our regular meals.  I substituted chipolte powder for the cayenne pepper since I didn't have it and my husband doesn't really care for cayenne.  Marinated it all day too the second time.  So tasty.

Just made this for Father's Day BBQ as an appetizer. It was a hit! I did add extra fresh basil and a nice pinch of dry basil for added flavor. I was asked to make this again!

We loved this. Makes a very light dinner and is delicious. We grilled 3 skewers of shrimp along with 2 skewers of brown mushrooms and 6 cloves of garlic. It was wonderful. Thanks

I followed the recipe except for using V8 juice instead of tomato sauce (its what I had).  They turned out very well.  I marinated the shrimp about 2 hours.

Perfect!! So moist and full of flavor!  I did not have tomato sauce so just left it out, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This was a huge hit in our house and I will be making again!

I did add red chile flakes to the marinade to give it an extra kick .  Best to watch the time. My shrimp did not cook quickly and 2 to 3 minutes was not long enough.

I made this as written except I used tomato paste instead of sauce because I didn’t have sauce on hand. It was delicious with the the right amount of spice. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Really good. Lots of flavor. It is better to grill them. I once put them in the broiler and the came out tough and chewy.

Turned out great!  I followed the recipe but made a few substitutions because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used tomato paste and a little water, dried basil, and white wine vinegar.  I marinated the shrimp for about 1 hour before putting them on skewers and grilling.

I had forgotten that I made these last summer until my family reminded me. I'm glad a put it in my recipe file because I was just asked to make them next weekend. This time I hope I get some! Last time they ate them so fast I couldn't get them cooked fast enough! By the time I was done all that was left for me were the last few that came off the grill! This time I'm getting mine first!

This marinade is absolutely delicious.  This is a great balance of flavor with a little bit of spice.  I added liquid smoke just to give it that extra smoky flavor.  Using this on chicken skewers tonight!

pretty yummy & easy. made with a few substitutions based on what I had in pantry...used ketchup instead of tomato sauce and hot sauce instead of cayenne pepper. Gave it a nice kick.

This was simple and delicious.  I used the entire 8oz can of sauce and just eye-balled the other ingredients, but subbed a liberal amount of Old Bay for the cayenne.  Very tasty!  Hubs grilled to perfection.  Thanks for shaing this recipe.
