This recipe is very versatile!  You can use virtually any cake mix you like.  You can also use different nuts and chips.  I used walnuts and peanut butter chips because that's what I had in the pantry.  I also only had a half of a can of sweetened condensed milk, which worked perfectly.  These were devoured by my nieces and nephews at a birthday party - they even unintentionally outshined the birthday cake!  Two suggestions: line your pan with parchment paper so the bars will come out easily, and do not overbake!  Crusts on these types of bars burn quickly.

very rich! but extremely easy, no mess and no fuss.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix, and melted the butter to go into the crust.  Paula Dean makes a similar crust for her "gooey toffee bars" from her show and she melts hers.  Very easy to pat the dough into the pan, with the butter melted it doesn't stick to your fingers.  I didn't have pecans so used 1 cup of the scotch chips and 1 cup chocolate chips.  I used the same bowl (without washing) to make the condensed milk topping.  They taste somewhat like a butterscotch brownie but are much richer.  The 9x13 pan was perfect and sprayed with Pam.  It didn't stick to the bottom.  A word of caution as with any other recipe that includes condensed milk, don't overcook as the sides will be hard.  This baked in my oven for 27 minutes.  This is a very fast easy dessert and would be nice for bake sales, parties, or any other time one would want a fast simple dessert but with the richness.  The possibilities are endless here as far as modifications.  Any flavor cake mix and chip/nut combo would work.  (spice mix with cinnamon chips, chocolate mix with white chocolate chips...etc.)  They cut into nice squares once cooled.

YUMMY!! They were a huge hit with my fam. I reduced cooking time by almost ten minutes. I think they would have been over done otherwise.

Really good. I user a butter flavored yellow cake mix and omitted the nuts since I didn't have any. So chewy and delicious. I bet it's even better with the pecans. Will definately make these again.

Good but very sweet. Make sure to use the right size pan otherwise they are too thick and don't cook all the way thru.

Wow, we loved these and so easy.  I made them exactly as written and baked them as indicated with no problems.  They came out of the pan very easily. I will definitely make them again.   They are very sweet but for us, that is not an issue.

Good - but does not taste homemade.  We prefer carmelita bars and other home made treats over this one.
Very easy though.

Just okay. My mom liked them though.

OKAY, I made these last night. Today they were perfect! The topping sunk down into the crust and they became the chewy cookie I like! I guess they taste better completely cooled.

Followed directions to the tee. I can't help but think the bars would've been better if crust only baked for HALF the amt. of time. The bottom was just too hard

I only had chocolate cake mix on hand, a half cup of butterscotch chips, a half cup peanut butter chips and a cup of pecans.  Delish!  Will try red velvet cake with white chips & walnuts next time.

Not too shabby!  A little bit on the too sweet side, but still really good.  Surprisingly, they were actually better a few days old, rather than right out of the oven or later that day.  I followed the recipe exactly and wish that I would have cut the second baking time down by a few minutes and use parchment paper as another reviewer suggested.  Overall, a good and easy bar to make.

Super delicious and very rich!! As others have said, be careful not to over bake since these will cool harder than other bars because of the sweetened milk. Much cleaner cut when cooled.

Wow, are these ever rich!!! I love blondies, but I'd never made them with cake mix. Super delicious, though I omitted the nuts (son doesn't like). Perhaps I'll do half choc chips and half butterscotch next time. Thanks for this delicious recipe.

This is a great easy recipe! I've made it so many times, wish I had a picture to upload! It is also very versatile, I've made it with strawberry cake mix and white chocolate chips..super easy and quick to put together. One of my go to's for sure.

My family loved this recipe! I, however, really didn't. I am not a butterscotch fan, so that's why. :-) When I made these I didn't have pecans so I made the recipe without. That was the only thing I didn't follow. These are very sweet, rich blondie brownies. I've made these several times since, and I now add about a cup more butterscotch or white chocolate chips (to spice things up!) and another teaspoon of vanilla...and still no pecans! This is a really great recipe even though I didn't necessarily care for it with the butterscotch chips. It can be tweaked in so many ways; that is a great thing about any recipe!

Make the pudding!!!!!! It turned out great even though I royally screwed up. I mis-read and just added the pudding mix in with the cake mix (I did not make the pudding)and realized my mistake too late. It ended up okay, I just added a cup of water and let it stand a bit so it thickened...but it was a little hilarious how I messed that one up. In any case, it still came out great, and I'll have to try making it again the right way - I'm sure it'd taste even better.

I tried it as is and then the next day I got creative.  I substituted devil's food cake mix.  I used Heath bar pieces instead of pecan (much cheaper), and a mix of milk chocolate and butterscotch chips.  These were AMAZING!

I followed the recipe as written.  The texture is more cake like than I would have expected.  I have the ingredients and will try it again without eggs... more like what is seen in the Eagle Brand Magic Cookie Bars or 7 Layer Bars.

The 5 stars are from everyone else. It is just TOO sweet for me, but that's only me. I made these for my husband's team at his job and apparently they were the talk of the office. Now his other fellow employees want to try them. They are still being discussed a month or so later. I made them without nuts, because I was not sure if everyone liked them and then I took out a little of the butterscotch chips and replaced with some white chocolate chips, because I had them and thought it would make a good combination, which they did.

I was a little apprehensive about this recipe, because it wasn't completely from scratch.  I am soooooo GLAD I tried it. The brownies are so moist and gooey. My oldest daughter does not like butterscotch and she loved these brownies. I did not have pecans so I used roasted walnuts.  Next time I make these I will use pecans.

They were good...but not great.  We decided they were not worth the calories.  We will not make them again.

Warning:  You will gain 5 pounds LOOKING at these!  OMG are they good!  If you're sensitive to the very rich and sweet, I would advise warming them up and putting vanilla ice cream on them.  I used white chocolate instead of butterscotch and they turned out perfectly.  Definately use the parchment paper.  Save yourself the scrubbing!  They'll lift right out!

I did make changes on the recipe due to what I had in my kitchen and based on prior reviews. I added 1/3 cup of cream cheese and 1/4 teaspoon of salt to cut down on the sweetness. I sprinkled 1/4 cup of coconut on top of the crust (my son is not a fan). I added 1/2 cup of mini snickers bars to the filling. Baked for 25 minutes and we have perfection!

Great recipe! I doubled the ingredients and layered on those chips! (As far as I'm concerned you can't have too many butterscotch chips for these blondies. I added chocolate chips too!)  My Daycare children gobbled them up and kept begging for more. A new favorite.

Followed exactly but used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch ones. Baked slightly under 25 minutes because the top set up faster in my oven. These were just ok, a little dry but the top had a nice chewy texture. I guess I was expecting something more because of the reviews. This wasn't at all bad but just not great.

I just didn't care for it.  I used to love butterscotch as a child but this was so overpowering.  No one liked it.

I made this is directed and it turned out perfectly.  I was not overly fond of this recipe.  I thought it was too sweet.  I made it again using a chocolate cake mix, 3/4  cup peanut butter chips and 3/4 cup semisweet chips.   There was a small riot over the last piece but I made it and  I'm going to eat it!   EXTREMELY versatile recipe with endless flavor combinations.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I am using this as a base rather than a recipe by itself.

These are OK.  Don't expect a moist brownie crumb; they are more cake like, but the condensed milk provides a bit more chewy texture than cake.

Theses were excellent!  A unique combination of gooey butter cake and pecan pie bars with a butterscotch twist.  These definitely taste best once completely cooled so that the flavors have time to blend.
