This recipe is out of this world.  I have made this about 7 times.  Very easy to prepare, I mix everything in one baking dish, limit the mess.  I use chive cream cheese spread, and parmesan cheese from the green can it works just as good if not better than the other.  I think the key to this recipe is the fresh bacon (do not use the pre cooked bacon).  I make this recipe in the morning and fry up the whole package of bacon (my family eats the rest for breakfast with eggs), I use  slightly more bacon 9-10 slices.  Also make sure you cut up the artichoke heart.  Serve with tortilla chips and/or toasted bread slices on the side.  Only serve a little at a time, keep the rest in a warm oven to keep extra yummy and hot!!!  This is the BEST EVER!!!!

I haven't made this yet but I am hoping this will help anyone else out there!  The garlic-herb cheese spread is probably the Aluoette brand that can be found at most grocery stores near the deli dept. with the gourmet cheeses (like Muenster, Gouda, etc.) It is wonderfully flavored and I am guessing it makes the difference in this recipe compared to others.

Great recipe although I didn’t have all the necessary ingredients, (looked this up spur of the moment) but, it was mmmmm mmmmm good! I had 8 oz tub of soft chive/onion crm cheese but only a ½ cup of sour cream. So I added a couple big spoonfuls of a Chipotle dip on hand. I used a Parm/Romano/Asiago cheese blend. Had a can of quartered Artichoke hearts in water I drained & chopped (I don’t care for the oily marinated kind). I did as another’s review to add the bacon on top before baking - good tip! (I did add a few drops of liquid smoke into dip mixture to compensate). Since I like garlic & didn’t have the garlic/herb cheese spread, I added a tsp of crushed garlic. I chopped up the spinach after removing any large stem pieces. I think some chopped water chestnuts and a bit of chopped grn onion would incorporate well. This is a great base recipe and for anyone like me it’s a great starting point you can experiment with when you don't have exact ingredients. I’m sure it’s super made the way it’s written also! Note: I also froze ½ of the recipe as I made this just for myself. Too much for me to eat on my own as it is a bit on the rich side, but real satisfying when you just need to have something hot, cheesy, savory, sinful and delish! Glad I have some available for my next craving!!! Love it with homemade toasted pita triangles.

I don't like artichokes, but I LOVED this recipe! The bacon was a nice twist, and I also threw the artichokes and spinach in the food processor to decrease the stringy spinach and chunkier artichokes. Everyone loved it, and I've had multiple requests for the recipe.  Thanks Mrs. Seals!!!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I made it for my family at Christmas and everyone, even my husband who is a picky eater loved it.  I did chop the artichoke hearts up so it would be easier to eat and I also cut the bacon into quarters with scissors before frying to make it easier to crumble.   
I would definetly recommend this and will make it again for parties.

I made this for a holiday party and it was almost gone before the guests finished arriving.  Everyone loved it. At least three people have already asked for the recipe.  By far the bet spinach dip I have ever made.

My husband loved this recipe!  He wants me to add more bacon next time though.  Kids didn't care for it, but I didn't expect that they would. My Mom, who said "Yuck" when I told her aobut it, tried it and really liked it.

Oh my gosh, YUM! I first had this at a friend's house and I LITERALLY ate 3/4 of this alone. This is so easy to make. I got the bacon bits from the salad bar at a local super market, they are real and already crumbled so you save a step. This is so easy, just throw it all together and its done. I wouldn't change one single thing. I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!

I made this for a Fourth of July BBQ, and everyone raved.  It was gone in less than 15 minutes!  I combined the spinach and artichokes in my food processor, and chopped them first before adding in all the dairy.  I used Tastefully Simple's Bacon Bacon in place of the bacon strips.  This will be my most requested item for potlucks, I just know!

This was phenomenal, way better than anything I've had in a restaurant. 

I didn't add bacon (it just didn't seem to "fit" the recipe). To give the dip just a little crunchiness to it, I added a few heaping tablespoons of diced water chestnuts. 

I used a previous reviewer's suggestion to do 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup shredded Italian blend cheese (the kind that has romano, mozzerella, etc). SUCH a good suggestion, it gave the dip just a touch of stringy cheese texture. 

I used a small tub of Alouette Light Garlic and Herb cheese spread (you can find it in the little 'gourmet' refrigerated section of the deli in the grocery store), THIS really made the recipe great, I think. I also used Lite sour cream. 

I served with toasted pieces of pita bread, DELICIOUS!!!! This is going to be my new party staple dish.

I made this recipe for Superbowl Sunday using whatever I had on hand. I didn't have sour cream or garlic herb cheese spread but I made do and the dip turned out very tasty! I used plain cream cheese and a packet of dry veggie soup mix in place of the cheese spread. I figured it would be ok to use the soup mix since it had a different recipe for making warm spinach and artichoke dip on the back. I didn't have sour cream either but I guess I didn't need it! As I scrolled through the reviews I saw that other users added different shredded cheeses in addition to the Parmesan. The only bag of shredded cheese I had was cheddar, and I was not going to try that! I found a fresh Sargento mozzerela cheese stick in the fridge. I chopped it up and threw it into the dip. Also, instead of bacon I added bits of cooked and seasoned chicken. The chicken was a nice touch and I'm glad I added it. I served the dip hot with a big bowl of tortilla chips and it was great!Although I didn't exactly follow the recipe to a tee I got tons of compliments! So don't be afraid to experiment with whatever you have in the fridge! :)

I made this without the mayonnaise and the bacon and it's still pretty good.  I added some chili peppers to actually make it hot hot. Warning: it's very important to chop the spinach!  Mine came out stringy because of this!

Yummy.. My modifications were to use a can of artichoke hearts in water which I drained well, also about 4T of Con Queso for the cheese spread.  It gave it a slightly spicy kick which was nice but I'd like to try it with the garlic herb next time.  I used "Real" bacon.  Served with crackers... :)

This recipe was just okay.  I felt like there was more "fat" in it than there needed to be - so much so that I could hardly taste the spinach and artichokes. If I were to make it again, I would most likely leave out the mayo and add some garlic.

I can't stop eating this stuff!  I'm so full but every time I've walked into the kitchen I've had to take a couple more bites!  I followed others advice and chopped the artichokes up but left the spinach alone (the package did say chopped spinach), added a couple of extra slices of bacon crumbled on top along with 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella on top for the wow effect when it comes out and strings a bit and other than that followed the recipe exact.  This is good hot or cold.  My neighbor even called me a chef.   :  )

This is a classic version of a hot artichoke and spinach dip. It was exactly what I had hoped for. I will keep this on hand for any party or get together in the future! It makes a lot and I ended up not being able to finish it all, which bummed me out given how the ingredients are a hair pricey for a dip. I think it's worth it though!

I made this two weeks ago and it was delicious. Easy to make and restaurant quality. I didn't use the garlic-herb flavored cheese like the recipe called for. However, without it the dip was sill flavorful. I served it with blue corn tortilla chips. Thanks for this recipe!

This dip was AMAZING!!! I did like what some other people did by adding more bacon, 10 pieces, i think id still probly put more in there still, just to have even more bacon flavor. I also was worried about it being too salty, cause i know fresh parmesan cheese can be very salty, so i did 1/2 cup parm and then 1/2 cup Italian blend cheese (has like parm, motz, ect) and it was perfect, made it cheezy without being too salty, it was one that got eaten the most at Thanksgiving!! Had 8ppl over and had barely any left overs lol! Great warmed up too! Especially with some toasted/warmed bread :) If your looking for a good dip/appitizer then USE THIS RECIPE! Oh i also put a lil bit of pepper and red cayenne pepper in it, cause i like some heat to my dishes lol. OH also lol i chopped up the artichokes really good too, and it was perfect, better than those big chunks.

Very good.  I made it for a lunch with a friend today with crackers. We both loved it.  I used Real Bacon pieces instead of cooking the bacon.  And I think next time I would use chopped spinach....too stringy otherwise and messy.  I also put the artichoke hearts in the blender and chopped them up first.  Excellent flavor and know I will make it again and again.  Thanks!

Super yummy. I doubled this recipe and will triple next time. I brought it to a potluck and they scrapped the bowl. Also i made a couple changes. I did it all in my crockpot. Used 2 cups of shredded parm and 2 cups of and Italian shredded cheese blend. Was super cheesy.

I brought this to a holiday party, and it was a BIG hit!  Also, I used canned, chopped spinach to cut out the thawing time, and it still tasted great!  Definitely a keeper :)

I absolutely loved this! I'm still learning to cook, and this was the recipe I chose to make for thanksgiving. It was a huge hit, and tastes great. The Aluoette brand cheese was a great addition, I think. I will certainly share this recipe and make it again.

Best Spinach and Artichoke Dip I've ever made!  The only things I did differently was I used refrigerated bacon bits and sprinkled come grated Parmesan on top before baking.  I served it in a deep pie dish.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and ran the spinach and artichokes through the food processor first. Perfect!  Great recipe!

I did not care for this. worst spinach dip I ever made :( Sorry guys but mayonnaise does not belong in spinach dip. I think it weighs it down too much. Skip the mayo and this could have potential and way more sour cream. It was also a little plain.

I've never felt the need to add the mayo to this recipe, and it's been my go to spinach artichoke dip for years. So easy and tasty. I have a lot of vegetarian friends, so I tend to leave out the bacon.

This recipe was pretty good.  I've had a similar one in the past with a bit of bit jalapenos in it for a bit of  kick.  I think I might throw those in next time along with adding another kind of cheese to beef up the flavor.  This recipe is almost better the next day, too!

This recipe was fast, easy, and an all around hit with the birthday crowd! People who said they didn't even like artichokes were eating the dip because they didn't know it was in the recipe.  I just said spinach dip!  I did not include bacon to cater to guest that don't eat pork. It was still great. Will surely be making this one again.

Just yummy! Added extra garlic and a dash of italian dressing (used artichoke hearts in water instead of marinated). Served it in a crockpot with blue corn tortilla chips and a sliced sourdough baguette.

this dip is so-ooooo good, everyone told me it is better than the restaurants recipes. i followed directions almost exactly, with the exception of adding in romano cheese with the parmesan, i added a pinch of red pepper flakes, used "real bacon bits" instead of making my own, and i used the crock pot instead of the oven, so it would be easier for our party and stay nice and warm also. i served it with tortilla chips. also it is easy enough to make a day ahead and keep in the fridge until ready to put into the crock pot and heat. i will make this again for sure!!!!!!

This recipe was quite tasty and perfect for a Saturday night but I give it four stars instead of five because it wasn't malleable after I baked it. Once it was put in the fridge it hardened up and for those of us who like to dip into the fridge for a quick bite, it didn't work so well. I did, however, add 2 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of mayo to loosen it up and it was quite good hot or cold this way! Thanks for the recipe:)

ABSOLUTELY UNBELEIVABLE!!!!!!!!  This was the hit of my X-mas party.  I should have put some to the side.  I tasted it before I put it on the buffet table and it blew me away.  I thought once I got all my guest settled I thought I would be able to grab some. Right.  No such luck.  It was gone in less than 45 minutes.  I actually made 3 times the amount of the recipe. My child who hates spinach or any food with the color green in it, has begged me to make more. This stuff is to die for. I promise.

I didn't have everything on hand or exactly what this recipe called for and since it was hours before the annual Halloween party I used what i had and it turned out divine! I used 2 8oz packages of quality bacon pieces already cooked & crumbled, fresh spinach, "thawed" frozen artichokes, 8oz chive cream cheese in place of garlic herb spread, 1/2 cup of sour cream(all I had), 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt, 3 mozzarella string cheese sticks(all I had)cut into small pieces, followed the ingredients directions & making directions above except cooking bacon I just had to bake for a little longer 28 minutes total it was a huge hit at the party served it with homemade peasant bread cut into bite sized pieces enjoy!

I've made this recipe a few times for friends, and there are never left overs. Everyone loves it, and I get begged to make it again anytime anyone has an excuse for an occasion. I love using the allouette garlic herb cheese, but I've also played around with a couple different cheeses, and for certain crowds add extra bacon. All-in-All I finally have a special recipe for my own.

Awesome Spinach Artichoke dip!  Just as good as anything I have ever had at a restaurant!  I skipped the bacon, and for the herb flavored cheese spread, I used the Savory Garlic Philadelphia cooking cream (half of the 10oz container).  I then shook in a little Italian Seasoning for the "herbs".  Turned out great!  I baked mine a little longer than 20 minutes just to ensure the Parmesan cheese melted.  I stirred the dip halfway through too.

So good! It was a great addition to our  Labor Day meal with the in-laws! My husband who's not a fan of artichokes or dips couldn't get enough!  I kept to the recipe but,  added mozzarella too! Mmmmm...gone!

This dip was very good. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is because it was almost to thick for me..but the flavor was wonderful. Next time I will add a little liquid to the mix and hopefully it will be closer to my personal liking :) I would defiantly recommend this dip and I can't wait to make it again!

Very good. Loved the little bits of bacon and the parmesan flavor. I found the cheese spread in the cheese section, not the cream cheese section where I originally thought it would be.

I have tried a few spin dip recipes in the past and they have turned out fine, but this one was amazing! I took it to a July 4th party and it was gone in 20 mins, even with 5 other app's on the table. I think it is the addition of the garlic and herb spread, which I have never seen in a recipe before. The only thing I did differently was using panchetta instead of bacon. Just cut it into small cubes and crisped in frying pan..

This is the most incredibly easy and tasty dish ever to take to a potluck or BBQ. there are so many ways to tweak and improve it. As if that was possible.

Very tasty. But VERY rich - too rich. There is a lot of flavor going on here, and I think the bacon and the garlic/herb cheese puts it over the top. I prefer a dip where the artichoke and spinach are the stars.

Great, So So Yummy!  Our grocery store doesnt carry the "garlic and herb" cream cheese variety so I used the onion and chive crcheese and added a clove of minced garlic.. It was a huge hit! Next time, I'm going to double the recipe! And maybe add some roasted red peppers!

Great recipe! I decided to use less mayo, less artichoke hearts, and added in creme cheese, and fresh chopped garlic. Amazing! Was the hit of the party.

Wonderful recipe. The only thing I recommend not doing, is putting bacon bits in it instead of the real stuff. I thought it would make this recipe just that much easier, however I think the extra effort is worth it in this scrumptious dip.

This was very easy to make and everyone loved it! The only thing I changed was I left out the mayonnaise because I'm just not a big fan, and it turned out awesome! I saw another person commented that for the cheese spread they used allouette brand, and I did the same. Once again, awesome!

YUM - this is super easy (draining the spinach is probably the hardest part) and always goes very quickly.  I usually skip the bacon as it made it too salty for me, but I've had it both ways.

Great recipe!  The only change I made was to use real bacon pieces by Hormel instead of regular bacon to save time.  I made it the night before and only had to microwave it the next day to serve.  Very tasty and will make again.

I tripled the recipe for a large engagement party. I generously added prepared garlic and served this with rice chips and pita chips in a silver chafing dish. Very  elegant presentation.  I recieved many compliments on this one.  The bacon offers a special twist.  The most time consuming part of the preparation was cooking the bacon which I did in the microwave on paper towels to insure crispness. A sure keeper and definate crowd pleaser!

YUM! This is such an easy and delicious recipe. Brought it to girls' night and it was gobbled up. Warmed in the microwave to combine ingredients and then baked a few minutes, but watch that it doesn't brown - not as flavorful. Served with bread and tortilla chips, think the chips were best.

This was fantastic.  I took it to our thanksgiving dinner this year.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it on the low setting of my crock pot instead of baking it.  Everyone raved over it and I will definatly be making it again.  Next time however, I will chop up the artichokes to smaller pieces.  Thanks for a great dip!

10 Stars from my family and I. This was so sinfully delicious. I did not have the garlic/herb cheese that this recipe called for....but I made my own using Herb and Garlic Cheese Spread recipe on this site. I also used all low fat ingredients, such as the cream cheese, mayo, and sour cream. The bacon really gives this dip a new twist. Served with multi-grain crackers and torilla chips. Will be making again for the next family gathering as it was already requested!

I have not made this dip myself, but my sister made it for Thanksgiving last year. And, it has to be one the best Spinach and Artichoke Dips I have had. It is wonderful as is, but I think a dash of chili powder might give it a kick

The only change that I have made is in the amount of garlic and herb spread. I typically add about 8 oz. Regardless, this dip is always gone before the end of the party and I always wish I had made more.

This got rave reviews from the people I served it too.  I've never had hot spinach and artichoke dip, and I didn't think this was that great.  The recipe was good, but I didn't think it was anything I would make again, but based upon their rave reviews of it, I gave it 5 stars.  If I reviewed it based on my opinion, I would probably give it a 4, though, because it was a good dip, just not something I'm interested in.  (Yes, I was asked to make this dip.  It wasn't something I chose to make.)  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I shared the recipe with my friends too who love it.

This was a huge hit and I have given the recxipe out several times.  It was very flavorful.  I used the garlic herb cream cheese and added 3 tablespoons of regular cream cheese to make it creamier.  I also used freshly grated parmesan cheese so it has more flavor and is not so salty. Enjoy!

this may be the best spinach artichoke dip I have made ... my only recommendation is to add the bacon to the top of the dip just before baking it, that way it won't get mushy in the dip ... this was a huge hit at Xmas this year.

Very thick, but delicious.  Not garlicky enough for my taste, but I'm sure the garlic is meant to be subtle.  Didn't see that it said to chop up the artichokes, but I did anyways- seemed to work out much better.  A big hit for Christmas.

I served this for Christmas lunch and everyone loved it. Plus, it's SO easy!! I omitted the bacon but it still turned out great. I served it with little sourdough bread slices (toasted). Will definitely make again.

Very tasty!  It was even better the next day.  Reheated well in the microwave and went very well with tortilla chips.  Yum!  Definately a keeper.  Thanks!

This dip was a HUGE hit at my Memorial Day BBQ.  I was looking for a different take on the usual spinach artichoke dip, thanks to you I found it! Highly recommend this one.

My husband is hard to please and hates spinach AND artichokes, BUT LOVED THIS DISH. It is served at a 5-star restaurant here in my home town and is just EXCELLENT!

So far I have made this three times and it always turns out delicious.  I skip the bacon though and add a few extra artichokes.

Had to make a few substitutions (i.e. cream cheese for the cheese spread), but it was really good.  Texture was a tiny bit weird.

I didn't know what garlic herb flavored cheese spread was, so I substituted chive & onion cream cheese.  It still came out great.  Will make again.

This is my go to Artichoke and Spinach Dip. Make sure the bacon is fried hard in the pan. Don’t try to cut corners and bake it (I did that once.) I also remove any part that is chewy. It doesn’t last long in my house, but after a few days, the bacon is not as crispy. I get compliments on this Dip every time I take it to events. People comment on the bacon, so don’t skip on the bacon. I’ve tried several other versions, but this is the final winner!

I made this for the Superbowl last night and my 11 year old daughter and my Mum LOVED it as did I....3 generations : )  I did replace the sour cream with greek yogurt and omitted the bacon and it was still delicious and super easy.  Thanks for sharing.

The only change I make is more bacon.  Everyone loves it.

My family really liked this recipe, but thought the artichokes should be cut up a little more.  Next time I make this, I think I’ll cut the artichoke quarters a little smaller.  Great taste though!!!

This was perfect as a base for a smoked halibut dip.  I followed the recipe as is and added smoked fresh caught halibut before the baking time.  It was wonderful!!!  When I make it again I will add some fresh roasted diced green chilies, because we love our Colorado Pueblo chilies!

Best artichoke dip ever; the ingredients were perfect for a hearty, tasty hot dip.  Guests all loved it.  Comments by the men  included "the bacon makes it and it's not greasy, no oily residue, right amount of artichokes," and on and on.  Will make again.  Served with pita chips and regular tortilla chips, and of course, beer, wine and Margaritas.

Easy.  Tasty.  Used Boursin for the garlic herbed cheese.  Bacon added a nice touch.  Devoured by guests. Will make again.  I may add some cayenne for a little kick.

I just made this for my families Christmas party and everyone loved it. I didn't use the bacon and used my small crockpot. It was quick, easy and tasted great.

I made this for family Christmas and served it with a variety of chips. I didn’t intent to make changes, but I didn’t know what the cheese spread called for was, so I used a tub of garlic and chives cream cheese, which was 7.5 oz., so I decreased the mayo to 1/4 cup to help make up the difference. It was quite tasty, and even better with sliced French bread that was on the table versus the chips I brought. Later, I ate some cold with chips and I actually liked this better cold.

This is delicious and easy to make.  It was wonderful served with pita chips, baby carrots and zuch slices.  It will now be my go to spinach dip.  Everyone loved it.

Awesome Dip! Followed it step by step, and it came out PERFECT! Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe!!

Update: Made it again, used 1 lb of crispy fried bacon & upped it to 3/4 cup mayo. Came out creamier and tons of bacon flavor. Making it again this weekend for the Superbowl- we'll see how the new crowd likes it :)

Great recipe. Always gobbled up when I bring to parties. I just put everything in a small crock pot and heat on low till warm. Only thing to take notice of is recipe states 48 serving. Maybe if one bite is considered a serving. I took this to a party of 12 and it was perfect amount.

It was great!  I made some changes.  I substituted onion/chives cream cheese in place of the cheese spread.  I substituted plain yogurt instead of the mayo.  I substituted three cheese blend in place of the parmesan cheese.  I added tsp of garlic powder and sprinkled shredded cheese over the top.  I served it with tortilla chips.  I was a grand slam!!!

Made it for a Leap Day Beer tasting, and it was demolished by pleased guests. Doubling the recipe should be considered a must, that's how good this is! (extra bacon always helps too) I made it without Mayo, and did a blend of Parm and Ricotta cheeses.  I am now required to bring it to all subsequent parties. Thanks for the great dish!!

I have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. I make it without changes. I bake it in a pie dish for easy dipping. It heats up great, but there are rarely leftovers to heat.

I was out of bacon, but I can tell you there were rave reviews at the pot luck at work I took it to. I made a double batch and it was gone before the second lunch crew got there.

I added extra bacon and used a small bag of mozzarella cheese and took the advice of others and used chive &onion cream cheese. I also add a few laughing cow garlic and herb wedges I had in the fridge. I baked it in an 8x8 baking dish and it was to die for!!

I made this for "girls' night in" and it wasn't a huge hit (and yes, I followed the recipe exactly). Some of the ladies thought the bacon was unnecessary, and while others said it was "good," but I was left with plenty of leftovers, and probably won't make it again. I made this because it received rave reviews six years ago (or more!) but perhaps in this day and age, when bacon is thrown into everything, it isn't such a novelty anymore. In the end, I wish I had just picked up a pre-made spinach and artichoke dip, and saved myself the hassle.

This dip was very good.  I used shredded parmesan cheese in place of the grated (didn't have grated and didn't have the time to grate fresh, so I used what I had on hand) it didn't seem to make any difference that I could tell.  My husband also liked it very much and he is not a dip person.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent!  I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving, followed the exact recipe and my in-laws and husband raved about it.  The only drawback:  I didn't calculate the expense, but looking back at it, realize it's a pricey dish to make with the herb cheese, artichokes, which are items I wouldn't have readily on hand.  I made it again just for my husband as something to eat with his tortilla chips while watching golf!  Reheats easily.

This was a very good dip, The only change I would make is to replace the garlic salt with powder and not add any salt at all! My guest really enjoyed it, however it was quite salty

The bacon and garli-herb cheese spread made this recipe a hit.  Made it for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it.  Will continue to make.

I want to make this for NYE and I am going to double the recipe to be sure to have enough and for left overs.  I saw that some used a crock pot....how long and on what setting did you have it in the crock pot?

I made this for my office Christmas lunch and for Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone LOVED it and it is so easy to make. I made it just as the recipe says to. I didn't need to change a thing. You must give this a try.

This is the first time that I make Spinach and Artichoke dip and it was amazing..I did add garlic powder and cajun seasoning to it though (Slap Ya mama)..Next time I might add some Monterey Jack Cheese to it though.  Excellent dip!

This recipe was great! My store was out of Herb cracker spread so I used one with Pepperjack and Jalapeno. This gave it a nice kick if you like to spice things up. I did add a little more bacon also.

I made this for a group of my boyfriend's friend who I badly wanted to impress and it didn't disappoint. Everything baked together really nicely and it smelled terrific. I definitely plan on making it again, but next time I would follow the advice of some other reviewers and chop the artichokes so they're a little less overwhelming. More bacon wouldn't hurt, according to my diners.

LOVE this recipe. The bacon gives it some extra kick and the flavored cream cheese is awesome!! I make it in a small, dip sized slow cooker and it works great for parties. I get asked for the recipe again and again!! Thanks!

Fresh spinach + Less Cream + cheeses works pretty good too.  (make sure the cream mizture covers all the leaves or you will have brown/burnt spinach... (still tastes okay- just not plesant) The herb spread comes in 'lite' so I use that + more veggies (I am trying fresh garlic + herbs I have in the fridge.)  Fills you up after one spoonful on your roll.  GREAT for hungry Men- LOL

I reduced the calories using light sour cream and reducing the amount of bacon in half. I don't think it had any real affect on the recipe. Helped it become a little more guilt-free! I plan to use this recipe everytime I want to make spinach and artichoke dip.

This is really good. Closest yet to our favorite restraunt version but it has to be hot. If this gets to even warm it's not nearly as good and it's too thick to dip. UPDATE: We made this again and I didn't measure as accurately, just went by eye and it was so much better. Not as thick but just as delicious.

I love this recipe. The garlic and herb cheese spread really makes it yummy. I cut the artichoke hearts more into bite sizes. My whole family loves this recipe.
I put extra parmesean cheese on top!

Yum!  I tried a few new appetizers for a recent party that I had at my house.  This one was a favorite.  Easy to make and I actually combined all the ingredients in the same pyrex dish that I baked it in!

I recently made this dip for a "girls only" ski weekend. It was a huge hit. I omitted the mayo, doubled the garlic and herb cheese spread and substituted Asiago for the Parmesan cheese. We had it with Melba toast rounds. Ammmmazing!

Very good dip! The bacon gives it a nice twist. To save time (and mess), I purchase pre-cooked bacon. It also takes great with turkey bacon

Our group of 7 found this to be WAY too salty!!. Did I use the wrong parmesan cheese? I used Kraft grated(in the green can). Would shredded be better-not as salty? I did not have the garlic cheese spread, so I used cream cheese with garlic powder added. Maybe that was the problem?? Since so many people love this dip, I figured I did something wrong. I will try it again but with different cheeses. Plus it took me a LOT LONGER that 10 minutes to make it--just cooking the bacon takes longer than that.

This is, hands down, the BEST spinach dip I have ever made or tasted. Brought it to a Christmas get-together and everyone raved about it. I used an 8oz. container of chive-n-onion cream cheese in place of the garlic-herb cheese spreak... excellent!

Came out really well! Since the recipe made so much, I split it in half and froze half of it for a later date. I did add more spinach for texture. The mayo and the sour cream could be reduced slighty (if you prefer sour cream, then just add less mayo and visa vera!) Came out so good!

Great!  Loved it!  I added more artichokes, my husband said the more the better!  Will be making again!

This was not a big hit at a get together we had last night. I thought it tasted better cold than it did hot!

This recipe is awesome!  I really don't like artichokes, but thought I would try this for a party.  The bacon adds a great kick to the dip.  I used Boursin brand garlic-herb cheese spread and it turned out great.  It comes in 5.2 oz packages, so I think this is what the author of the recipe meant for use.   Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious.  There wasn't a bite left Christmas Eve.  Will definitely make this again.  Couldn't find the marinated artichokes so I used the plain ones.  Still very flavorful.

This is a WONDERFUL dip for crackers, bread chunks, etc.  Everyone loved it - even those who don't like spinach. Thank you for the recipe.

SO GOOD!!! and so easy!!!  kudos to the bacon bits/pieces suggestion -- much easier than dealing with real bacon. I made this at a recent party and everyone raved over it!  (Just have some dental floss handy in the guest bathroom to deal with the spinach! :) )

The first time I made it I took it to our family christmas party and everyone loved it. I served it with little sour dough sandwich slices which worked really well, tortilla chips would be good also. I think this is a good recipe for stuffing mushrooms I may try that next! This website has been a  blessing for last minute ideas on potluck ideas!
