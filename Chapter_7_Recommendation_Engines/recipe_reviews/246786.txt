I had 4 boneless NY strips. So I doubled the seasoning. I reduced the chimichurri by half & it was still enough for 4 steaks! It was delish, I enjoyed it.  I also cooked shrimp sprinkled it with lemon pepper & cayenne and cooked it with the fond from the steak. My man loved it. Will make again!

The cooking time was way off.  I cut my roasting time back to 8 minutes and it still came out medium well.  The sauce was fantastic though.

I had Tbones so I rubbed them with the spices and grilled them. The chimichurri sauce was über strong. I tripled the recipe but only doubled the garlic and vinegar. It was delicious but if I would have made as posted it'd be way too much. I froze the rest of the sauce to use again.

Steak came out wonderful! (I skipped making the sauce and added garlic to the steak) Will make again and again! Thank you.

So I think the red wine vinegar was way too much. I didn't buy the right kind of steak I guess so mine was over cooked and I like mines medium rare. I like the foil idea, I'm doing that again but just lest seasoning.
