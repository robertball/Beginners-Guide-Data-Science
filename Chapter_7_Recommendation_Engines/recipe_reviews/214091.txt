To me the density and consistency of this flan was perfect.  I've since modified it to use only 2/3c. sugar for the caramel since not all the caramel liquified in baking using the full cup.  I also use whole evaporated milk and leave out the cornstarch.  If I'm choosing not to use the orange juice, I sub in milk.  This has become my husband's most requested dessert.  Thanks!!

Several folks have had trouble getting all the sugar to caramelize - an easy fix is to use Baker's Sugar... it's a superfine granulated sugar (not powdered sugar) that is made for just such an application.  C&H makes it; I don't know if it's available all over the country, but look for it in the sugar section of the supermarket.

I made this today and it turned out perfectly! Instead of one flan pan I used a decorative muffin pan that has six muffins and this made individual flans. (I had a bit leftover and out it in a small pie pan.) I omitted the orange juice and orange peel (don't care for orange flavor) and also omitted the whole milk and instead used 1 whole can of evaporated milk. Everything else I followed exactly as the recipe stated and the taste is amazing! It was a huge hit for my family, also. My husband said it is better than the flan in the local Mexican restaurant. Thanks!

I swapped a few things, but will stick to my new recipe from now on: subbed whole milk for evaporated milk and reduced it to 3/4 C, then omitted all orange stuff, and added 1/2 C coconut milk. Also toasted my own coconut and put it on the syrup before putting flan in dish. Followed same blending instructions, and it is SOO creamy and delicious with a touch of coconut flavor.

This was my first attempt at Flan, it was also my first time eating flan. Whenever I have seen it at a restaurant I was never tempted to try it. But the other day my son was asking about flan and if it  was good or not so I figured the best way to find out was to make it. I had to make this 2x. The first time I tried to make these in mini spring-form pans. Really bad idea they leaked all into the water bath and just made a big yucky mess. So I tried it again the next day. I used 6 6oz ramekins and baked for 40 minutes. This was fun to make. And surprisingly easy. I expected it to be more complicated. The texture was silky and smooth. Lovely flavor with just a hint of orange to it. Really fantastic and now I know that Flan is fabulous. Thanks for the recipe!

I had tried the Spanish Flan on this site, and while I thought that was lovely, it was NOTHING compared to the texture of this one! I omitted the orange stuff and left it traditional vanilla way. Instead of the whole milk, cornstarch, and heavy cream, I just used a can of evaporated milk. Obviously, it is the 3 eggs and two egg yolks that makes this one have a divine texture! I definitely recommend it, even the simple way with just a can of evaporated milk, one can of condensed milk, vanilla, and the eggs blended and cooked just as directed here! Excellent! This is my flan recipe from now on.

This was a phenomenal recipe!  It was easy to fix and it came out looking picture perfect.  It is important to allow the time (4 hours) for it to sit, though.  My husband wasn't sure he liked the orange flavor, but I loved it and all the people at the dinner we served it at raved about it...they are still raving!

For those having trouble with the sugar/carmel, What you can do instead is use the pan that your going to pour the mixture in make your carmel in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes.  This works great and it's easy.  No stirring just when it starts to liquify get on the oven gloves and roll it around and it works amazing.  It's ready to go as soon as it cools in your flan or baking dish.

Wow!  Thanks Tigerlily402!  This was delicious!  The orange flavor was pretty distinct and we enjoyed it.  But next time, we might just try it plain.  I followed the recipe as best I could: I did not have a flan mold, so I used a deep-dish pie pan.  And I didn't have a roasting pan, so I improvised with a deep skillet.  Not ideal, but it worked!  Mmm...

Neither I nor my family has ever tried this type of flan before, and although we finished it off, we've decided we don't like it because it was too rich, too sweet, and too custardy for our tastes. However, to be fair, I gave it 5 stars because the recipe and instructions were step-by-step, and because the texture, the appearance and the orange flavor turned out the way it was supposed to (according to the description and other reviews).  A word of caution: this is not the recipe to try in a removeable-bottom flan pan, since the water from the water-bath seeped into the removable bottom of the pan, creating a bit of a mess with the caramel-sugar layer. (Of course, I should've realized this beforehand. Duuuh!)  All-in-all, though, this was a nice recipe, and at least we can say we tried it! Thanks!

I was a little intimidated when making this recipe because I LOVE flan and I really wanted it to turn out. I made this for my girlfriends and they loved it! They couldn't believe that I made this myself. You will not be disappointed. This is a keeper.

A dependable, easy recipe that yields an exotic dessert. I've made this flan five times in the last two weeks, because friends have tasted it and requested that I make one for their cake sale or Mexican-themed dinner party.   My recipe tweaks: - Whisk the eggs and egg yolks together before adding, or the gelatinous whites will separate from the pudding mixture. - A Tablespoon of grated orange rind is way too much! I've taken it down to about 3/4 teaspoon and acheived the fragrance without an overwhelming orange flavor. - You really do have to refridgerate it for four hours, or the flan will not turn out of the pan easily and neatly.  Of course, eating my mistakes is what keeps me such a fat and happy cook!

This was an amazing recipe without any alteration: I will definitely be making this recipe many times. My wife, our friends and I all loved it. I used several smaller custard dishes rather than a large flan dish and it turned out great. After you've got the dishes prepared, put a kitchen towel in a baking dish, put the smaller custard dishes on the towel, and fill the baking dish with water until it is about half way up the side of the custard dishes.

This is a very nice recipe. Made it exactly as written and it came together perfectly. The next time I make this flan I will us about 1/4c less sugar in the caramel sauce because as another poster experienced too, not all the sugar liquefied during the bake. I don't know how big a flan pan is, and I didn't think all of the mixture would go into any of my pie pans, so I used one of my 9" cake pans. Seems to work out pretty good too.

This recipe is amazing. I made it for a party, and I was asked by no less than 5 people for the recipe! The texture I thought was outstanding, and the flavor, while sweet, is great in small portions. My only criticism is that the custard did not set with 1 hour of cooktime on 350F; I found that increasing the temp to 375F or increasing the time to 75-80 minutes worked for me. Might be just my stove, but I've seen similar notes on other reviews.

I liked the orange flavor and will use it in a recipe that I have used for years with more success.  I have never seen cornstarch in any other flan recipe.  Mine came out more like plain egg custard (admittedly it had a lovely orange flavor).  Also, my recipe calls for a little water in the sugar to make the caramel.  My sugar was nearly burned before it was fully disolved.

You're having trouble with carnelizing because the sugar from mexico is not refined white sugar its a brownish sugar (not brown sugar) just brownish (azucar moreno) this sugar melts and caramelizes quite easily. Some supermarkets in the US are selling this type of sugar now.

My husband is from Nicaragua and his dad makes this awesome flan and I used this recipe and my husband loved it!  I dont think I am going to put the orange juice in next time as the orange was overkill and why we didnt give it 5 stars, and this makes 2 flans not just one if you use the Pampered Chef Flan pan, but I will definitely make this again!!!

I am a Mexican and this is very very close to be OUR recipe.

Evaporated milk instead of normal milk, 6 eggs (no need to separate the yolks) and no cornstarch... the orange is even optional for us too.

I hope you all enjoy.

I almost rated this with one star.  I wanted to try this flan because of the orange juice added on and because it didnt need cream cheese which is part of the recipe my puertorican family uses. The only change I made on this recipe was adding coconut flakes. My husband could not wait to try it so we tried one of the two flans only after leaving it in the fridge for one hour. Not a good idea. I left the second one in there for two days and what a difference. The reason why I didnt like the first one was because of the strong orange flavor; the mixture of flavors did not sit well with me, although my husband loved it. The second one had a much better texture and the orange flavor was more subtle which for me made it very good. I didnt find it to be too sweet and could not taste egg at all. I would definitively make this again.

My son made this for his Spanish class - what a hit!  We used a star-shaped jello mould, and I was worried that the sugar was going to stick but it didn't.  The flan came out looking fantastic & we can't wait to make it again.  Very easy with a beautiful presentation.

Great reseta.  I made this three days ago and it tastes just like my mothers flan (and maybe a little healthier).  I did add about 1/3 of an 8 oz bar of cream cheese and it tasted amazing.  Highly recommend this recipe and I will definitely keep it in my normal cooking rotation  : )

This was too eggy for me. It was like eating sweetened quiche. And how do you melt sugar without it getting higher than 240 degrees (at which point it will be crunchy when it cools)? I would add 2/3 c. water to the sugar to make a syrup, then heat it to light amber color. I tried heating just the sugar, since the reviews were all saying it works perfectly, and I had little sugar rocks at the bottom of my custard dishes. Had to clean them out and start over. Ended up using my tried and true caramel sauce recipe of sugar, corn syrup, butter, and heavy cream. Or you could just heat sweetened condensed milk until it browns into caramel sauce. Anything is better than hard candy on flan :/ And I would maybe try it with two egg yolks, or even only one. Not sure what else you would have to adjust to keep the consistency right (because the consistency was great) but you can just taste the egg too strongly. Oh and I left out the orange zest

Soooo good! We just ran out of it yesterday and everyone is already wanting more. My first time making flan. The strong orange flavor was not expected, but it was really delicious. The texture was out of this world. Also, don't have a flan pan so used 13 x 9 x 2 glass pan. Didn't have a double boiler set up for this so I took a chance and placed a dish towel on a cookie sheet and placed the dish of flan on top. I stuck it in the oven and then ladled water onto the cookie sheet/towel until the towel was soaked good n water was ready to overlfow cookie sheet. Sounds a little strange, but it did the job and worked well. Please b sure to soak the towel really well and check often.

Made it without adding any orange juice or orange peel and it came out perfect. Everyone loved it, it had plenty of caramel to go over top and was a smash hit.  Highly recommended you try this, it is easy and delicious!!

This was AMAZING. I didn't have an orange, so I subbed 1tsp orange extract, but didn't change anything else. Everyone at our big family dinner kept exclaiming over how it was the best flan they'd ever had; better than any restaurant's. Thank you for sharing!!  Oh, also, it was perfectly done at 45 min on 350 - wiggly and not "set." cooled for less than an hour on the counter (to room temp), then in the fridge for 4 hours.

We enjoyed this today for Cinco de Mayo!  I chose to leave out the orange juice and orange zest and make it plain this time.  It was very good and the next time I may add the orange additions and use a bit of whipped cream and chocolate sauce like the restaurants do.  This was my first time making one of my favorite desserts!  A word of warning...use a wooden spoon to stir the melted sugar.  I didn't think it through and used one of my favorite hard plastic cooking spoons and melted 1/2 of it in the process.  I had to remake the caramel sauce before finishing the recipe!  Lesson learned.  :)

This was my first time making flan, and I have to say, I was pleased with the results. I also omitted the orange juice and peel.  A word of caution-please be careful melting the sugar.  I have second degree burns on my hand from some falling off my spoon as I poured it into my pan.  I also used a pie pan and it worked very well.  It was good the first night, and even better the next day!  I will most certainly make this again, giving much respect to the "edible napalm" during the sugar cooking process. Lesson learned!

Delicious! Took someone's advice and sub'ed a can of evap. milk for the orange juice and orange peel and it works great! I used to never like flan but this recipe has most definitely changed my mind.

Made this for a mexican themed grad party.  A big hit.  Didn't change a thing.  Pie plates work well instead of a flan pan.

This is the first recipe I have ever rated but i had to come on here and say just how amazing this recipe is.  This resulted in the best flan I have ever tasted (and that is saying a lot).  I didn't use orange flavoring at all so it was just vanilla flavored.  It came out so creamy and perfectly textured.  Will definitely be making again....a LOT!

I have never made flan and I have never really liked it but since it was Cinco De Mayo I decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly although I don't usually like to add whole milk or heavy cream to anything I cook.  It was delicious. I guess I had gotten used to crummy restaurant flan where they use gelatin.  This was much more like Creme Brulee...which I love. Now that I know what it should taste like, I may try adapting it to make it lighter (i.e. using fat free condensed milk and/or fat free sweetened condensed milk).

This flan was delicious but it did not set up. I might not have baked it  long enough or perhaps it was because I overlooked the step of adding the heavy cream to the mixture and just pulsing. I added all to the blender at once,I also used a bundt cake pan to bake this. I don't know if any of these steps I took made a difference but the taste is amazing. My texture was ore custard that flan. (baked in bain marie)

We love Flan and no more box mixes for this family:) Made it without orange juice (used 1/4 milk in its place)and no zest since we like vanilla. Used one reviewers suggestion to caramelize sugar by placing the flan pan with sugar in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes. Using regular white sugar, I added enough to cover the bottom of the pan, about 2/3 cup. It worked wonderfully! Thank you for sharing an authentic recipe!

this recipe is awesome! i just baked it last night and i can't seem to stop getting more slices! I'm going to experiment with it next time though.. gonna try the evaporated milk substitution for the heavy cream to see if it will make the flan more settled and put less vanilla extract on it. other than that, im gonna keep on making this delectable recipe again and again!

I've never had flan before and decided to try something new and it tasted great! To make this slightly healthy, I used 1% milk and fat free condensed milk instead of the full fat versions and the consistency was similar to cheesecake. I will definitely make this again but I would use less sugar in making the syrup as I think 1 cup make too much

This is the first time I made flan, and it came out wonderful! I omitted the orange juice and subbed milk instead. I made do with a 9in cake pan and a stainless steel skillet for cooking. Hint for next time- dont overcook the sugar :)  Will absolutely be making this again and again!

The flan was phenomenal but most of the carmelized sugar stayed in the ramekins, close to rock hard.  Kind of a waste??

I have made this flan several times. I omit the orange juice because I prefer a vanilla flan without a citrus flavor. However, no matter how many times I make this recipe, my caramel ends up more like candy glass than caramel. I have tried tips offered by other reviewers and have even watched YouTube videos that demonstrate how to do this, and I've used thermometers , to no avail. I am starting to think my stove is bewitched! My kids don't mind, though. They lift the "glass" off their flan and eat it like a hard candy. I'm giving this five stars because it is easy to make and it's rich, creamy, and decadent, like I expect flan to taste.

This was really tasty and easy. The orange flavor was lovely. When I cooked this, I must've overdone the caramel sauce, as the layer on the very bottom of the pan hardened (and then cracked when I poured in the custard filling!). But there was still sauce left, and it was very good. When taking out of the dish it seemed "chunky" and had cracked in one place, but was silky smooth once you ate it. I sliced into squares with thread to make serving easy at a potluck. I did this in a glass deep dish pie and had a bit left over - enough for two small ramekins worth; the ramekins overcooked and puffed up (then dropped) like a souffle... which still tasted good, but had a weird texture!

VERY good. Not exactly the same texture as traditional flan due to the addition of pumpkin.  It's to be expected.

I've made this at least a dozen times now, and regularly get requests to bring it for get-togethers.  This is by far the best best best flan recipe I have ever tried!  It's better than my Puerto Rican mother-in-law's sssssshhhhhh.  Depending on the pan, I've had to adjust the cook time between 45 minutes to an hour and fifteen minutes.  Amazon flanera pans work marvelously for this one.  Remember to always rely on the toothpick test; If the toothpick comes out wet from the center, just pop it back in the oven for another 15 minutes and check again...Although one episode of (undercooked) flan pudding went over incredibly well too.  You cannot go wrong with this one!

Great recipe. I agree with others that a bit of water in the sugar helps it melt easier. The second time I made it I substituted lemon juice and grated lemon peel. Liked the lemon version better.

This is almost the exact recipe that I've had from years ago in my favorite Mexican cookbook. I love the fact that it uses cream and condensed milk---it's really rich. Next to my recipe, it's one of THE best flans I've ever eaten. REALLY rich!!!

Made this for New Years Eve.  It was delish and so easy to make. It's just as good as any Flan I've had in a restaurant.  I made it without the orange juice or orange peel, used 2% milk and used 3/4 cup of sugar-which was more than enough.  Family recipes are the best!  Thanks so much for sharing this one.

I thought this recipe was outstanding and so did everyone at the party.  The next time I will make it without the orange juice and orange peel. Just use this recipe but do vanilla or coconut.  The texture came out perfect. This was my first time ever making a Flan and I thought it was very simple. I was pleasantly surprised.

This is the easiest and most elegant recipe ever! I have become somewhat of an expert on this recipe, as this is the only desert my husband ever requests. He would eat it every day if I would make it that often.   Although the recipe as written is perfect,  I have tried a few things to make it easier and to add variety. 
TIPS:   1. If you use Turbinado Sugar, available at Walmart, you will not have any problems with your caramel sauce. This is the kind of sugar they use in Mexico, and it has a much better caramel flavor and melts easily.  It will be ready almost as soon as it is melted. (Don't cook it for 10 minutes!)  2. You will get a better orange flavor if you use Valencia orange juice/peel.   3. Try new flavors, such as almond flavoring and toasted almond slices, coconut flavoring and toasted coconut flakes (NOT the shredded/sweetened stuff), etc. in place of the orange. Everything I have tried so far has been wonderful. 4. Use 6 whole eggs for simplicity, and if you make sure to put them in the blender and whip them before you add the other ingredients, you will not have to worry about pieces of egg and your flan will turn out light and fluffy. 
 5. Use one can of evaporated milk in place of the milk & cream and omit the corn starch. This makes it easy to keep the ingredients on hand and not have to worry about buying cream. 6. Again for ease, I cook it in a 9x12 glass dish that has a lid and leave it in the dish for storage and I just flip each piece individually as I

I made this for my husband's birthday. I normally do not like flan. This was the best!  I used baker's sugar,  omitted the orange since he doesn't care for that, and just used evaporated milk instead of cream and milk. I did not add corn starch. Delicious!

The orange enhancements and smooth texture made this flan better than any other ones I've had over the years. While following the recipe with near perfect results, next time I plan to make three tweaks: (i) use superfine caster baking sugar and add 2 tablespoons water when making the caramel, (ii) minimize agitating the custard batter to lessen air bubbles and strain through a sieve to remove any egg chalazae or air bubbles should they exist, and (iii) use a hot tap water bath (not boiling water bath). As other reviewers have commented, the most challenging step is making the caramel as it can quickly burn, or seize if over stirred. An alternative technique is to place a lid on the sugar mixture pot for the first minute, then remove the lid (do not stir).  For the next 5-8 minutes, continue cooking the sugar mixture by swirling the pot very gently every 30 seconds, until the mixture is a golden amber color. Make this at least one day ahead, and the orange flavor continues to blossom through day 2 (if it lasts that long). Amy's mother-in-law's recipe rocks, and  Amy adding orange zest makes for a gourmet dessert.

Excellent Recipe. I omitted the orange juice and peel, substituted whole milk with evaporated milk, and added half a can of coconut milk. With all the ingredients, I also added about 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream. This is an excellent recipe! Always my go-to for dessert/potluck! Quick, easy, and delicious!

Thanks to those who suggested melting the sugar in the oven. In a ceramic souffle dish measuring about 7" at the bottom I melted 3/4 cup C&H Mexican sugar (azucar de caña, which has pale blonde large crystals) at 360 degrees (yes, 360) until liquified, about 40 minutes. I wanted a lighter flan, so I used a full 12-oz. can of 2% evaporated milk instead of whole milk, fat-free condensed milk, and, instead of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of half & half. I did use the cornstarch, and I cut back the orange zest to 2 tsp. Baking time was about 45 minutes with refrigeration overnight. The resulting flan was silky, decadent and got rave reviews. I would definitely make it again.

Wow. This recipe is the BEST! I used light cream instead of heavy cream; and it still came out perfect. I loved the orange zest. I do not own a special pan to make flan. I used a metal pie pan. Some of the sugar topping stuck to the pan, but overall it was beautiful as well as tasty.

After a recent trip to California, I came home slightly flan and horchata addicted. My kitchen became the testing grounds for the best recipes to curb the urge, and this flan recipe....boy did it hit the spot.  I have made it both with and without the zest, and this addict (and her loyal crew) all preferred it without.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!  Changes were evaporated milk instead of whole milk, omitted orange products & substituted 1/4 c of Bailey's coffee creamer, omitted cornstarch and added 1/4 tsp of coconut flavoring.  Used a deep cake pan and it worked fine.  This is a versatile recipe--I didn't have the orange products on hand, so I improvised.  Family loved it.  Will try it at some point with the orange.

This was outstanding! I used all the ingredients but omitted the orange juice, orange peel and cornstarch. I used evaporated milk in place of the orange juice and I put the pie plate(didn't have flan mold) in the roasting pan without the damp towel. My mom and brother are big fans of flan and said that this was the best they ever had. Thanks for posting!

I have made this flan several times and everybody loves it.  The first time I made it I went straight by the recipe.  I now leave out the corn starch and orange juice.  I substitute the orange juice liquid for whole milk.  Instead of vanilla extract, I have used real vanilla bean.  I scrap the pods and steep in some of the whole milk then let the milk cool. This adds a very complex layer of flavor.  

This flan will be served after Christmas dinner instead the usual favorites.

I took this to a dinner party this evening. RAVE reviews. I made it according to directions except I substituted evaporated milk for the whole milk, orange juice and cornstarch. I was in the mood for plain old flan. But, next time I'm trying the recipe as written. Well done, Tigerlily (Note: does anyone know why there were darker *solid* pieces of the caramel sauce when I turned over the flan? Didn't hurt the flan - just didn't look perfect.) UPDATE: 9/29/12. Made it again - this time with the orange juice & peel. It was fabulous - the orange flavoring was more of a hint, not overpowering. All the dinner guests loved it. The caramel sauce was perfect this time.

Made this for a party of 8.  Several (who know their flan) raved "best ever."  I omitted the orange juice and zest, substituting more milk to maintain the proportions.  Cooked 40 minutes in individual glass ramekins.  Perfect consistency.  Really a fabulous dessert.  Might try the orange next time.

My husband has been wanting to try flan from different places to see which one he liked best.  I made this one from Mexico.  A Spanish flan and a Cuban flan.  I didn’t make any adjustments to any of them.   This recipe was the lightest with the hint of citrus.   It was also the sweetest of the three.  All three were taste tested by my husband, me, and my in-laws.  This one was the least favorite.  But that was due to the sweetness.  None of us like super sweet foods.

A few tips for those new to flan and custurd.

Carmalized sugar is suppose to harden quickly as it cools, so you must pour it into the flan dish as soon as the desired color is reached. It needs to be light brown to amber in color, then immediately removed from the heat because it can quickly go from amber to burnt (30sec-1min). Don't even try to use the carmel if it looks black because it will be bitter and ruin your dessert. The caramelized sugar liquifies again once left for a long period of time in the fridge. If you find that there is "leftover" or wasted sugar in the flan dish, it is because you choose to eat the flan sooner rather then later. If you leave the flan in the fridge for 24-48 hours, all the caramelized sugar will liquify and there will be none wasted. To clean up caramelized sugar or black burnt sugar in your pans fill pan with water to cover all the burnt sugar and boil until sugar dissolves! 

If your flan has bubbles, hardened egg pieces, or fluffy in texture like scrambled eggs, I hate to tell you this but you OVERCOOKED your flan. It should be silky smooth like a creme brulee, but usually slightly firmer. The flan got too hot. Either it cooked too long in the oven or the bain Marie (water bath) was too shallow and the custard got too hot while baking. Custard must be cooked very slowly with even heat. A water bath is the best way to accomplish this. Someone mentioned making this without a water bath, which I highly doubt can be accomplished, unless the

I followed this recipe exactly, using freshly squeezed orange juice that I squeezed myself. The flan itself had wonderful flavors and an oh so creamy consistency but I would have loved it if the orange notes were a little more prominent. Maybe my oranges weren't sweet enough? Will have to try again! I wonder what the flan would taste like with store bought OJ such as Tropicana?

This is fantastic!  I did not have orange juice so I just used vanilla as the author indicated was the original recipe.  Yum!  I'm not sure it can get any better but next time, I will make sure to plan ahead and use the orange juice to see how it adds to the flavor.  The texture is great and it slices so nicely. I used a Bundt pan since that was all I had. The only problem I had was getting the caramel out of the bottom of the pan once I flipped it over.  Though some liquified and covered the top of the Flan, some stayed as a hard candy inside the pan.  Had to set the bottom of pan in boiling water to melt the caramel in order to get it out.  I'm not sure what I did wrong there but regardless, the Flan is superb!!

Skipped the blender and used stick blender.  Used hottest tap water, not boiling.   Used 8 individual ramekins.  This is a fabulous recipe!

I'm not a particular fan of Flan, but decided it would be a perfect desert for a brunch we were having.  I tried another Flan recipe and it was okay, nothing special.  Then I came across this one and made a "trial" one.  My husband and I loved it so we made it for our brunch.  I also don't like to cook, especially complicated dishes.  Not only was it easy to make, everyone at our brunch loved it and wanted the recipe.  Friends who don't like flan loved it!  I even made another one mid week for a couple of friends and once again it didn't disappoint.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe, but my husband (whose the cook of the family) and I both decided that any more orange juice or peel would've been overkill.  This is a recipe will be my go-to for years to come, and will be passed down for generations!!

Delicious! Almond milk substituted for the milk no problem. 
Only problem was that quite a bit of the caramel stuck to the glass pan so will need to troubleshoot that one next time.

Delicious! I made this flan for my son's school dinner function and it received excellent reviews! I followed the recipe almost verbatim -- I did not include the orange zest and I used two 8-inch cake pans to make two flans. I juiced a freshly picked orange from our tree, and used 1/4 cup as the recipe indicated. The orange flavor was perceptible, but did not overwhelm the custard. I will definitely make this again for future parties as it's very easy to make, it's delicious, and it presents very well!

It took me two tries to make this recipe work. The second time it was perfect! the consistency was perfect, and the vanilla flavor was glorious. Subbing milk for the orange juice, and eliminating the zest worked to make it a vanilla flan. 
Please learn from my noob mistakes. 1) I assumed this would make 12 cupcake-sized ramekins. It really makes about twice that size. The result of my error was way too much sugar in the bottom, but that wasn't the end of the world. They were yummy hard candies that mostly stuck to the bottom. 2) I ruined a flour sack towel and messed up the water bath. Don't make my mistake. Don't drape the towel over the sides. If you do, it will draw out the water and the custard will bake unevenly. it might also upset your rammikins. In fact, make sure the towel is completely submerged in the water.

I have made this dish four times. It has such great flavor and everyone loves it. When you go to most food gatherings you will usually see cake, pies and cookies. This dish really stands out and always has great reviews.
It is my “go to” when I want to make a hit.

I made this today for my custard-loving friend suffering from dental pain. She declared it the best flan ever. I omitted the orange because she's not adventurous. The texture was creamy and silky, luxurious.

I don't know what went wrong, but this turned out badly.  Maybe the three stars are for me.  I followed the directions, but made a few changes based on other reviews, plus one of my own.  I substituted Grand Marnier for OJ.  I left off the corn starch as per one reviewer.  Other than that, I made it exactly as directed.  The worst problem was that when I served it, most of the caramelized sugar pretty much remained a solid on the baking dish. I guess I will go back to prior flan recipes which always worked out for me.

I don't do much in the kitchen, so I enjoy trying recipes from this site when I do need to come up with something for a potluck or party. I followed this recipe exactly.  It was soooo good and really easy.  Even someone at the party who doesn't typically like flan because of the texture - he really liked it!

Beautiful! I wish I took a photo but it was all gone in less than a minute! I made this for a party and everyone LOVED it! The texture is smooth and creamy. I did leave out the orange ingredients because I enjoy the vanilla. Overall it was wonderful and I will be using this recipe a lot more in the future.

SO GOOD!   I cooked it in a 9 inch cake round (1.5 inches deep) with tin foil over top cuz I don't own a flan mold haha :D  I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk, 1/2 the corn starch, and didn't add any of the orange stuff.  I also used Baker's sugar instead of regular just because it's finer and a bit easier to melt but I'm sure regular sugar would have worked fine.  I didn't feel like it was firmed up enough after an hour so I cooked it for 20 more minutes just in case and it came out perfect. :)  My friends and family can't stop talking about it!  Thank you so much!!

I will definitely make again.   The only change I made is that I used evaporated milk in place of milk and orange juice.  I still used the orange zest.  Amazing!!

I don't have a flan pan, but this worked great in an 8" cake pan coated with cooking spray. Would not add the orange zest next time, maybe even less juice, as I personally prefer more vanilla flavor. Would also decrease the amount of sugar syrup. Not all of it liquified and there was a lot stuck in the bottom of the pan.

I made this for Christmas dessert 2016 for 7 extremely discerning foodies, including inlaws and parents of inlaws who intimidate me whenever it comes to contributing ANY THING when it comes to meals.  Well, it was a huge success!  And not that difficult to make.  But fair warning, the melted sugar is VERY hot during the melting process.  I didn't get to take photos but it came out of the ramekins looking restaurant quality.  i was shocked at my the results.  Everyone raved and I was redeemed!  Epilogue:  candied sugar cleans up with hot water soaking or running through the dishwasher

excellent! this time I skipped the orange zest for a more subtle orange taste. It is delicious with the zest but a bit too different for my kids. So easy to make this recipe is a keeper.

This won first place at our Havana Nights service auction dessert contest. And let me tell you, there were some mean bakers there! No one knew who baked what, and they voted with their dollars. When I saw the cup holding the dollar bills next to the flan was overflowing, I knew I had a winner.  I followed this recipe exactly! The addition of the orange made all the difference. And I sprung for a proper flan pan.

I have tried this recipe and another I found on allrecipes, and this one is so much creamier and richer tasting.  This will definitely be my go to recipe.  I didn't change anything.

I made this recipe without the orange juice or zest as I wanted something more traditional. Also, I only used 3/4 cup of sugar vs the 1 cup it called for. One thing I wanted to note for first timers like myself, keep the pan/dish warm so that when you pour the melted sugar/caramel into the pan... it won't harden quickly. I struggled with the caramel part! I used all of my sugar the first time only to mess up completely by making rock candy. Second time was fine, but once I poured it into the pan, it hardened and didn't spread evenly. A few parts were very thick... so after pouring the custard, cooking it and flipping it over (only let sit in fridge for 2 hours and it seemed fine!) I didn't have the pretty and even caramel distribution. Some parts were still undissolved.

One final note, I cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes and then lowered the heat to 325 for the remaining 15 since it still seemed a bit jiggly to me. 

It tastes delicious and is so dense!!!!! I would say 3/4 of the can of sweetened condensed milk would be fine, too. Maybe even 1/2 of the can! However, my husband said it was perfect as it was! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was excellent! The texture, and flavor was fabulous! For personal preference, I did leave out the orange juice, and zest. And I substituted evaporated milk for the whole milk and corn starch, because that is what I had on hand. The directions were very well done, and easy to follow. Next time I might use a little less sugar for the caramel, as it did not completely liquify during baking. I took a big chance having never made this recipe, and made four batches. They were served at a fiesta baby shower the next day, and everyone love it! This will be my flan recipe from now on!

I have made this about 5 times already.  Everyone loves it! The only thing I can't get correctly is the cooking time. I have to leave it in the oven for almost 2 hours for it to cook thoroughly and I had to throw the first one out using the cooking time listed. I had left the first one in the fridge overnight and it did not set. Any tips would help.

Previously reviewed and indicated that it filled 8 6oz custard cups, should have written 10 6 oz custard cups. Stir melting sugar with a flat edged wooden spatula. Use vanilla extract, not vanilla paste, because the bean bits sink to the bottom of the flan and kind of look like mold. Wish I knew how to edit previous reviews I've written!

Way too dense and sweet for our family, will try a different recipe next time.  We like a light custard so this would be fine for those that like a heavier style.

great!  creamy and silky.  I used light cream and an extra tsp. of cornstarch and it set just fine.  Note that if you do not add boiling water to the pan and use hot tap water instead, you may have to cook this a little longer.
