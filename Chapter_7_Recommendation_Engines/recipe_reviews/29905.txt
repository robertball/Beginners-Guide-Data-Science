Can I rate this 10 stars??? Shary, thank you for submitting this!!!!!! I hosted Thanksgiving at my house and had 15 people over. I LOVE LOVE LOVE (did I mention I love?) the slow cooker as it's cooking option. Definitely freed up oven space. I read a lot of reviews first and listen to the majority of the reviews and add the chicken broth 1 cup at a time when stirring (I checked on it every 45mins-1hr). I did end up using just about all of the stated cups of broth. I also added a can of sliced chestnuts. I was worried that the spices would be too overpowering, NOPE. No one believed me this stuffing was NOT from a box :) DEFINITELY to be made again!!!

I cut the onion back to one big one and added a half cup or so of chopped carrot, used chicken broth instead of water and a mess of fresh garlic. I also went easy on the salt. Everyone in our house loved this stuffing, even the two kids who normally hate stuffing. None of us had ever had stuffing made with bread AND stuffing, it was a huge hit. This may be my go-to from now on!

Only got one jiffy box of corn bread which did not make six cups! I just topped it up with a little more white bread and it worked out GREAT! I had never made stuffing before and am not sure that I've ever had it with meat so I was somewhat apprehensive. It was AMAZING. Also I'd never heard of sage sausage before this but it was right next to the other breakfast sausages so all the ingredients were easy to find.

Made this stuffing with some modifications. Didn't use eggs because I worry about Salmonella and other such things. Just added more broth. Also didn't have cornbread, just added more bread. Tossed in a handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley. Also, added a bit of butter to the drippings and sauteed a pound of chopped white mushrooms to add. Rave reviews and not many leftovers. Next time, will try it with the cornbread. Thanks!!

This was SO delicious. Followed the recipe. 
My husband chose this recipe because of the simplicity. I would have gone for a "fancier" recipe.
I put 1/2 in the turkey and 1/2 in a casserole dish.  
We actually liked the texture of the one in the casserole dish better.
I wish stuffing was healthy for you because I could eat this a few times a week.
Looking forward to leftovers!

Tastes great and I would estimate it serves 10-12. The only issue I take with this recipe is the time to prepare. It took me a LOT longer than 15 minutes. Granted this was my first time, but I'd say even next time I'd give myself at least 30 minutes for prep. Especially if you like to slow cook your sausage and veggies.

It was very dried out, but the taste was good.
