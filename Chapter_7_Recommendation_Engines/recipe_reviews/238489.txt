NOM NOM!  I didn't measure the garlic, I just added a good spoonful--probably closer to a tbsp.  This recipe is fabulous, but it makes a LOT...way more than 4 servings.  Unless you are planning on eating nothing but rice for dinner this could easily feed 8 as a side or as a burrito filler instead of the stated four people.  To give it extra zing, zest the lime and add that as well.  Be careful though, as a little goes a long way.  It was perfect with chicken enchiladas.  This is going in my keeper box....it's just too bad that only 1/2 of my family likes cilantro and lime!

Good tasting recipe. I usually add my stuff to rice before I cook it so I wasn't sure about this method. It was great. I made my rice a bit drier so it would absorb the lime. I used white rice since I was short on time. Goes well with anything, especially Mexican and Thai.

Wonderful as is. My husband does not like brown rice, and he loved this. My kids did too!

Since I first made this, I have made it several more times and my family never tires of it. I have been making my rice in a rice cooker, and I think the texture is even better than cooking it on the stove top. I don't know if it's really true, but my rice cooker changed my opinion of brown rice. I love it now!  I love going to Chipotle for this rice, and now I can make it any time at home. Love, love, love this recipe. One of my all time faves!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted nothing like Chipoltle rice. It was sticky and gunky.

this was a really good starting point.. i cut this in half which was perfect bc i had the boil in a bag brown rice that is 2 one cup servings.. i used 3 T bottled lemon juice for the lime (but i'm sure the lime would have been best) and instead of using minced garlic and sea salt i used a little less than 1 tsp of garlic salt.. left the olive oil and cilantro amounts the same.. ty for a good simple recipe

Simple and tasty! I mixed all the 'dressing' ingredients and cilantro a little before I cooked the rice and just mixed it all together when the rice was done. This went great w/ our 'Lettuce Leaf Tacos' and 'Easy Refried Black Beans', both from this site. Thanks for sharing. :)

8.4.2017-Very easy and good recipe to make! Will definitely make again! As written, I felt it needs more cilantro and lime, but that's easy to adjust. I used Young Elephant's Brown Jasmine Rice and surprisingly had no problems with the rice being mushy! I followed the cooking directions on the back of the bag, which was for every 1 cup rice, use 1.5 cups water in a rice cooker.  Several reviews complain about mushy rice, so definitely refer to the mfr. recommended cooking method. Most long grain brown rice calls for 2 cups water p/1 cup rice, which I've always had problems making on the stove. When using those, such as Riceland brand, I find Alton Brown's baked brown rice method yields fluffy brown rice every time. Try baking the rice first using his method, continue with the rest of this recipe, and you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE: 2.9.18-Had about 2.5 cups leftover baked brown rice, made this recipe again using a tad more lime juice and about 2 tsp dried cilantro (1st time using this not bad, but prefer fresh). Added a little chicken broth to reheat brown rice in oven to prevent it drying out. Stirred all to combine, covered with foil, bake at 350 F for 20 minutes. Recipe worked perfect for us tonight! Thanks again!

I know the way I made it uses totally different main flavors, BUT that was all I had on hand...and it was still 5 stars! I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use Lemon instead of Lime and Basil instead of Cilantro. Even with Lemon and Basil, it was great! Had this with roasted chicken and veggies.  Can't wait to try it with Lime and Cilantro when I have some!

I followed recipe, easy as it was, but had dried cilantro on hand. And from the internet it says fresh to dried is 1:3 meaning say 1 tablespoon fresh to 1 teaspoon dry because dry is more potent. Well, I was optimistic it would taste close to "chipotle", but it didn't. Now I'm no expert on chipping because in Fl I prefer Tijuana flats over chipotle and definitely chipotle over moes. The taste just fell flat. I barely tasted the lime or cilantro and I'm not a huge fan of lime to begin with. I will consider making again but adding half a lime at first and maybe buying fresh cilantro to see. Otherwise it was decent.

My rice came out  yucky & sticky. I'll try it again cooking the rice the way I normally do since I couldn't concentrate on the flavor from the mush.

when I made the rice, I combined what this recipe called for and a few other recipes. First, the ration of 2 to 1, so 2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice worked perfectly. The trick is to not stir the rice at all and even let it sit for a few minutes. At first, I thought it was lacking flavor, so I added like 1/4 more of lime juice, more garlic powder, salt and pepper. I think what really boosted the flavor was when I added some Adobo. Overall, pretty good recipe to start, definitely needs some tweaks.

We used this in our Chipotle® Copycat Chicken Burrito Bowls tonight, and the flavors were spot on! The only change I made was to use white basmati rice instead of brown rice, and I soaked it for about half an hour before cooking it, which results in less cooking time, and individual rice grains that don't stick together. My kids didn't complain at the dinner table tonight, so that says a lot! Will make this again!

For anyone that says their rice came out mushy... the recipe is likely for the specific rice the cook had... I used Jasmine rice and followed the directions on the box/bag (15 minutes for mine). I didn't have a real lime, so I just used butter, salt, pepper, bottled lime juice and cilantro. Came out great!

Inedible!

I followed the recipe exactly. I make brown rice all the time and it's never like this.  This was VERY overcooked. So much so that I didn't bother to mix anything with it, I just fed it to my chickens!

We used white rice, but this turned out so wonderfully fluffy! Not sticky at all and it was done so fast. The lime, cilantro and salt added great flavor. I’ve saved this as a go-to for cilantro lime rice.

I made this with one change. I used Alton Brown's recipe for naked Brown rice. It always turns out perfect! I then tossed the cilantro and lime with it when it came out of the oven. Put the foil back on and let it sit about 20 minutes until dinner was done and tossed again. I added more lime for our tastes. It won't taste like chipotle because the recipe doesn't call for it.  Kinda weird because it's in the name. :) Just need to add some if you want. Whole family loved it and will be making it again for sure.

This was delicious! I did follow the guidelines on the rice bag, as it listed less water with the 2 cups rice.  I was afraid my rice would be runny.I used short grain brown rice.  It turned out creamy, almost like risotto.  We ate this as a carnitas burrito bowl style.  My husband also eats rice, but does not love it. He really liked this recipe.  I will be keeping this in my arsenal of regular recipes.

This is great. Easy to make and keep in the fridge to throw into chili and burritos, which I make a lot because they're so fast and easy. This tasted best warm from the pot but reheated well too.

I followed the recipe perfectly and it makes a lot more than I thought it would.  It went perfectly with  beans, salsa, grilled chicken. Loved it!

Great! Tastes identical to chipotle! We don't measure the cilantro or other ingredients as we do it to taste! Perfect and simple.

EXCELLENT! If you like cilantro... add more! Next time I make it, will only change that and add a whole cup of it.

Super easy! Not sure how anyone rates this a 1 star. I made it today and it's darn near an exact copycat! 
I cooked my rice in my rice cooker. Be sure to let the rice cool before adding other ingredients.  5 out if 5!

This rice is the bomb! I used white rice instead only because I was out of brown and used a heaping spoon full of minced garlic and salted the rice well so I didn't add salt to the mixture. adding the lime,garlic and cilantro at the end is the key to this kind of rice!  I definitely recommend it.

We really enjoy this recipe and usually make it for our Mexican themed nights. Our little ones and friends love when we make it and we always make extra to have on hand. The key is learning to prepare brown rice correctly. After that, it's so simple and delicious.

Easy and the whole family liked it (including kids). I used the rice cooker, which saved space on the stove and I didn't have to watch it. My only change was using regular table salt instead of sea salt. I increased the recipe to 6 servings and it was enough for 10 people plus left overs (served as a side dish/burrito filler).

Recipe turned out great! We're vegetarian so I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth, but it was delicious served under our  grilled veggie and pineapple kabobs.
