I used 1 cup honey instead of sugars, 1/2 cup extra pumpkin instead of butter, and doubled the spices. It rose beautifully, was moist, well-spiced, and gone in 5 minutes! Thank you for a recipe I could easily make egg and dairy free without anyone knowing!

I made this on my mom's request for her birthday.  It was good b/c it has no egg in it which 3 people in my family are allergic to. The cake rised really good at least doubled in size.  And was very moist.  Every loved it. I topped it with a whipped cream cheese frosting from this site, that I just added cinnamon to.

Very tasty! I skipped the frosting and served this with whipped cream. This cake is moist and full of flavor. My cake was done baking at 35 minutes.

Very Easy to make! I omitted the oats and the walnuts and added 3 chopped Hershey bars to the batter, instead!

Really good. I used applesauce instead of oil. Very moist. I think I will increase the spices next time though as the cake lacked depth in its flavor. But that didn't stop me from eating the whole thing ;)

I made this recipe as stated but doubled all of the spices and added ground ginger. The cake turned out very moist and was very tasty. I made my own cream cheese frosting with 2 (8oz) packages of cream cheese, one stick of butter, 2 cups of powdered sugar and 4 Tablespoons of milk so it wasn't too thick, and then added the cinnamon. Very good recipe for Thanksgiving or a fall dessert.

Excellent, easy to make.  We made it as dessert for the family Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved it!  My husband and I made homemade cream cheese frosting instead (and added the 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, according to this recipe).  We highly recommend doing that instead of using store-bought.  Do your own taste test!  (it's easy to find a recipe online for the frosting)

Sooooooo good! I followed recipe exactly except I made my own cream cheese frosting because I think the ones in the can are too sweet.

This pumpkin cake was absolutely delicious! I topped it with cream cheese icing, and it was soooooo good! NOTE: I made my own icing with 1 pack of cream cheese, 1/4 C. sugar, and 1/8 C. milk. I melted the cream cheese in the microwave then just added the other ingredients, and ... Presto! Definately a keeper.

Perfect as is.  My hubby can't have eggs or dairy.  So I used rice milk for the milk.  The whole family, including the kids, loved it.  My hubby loved it, even without frosting.

This is a delicious fall cake.  I used applesauce for 1/2 the oil, skipped the icing and dusted it with a mixture of powdered sugar and pumpkin pie spice.  It was a hit!

I really really really wanted to love this recipe, but texture-wise, I will stick to the pumpkin roll recipes on this site (with eggs).

This cake was absolutely great! I made it 'just because' and my roommates ate it all in about 2 days. I also made my own cream cheese frosting (Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site) and they went fantastic together.

Wow, does my house smell great right now!!!  This easy cake, made without eggs, is really really good.  I substituted lime juice for the vinegar, but otherwise made this as written.  Okay, I doubled the spices because we really love spice cake.  It is cooling now as I prepare for guests, and plan to frost it with a cinnamon buttercream frosting, as I don't have any cream cheese, but can't imagine anyone turning up their nose to this one.  Great recipe.

I will make it again, it's a good, tasty, moist cake. I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and the whole can of pumpkin, as well as double the spices. To compensate for more pumpkin, I only used 1/3 C of oil. I had gotten some Nestlé's Pumpkin Spice chips, which I'd never seen before, and I added 1/2 C of those with the nuts, which people liked. I made my own cream cheese cinnamon frosting.

Thanks for such a great recipe. Great to have an eggless recipe which turns out so beautifully. Agree with other reviews that the quantity of spices need to be atleast doubled for more depth of flavour. Making it again for the Good Griday today.
