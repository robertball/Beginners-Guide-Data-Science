First time cooking Cornish Game Hens. Reduced the recipe down to just two birds, but thankfully kept the sauce the same. Mmmmmmm! To reduce fat, I skinned the hens before putting them in the crockpot and put them in breast down to make them extra juicy. Fancy Valentine's Day dinner with little or no extra work! Thanks!!

I didn't have any plum, but I did have cherry perserves. I did everything else the way the recipe said and it was soo tender and falling off the bone. I'm new to slow cooking and this is a keeper!

I thought this turned out really well. The plum glaze added a really nice flavor. I might try this again with an apricot glaze. This was my first attempt cooking game hens in the slow cooker and loved the ease and convenience.

Amazing! My roommate and I love this recipe. Very easy.   I've doubled the plum jam and mixed the opnion soup and red peppers (same amounts) in all together. Glaze 1/3 of the mix in the beginning, 1/3 an hour before, and save 1/3 (microwave for 30-45 seconds) for dipping sauce for the insides of the hens. Also good with peach preserves OR cherry jam.

We really enjoyed this!  SO EASY and very few ingredients.  Couldn't find plum jam so used red raspberry.  Really delicious.  I may use more crushed red pepper the next time, we like the zing.  The only thing I did different was salt and pepper the hens before putting them in the slow cooker.  This is a keeper!

I did the recipe exactly as printed and will probably double the jam next time.  It was good, but the hot of the pepper flakes competed too much with the sweet of the jam.  The juices made a great gravy with a little corn starch and chicken broth (we had on hand from making risotto).  As other reviewers said, it was fall of the bone tender!  Will definitely make again!

I had to use a strawberry-plum-raspberry fruit spread instead of the plum jam, but it has still gave it that slightly sweet flavor.  The chicken was literally falling off the bones in the crock pot by dinner time.  I did turn the bird juices into a gravy by heating it more on the stove top and adding so cornstarch (that I'd already mixed with water to prevent clumping).    After dinner I removed all the bones, skin and grizzle etc so that I can turn it into a biscuits and gravy with mixed vegetables and chicken for tomorrow night (my husband won't eat the same dish twice ... sigh).

I rubbed salt and pepper along with the crushed red pepper flakes on my hens before glazing them with the plum jam/onion soup mix. I was concerned about using the crushed red pepper flakes, but actually didn't notice them when eating.

This simple recipe is over the top! I cooked the birds legs up and used four to keep them that way in the slow cooker. I cooked them all night long and the meat melted in our mouths. Next time, I'll try using the jalapeno plum jelly from one of the salsa websites. Can't wait!

This was excellent, I had to use black cherry jam instead of the plum ( store did not carry plum), but the hen just fell apart from the bone, my husband loved it as well.

I really changed up this already great recipe. Made TWO large hens;  Sauce:  1 cup cherry preserves + 1/4 cup apple jelly+1 tsp pepper flakes + 1 tsp rum salt + the soup mix.  Then I baked them "basted" at 325 degrees for 1 hr 15 minutes. Yum yum yummy!

I'm not a fan of crock pot food, but this was good, and easy to put together. Also, I think it's a very forgiving recipe - I used apricot jam and veggie soup mix since those were what I had in hand, and it was great. You can probably do any number of jam/seasoning combos.

I used chicken thighs. The pepper flakes and plum is an exciting flavor combination.  Will make it again, and again with other bird parts.

I made this exactly as written.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and moist.   There was plenty of sauce to use over rice or noodles.  The flavor of the sauce was slightly odd.  Not sure that I will make this again.
