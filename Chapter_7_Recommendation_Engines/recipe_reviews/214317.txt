Excellent!! I made a double batch to take to work. I used the big container (32oz) of yogurt with 2 pkgs of Jello and 2 big dollups of whipped topping. It was perfect! Don't make them too far in advance though, or wait to put the cookies on because they get soggy pretty quick. I was told I could make make them again anytime :)
