This is a great side dish!  I always add a sliced red onion and use cherry tomatoes cut in half.  I add minced garlic and come italian seasoning and a little salt and pepper.  I bake it in the oven at 425 for about 45 minutes in a 9x13 in pan sprayed with Pam.  I sprinkle it with light parmesan cheese right before serving.

This is really good. I used olive oil instead of cooking spray and 1 can of diced tomatoes. Next time I am going to use a clove of garlic and serve it over pasta.

I thought this was a nice change up for a side dish. I omitted the yellow squash and went with four small zucchini. I used olive oil instead of cooking spray, added a tsp of minced garlic and a sliced red onion and used grape tomatoes, halved. I also used the suggestion of red pepper flakes. I think they really added a nice kick that this dish couldn't do without! I'll definitely make again, except, I'll double the sliced mushrooms.

I accidentally added the mushrooms with the tomatoes but I don't know if it made a difference.
I added some olive oil because the cooking spray wasn't enough liquid. This was soooo good. I like the idea of tomatoes with the squash. My 16 month old daughter loved this dish. Yummy!

I HAVE MADE THIS WITH A MEXICAN FLAIR. INSTEAD OF THE TOMATO, I ADD MAYBE A CUP OF CHUNKY SALSA & A CUP OF CORN. I SORTA EYEBALL IT. TO ADD MORE CALORIES, WHEN THE VEGGIES ARE DONE, I SPRINKLE A CUP(OR SO) OF CHEESE ON TOP. PUT A LID ON IT AND TURN THE FIRE OFF. YUMMM...

I actually found this to be very bland. That said, however, wrapped in a tortilla with sour cream, it was quite good!

Has such a great flavor!  I don't usually like these veggies, but it was very good.  I doubled the recipe and gave some to neighbors who also loved it!  I even used some in scrambled eggs the next morning.

This is the first recipe I'm giving 1 star, ever. I followed it to the letter, and after 15 minutes of simmering the veggies still tasted raw, with no flavor whatsoever. It was inedible. I let my boyfriend take over, and he added a lot of Indian spices, and simmered for another 10 or so minutes, and it ended up pretty decent (but it was a completely different dish). We ate it with rotis.

I make this too, with just a few differences in the quantities!  I divide smallish medium tomatoes (I grow them in the summer), quarter/1/6th them and bake separately from the rest, since I frequently serve this as an appetizer.  I add sliced sweet basil (fresh) on top the rest with

Solid recipe that you can make your own.  I did use suggestions here for seasoning and garlic.  I would like to say I did use two tomatoes, but one at the last minute.  The Diced tomato the recipe calls for goes in the pan first.  By the time I was almost done that tomato essentially incorporated completely, so I quickly diced another tomato and tossed it in for the last five or so minutes, worked out great.  Thank you!

Quick easy and delicious. This recipes is enough for four people. Made this dish for two people so I cut the recipe in half but yet still used a whole it was perfect. The only thing I changed was adding a little parsley.

Saute in about 2 Tbls olive oil and throw in a sliced narrow sweet potato; gives a slight sweet flavor for a change and more vitamins!

Quick and easy. I melted some butter with olive oil, sliced instead of diced and added salt, pepper and minced garlic instead of garlic pepper. Great way to use up veggies from the garden.

This was a really good side dish that I made to go alongside a pasta dish.  Instead of fresh I used canned tomatoes, and it seemed to work out pretty well.  I also added garlic. but not until the end.  It would probably be really good if added from the get go.

This is a good very low cal. side.  We liked it alot but I think it needs some extra seasoning.  Maybe next time I'll use some creole seasoning to spice it up a little.

I thought it was tasty, average side dish.  Will make again.  But nothing to go cuckoo over
