This was fabulous!  Used dark chocolate cocoa and it was rich and creamy!  Served with fresh whipped cream and berries. For my chocolate loving friends, they said it was a keeper.

This was delicious!! The custard was so rich and luscious and the burned sugar on top was just what was needed to cut through the richness.  I will definitely make this again!
