This was quick, easy, and flavorful!  I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  I served it over mashed potatoes as a side to go with "Chicken Ole" from this site.  Will make this again!

I tried this recipe after using a different recipe that called for cilantro.  I was out of cilantro so I tried this recipe.  For how simple it is, it is great.... but with a little cilantro in it, I would give it 5 stars.  (my wife thought this recipe was better than the recipe with cilantro).... try it, you might love it.

Super easy.  I add a green bell pepper and saute it with minced garlic, so I don't use the garlic powder.  Freezes well to bring for lunch to work.
