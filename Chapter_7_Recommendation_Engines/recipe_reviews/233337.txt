Tankyy have I told you how much I love you?!!! I've made this several times now playing with it each time. Great for those chocolate cravings and there is nothing in the house kinda fix. I think I have it down. Add a drop of vanilla ,use canola oil and top with chips such as chocolate or caramel. Let sit for several minutes and top with vanilla ice cream. This is a gooey chocolate wonder! Thanks so much for sharing this delight!

Decided to try this recipe since I was having a chocolate craving and this sounded like a quick and easy sweet to solve it. It was very easy to make and does fit perfectly into a standard size mug. However I found it to taste more like warm chocolate flavored flour with sweetener than the brownie I was looking forward to. I was very disappointed. It's a great idea, but the final product just does not live up to its full pan counterpart.

I didn't want to bake these in the oven, and it was too cloudy to cook in the solar oven, so I steamed these.  I doubled the recipe, using gluten free flour, and half the amount of honey as I would have used if I had used sugar.  I steamed the double batch in 3 egg poaching cups.steaming for 20 minutes.  They are heavy and dense with great flavor!

I've tried quite a few mug cake recipes and this is by far the best.  If you're expecting traditional brownie taste/texture, you'll probably be disappointed, but c'mon, this is a 100 second microwave recipe!!!  I took the other reviewers' recommendations and did not use olive oil - I used butter instead.  I also added a splash of vanilla extract.  When it was done, I took a taste and was immediately impressed. It was slightly crumbly, so I poked holes in the top with a chopstick and drizzled half and half over it. To die for!!!!  The next time I made it I only cooked it for 1 min 30 secs and that was perfect.  I've also drizzled cream over top if I don't have half and half. So good! Thanks for the great recipe Tankyy!

A great starting place, but needed some tweaking.  I recommend replacing the olive oil with two tablespoons butter and a teaspoon or so of vegetable oil (it's a dry recipe).  If you like it rich and not a bit dry, mix in a spoonful of chocolate chips before cooking.  Cook for 1:20 instead of 1:40.  Soo good.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe.  I wasn't a thick dense cake but more of a thick mush.  Also the taste of olive oil was overwhelming.  It did taste like chocolate though.

My kids love this when the pantry is bare.. I will use real butter if I'm out of vegetable oil. I always add a couple drops of vanilla and 1/4 cup of water.  and since we have been making this for years I have learned microwaves will vary the time. So I cook till the sides start to Crack a lil and the middle is almost done..

My husband didn't want to do the dishes for brownies tonight, so we looked up this recipe, and we don't regret a thing! This is very yummy, fast, and just as good as brownies that come from the oven. But %100 better than brownies you get from a microwave dinner. You won't regret making this brownie.

I thought this was pretty good. I did sub real butter for the oil, added 2 heaping tablespoons of plain yogurt and just enough water to make a batter consistency, maybe 2 Tablespoons. Also a dash of vanilla. I also put this in TWO  6 oz. custard cups. I put a dollop each of peanut butter and marshmallow fluff BETWEEN 2 layers of batter and nuked for 60 seconds. FYI-the fluff will expand and rise out of the batter, but mine stopped just short of escaping the cup and fell back on itself. Keep a close eye on it and LET IT COOL before you eat it. It was really yummy!

More cakey than brownie.  A quick chocolate fix than I really appreciated, despite the calorie count.  I might play with this a bit.  I used butter instead of the olive oil.

I don't know why the recipe says to use olive oil, but I followed directions and the brownie had a strong olive oil taste, and I couldn't eat more than two bites of it. I might try it again with veg or canola oil, but can only give it 3 points using the original recipe. Perhaps some people won't be sensitive to the olive oil flavor, but to me, it doesn't "go" with chocolate flavor.

I was skeptical about brownie in a mug.  I had a major brownie craving and decided I had nothing to lose.  It actually turned out really well considering its made in a mug for a minute and 40 seconds.  Room for improvement of course.  Still very good and it solved my brownie fix problem.  I might add melted butter next time too. Very much a keeper and kids would LOVE LOVE LOVE it.

These are great for those moments when nothing but a rich, chocolatey brownie will do! I didn't care for the taste the olive oil gave, so I used canola oil instead; I plan to try melted butter one of these days. I reduced the sugar to 3 tablespoons, and it only took 50 seconds in the microwave. I topped it with a little peanut butter--pure bliss!

Very yummy. Unfortunately I can't get the photo adding button to work here. I made 4 times as much and microwaved 10 minutes in a glass bread pan. It was excellent under my vanilla ice cream.

Used Canola oil instead of Olive oil.  Added a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.  Microwaved for 1 min 30 sec and came out perfect.  Awesome with a scoop of ice-cream.

I made this for eating around the campfire and it was perfect.  Moist, dense, chocolatey.  EASY.  The only thing I changed was vegetable oil for olive oil as I knew I didnt want to taste olive oil.  I also added peppermint extract, just a smidge.  On my second try I didn't use all the sugar and topped with chocolate chips.  Pretty darn awesome.

It was pretty good but a little floury tasting, I would like to make it again and maybe add a tiny bit less flour.  Other than the small flour problem it's really good and great when Your craving some chocolate.

This is wonderful for a quick chocolate fix. Mine came out a little dry, so i would cook it for a minute next time then check, maybe even ado another tablespoon of water. Microwaves have different power levels and that greatly affects the outcome.

I doubled the recipe in a bowl and substituted canola for olive oil.  I added a splash of vanilla.  I microwaved it for 3 minutes and then I put some condensed milk on top of it.  I then threw a spoon of raspberry preserves on top of it.  It was surprisingly good.  I somehow doubt the olive oil would have went well with it.

I made this for my husband and myself on a lazy evening at home. I was craving chocolate cake and didn't quite want to take the trouble of making an entire batch. This recipe seemed to fit the bill.  I've tried quite a few recipes online, and none have thus far given me the kind of satisfaction as this has. I followed the advice of other reviewers and subbed vegetable oil for olive oil, added a splash of vanilla, and once out of the microwave, topped it with chocolate chips. Delicious! I'd probably reduce the cook time to 1:30 next time, coz I found the bottom a bit more crumbly than I like it, but otherwise it's perfect. As on reviewer rightly said, if you're expecting traditional brownie texture/taste, this isn't it. But this is nearly as good and a great subsititute for when you don't really feel like doing the dishes! Thank you so much for this Tankyy!

For a microwave recipe, it is really tasty! It looks, tastes, and smells like a brownie! It is perfect for when you want a quick desert without having more brownies than you need. I will definitely be making this again!

It was okay. I would've preferred it to be a little bit more sweet and moist. I put nutella and frozen vanilla yogurt on it and it was great after that.

First time I did it for 1 min 40 secs. And it was burnt. Second time 1 min15 secs. It's not burnt. I'd recommend that time

Well first off I didn't have any ice cream so that might make it perfect but if you don't go into it looking for a real brownie, it's not bad for what it is. Replaced olive oil with canola oil and also added some milk. Definitely needed to cook a little longer because it was slightly mushy and there was sugar that I must not have mixed correctly crystallized on the "batter" on the side. Don't know if that was because of the mug or microwave but I do know it made it HOT. Might play around with it and try some adjustments to suit my tastes but overall wasn't bad for a quick chocolate fix.

I made this with my 3 girls (did half a recipe for each- plenty) and they said this was the best dessert they ever had! I also used veggie oil instead of olive oil. 1.5 minutes in the microwave was perfect. thanks for the great recipe!

It was good but I wouldn't call it a "brownie in a mug"  it's more like cake. My little sister said it was good but was hoping for a more "brownie-ish flavor and texture.

I used melted coconut oil instead of olive oil, and a few drops of vanilla. I also topped it with sprinkled powdered sugar. One of the better mug brownie recipes I have tried. I enjoy that it doesn't require an egg.

I was in the mood for a brownie, but didn't want a whole batch, so I thought this was perfect! It was easy to make, & smelled gr8, but I thought it tasted like flour with some Cocoa mixed in. So, not my favorite, but it was quick & easy!

This recipe is perfect! Made it tonight for Valentine's Day and the entire family loved it.  I used self-raising flour, so left out the salt. Used evoo and did not taste the olive oil at all.  Will make this recipe again and again, trying different toppings etc. but the base recipe is just perfect.

My 13 year old made this. She added about a teaspoon of vanilla to give it more flavor. She had to double the water to get it more like batter and it's still sort of dry.

Needed a simple chocolate fix on a Sunday afternoon and this was PERFECT! Used 2 TBLSP real, salted butter in lieu of oil and added an extra TBLSP cocoa powder (to make 3). Microwaved 1 min 15 sec (til the edges cracked slightly). Topped with vanilla bean ice cream for a rich, decadent dessert to share. My husband exclaimed this was as good as a molten lava cake recipe I made that was way more involved regarding prep and cooking.

Is this the greatest brownie ever, of course not! But if you need an emergency chocolate fix and only have a few ingredients this is more than sufficient. I added a few walnuts and a tiny splash of vanilla and will try using milk instead of water and melted butter instead of the oil next time. Quite nice considering there are only 6 things in it.

This has been a family favorite for years. Over time I substituted melted butter for the olive oil and sometimes add a dash of vanilla. We often share it for two because them we can have it more often :)

I love this! Woohoo-now I can have a fresh chocolate dessert any time! I followed another reviewer’s advice to add a drop (or two..) of vanilla and I also microwaved it in a small rice bowl instead of a mug. The increased surface area improved the texture. It really seemed like a real baked dessert. Thanks for the recipe!

I’ve made many a microwave brownie trying to perfect the recipe. I finally had it down but lost the recipe when we moved. I’m pleased to say this one is just as good! I did make a few small adjustments. Instead of 2tbsp of olive oil I used 3tbsp of melted butter and instead of water I used milk. How long you cook it will make or break the recipe. Too short of a time and it will be chocolate goo and too long and it will be flavorless and dry and crumbly. I found 1 minute and 30 seconds perfect for MY microwave. Just from my own experience, when  it’s cooked to perfection it will still look wet on top but if you take a spoon and scrape at the top it will reveal a cooked brownie. If it looks dry on top it’s likely over cooked. I really like that this recipe doesn’t call for eggs. My son and I are chocoholics and we love this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

do not use Olive oil, it does overwhelm the taste. add vanilla flavoring and you've got a winner.

Before I made it I read some of the comments and put butter instead of olive oil and a splash of vanilla extract. Also I thought I think baking soda helps it rise so I Added a pinch of baking soda and put it in the microwave for 1 min and 30 sec so it was a little bit fudge.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe. A lot of people said it wasn't thick like a brownie. I added half a beaten egg (I made 2 mugs) to each mug and added less water. I also used canola oil. 1min 30secs later and it was perfect.

Super easy recipe. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and added 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 teaspoon of olive oil, then added 2 tablespoons of water. I added chocolate chips. After I had microwaved it (I used a small corning ware dish instead of mug), I topped with marshmallows and popped under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the marshmallows. Sweet ending to a crazy day.

it is really that easy. My son and husband approve this treat. After letting it cool..a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream on top really impressed the guys.

I absolutely loved this warm -midnight craving- treat! However, I have a couple helpful changes. Instead of using olive oil, I used vegetable oil (if you do this reduce cooking time to 1:30 seconds!)  I have made it both ways, and the original way had an overwhelming, bad taste. I also added a couple drops of vanilla extract, it makes the taste so scrumptious. Lastly, I added a little extra sugar, just over a teaspoon, so it evened out with the liquid.

This recipe was great even without the changes. I heard someone recommend butter instead of olive oil so I did that as well as exchanging the water for an egg. It was delicious for a microwave dessert

I love this recepie! I have tried so many different types and this one is definitely my favorite. the one thing I would recommend is using canola oil instead of olive oil ( im not that much a fan of the flavor) otherwise it is the best.

It was really easy to make, but for me there was a little bit too much chocolate. Instead of olive oil I used canola oil and I also added a little bit of vanilla extract which made it sweeter. If I made this again, I would just add less cocoa powder, but other than that, these brownies were excellent.

This is really good for a quick "brownie fix" if you make these changes. Substitute melted butter for olive oil, add a splash of vanilla extract, and microwave for 1:20. Perfection!

This is a deliciously chocolatey recipe, it worked awesome the first time I made it and is just gooey enough to not be too cakey. What I did instead of serving with icecream was microwave for the first minute, push some chocolate buttons into the centre and microwave again for the remaining 40 seconds, which made it even more chocolatey and delicious! 
what I would do next time - by no means is this a complaint but only an observation who likes sweeter chocolates - I would use a little less cocoa powder.

Based on previous reviews, I replaced the olive oil with butter flavored shortening, added a tsp of vanilla, and reduced the microwave time to 1 minute 20 seconds.  It makes  an easy and delicious snack!  Moist and rich.

I actually didn't cook this but rather enjoyed the brownie "dough" raw. It was delicious. I used melted coconut oil rather than olive oil, left out the salt since I wasn't baking it, and added walnuts. Washed it down with a cold glass of milk. Yum.

Amazing!! I'm not a huge brownie lover but I decided to try this. SO GOOD. Better than the pan ones in my opinion. There are so many options! I substituted the sugar for 1/8 cup fructose. Healthier and the brownie was very dark and rich. Next time I want to try adding milk and some vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!!

Having a chocolate craving, I figured this might do the trick.  It did...but it was just ok.  It tastes really flour-y and the olive oil taste is strong.  If I made this again I'd use vegetable oil and maybe some chocolate chips to add some flavor.  I'd also probably eat it with ice cream too.  It's taste isn't wonderful but not too shabby for as easy as it was.

I love that this recipe doesn't call for eggs. I hate making a brownie to walk out with scrambled eggs. 
I literally am eating this brownie as I'm typing this, and this is probably the best microwave brownie I've made so far. Would recommend!!!

The consistency of this was great, however it was not nearly sweet enough for me. Other recipes like this have more sugar and less bitter cocoa powder so that may balance it out better. As is, it just isn't sweet enough!

I cooked my brownie for a minute and 10 seconds instead and it was amazing!! A lot of people were complaining about the dryness but if you cook it this way it will be fudgy and delicious! I also used vegetable oil instead of olive oil, added a teaspoon of vanilla and mixed in chocolate chips and it was to die for!!

Great recipe, I did 3 tbsp of cocoa, substituted milk for water and added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips or chopped candy bar and topped with ice cream. This will go head to head with your grandma's secret brownie recipe any day! Delicious!

I thought this was great with some tweaking.  I used 3 tablespoons of cold coffee instead of water, only 1 tablespoon of oil and then added a tablespoon of yogurt.  Mine came out moist, gooey and delicious (but terribly sweet).  Could only eat half of it :)

Have made this many times with different variations, definitely 2 table spoons butter , 1 tsp veg oil, only 1/8 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and i can actually finish it because this variation isn't too rich for me.

Great for when you want a 5 min chocolate quick fix. Obviously not as good as a pan of brownies but like we said QUICK FIX. I put marshmallows and caramel ontop of mine. YIM

Don't like the fact that the olive oil is one of the most dominated flavors in the brownie...id probably switch that out and it'll be great...also sprinkled powder sugar on top and it was amazing. All around has potential to be a great recipe.

Why do so many comments start out, "great recipe!" Then detail how they changed everything?  This was just fine as-is in my nuker. A minute-forty on high, scoop of vanilla ice cream, and Bob's your uncle. Not a perfect brownie, but it isn't supposed to be. It's quick, rich, and chocolatey.

It really isn't as good as a pan but when you don't want to eat a whole pan and you know you will if you make it, this is a great alternative.  I added a few chocolate chips which I think made a huge difference.

Good concept, But not my mug. hah, mine started to burn at 55 seconds.
When it was done it tasted like coco flour, it had a kind of cake like texture. but this recipe need help. some flavoring some kind, little egg beaters, some butter. I may play with the recipe. Happy Cooking!

I think that cooking oil ruins the flavor of most things in the baking category. I try to avoid it at all costs. I tried this recipe (and several others around the net) and they all pretty much weighed in the same- just OK. I set out to make my own version which is lower calories, better single serve portion and can be made in the microwave!

I liked this. Though second thinking it, seems to be that it should say vegetable oil instead of olive oil. I would make this again but not the same way exactly.

Took care of my chocolate craving in a pinch, but wasn't as sweet as brownies and did have an olive oil flavor.  And looking at the ingredients/calories it's just not worth it!  For these calories I could have Ben and Jerry's.
