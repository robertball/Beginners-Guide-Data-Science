Can I give this recipe ten stars? Whenever I go to restaurants like Boston Pizza or East Side Mario's, I always order the equivalent of this from the appetizer menu. I made a batch using mini tortellinis - bite-sized and delicious! Be generous when dipping the tortellinis in the sour cream + milk mixture: the pasta needs that moisture to cook! Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!!

Made this for my daughter's birthday as an appetizer to feed the guests.  GREAT HIT! EVERYONE loved them! I did use Italian-seasoned bread crumbs and a little more parm.  These baked great and were gone within the first half hour they were out of the oven! Pizza sauce for dipping is a must. Many thanks for this recipe!

This is a easy, simple recipe to make as an appetizer. Rave reviews from everybody.

I would suggest using non-stick cooking spray on the cookie sheet before baking ot make turning them over easier.

Love it! Will definitely be making again!

This is an honest review.  I made quite a few of these for a party following the recipe exactly.  I put the tortellini bites out on a plate with the pizza sauce on the side at a party and everyone who tried them did NOT like them at all.  I was embarrassed.  They were dry and tasteless and even though the pizza sauce added a bit of flavor, they were still bad.  I ended up throwing them away.  Needless to say I was disappointed and this has been the only recipe that I've made from this site that I did not like whatsoever.

If I could give this recipe 4 1/2 stars, I would. After reading the other reviews I made a few modifications and they turned out really tasty. I boiled the tortellini for about 9 minutes beforehand so they were about 3/4 of the way cooked. I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain and added Italian seasoning. Baked for 8 minutes and they were great. Couldn't stop eating them!

The first time I made this recipe, I understood why some folks rated these poorly as dry and tasteless.  It was obvious to me after the second time that they overcooked them because the next time I made these, I was careful about the timing and they were scrumptious.  I've since made them for a variety of different groups and they have always gone like hotcakes.  Please note the reviewers that called this recipe dry and tasteless most likely cooked them too long. This recipe is now a standard for my italian themed parties.  For the pizza sauce, I used the canned and add 1/4 cup of parmesan and some Italian seasoning.

This recipe was just okay in our house.  Nobody was really thrilled with this dish but it wasn't bad either.  Just not a favorite or a recipe we would make again.

I thought these turned out better then expected considering the problems others had.  I used a mixture of egg and milk to dip and Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain to help with the flavor.  Then I drizzled with melted butter before baking.  As far as the difficulty, these were not hard or time consuming, just throwing a few ingredients in a zipper baggie then dipping the tortellini - easy.  Use the the larger tortellini, not the mini's. The biggest thing was the texture, they were flavorful but tough and chewy, and not from overcooking, it's because you are baking uncooked pasta.  Next time I will either par boil or run under warm water to soften the pasta.  I will try these again though, because they are different from your basic party fare.

These are a little difficult to make and you need to eat them while they are hot so they are not good as an appetizer for a party unless you have a warming tray.

I was a little disappointed in these.  I don't know why you need to dip them in milk and sour cream.  I had to keep shaking off the excess and the tortellini were small and a pain in the neck.  I also had a bag of ravioli which was a little easier to dip.  Still the milk/sour cream was a nightmare and I think you could get the same results just using an egg bath.  Didn't give it a different flavor.  All in all they went!  The dipping sauce was a great touch.

I'm not much of a cook, but even I could make this and have it turn out excellent.  This was such a delicious snack, and very easy to make.  We will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I wasn't sure when I made these how they were going to go over...but they were a big success!! Everyone enjoyed them. I followed another persons suggestion about making sure the tortellini are well coated so they don't dry out. I put the tortellini (a few at a time) into the mixture and stirred - it was much easier than trying to dip them individually. Great recipe - will definitely make again.

Didn't have chicken bullion so I used French onion soup/dip mixed with the breadcrumbs and left off the parm. They weren't bad, but a little chewy and not a lot of flavor. One suggestion is to use larger tortellini. I used the mini and they were a little difficult to work with due to their size.

This was OK at best.  Added italian seasoning as suggested by another postee and increased the garlic powder to 1 full tsp.  But still kinda bland.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. The end result tastes really good, in fact we had no leftovers, but the prep. work was SO messy. I think it's a good recipe for the whole family to make, if you do not mind getting your hands dirty. Probably will not make again.

I used italian seasoned bread crumbs for additional flavor.  I also tossed the pasta into the sour cream mixture to make sure they were well coated.  This is was an ok start to an italian meal with friends.  I was impressed with how they looked.  I won't crave these but will keep them in my recipe box for italian themed entertaining.

These were pretty good.  My pregnant sistem in law went crazy for them.  We get something similar to this at a restaurant near our home and they are much better deep fried.

Pretty good, after reading the reviews I decided to SLIGHTLY boil the tortellini first so they wouldn't come out dry.

Sorry, but as another reviewer also stated, these were very dry, bland and unpopular with my party guests.
