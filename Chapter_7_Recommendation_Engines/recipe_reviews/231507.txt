Hooray! My kids loved these! I made a few changes: swapped 1 cup pecans for raisins, 3/4 C brown sugar for the agave nectar, cinnamon to taste, 1/4 C applesauce for oil and 1 cap of vanilla. Loved them.

These muffins smelled wonderful but tasted bland. I don't know whether the recipe omitted salt by accident or on purpose, but I think it could benefit by the addition of at least 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Note also that the original recipe actually makes 2 dozen muffins, not 1.

I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, and used sugar because I had no agave.  Also added 1/2 tsp salt, a small dash of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon.  Came out great.

These muffins turned out great!  I added 1/2 tsp of salt and walnuts to the recipe.  The recipe made 18 medium muffins for me and I baked them for 23 minutes at 375.  They were nice and moist and delicious!

I took the adevice of other reviewers  and added 1/4 teaspoon  of salt, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and plenty of cinnamon,  ginger, clove, allspice,  and touch of nutmeg. I'm diabetic and prepping meals for postpartum.  I made these even more lactation friendly by adding 1/2 cup of whole flax seeds. I substituted truvia brown sugar (6 tablespons) baking mix for the agave. I swapped 1/4 cup of steel cut oats for 1/4 cup of old fashioned oats. I reduced raisins to half cup. In half of the batch I added semi sweet mini chocolate chips (also good for lactation) I swapped out the oil with 1/2 of unsweetened  apple sauce. I made 2 trays of mini muffins and a dozen standard size muffins with this recipe. Mini muffins turned out well. I only baked them for 18 minutes. This is not very sweet, but very flavourful!

Made. These today and added salt and cinnamon but still rather bland I sprayed the inside of the muffin liners with Pam so they did not stick but now they are just falling off of them I do not recommend they are very plain I even put chocolate chips in the second batch after I realized how lame are

Just took them out of the oven. Delicious. I only used a little over 1 cup sugar and used 1 cup applesauce instead of oil. Also put in some chopped pecans and raisins.

Good, but my pumpkin spice didnâ€™t give enough flavour. Check when making. Next iMessage I would add more cinnamon and maybe some honey

They are great! I used advice from the other's comments. I even added a handful of chopped nuts to the second dozen, and I ended up with 26 total. Very nice recipe to tailor it to your own preferences.

These turned out very bland and like hockey pucks.  It could have been my fault.  I didnt have agave and read somewhere that you could substitute honey.  So thats what I did.  I did my usual alterations for high altitude since i live in Colorado.  I may try this again per siggestions from others reviews.

The muffins are  gummy,  taste like baking soda. The addition of salt and vanilla did not enhance. The cupcake paper held most of the muffin.

I made these pretty much as the recipe stands. They are moist and delicious. I didn't find them bitter as others stated and they did not stick to the muffin tin. I love that they are not TOO sweet - just right for me!!!

Yummy!  My Partner does not like Agave so I replaced it with pure maple syrup and added dark chocolate chips.  The muffins are moist and delicious.

I was looking for a healthy recipe that my daughter could take to school.  I'm not sure 4 eggs falls in to "healthy" but I guess that it is better than regular muffins. The 2 tablespoons baking powder give them a bitter flavor but not so much that they were inedible. I used coconut oil instead of canola. I think I will be looking for a new recipe for next time.

2-TABLESPOONS of baking powder (??) makes the batter taste bitter.  I even tried the recipe a second time with 2-teaspoons and still was not impressed.  The paper liners stuck to the muffins and was disappointed. :(
