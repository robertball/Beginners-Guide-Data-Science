If I could give this recipe 10 stars -- my family and I would do so.  In the past three months I have made this at least 10 times.  Specifically, we have had birthdays, holidays, and a graduation.  Plus, I I have experimented with other dark juices and they all have been phenomenal.  03/09/2020. My family still requests this recipe.  Very inexpensive.
