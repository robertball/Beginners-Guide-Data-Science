I made two batches for Mothers Day to go on Waffles.  I made one batch exactly as the recipe states.  The second, I replaced the Chambord with vanilla and the Cherry preserves with peach.  It was great!  And as my family loves peach it was a bigger hit than the original.

I made this at Christmas time and gave it away as gifts in little vintage-type jelly jars. It looked beautiful and I received many compliments on it. I also made little loaves of cranberry orange nut bread to accompany it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Elegant and gracious. Pretty pink color. Nice fruity flavor, with the spreading consistency of a thick yogurt. 

Put this together last night to have this morning with some crumpets I made from a recipe that a dear lady was kind enough to share, coffee with frothed milk in china mugs, pleasing company, and the below-freezing weather was forgotten.

This has absolutely fabulous flavor--a nice sweet and tart flavor.  Be sure to use really good preserves.  My only complaint was that it did become a bit grainy as it set, although it didn't hinder the flavor.  It stays very soft; it would have been nice to have been able to mold it into a round in order to freeze it.  It does make an awful lot, so it can be cut in half with plenty to go around.

This was too sweet for my taste!  However, I do plan to play with the recipe a bit until I get it *just right*.  For me, I think that will mean less cherry preserves and less powdered sugar.  Also maybe regular cream cheese instead of the reduced fat version.  I would like less sweetness and more of a butter consistency.  When I made this, hubby compared the texture to yogurt, and I agreed.

This was REALLY good.  Not TOO sweet because I hald back a little on the sugar.  We had it on Baked French Toast.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
