This recipe is delicious! I added garlic powder on every level for a little extra flavor, and used mozzarella cheese in place of swiss (I also bought the pre-shredded cheese to reduce prep time).  We will definitely have this one again!

Save yourself the trouble and just make scalloped potatoes with ham and serve broccoli on the side. It will be much better! (This one didn't do it for me.)

This was extremely good.  I added a bit of onion and used shredded cheddar cheese because that was the only kind I had.  Served it with some rolls and it was wonderful.

After a five year hiatus I have been persuaded to return to the "trade", albeit to teach a Culinary Arts course at a Community College. I tell students that in all faculties there are rules and there are diversions, and in diversions we find creativity. Technically Lasagna is a flat noodle; basically it is a starch used to bind (hold together) in layers and the potato resemblance in this creation achieves that purpose. The ingredients used here are substantial and the only caution I will offer is to suggest that a firm waxier potato (like Yukon Gold) be used, otherwise this recipe offers flavour, cosistency and imagination. It works well!

We really like this recipe and it is very easy.  I was skeptical of the jarred Alfredo sauce, but it was good, and the whole family likes it.

This is delicious and fairly easy to make! For more flavor try making your own alfredo sauce. I'd also recommend preparing the recipe as described but cutting some additional pieces of ham into thin strips layering that with the potatoes.

Yes, this is not Lasagna, but then Cowboy Caviar is not really caviar is it?  Just a play on words as far as I'm concerned.  That said, this is a hearty comfort food that my family loved. I made some changes based on other reviews. Made my own sauce and used low fat (and less) cheese, as well as skim milk to help with the fat content.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This was Awsom !
I made to exactly as written with ham and added 1/2 finely diced onion. It was so good my Husband (who never packs lunch) asked for some for his lunch the next day. He also asked to make it again real soon!

This was easy and delicious. I added spinach and only wish the parm had melted better but it was still great! It is different too so I added it to my standard cooking list!

This is a good solid recipe as is, and could be revised to fit any preference or lifestyle.  I used more broccoli and a lo-cal alfredo sauce.  Very enjoyable!

This really is not lasagna in texture..i mean we are working with potatoes. I really did love it though.I cant say enough good things about this. Such warm comfort food. I think the results vary depending on the quality of sauce you use. I used an amazing sauce, added some fresh garlic,fresh brocolli flowerets, an italian blend cheese and onion powder. My family loved this meal, and i will definately make it again.

Delicious!  In place of ham and swiss cheese,  try italian sausage and mozarella, or a blend of both.  All who have tried this recipe are surprised by its great flavor.

This was wonderful!!!  My husband who has a very limited taste palet says "This is some good stuff!".  I'm not sure what everyone is griping about the lots of work?  It was really easy and we ate it for 2 days.  I made mine in my large cast iron skillet.  It was really pretty and will make it for company.

Another reviewer described it exactly as I feel. Tasted like scalloped potatoes with ham and broccoli. Was not worth the trouble.

I switched the ham for smoked sausage (personal taste preference), and sliced it and the potatoes fairly thin. I also homemade Alfredo sauce, which i make for pasta regularly. I then layerd them with swiss cheese slices (couldn't find shredded) until reaching the top. A few major problems with the outcome. 1: it was super greasy. There was literally grease pouring over the sides. Disgusting. 2: the way that the recipe recommends adding the potatoes didn't allow them to thoroughly cook through. They couldn't be cut through and ended up making serving a mess. 3. The taste was.... okay--for the first few bites. But then the swiss cheese and alfredo sauce and grease just over powered everything. It was way to rich. IF I were to try this recipe again , I would boil the potatoes at least part of the way through, and switch to a different cheese. It seems to be a good idea, but this recipe could use some work.

We really enjoyed this dish. I did add garlic to the Alfredo sauce, I used leftover ham from earlier this week, and I had smoked Swiss cheese that I used instead of regular Swiss. Definitely will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very good and easy meal!  I changed mine a little though.  I added cubed chicken instead of ham, and a little more of the seasonings.  I added a couple garlic cloves also.  It took no time to make, and it was even better the next day!!

Pretty good, my mom loved it, she said it was a 5, my dad on the other hand only thought it was only alright. I thought it was good but lacked a bit of flavor. I think bacon would give it more flavor. I will definately try it again and add more cheese. This is  a good dish for brunch.

I've made this recipie several times - each time varying the ingredients a little.  I've used turkey or ham, fresh broccoli vs. frozen, chopped onion and garlic, mozzerella and swiss cheeses.  With the right spices and a good flavorful Alfredo sauce, this dish can rock.  Kids love it too!

I used homemade alfredo because the jarred stuff is just nasty.  Added some garlic to the alfredo.  Recipe was okay.  We all ate it, and got full....but it isn't something we'll be craving to have again.  Probably won't make again.

We thought this was delicious! I added some spinach and used a roasted red pepper Alfredo sauce. The only thing I would change is I will leave the salt out next time, the ham has plenty. I will be making this again though.

I thought this was a nice little recipe. I can't really review the exact recipe though because i changed a few things for what I had on hand. I used asparagus chopped up (instead of broccoli), store-cooked rotisserie chicken (instead of ham or smoked turkey), and for cheeses I substituted the Parmesan with cheddar and the swiss with mozzarella. Those cheeses were cheaper and I thought they might go better with potatoes and Alfredo. It was pretty good!

My family loved this. I added 4 slices of cooked turkey bacon to the ham/broccoli mix, and it was delicious.

My husband liked it better than I.  I used more Swiss cheese - 1 pound & about 10 ounces of fresh brocolli crowns chopped instead of frozen chopped brocolli.  I thought it wasn't flavorful enough.

First, I don't buy alfredo sauce so I made my own using another recipe from this site(which may have been this recipe's demise).  Although the sauce tasted great when first made I think the sauce seperated during the cooking process resulting in a "clumpy" not creamy dish.  Either that or it was the swiss cheese. I can't tell which. I may go out and make my first purchase of store-bought alfredo sauce and try this again b/c I think this dish has potential. Either that or I'll try a different kind of cheese.

This turned out basically like scalloped potatoes but it was still delicious! (I didn't add broccoli so that may be why). I also used 4 cheese alfredo sauce and evaporated milk/water mixture because I was out of milk. Will definitely make again but probably just as a side, not as a main dish.

I really wanted to love this, but it was only ok. I think the jarred Alfredo sauce is what made it have an "off" taste. I think the brand I usd was maybe too salty with the combination of salty ham. I would make it again, but maybe a homemade Alfredo sauce. The Swiss cheese is really a good flavor to add!

I made this for the first time for the first dinner party at my new apartment. My parents and my best friend loved it, as did I! I did make some minor changes though. 
I used garlic alfredo sauce which definitely helped with the flavor. If you have regular alfredo sauce, I definitely recommend following previous reviewers advice and adding garlic powder to each layer. 
I had the hardest time finding diced ham! So instead I fried up thick slices of bacon (keeping them as fat and juicy as possible) and cut them into nickel sized pieces.
Also, I'm vegetarian. So instead of combining the meat, cheese, and broccoli all together, I actually just mixed the cheese and broccoli first, then set a little more than 1/2 cup of it aside. I mixed the meat in with the rest. So half of the dish had bacon, the other half did not. Still very tasty and very easy to separate! 
Finally! I felt that the top was kind of wet looking with all the alfredo sauce, so I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese for the last 15 minutes. Added a nice flavor and a very pretty coloring!

This is a flavour winner. If you use 1% milk I suggest reducing the liquid a little. I used fresh broccoli and it was cooked just right after at hour.

This is very good and very easy if you have a food processor.  It does take a long time to get the potatos done enough.  I mix all ingredients together, use italian blend cheese instead of swiss and microwave for the first 15 minutes or so to cut down on the cooking time.  This is my kids favorite meal and my husband and I enjoy it too!

I love this recipe.  I originally chose to make it because I had some leftover ham to use, and had all of the other ingredients.  It sounded kind of weird, but I'm so glad I decided to try it.  I've made it several times now, and the whole family loves it.  This would be great for brunch, too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I can see what this recipe wants to be...I really can.  I did not happen for me, though!  I tried to lighten the recipe up a little using low fat alfredo sauce and skim milk.  I ended up with a runny, separated, very unappetizing looking entree.  Probably my fault for using lighter ingredients, but I'm not willing to try again.

This is the absolute best thing you can serve at Easter dinner! I cooked it this morning, and my husband was dying to try it after smelling it cooking in the oven! I used Vermont's Dakin Spiral Sliced Ham, which alone is incredible, along with a 10oz frozen package of chopped spinach, and a jar of Classico's Roasted Garlic Alfredo Sauce, and also used 1/2% milk in the recipe... turned out great, thanks for the recipe homemaker!! :)

I tried this recipe to use up some leftovers I had.  I was a little leery of if because I just couldn't imagine what it would be like, but my family loved it.  I pretty much ate the entire container of leftovers in the next few days.  I made it just as it was written and would definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

First of all thanks for this recipe.  I have made it several times but because I don't always have the exact ingredients it is a bit different each time.  Last time I used cooked cut up sausage links instead of diced ham.  The cheese is always mexican mix grated cheese and I always forget to add the parmesan.  My family call it my killer potato dish.  Thanks again

We loved this dish!  The only thing different was that my jar of Alfredo sauce was 14 oz., so I used all of it and only 2/3 cup of milk.  It was still very creamy.  Lots of prep work, but totally worth it.

This was very good but a lot of work.  I think next time I will simply cube the potatos and mix all together rather than layering.  The potatos weren't done enough for us.

This was very easy to make. I even added more veges and green onions on top for more flavor.
But my family did not like it at all, they thought it was much to bland and hated the sauce.We would not make this again. Sorry

As an alternative, I used a can of clam chowder instead of alfredo sauce.  It turned out great and we couldn't really even taste the clam chowder.  We also added cooked polish sausage instead of ham, as well as crumbled bacon, and used cheddar/monterey jack shredded cheese instead of swiss, then covered the top with sliced american cheese.  As is typical of potato casserole dishes, the potatoes weren't cooked through (despite slicing the potatoes very thin using a mandolin) and we ended up microwaving the servings to fully soften the potatoes.

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed directions (almost) to the letter, except my pkg of broccoli was a tad larger, and the cubed ham I pulled from my freezer measured a bit more, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  My husband and I loved it!  I put the potato slices in my salad spinner to get rid of as much of the water they soaked in as possible.  The dish turned out perfect...not soupy and not dry.  This is definitely going into my recipe box to make again and again!

With a few tweaks, this recipe is delicious!  Here's what I do: put a little sauce in the bottom of the pan and layer 1/2 potatoes.  Sprinkle with pepper, garlic salt and parmesan.  Put 1/2 broccoli and ham over that and then put 1/2 the cheese over that (USE SMOKED GOUDA-ITS AMAZING).  Pour 1/2 the sauce over that and repeat the process.  Bake as directed.  The addition of the garlic salt and the substitution of the smoked gouda makes this dish truly wonderful.  Oh, and it really is better if you use FRESH steamed broccoli and 1/4 inch thick ham stake (diced).  Enjoy!

This tasted pretty good but I don't think the end result was worth the extensive prep. I may try making again and see if I can sneak a few shortcuts in. I like the idea of using frozen hashbrowns or something similar as one reviewer mentioned. I would also like a bit stronger flavors and more seasoning. Maybe onions, garlic, bacon, a sharper cheese? This is a recipe that I really like the idea of but needs some tweaks to make it 5 stars.

I made this recipe on Sunday and we just had the leftovers for dinner last night (Tuesday). The leftovers were just as good as the first meal! So yummy! My husband and I both really liked this recipe! It is a bit labor intensive with the cutting off the potatoes but I thought it was worth it! I used mozzerella cheese instead of swiss and followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used a little garlic salt on each layer, too. Instead of the ham, I used small pieces of turkey bacon. Turkey bacon is PERFECT for this recipe! My husband who doesn't like turkey as a substitute for anything, really liked it in this recipe! Will definitely make again!

I cut my potatoes into crinkled coins and they were cooked perfectly.  We all liked this dish, until we hit the brick wall.  There just came a point when we all stopped eatting because it no longer seemed tasty.  I know it sounds weird.  Maybe it was just too rich to be served as a meal

Excellent idea.  Tasted great.  Used the extra garlic powder as suggested, used leftover baked chickhen, and sharp cheese. (didn't have all the recipe called for, and this sounded really good)  Didn't bother with the veggies as baked ones don't taste too good. Great tasting. Will make it again.

This was very good but a little too rich for a meal by itself...I will make it again but have it as a side dish with smaller portions.  Otherwise, very yummy :)

I do something similar with scalloped potatoes, I didn't care for the jarred Alfredo. I used a "cream of" soup. My choice was mushroom,added ham and added fresh mushrooms instead of broccoli. And substituted Swiss for the cheese. My family loved it!

The dish is great! 
honestly, i didn't even expect that it will be so tasty! I substituted ham for pre-fried chicken fillet pieces and made Alfredo sauce myself, so it was all natural!

Boiled the potatoes to cut the cook time. Made my own Alfredo. Really enjoyed the fragrance and the food.

I used mozarella cheese instead of the shredded swiss cheese.  The hotdish curdled--would try the swiss  next time.  It was very tasty tho.

This is a wonderful dish and the jar of alfredo sauce makes this an easy and quick dish to make!  This would be an impressive pot luck dish.

Really good, but I think next time I will add more broccoli and ham.  It is a nice change from other dishes!

I really liked this!  I added half an onion, minced, and a quarter tsp. of garlic powder; I used sharp cheddar instead of Swiss cheese. I'll make it again.

OMG!!  What a good recipe!  I had some homemade alfredo that was made earlier in the week and I used 3 kinds of cheese--Parmesan, mild cheddar, and mild Swiss.  I also used cream instead of the milk(it's just what I had on hand), and fresh broccoli.  Family approved.

I absolutely loved this dish! Potatoes also happen to be my favorite food. Since I don't like broccoli, I substituted chopped spinach like other reviewers. I used a little less Swiss cheese to save a few calories. I only did two layers because that's just easier and doesn't affect the taste. Because some reviewer's mentioned bacon, I choose to use the new Prego Alfredo sauce flavored with savory bacon and still used the ham as my meat. I honestly think I could eat this every single night!

This recipe has been in my recipe box since February 2011 -and- I just received a boatload of fresh dug potatoes - great combination for trying this recipe.  I admit to changing a few things.  For starters I made 'Basic Béchamel Sauce' from AR instead of using store bought Alfredo sauce.  I also did not peel the potatoes, I just scrubbed them really well and sliced.  I knew this recipe was going to make a lot, so I divided it into 3 casserole dishes and shared 2 of them with family members.  Mine baked at 350° covered for 1 hour and uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.  It had quite a bit of liquid when I removed it from the oven, but letting it rest for 10 minutes took care of that.  This is a nice dish that compared to ham and scalloped potatoes with broccoli added.  I served this with homemade applesauce and 'Garlic-Cheese Flat Bread' from AR.
