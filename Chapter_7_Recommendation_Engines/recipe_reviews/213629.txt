This is the basic recipe, and it's good; I hope you enjoyed your stay in Guam!  But awesome finadene' requires a bit more effort.  Why use vinegar when there is lemon juice?  Even lemon powder is better than vinegar.  And what kind of vinegar: white, cider or the Filipino spiced brand? Why take out the seeds -- there's the kick?  Add some green onions for color.  Don't you want a bit of chopped garlic for flair?  There's so much to do with the versatile finadene'.   This recipe is limited, but okay in a crunch! Especially when you're so far away from Guam!  I'm glad finadene is a beautiful memory of Guam for you!!!

Subbed lemon juice for the vinegar. Chile pepper bring just the right amount of heat.

I grew up eating Chamorro food since I am Chamorro. You can use lemon or limes instead of vinegar as well for a better taste, also add green onions or regular onions...

Your receipe is exactly what I was looking for. My brother used to make this with his Spam and rice when he was hungry, I've been trying for years to recreate it after he passed away but kept forgetting what it was called.

I think lemon and garlic sound great but it is really a matter of preference. I use garlic and limes a lot so for me the basic recipe is just right :)
