Very good and different - I definitely adjusted the ingredients.  I used half the amount of mayo (used Hellman's lite), only 1 Tbsp. of relish, and  upped the chile-garlic sauce to 1 tsp. I also added a little salt and cracked black pepper.  Next time I might increase the chile-garlic sauce if I'm feeling a little daring.

Yes, yes, yes!  Finally a tuna salad that is simple, but complex and worth a second try for sure.  Heres the thing the author says: "you can adjust ingredient amounts for a personalized taste."  I did just that.  Knowing that 1/2 C of relish would be way to much and 1/8t of Sriracha would be way to little.  I went with 1 tablespoon of both.  Sweet and savory and surprising good!  Thanks for sharing I will make this again.

I have actually added the Chili Garlic Sauce to Tuna Salad before, I used Huy Fong Foods, it still has the seeds and to me a little more kick, but the same taste!  Good recipe!

I made this with canned chicken instead of tuna and it still tasted great. I added a bit more chili sauce for more of a kick.

This sandwich is super easy to make and taste good. The chile-garlic sauce gives it a nice little kick.

I doubled this recipe. I only made one change, I used equal amounts chopped garlic dills only because I don't keep sweet relish on hand (noone in our house will eat it). Very wet tuna salad but tasty. I'd make this again but I would cut back on the mayonnaise a bit. This filled four sandwiches.

I used an olive oil and black pepper mayo because Im trying to use it up. I added 1 heaping tablespoon of Wickles ( a spicy sweet pickle mix) and just a few drops of sriracha. This is an excellent change to normal I wouldnt put eggs in it but I might add something for a little crunch. Its a texture thing not a flavor thing.

I used a tsp of sriracha and stuffed this into zucchini boats and baked it.  We're not big tuna fans, but I'll be making this again and again.

if you add some diced red onion to this, use less mayo, and crumble a hard boiled egg in with it it is super delicious :)

DEE-licious! Of course, I tweaked it a bit: used bread & butter pickles I chopped (no relish on hand), doubled the sriracha & ate open-faced on toasted homemade bread. Between me & the parrot, we finished it off (5oz can)! I'm making it again today - double it, use dill pickles (no more sweet on hand) and will add a few pickled jalapenos. This is the first tuna that I don't miss having onions & celery in! (which is why I made this recipe - I'm out of celery & onion!)

I love this! It came out a bit too wet for me so I added 2 2.6oz bags of Sweet and Spicy Tuna Creations. Will make this again but next time I'll add some hard boiled eggs.
