My only "complaint" about this recipe is that I wish it stated at what temperature to "steam" the clams.  My husband and I had quite a disagreement.  He wanted to bring it to a boil and then almost shut the heat off.  I thought it would be hot enough. Our compromise was to turn the heat to medium for about 20 minutes.  49 out of the 50 clams opened.  I was shocked to see how much liquor they make.  I thought the small amount of wine wouldn't be enough.
They were great.  Definitely have a lot of crusty bread on hand.  Linguine or some other pasta is great.  My kids were so brave about trying them.  I can't wait to make it again.  We added some fresh lemon after they were cooked and it really brought out the flavor. Delicious!
Oh, and scrub the clams really well.  I got a lot of sand and gunk off them.
THANKS for a great recipe.

This was delicious! I used roasted garlic instead of regular garlic, used a full stick of butter, and added about 2 tbsp. of clam juice. Also, the juice of one lemon and sprinkled some crushed red pepper on top!! YUMMY.

I made this for dinner for Valentine's day & they were out of this world good! I used pinot grigio both in the sauce & as an accompaniment & it went exceedingly well. I served this w/ barely buttered, toasted french bread (very good dipped in the sauce), strawberry onion salad (from this site) & the pinot grigio.  I had other courses planned & ready to eat but we enjoyed this so much that we decided to pig out on it & forego the other courses (we'll have them for dinner tonight). It was simply the best meal I have ever eaten!

Excellent recipe! Best clams we've ever had at home. We like our clams well done, so we didn't have a lot of the juice left. Next time we'll add another 1/2 cup of wine and 1 tbsp of butter half way through steaming to ensure we have more juice because the little bit of juice we did have was so yummy!!
We had this as an appetizer with white crusty baguette, so good! 
Excellent with the main course we had of Red Snapper with Orange-Almond Sauce. Adding this one into my recipe box.

This was a fantastic simple fresh recipe.  As an earlier reviewer suggested, I added a dash of oregano, a dash of red pepper flakes, and a medium can of diced tomatoes.  The tomatoes were a great addition.  Served it with pasta for a main dish (linguini).  I'm making this for Christmas Eve with shrimp, yum!

Delicious yet simple recipe! I've made this twice. Once the wine reduced, I added a can of crushed tomatoes my 2nd time around and added a bit more garlic, shallots and green onions for a fresh new taste. (cook the shallots first to get them tender) To wash clams, soak in fresh water for 20 min. then scoop up the clams (dont pour out) while the clams "breath" in the water they filter out the salty sand.

I gave this recipe a double punch after cooking with another big spritz of wine and salt/lemon. Cover and simmer one or two more minutes... its seems to bring the broth to new heights.

We make steamed clams all the time, but never quite like this. We used both little necks and the real steamer clams. (the ones with the tail) They were so excellent Scott and the broth was incredible. I took your advice Stephanie and made the italian bread from this site and used it to soak up the broth. Hubby and his buddy were inhaling them!

Great EASY recipe!  Steamed about 15-20 minutes.  Served with Ceasar Salad, corn, and garlic/butter rice.  Make sure you have some good dipping bread!  Makes a lot of juice!

Using Pinot Grigio, I made the oil-garlic-wine concoction at home. Bottled it for transport to a local oyster farm. Put mussels (no clams available that day) in aluminum foil pouches, poured a bit of wine concoction in pouches before sealing and putting on the bbq grill. Opened the pouches after 10-12 min., drizzled the contents with butter & parsley. Voila... delectable, elegant steamed mussels at a picnic! Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good! Unfortunately I didn't have any parsley and substituted butter for Benecol Light , but the flavor was great!Clams make lots of juice so have lots of crusty bread on hand! Will make again.

I ordered some blue crabs from my favorite on-line store and they sent me some clams in error. I wasn't thrilled and was not sure how to cook them but then  I found this recipe and cooked them exactly according to the directions. Wow!  I never liked clams, but do now. Great recipe! I do recommend the crusty french bread like many who have reviewed...the sauce is delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. I just made this the other day it's a great base I like to saute some shallots, a pinch of red pepper flakes and garlic together then add the wine and a bit of fresh lemon juice.  Once reduced I add the clams and 1/2 herbs. Fresh Parsley, basil and oregeno. Cover and steam. Once clams are done I add the butter and the rest of the fresh herbs. Serve with crusty bread over pasta. Yum!

This is very similar to a local dish here in Qingdao, China called 'la gala' 
I have this every couple of days, but we add a little chopped up dried red chillies, a small amount of ginger, and then sprinkle chopped coriander when the dish is finished. When done in a wok at high temperatures, we steam the clams in a very small amount of water 2 minutes & they are all open. The very quickly saute the garlic, ginger & chillies then add the drained clams back in, mix with the garlic etc for 1 minute then add reserved juices back in. Total time 5 minutes at most.

This is delicious! I have been using this recipe for over a year now and have had no complaints yet from my family! I scale down the recipe to use only a dozen clams and add a little more wine, a pinch of red pepper flakes, a teaspoon of lemon juice, more garlic (I love having a garlic taste to my food) and cook a little bit of the parsley in it to get some of its flavor (I pick the cooked parsley out after its done steaming). When I make this I also make Clam Linguni with it and poor the juice from this into the sauce. I recommend The Best Clam Sauce by Jodie B. to serve with this! A great combination!

Wow, is all I can say. Being a clam lover, I usually just steam my clams in water, but I was in the mood  to try something different. I served French bread with the broth, and it was a wise choice. I am sure that pasta would go well with it also, but the bread was the ticket. The one thing I did do differently is I put in about a 1/3 more garlic.

I have made this so many times, the first time it was because it seemed the simplest of the clam recipes and because I had all the ingredients, each time after because my family wanted to eat this again.  Be sure to have a loaf of crusty bread for dipping, the sauce leftover is heavenly.  I had a lot of sand in my clams and found out that if you put the clams in a shallow dish (I used my big casserole) with a few inches of water and let the clams sit for about twenty minutes and they will spit the sand out.

Outstanding. I have used this recipe for mussels as well as oysters. Due to personal preference I always use chicken or seafood stock, whatever's handy, instead of white wine. So good and so easy!

I was hosting a luncheon with the Superintendent, and I decided to make some Steamed Clams. I accidentally turned the heat in my oven way up, and smoke was getting everywhere. Thinking on my toes, I ran across the street to grab some hamburgers. I told the Superintendent we we're having "Steamed Hams," and he was none the wiser. Great recipe!

I made this last night as a main dish on top of whole wheat thin spagehetti and it was delicious.  I added a squeeze of lemon juice, a sprinkle of canyenne pepper, a few shrimp, and a sprinkle of fresh parmesan and ramano blend cheese  to top it all off.  I could just drink the sauce it was so good.  Like other reviews suggested, eat with plenty of crusty bread to sop up the sauce with and enjoy.

This is a great recipe.  We substitute fresh basil for the parsley.  You can throw the fresh herbs in when you add the butter or sprinkle it on top after cooking.  Believe it or not, these make a sensational dish when camping - especially if you're near the coast and can pick up some fresh ones on your way to your campsite.  This is one of our favorite Pacific Northwest camping experiences!

These were so easy and even my daughter ate two, which is a big deal. i ended up doubling the sauce because my daughter helped and didn't realize I was trying to cut the recipe in half. I did add a little more garlic cause we love garlic in my house. will be making again.

This was fantastic!  I used beer in place of the wine as it was what I had on hand.  Very simple to prepare, took little time to cook.  Served it with some angle hair pasta to make use of the yummy broth.  I also doubled the recipe.  Kids said it was just as good as clams from their favorite restaurant.

We LOOOOOOOVE this recipe.  I have made it several times and it is always perfect.  I find that I need to cook the clams for approximately 20 minutes.

So simple but oh so wonderful!  I used a St. Chappelle Special Harvest Riesling for my wine.  Served over angel hair pasta tossed with garlic and olive oil.  This is truly amazing!

WOW!!! Scott this is a keeper.
I've never made clams before, but love them when I go out. The only thing I added was some red pepper flakes and instead for lemon like some people said, I added some Mango key Lime juice.(Nellie & Joe's)--- The sauce was truly to die for!

Excellent recipe!  Be sure to serve with good bread for 'dipping'.  I doubt I'll ever order steamer clams in a restaurant again, as they never compare to this recipe that is so quick and easy to make at home.  Thanks for sharing!

I used pinot gris and thought the wine flavor was too prominent.  If I were to make this again, I would use half-cup each white wine and clam broth.  Still very good, just not a 5-star recipe for us.

Splendid recipe - the broth was sooo flavourful.  

I'd never cooked whole clams before, so didn't know how long they might take to open.  My littleneck clams took about 5 minutes. I should have added the butter around the 3-min mark, I think.  

My only other recommendation is to have wine for the sauce AND for the cook.  But I bet most of you already know that. ;)

Delicious!  I actually forgot to print this recipe out before leaving for our vacation at the Ocean.  But it was such a simple recipe that I was able to remember it!  It was soooo good!  Raw oysters and then scallops simmered in the clam broth with a huge loaf of garlic bread was superb!

This was extremely good, but the juice was EXTREMELY SALTY!  I'm not sure if the saltyness was from the clams themselves (as I only added maybe 1 tablespoon of butter to them, no extra salt).  But the clams themselves were amazing!

This recipe was so easy and so good! One important thing to note is that if you taste the broth before adding the clams, it has a rather sharp/astringent taste (regardless of the wine used)--don't worry, as you simmer that gives way to a wonderfully tasty dish. Have lots of bread on hand to soak up the broth.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.  He said 4 or 5 stars for sure... and due to the ease a preparation, I am going with 5.  I don't make a lot of shellfish at home, this recipe might change that.  I served this with garlic bread and really enjoyed it.  Next time I make it I will give it a try with pasta. I think that I will increase the liquids and then drain part of the sauce into a seperate pan and add cream and parmesean to make a psuedo clam alfredo sauce.  A little extra work, but I think will be worth the effort.  This is a keeper, Shellfish will be welcome at my dinner table again in the near future.

Mmm good. I had these with angel hair noodles and caesar salad. Yumm.  I made half the recipe and I think I might need to make more sauce next time. I'd like to eat this every week, haha! It's that yum.

My whole family loved this.  We prefer muscles, so I used them instead of clams.  The flavor reminded us of muscles we had at a Restaurant in Paris.  We thought the "sauce" could use a little salt.  Next time I make these I will make that adjustment.

fantastic!!!!!!!!  I had never had clams nor had I ever attempted to make them.  My husband had been wanting them and New Years Eve I made him this recipe.  I loved it, he was raving, better than any restaurant.  Thank You so much for this recipe.

Just like in the restaurant!  
Bought a bag of New Zealand Cockle clams from Costco yesterday (5 lbs!) and I came here, old faithful, to search for a tasty clam recipe.    We tried Scott Ure's and it was sooo goo-ood.   This reminds me of those steamer buckets in NYC's South St Seaport. 
The broth was tasty without being saturated in fat.  It was just the right amount of butter.  I thought it might have needed salt but not at all necessary.  This recipe allows you to enjoy the taste of fresh clams in the shell.     
Since I still have half the bag left - I know what I'll be making tonight.  Will probably throw some some more herbs in there too.

Oh yeah, not bad, oh yeah.  Liquid a little too thin, but yummy flavor.  Served with garlic bread; wasn't filling enough for pudgy hubbie and ugly mother-in-law.  Oh no, oh no.  Not so great, not terrible.  Next time would make thicker sauce, oh yeah oh yeah, that was the problem, come to think about it.  Little Anoose didn't complain.  No complaints = oh yeah, oh yeah.  Pudgy hubbie's never full anyway, so = oh yeah, oh yeah.

Simply WONDERFUL! I added a pinch of cayenne oregano beofore reducing my Luna d' luna white wine, and i'll tell you..the broth was just heavenly.  My husband is usually nothing but a miserable old gasbag all the time on the couch with his football and chips, but man, the hair on the back of his neck stood up for this one! I think he'll even clean the garage later! It's about time he got that old rowing machine out of there.

All I can say was the broth was wonderful!  But I screwed up by using BIG clams vs. small.  So I couldn't even enjoy the clams cause they were so darn chewy.  Make sure you get the right kind of clams.  But I gave it 4 stars cause I believe that if I had the right clams it would have been a dream to eat.

Enjoy!

Tried this for the first time tonight. It was fabulous. I wouldn't change a thing. Served with Angel Hair pasta and french bread for sopping up that delicious liquid. The key is to watching for those clams to open ... when they open up they are like popcorn popping. ... get them out so they don't over cook or they'll be tough.

Yum! Never liked clams. My huisband bought some and asked if I would cook them up. Didn't know how. Found this recipe and am thankful I did. A new clam fan within me and my husband said that these were the best he ever had!

Awesome it tasted like the clams at my favorite seafood resturant in San Francisco. A little wedge of lemon on the side made the flavor really pop.

Great recipe. I wanted to try a new way of preparing clams and came across this recipe. I used only 1 dozen clams, and we didn't have the fresh parsley on hand, but I used some mrs. Dash garlic and herb  powder in the oil, and It came out excellent! We ate them solo, but next time I plan to try over pasta. I recommend.

I make this recipe all the time.  I add 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to infuse the garlic while it is simmering.  When clams are done I strain the broth through a tight strainer or cheesecloth to keep out any sand grit.  Lastly, I add a touch of tomato paste for color and depth in the sauce, add 1 tablespoon of butter and swirl and fresh chopped parsley - -  and then when I pour the clams into a bowl, I wet a dish towel, put it in the microwave for 1 minute, pour the sauce over the clams and cover with the hot wet towel to keep the clams hot and steamy until everyone is ready to eat! 
Mangia!

WOW!! In no time at all I made a fantastic meal that in a high end restaurant can cost big  $$$!! Throw in a rented movie and you have a really great evening with friends that saves $$$ AND the meal is perfect..this recipe was so good that my pals all wanted to make it at their home as well...next time I'll enjoy it at THEIR house...unless I make it at home first and eat it all myself!  Really great...thanks

Excellent and easy at-home recipe! Mine were a little salty so I will try it with unsalted butter next time, but the flavors were still great and I sopped up as much leftover liquid as I could with some sourdough bread. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe! A five star restaurant in our town makes this dish, with two additions that make a truly phenominal recipe. First is to add 1/4 cup of lemon juice after the clams finish cooking, and second is to add 1/2 cup of thinly sliced onions to the wine while it is reducing.  Thanks you for a fantastic recipe!

Simple yet sooooo delicious.  Made this for a late night snack for the guys while they were outside smoking cigars.  I won't have to buy the next bags, the guys are all going to be taking turns bringing me bags as long as I promise to use this recipe.  I didn't really follow your amounts since I made a larger amount, but I don't think it matters.  Your ingredients and cooking instructions were perfect for "fool proof" clams.  So simple anyone can make it.  Thanks Scott--really loving the clams. :)

Great!  I like more lemon, and next time I'll use a more stout white wine than the Chardonnay I had on hand.  VERY IMPORTANT - put the butter in earlier - the person who said that once they are open, get them off the heat was right.

Best clam recipe ever!!! I made about 50 large clams with this recipe (so I doubled it since the recipe is for small clams) and they tasted just as good as from a restaurant!!! Fantastic!!!! Thank you for this very tasty recipe!!! :)

These were awesome! I made a dozen for myself and I regretted not making more! I added lemon and salt at the end and made thick sliced garlic bread to go with it, as that's what I had on hand, but I love garlic so was good for me! Simple, quick and mmm, mmm, GOOD! Five Stars!

Yum! This was a great recipe for steaming clams. We also threw in mussels and it was so delicious. I added in some roughly chopped green onion and tomato when we added the clams and mussels. It was just something we enjoyed from a restaurant once and I had the items on hand. This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. My 4 year old son LOVED them. Steamers have always been a regular thing here since we live right on the NH seacoast but we usually just steam them with water, nothing fancy... Just dipped in clarified butter. These were so great, I will never make them any other way again. I used steamers bought at the grocery store because everyone else was closed but next time I will get them nice and fresh from the fish market.

Made this last night... me and BF loved it and it was sooooo simple. Basically followed the recipe but added red pepper flakes to the oil & garlic. Also added a couple lemon wedges and juice when I added the wine. Used cooking wine since that's all I had and it was still great. Will definitely make again and again!

Wow!  What a yummy dish this turned out to be.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used dried and it was just FINE!  Also, I didn't have as much broth as I wanted so at the end I added some bottled clam juice - just enough to get it to the amount that I wanted.  And if you would like it to have a little bit of kick, add a little bit of dried pepper flakes.  My husband (the real cook in the family) loved this dish.

This recipe was the best. Well after dinner my girlfriend and I just savored the feeling of happiness this recipe creates. The best advice is get a good crusty bread to dip in the liquor. It could be a meal in itself. This was my first time trying to make any kind of shell fish. It ended up being super easy!

What a deliciously simple recipe!  I love throwing this together as either a side for steak or as an entree on its own.  For the wine, I use either Pinot Grigio or Chenin Blanc.  And this recipe is just as tastey with mussels or a combo of both clams and mussels.

For those wanting an easier cooking method, take the clams and put them on a hot grill.  Let them sit for a few minutes until opened.  Then take a tsp of the butter/garlic sauce and drizzle over the clam  (make sure meat side is down).  Cook it for another minute, remove them with tongs not spilling any of that juice, and eat immediately.  Then take a good crusty bread and soak up any left over juices on your plate.  And if you are lucky, dig up your own cherrystone clams like I do.  Fresh is best.

My husband & I had clams at a dutch pub recently and we loved it so much that we decided to try it at home. The recipe is so easy to cook and we think that it was actually better than the ones we had at the pub. We used a good sauvignon blanc and had crusty french bread with it. the only trouble is with scrubbing the clams clean.. Will def be making this again.

This recipe made a fantastic clam dish.  I prepared this for three people over pasta.  The meal was light yet still very flavorful - a very nice contrast to a more typical clam dish with heavy sauces, etc.  I used only 1/2 the garlic indicated and a good sauvignon blanc.  The next time I prepare this recipe, I'll add most of the parsley a couple of minutes before I remove the pot from the stove to soften it.

We had this last night with crusty bread and Seared Sea Scallops. I put the clams in a big pasta bowl for each person. Looked great, smelled great, and tasted GREAT! I did not modify the recipe at all. I didn't need any tweeking.  Very good!

This was a really good recipe. I had to subsitute the clams for mussels due to the fact that I'm poor and they don't have that at the commmissary. But the recipe still turned out excellent. I tossed the mussels in a linguene pasta. Yum!

This was really excellent!  I am so glad I made it.  I am a veteran clam cooker, so I'll share my observations/changes.  I used 50 little neck clams.  I used about 9 cloves of garlic.  I saw other reviewers used red pepper flakes, so I added 1/2 fresh minced jalapeno pepper which I sauteed with the garlic.  

I added 2 cups seafood broth from a carton and brought the heat to high for about 2 minutes to reduce to about 1/3.

Reduced heat to medium and added the clams.  I usually steam clams with some liquid at fairly high heat.  Keeping these at medium heat increased the cooking time (duh).  I covered the pot and waited from them to start opening - about 10 minutes.  Added the butter (4 tbsp),  stirred and covered for probably another 8 minutes.   

Then added 1/2 cup chopped parsley, 1/4 snipped fresh chives, and the juice of 1/2 lemon.

Excellent!  Served with a loaf of crusty french bread toasted in the oven for a bit.  Loved it.  DH loved it.

This served 2 with leftovers; could have served 3 reasonable people.

This is a great recipe, thanks Scott!

I live in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, and I say these clams, for only 17,000VND kg. ($0.80US) was a great deal! So, I looked for a quick and easy recipe and I found this one. One problem here is that a bottle of wine is very expensive with import fees and more. So, I looked for a replacement for wine. I learned that grape juice (red or white) can be used and that adding a teaspoon of vinegar to it would give it that "wine" flavor. I did just that and followed the rest of the recipe. Everything worked well and, yes, I kept the liquid at a low boil and could see that the steam was just going everywhere. The flavor was more than wonderful! The smell of the food was more than enticing. It "looked" very good as well. So, my Vietnamese friend, who told me that does not like clams at all, tried them and she just loved them! THAT is a real tribute to the recipe!

I strongly recommend this recipe and, as was stated in other reviews, the liquid from the clams keeps enough of the liquids going and ALL of the clams opened! So, bon appetit!

This was so good that my brother was slurping the left over liquid afterwards. I did 1.5x the recipe and it worked great. I steamed them on medium for 15 minutes and all 75 clams opened. Just for future reference, 75 clams is about 2.5 pounds. The woman at the fish market gave me a weird look when I asked for 75 clams.

Amazing!!!! I did follow other reviewer's advice and I sautéed shallots with the garlic. I also added a half a stick of butter and lemon. And added oregano and some crushed red pepper flakes during the cooking. At the end a little Himalayan sea salt and it was wonderful!!Definitely don't leave out the crusty French bread. the best part was dipping it in the yummy broth!!

4 stars as-is. I made a few additions. Added a pinch of oregano and basil to the wine and garlic. After the clams opened, I threw in about 1/4t crushed red pepper and a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Prep and cooking instructions are spot on! Served over egg noodles.

NOTE:  I used mussels (no clams available).  It's easy - quick - delicious!!  Make sure you have no distractions when cooking as the clams/mussels cook quickly once they're added.  They were a big hit, even after they cooled off. This recipe's a keeper!

Used butter to saute the garlic and some green onions & added a little red pepper flakes, but other than that followed this receipe to a T and it was great! Should add that if you use softshell or steamer clams, you should soak them in saltwater (must use kosher or sea) for about 2 hours to get rid of the grit. Hardshell clams just need to be rinsed and scrubbed with a brush. Excellent recipe! I will definiately make again! :)

soak clams for 20 minutes in water before cooking so that they can spit out the sand.  Scrub shells and throw into to pot. Cook them for about 5 minutes or until they open. Very good.

I followed the recipe exactly but didn't think there was enough flavor. I added salt, extra garlic, and 2 tablespoons of cream and it tasted a lot better.

Used 150 little neck clams! A stick of butter, good white wine, and I used McCormick's California Style Garlic Powder that had parsley in it....also added a lil chili powder. Added 2 lbs of shrimp and some andouille sausage. Put everything in a big disposable tin pan covered with foil and let steam on the grill until the shrimp were done and clam opened....delicious! Used the broth in the bottom of the pan for dipping crusty bread. Just amazing!

I used this recipe to steam my clams because I had never done so before and this looked easy enough. I was going to bake them after for my bf (as I don't eat seafood) I didn't have white wine so I used a light beer. The "broth" smelled so good and I set the bowl aside for my bf to do what he wanted to with the broth. He was dipping bread in it...potato pancakes, his baked clams...whatever he could dip in it. Thanks so much for making this easy for me and such a good treat for my bf!

Wow, these are restaurant quality as they are! They really allow the clam flavor to be the star. Yum.
However, what made them even better were a few changes... I sauteed a 1/2 cup of chopped yellow onions with the garlic and it gave the tad of sweetness it needed. I also added 1/2 cup of clam juice after reducing the wine, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (or more for an extra kick) and garnished it with the chopped parsley AND the zest of one lemon. My family ate it with freshly baked french bread and it was heavenly. Thanks for this recipe!

I ended up overcooking mine just a bit because my young children were going to eat them with us and I was worried about undercooking, so they were a little chewy, but even considering that, the flavor was wonderful.  The sauce was plentiful and delicious, I will make this again, and I won't cook them so long.  My husband was so impressed, it's the first time I cooked clams and it was a big hit!

Wonderful recipe! Thank you! I recommend sticking to the recipe, because I made 25 clams one day and another 25 the following day.  The first time, I free-poured my wine (oops! more than called for), and I also added water because I wanted more liquid for the broth.  It came out ok, but not quite right.  So the next day, I stuck to the recipe, without adding any water, and it tasted perfect.  I didn't have any parsley on hand, but it still was delicious.  There is indeed less broth than I would have liked in this recipe.  If you are like me, and like to have more broth, buy a jar of clam juice and add it to the pot.  In the past, I've also shucked clams to eat raw and used the clam liquor in my pot of steamed clams (use any saved liquor within one or two days!!).

This is a great recipe.  My grocery store didn't have clams, but they did have mussels, so I used those. I also added some diced tomatoes for a little color.  Next time I will definitely add a little more garlic, though. Tossed the mussels with linguine and then served topped with "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" from this site.  Delish!

This was good.  A nice, simple way to prepare clams.  There wasn't any significant flavor, but it did bring out the flavor of the clams nicely.  I used pinot grigio for the wine and served with wheat toast.

This was very good, our supermarket was out of clams, so had to use mussels as a replacement, but nevertheless the sauce and cooking method worked well for those shellfish as well.   thanks for sharing this recipe.

I thought this would be a good recipe to try since I've never eaten let alone cooked clams and it sounded tasty so I may not be the review to look at if you already know you love clams. But I wasn't thrilled. I used a resling white wine and I think I should have tried something dryer, and my husband and I both thought the sauce should have been a little thicker so it could stick to the pasta and not spray all over the place.

This was easy to prepare and tasted almost as good as a traditional white clam sauce.   I only had two dozen clams on hand, but I added a can of baby clams (with juice) to make extra sauce to go with linguine. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.

What a wonderful recipe!!  So simple and elegant and delicious.  I used about a dozen large clams instead of the 50 small ones, and it worked out perfectly.  I will make this again and again!!

This recipe was magikal. In every sense of th word; quick, easy, newbie friendly, I was even able to substitute champagne for white wine, it was all I had left over from New Years, and it was fabulous! Every single clam opened, and I had never steamed clams before. I also left it on about medium heat through the steaming process, they were all opened in about 15 mins. served with aspargus and almonds steamed in a lemone butter sauce. I also threw in a fres sprig of rosemary and dill in the pot, delicious! I will certainly be making this again!

Awesome recipe.  Quick, easy and delicious.  I served it with fresh Italian bread right out of the oven for sopping up the wonderful juices and a simple green salad...my husband said it was all of 5 stars! Thank-you.

This is outstanding! The first "real live" clam recipe I ever prepared. When I made this I made 2 batches, 1 w/ live clams and 1 w/ canned because I just wasn't sure about the real clams. I had made both red and white clam sauce w/ canned before that was very good. This recipe ruined me on canned clams. The fresh was so tasty that the canned wasn't eaten. Yummy! we make this every time fresh clams are available. Thank you Scott!

Love this recipe!  We make it a meal by getting the 5 lb. back of clams from Costco & a loaf of sourdough bread!  Two of us can eat all the clams & the great sauce!

This COULD HAVE been great, but, as a first timer at clams, I didn't realize that one, you need to use little or middle neck clams; Two, they absolutely must be purged in saltwater first to get rid of the sand. I did not know these things, and I ended up with the most repulsive steamer clams! We threw the entire dish away, for there was no saving them. As I said, with a more thorough recipe, it may have been wonderful.

Just like I've eated in the finer restaurants.  Unfortunately I didn't know that you purchased the clams live, so I had a pretty hard time eating them and doubt I'll make this again.  But if you can live with yourself for cooking these, this recipe is delish!

Shopping list amount for the clams is wrong.  When you send your spouse to the store and expect 50 clams and get 7 there will be a problem.  Other than that, great.

Absolutely wonderful!  Nade it last Sunday for the first time.  I usually use cooking wine but decided to splurge and used a cheap bottle of "real" chablis.  We had it with linguini and bread. Fantastic!  Clams were on sale today so guess what we're having tonight?  Thanks Scott!

A great recipe! We use this recipe along with some variations.  We live by ocean and often go claming when we go out on the boat. So the cost is not a factor but if I had to buy them - always in the shell fresh garlic is also a must.  In addition to the broth we melt butter with a little lemon and FRESH garlic (always a must in any recipe) and dunk the clams in the butter mixture as well (sort of like you do with lobster).  Cooked Bacon is also a nice added flavor.  We actually have to stop our 3 year old from eating too many!

Great recipe!  I use 6 very large cloves of garlic.  My husband and 15 yr.-old son love this recipe, as do all I have made it for.  I could just have a loaf of crusty bread and the broth for dipping for dinner and I would be happy!!!

I'll stick with just steaming my clams, using butter & fresh lemon juice for dipping. Though my Japanese guests thought they were excellent.

Scott "Ure" doing something right! Since honeymooning in Maui I have longed to make steamed clams as good as the ones we had there. This recipe is perfectly balanced - allowing one to appreciate the wonderful flavor of the clams. Thanks for sharing your secret!

Thanks so much for this delicious recipe that's so easy to make! They steamed open a lot faster than I thought they would, though, so next time I'll take them out sooner. The sauce was excellent for dipping bread.

Scott, "Ure" my hero!  So simple, so delicious! I took another user's suggestion and added salt and lemon. The lemon gave it an extra "yum" kick, but will leave out the salt next time though. I gave it a "generous" cup of Robert Mondavi Riesling and also threw in 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes.  Will use finely chopped japenos next time--I like my foods spicy!! No Italian bread to be found here, but a bagette did the trick just fine. I will never have to order this dish from a restaurant again ... unless I'm feeling lazy!!

I just made this about an hour ago this late aftternoon.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Came out kinda salty.  Enough to make me try and figure out what went wrong.  How do you not get a salty clam sauce.  I purged the clams in tap water for 1.5 hours.  Scrubbed them clean and followed recipe.  Any help, please, would be tremendously appreciated.

It is a good recipe but I am from New England, Cape Cod originally from Martha's Vineyard, these are Quahogs we do not call them clams.  I added Portuguese Linguisa instead of Hillshire farm sausage if you want and added kick you can add the spicier Portuguese sausage Chourico!!

This is the first time making steamed clams.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought 1/2 cup of parsley was too much.  Next time I will reduce it to 1/4 cup.  I will also soak the clams instead of just rinsing them to remove more of the salt. The broth was very good.  I used Pinot Grigio wine and added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  I steamed the clams for 6 minutes on high.  The broth was great for dunking the crusty Italian bread.

I made this with small clams and the broth was so good we drank it at the end! Not that there was much but a few teaspoons would have been great with crusty bread if we had some, I also made it with a slice of lemon squeezed in (1 wedge, not too much!) and poured it on fresh grilled swordfish and tuna which I grilled only with salt, pepper and olive oil. A keeper for sure!

soooo good!   You don't need to change a thing.  I used a chardonnay and followed the recipe.  I was worried that it would not be enough liquid to steam the clams, but it was plenty!  The fresh parsley at the end was great!

I made this and my wife loved it. She has been eating steamers longer than I and her folks always made them with beer. She now wants me to make them at all family events going forward.

I did make one change, instead of 1 cup of wine I did 3/4s and 1/4 of Sherry. DELICIOUS!

Delicious, easy and quick! I'm definitely going to make this again! the only differences was adding 1 onion with the garlic as  well as a hand full of cherry tomatoes (sliced in half) once I add the wine. It adds a bit of sweetness while the wine reduces.

Very easy recipe.  I made it as an appetizer and my wife and I enjoyed it.  I will shop around for some less expensive clams.  Littleneck clams were $0.50 each here is Dallas!

Excellent recipe. Most important is clean clams and this works well for me. Place clams in the sink and rinse well with cold tap water.  Cover with cold tap water, let soak at least 1/2 hr. Drain and rinse again with cold tap water. Cover again with cold water and let soak at least 15 minutes. If the water is clear most likely they are clean. Rinse again and start step 2.

Incredibly easy process. Great result. Store was out of small clams, but it worked just as well for the large ones I snagged. Paired them with a mushroom risotto.

Made it exactly as written. While it was ok, it wasn't great. I love steamed clams. This was boring.  Not much flavor, very, very mild. Best part was the rosemary and garlic crustini. Next time I'll add more seasoning. Red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, clam juice, etc. Juice really lacked flavor.

I scaled it down to 2 servings, but I had a lot more than 25 clams. I added a little water, but it wasn't really necessary. The liquid specified steams clams nicely. I stopped the cooking at 10 min, but it was probably ready a lot earlier than that. Delicious and filling dinner and yummy with drawn butter. Thanks!

Followed exactly.  We did really like it but saltier than I generally like food.  Washed & scrubbed 3 times so not sure of any way we could have removed more salt.  The juice was fantastic & both teens learned how to clean calms.

Great easy recipe! Soaked the clams in water for 20minutes before to clean and let them breathe. Steamed the clams for 20minutes, added butter halfway through. All the clams opened except one, this recipe was delicious. Be sure to have some crispy bread

This was fantastic! My daughter has a dairy allergy so I just left out the butter and added a bit of EVOO at the end and every bit was eaten! For those who were wondering about cook time I did 12 clams (serving for 1) and covered at med heat for 5 mins and everything opened up beautifully. I also took the clams out and reduced the sauce and tossed with spaghetti for a perfect meal for 1.

The sauce is delicious and excellent with crusty bread. The only thing I did differently was to steam the clams separately from the sauce. When clams open up they make a lot of liquid and I did not want all of that in my sauce. Once the clams opened up I added them to my sauce with a 1/4 c of the clam juice. Delicious!!

Ah I  loved this!  I agree with a previous reviewer that is was a little salty but I'm contributing this to my wine choice, prepared garlic  and the salted butter  I  used adding to the salt water creature (i used venus clams, very inexpensive). Over all though,  I  think this turned out  delicious and up to par with any  restraunt  clam  dish at a fraction of the price with the addition of enjoying beautiful  seafood in my own (non seaside) home.

This was delicious! I made a couple of changes... instead of olive oil, I cut up two slices of thick bacon and put in the pot with the garlic and some chopped sweet onion. We don't like parsley, so I substituted cilantro. I added some chunks of fresh Roma tomato with the butter, then topped the servings with fresh cool chunks of tomato and cilantro. Wonderful. (Of course it was! It has BACON!!)

Needs a little salt. I added onion finely diced. Medium high heat. Put on fettuccine pasta. I added juice of 1 lemon with parsley. Next time add tsp salt. It would be lovely with a little fresh basil.

This was easy, fast, and delicious.  
I soaked the clams for ~10 min, then scrubbed each individually and rinsed.  It took a little while, but there was no sand in any clam.

These were awesome!! I've always eaten mussels but am thinking now I may like clams better. Rinsing & scrubbing takes a bit of time so allow yourself that time to prepare them. Mine had no sand but I rinsed and scrubbed anyway. I ended up adding a little fresh squeezed lemon juice because I love lemon. They were so good!! I did the 50 for 2 people and it was a good amount plus I made mussels for a full seafood pig out! I highly recommend this recipe!!

I loved this dish! I served it over angel hair pasta. The only thing I will change for next time is a reduction in the garlic. I love garlic but I really wanted the clam flavor to come through more. It is really an outstanding dish.

I love steamers and get them often as I live on New England but had never made them myself. This will be my go to recipe! Easy and flavorful. I love buttah and salt but because I used salted butter for the clams and for dunking I think I will use salt free butter on the clams as I think it was a tad bit salty. I think if I did not dunk in additional butter that it would be fine. Love this recipe and can't wait to have these again.

Used 1/2 the butter and no fresh parsley. Added crushed red pepper, cracked black pepper, dried basil, and dried oregano (less than 1/2 tsp each) DELICIOUS!

Absolutely delicious. We did not even add salt and pepper. Plenty of baguette is highly recommended.

I made this recipe with half the garlic and added some onion powder. I used an Oregon Pinot Grigio and had to double this recipe so that I could have some too! Serve with multigrain baguette to dip in broth. We love this recipe!

Amazing! I used about 70 clams, increased to 2 cups white wine, steamed on medium for 20 minutes. I added parsley and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Perfect!

Delicious!  I added a can of diced tomatoes and, although I used fresh clams, I also added a can of clams with juice.  Wonderful with hot French bread and a salad.

Mine turned out great! I tossed in cooked linguine before serving. Here are some tips for steaming and getting rid of sand.

To get rid of sand in clams:
1) Soak them neck-high in salt water for about 3 hrs. They will spit out the sand.
2) Gently scoop them out and put them in fresh water (no salt) for 1 hr to desalt them... Unless you like to taste of salty clams.

Steaming clams:
Steaming with medium heat from 3-5 minutes. Time varies depending of type and size of clams. The trick to knowing when they're ALMOST ready is when you observe a burst of steam fromyour pot.

This is my go to recipe for steamed clams. The flavors meld together perfectly and never overpower the clams. Made this several time and it never disappoints!  Serve with a glass of white wine and a crusty loaf of warm bread, delicious!

Loved this! I bought 3 pounds of clams for two people. I added shallots when sautéing the garlic along with some oregano and red pepper flakes. Added extra wine after I added the clams. Finished with a squeeze of lemon. Will definitely be making again!

......simple ...and complex at the same time.  Nevertheless ....delicious!!!  Although the "type" of white wine is not specified ...I've used Pinot Grigio ....and White Zinfandel to make this dish ...both with immensely satisfying results.  Don't forget the loaf of GOOD ....CRUSTY bread to sop up the broth.  This dish ...and a simple green salad ...is a complete meal.

This is an excellent recipe! Tried it the first time exactly as instructed and loved it. Adjusted it here and there when making it thereafter. Right now my favorite "tweak" is adding lemon pepper to the sauteing garlic (and sometimes chives) for a little extra zip.  This is an easy recipe so neglected to read it when preparing it once and almost burned the butter I added prematurely while steaming the clams. Lesson learned. :)  

Thank you Scott, for sharing this recipe!

I make this recipe often. It's simple but delicious. A couple of things I do differently........after scrubbing clams I leave them covered in salted water for a few hours and add cornmeal. This will help purge any sand inside the clams. As others have mentioned I also add red pepper flakes and instead of adding butter while they cook, I make a roux and thicken the broth after removing the open clams. I prefer a thicker texture when dunking my crusty Italian bread !!!

I made this last night and it was AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly except at the end. I left the lid on when I noticed the clams beginning to open and just turned the heat off. All 50 of them opened and were SO GOOD. Will make this again and again.

This is my go to recipe for steamed clams. I've been using it for years from the first time I found it on the site. I do add a little salt, pepper and garlic salt to the broth as well as onion for a little flavor.

Great recipe...we added more garlic and the red pepper flakes.  Just great with the bread to soak up all those great juice flavors.  Simple, tasty and filling.  Just add a glass of the Pinto Grigio and it's a  done meal!

Tried this today with linguine. Very simple and delicious. Wine used was Du Toitskloof (South African)Sauvignon Blanc and I added a teaspoon of crushed chili. A wonderful light lunch for two (recipe adjusted to serve 2)

Very salty - next time i will add more liquid...maybe a bit more wine or a bit of water - really enjoy this recipe otherwise - bread dipping is a must  - dont make half the recipe i know 50 seems like a lot but 3 of us finished it all in no time !

SO GOOD!  I was in heaven eating it.  Just like at the fanciest restaurant in town- better when you control what ingredients go in and what doesn't!

Excellent recipe.  I've made this numerous times although always with mussels. A very simple recipe too.
Comes out great every time.  This is a family favorite.

I don't eat clams but my fiance does and he made this for his lunch yesterday.  He loved it!  He said it was very simple to prepare.  When he was mincing the garlic he thought it seemed like an aweful lot but when it was done he said it was just right.

Awesome. If you like steamed clams definitely try this recipe. You'll never make plain steamed clams again.

Very nice, I used an alcohol-removed chardonnay, with a hearty garlic sourdough loaf and a spinach salad. It tasted wonderful.

Bravo, this recipe deserves a standing ovation as my company nearly gave me one. I tripled this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit, we didn't have one clam left and the broth was soaked up with crusty bread. I hardly needed to serve a main course.

I halved this recipe for myself and my six year old son (my husband will not eat clams) and we had it as an appetizer before dinner.  It was out of this world delicious! My son and I LOVED the broth sauce; we dipped buttered bread in it and ate to our hearts content.  You will not be disappointed with this fantastic recipe.  I am even thinking of trying the broth will fish in foil on the grill.  Thanks Scott!

I tried this recipe twice; the first time pretty much as written and the second time with shucked clams. For some reason, the flavor with the shucked clams was just weird. I was hoping it would work since they're easier/cheaper to get than good clams-in-shell around here. Anyway, the first time was good - added a little extra garlic and garnished with parsley.

Thanks for the recipe, Scott!

Scott, this was wonderful...thank you so much for sharing.  I made these for my husband for Father's day...I was skeptical, I have never steamed Clams before.  The broth smelled so good, my husband was in heaven, told me I can make these over and over again,better than any fancy resturant.

I made these for lent and they were wonderful. I didn't have white wine so I used a blush and it worked great. I love garlic so this is right up my alley and very simple to do. My hubby always made the clams but I made these!

Lacks something, can't put my finger on exactly what.  Tried it with a combination of littleneck clams and mussels (the mussels take less time to cook).  Usually we love to dip french bread into the broth, but just not enough flavor here.

Absolutely delicious!!  Best steam clams we have ever had and so simple.  Better than going out for dinner.
