Leave out the sugar and use sweet pickle relish and liquid from relish to taste. Use regular mustard instead of honey mustard.

These were very good, but be warned: they are sweet. I made my own honey mustard and cut the salt in half. They were even better after they sat in the frig for a few hours. I really liked them, but husband asked where the pickle relish was :)

I liked these a lot. Others thought they were too sweet. Next time cut down a little on both the salt and sugar and use smoked paprika instead of regular. Round 2: used half the called for amount of salt and sugar and tried smoked paprika. They were great. Do this again next time.

I thought the recipe was very good.  If u try it try cutting back on the salt and pepper then taste because I thought that it was a little to much.

These were OK, be warned they are very sweet. A little too sweet for our taste however if you like really sweet eggs  you may like these, we did not.

I loved this recipe but I made a few changes. I used a half teaspoon honey and one half teaspoon mustard. I did not add sugar. I used rice wine vinegar and 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce. The hubby went nuts over it! This will be a favorite and the only deviled eggs recipe I use!

My adult son loves these. I was fixing them so often that the last time I made them for him, I sent him home with the eggs and a copy of the recipe. I made the original recipe but I will try some of the suggestions listed here for a change up. Thanks so much

Excellent!  Only one caution.  I have been on a no added salt diet for years so I reduced the salt by half. It was still too salty.  Next time I will eliminate the salt entirely.

I used this recipe as a base. I used yellow mustard and half as much salt and pepper. Then I added some chipotle hot sauce. WOW what a difference.

Delicious! These are not too sweet as written in the recipe. I did add less salt and pepper, but only because my husband gets really bad heartburn if he has too much. I love these eggs and will plan to make them again next Easter.

Great recipe, however I did make slight changes. I used spicy mustards & a Tsp of real honey. I also cut the tip off a 'New' Rx dispenser syringe & it was perfect for injecting each egg half with the mixture. I had very little left over & probably could've used it all but I don't like my eggs too stuffed. Again, delicious recipe! Highly recommend to try it for a something new twist on traditional deviled eggs :)

Delish!  Doubled the recipe and it came out well.  I would personally half the sugar, though everyone else liked it as it.  Will definitely make it again.

We loved these sweet deviled eggs.  The only change I made to the recipe is to leave out the salt.  We eat low sodium at our house.  It still turned out delicious.  Try 'em!!!

Easy to make and delicious!  I didn’t have honey mustard and I left out the vinegar and it was still good.  I used regular mustard. I hope to have all ingredients next time.

good base recipe. I substituted relish in place of sugar. Also, after reading the previous reviews, I added salt and pepper  to taste instead of the suggested serving

These were super yummy. I followed this recipe using 10 eggs and only adding a little more mayo. Otherwise the seasoning was perfect. Everyone at my party loved them and I’ll definitely make them again!

i absolutely loved these, BUT do not use honey mustard it makes it way to sweet. i also didn’t use paprika on top because i don’t do spicy stuff amdnit turned over very good.

We really liked this recipe, with a few modifications. I didn't use any sugar. I used honey instead. I also used regular mustard and think I used a little extra mayo (didn't really measure).  I cut the amounts of salt, pepper, and vinegar in half. Lastly, I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I will be making these again!

Very first time making this. My son and my husband loves it. Really sweet so if you'd prefer it to be less sweet use half the sugar. I will be making this dish  from now on !

DON'T ADD THE AMOUNT OF SALT AND PEPPER that is called for in this recipe! My first batch of eggs were fed to my garbage disposal because of the overbearing salty taste. The second batch turned out well (I slowly added salt and pepper to taste).

Way too much salt and pepper! I love everything else in this except that. I would have done about 1/8 tsp of each.

As others have commented this is too sweet.  I would cut the sugar to 1 teaspoon and use Dijon mustard instead of honey mustard.

I used 1/2 the sugar it called for.. a little less salt, I used miracle whip because I did not have mayonnaise, also used the honey mustard but I had some southwest honey mustard and decided to put a little of that in too.... that gave it the kick I was looking for..... It was still plenty sweet but NOT TOO...
