If you like Thai food, this is a great recipe. I made it twice, once with regular coconut milk and once with "Lite" coconut milk. I think the taste is better with the "Lite". I think it seems too "heavy" with the regular. Another bonus is the fact you shave two thirds of the calories and fat off by using the "Lite".

Hubby and I are big fans of curry. Admittedly we like more "complex" flavours, so I added ginger, cilantro, lemongrass and freshly squeezed lime juice. However...this is really quick, easy and really quite flavorful.  Will definitely make again!

My husband and I love Thai food. This was wonderful, but pretty spicy, so be warned. You can use any curry paste (it comes in red, yellow, green, panang and other varietis); they are available at a Thai market. I served this with lime wedges, jasmine rice and fresh chopped cilatro. You can also add pineapple chunks and green onion to the rice. 

If you add chicken broth, chopped green onions, juice of half a lime, and a can of corn (drained) this makes a great soup, also served over jasmine rice with fresh cilantro. You can use shrimp or chicken very thinly sliced.

This was definitely excellent!  The one suggestion I have is to add vegetables (peppers, onions, etc) to soak up some of the extra sauce!

This is a nice simple, basic recipe that leaves room for lots of creativity.  Just the kind of recipe I love.  I used jalepeno peppers instead of chili, and also added cilantro and ginger along with other veggies.  I also added lime juice and pineapple chunks when finished cooking.  I agree with others and suggest you start with 2 tsp of red curry paste and then adjust for taste.  The sauce is soupy until you add the rice to it and allow the rice to absorb the liquid, which it will do.  I used chicken stock to cook rice then added rice to coconut milk and  continued simmering another 5 minutes.  The beauty of this recipe is you can add whatever veggies and other spices you want or have on hand, or just leave it simple.  You can even use frozen veggies too!

The 2 cans of coconut milk that the recipe called for was way too much.  Beware of how much coconut milk you use.  Secondly, the one chili pepper I added made the recipe flaming hot and practically impossible to eat.  I ended up having to dilute the recipe with a lot of water.  Even with all the added water, it was too spicy.

I know this sounds weird, but, add 2 large julienned, unpeeled, seeded cucumbers during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  AND 10 - 15  Basil leaves.  Also substitute GREEN for RED curry.  AN EXCELLANT DISH.

This basic recipe is kind of bland - add 1/2 cup of condenced chicken or vegetable broth and add two cups of fresh veggies also makes this much better (try red bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms).

Outstanding taste!  Be careful, though, it's VERY hot.  Next time I'll half the recipe for the sauce, because we had too much left over for my husband and me.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  I felt like I was eating at a Thai restaurant!

BLAND!!!!! After reading the rave reviews about this recipie I couldn't believe how bad this tasted.  There was barely any flavor or spice in the sauce.  I added asparagus, yellow squash and broccoli and used lite coconut milk.

This has a great taste, but is a bit bland.  I added veggies (zucchini, onions and red pepper) as well as ginger, cilantro and salt.  I'm excited to taste it tomorrow - I hope other reviewers are correct that it tastes better the next day.

This is a good base for this dish, but I too changed to suit my tastes... I used lite coconut milk, but will use regular from now on. It imparts a thicker texture and flavor than the lite version. I also used sweet red and yellow peppers, and added bamboo shoots and fresh cilantro.

This was a good recipe, but I was dismayed at the lack of veggies.  Prior to putting the coconut milk in, I diced half an onion, 2 cloves garlic, 3/4 of a package of mushrooms I chopped and cooked them in the fish sauce (be careful with that stuff it's potent).    Also added half a bag of bean sprouts and some canned bamboo shoots at the same time as the shrimp.  Made the recipe much better.    Without alterations-its a 3 star recipe, but it can very easily be 5 stars through a little creativity.

This was a delicious starting point for us! We're moving in just over a week, so we're in a mad dash to clean out the fridge and cabinets--and doctoring this recipe fit the bill. We added frozen vegetables (broccoli, peppers, onions), lime juice, a bay leaf, ginger, cilantro, and a touch of brown sugar. We served it over jasmine rice (cooked in chicken broth) with slivered almonds on top. It turned out just beautifully!

I added yellow and red sweet peppers and plenty of fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro. The recipe calls for  too much coconut milk in my opinion.

It wasn't very good. I wouldn't make this recipe again. I'm sure there are better coconut shrimp curry recipes than this one.

This was just okay for me. As per other reviews, it was WAY too much coconut milk. Flavor was okay too. I didn't think it had much spice, but not bad. If I had spent more time doctoring it up, it probably would have been better. I did add 2 green onions, a little bit of baby corn, and some broccoli.

I used red and green peppers to give it color and body. The people I cooked it for thought it was outstanding. I even got the thumbs up from a friend who is thai. Its very easy to make.

Bland, but qick. I've found, when using peppers, one can never tell the spiciness of the dish until tasted. Therefore, if you you do not care for a lot of heat, start with half the amount called for. For my family we start with the amount called for and go up from there!:)

Using other reviewers' suggestions, I added vegetables. I omitted the fresh red chili pepper because it seemed like it would make the dish too spicy. I used 1 can of coconut milk, 2 tbsp. red Thai curry paste, 1 tbsp. fish sauce, 1 lb. medium raw shrimp. I started brown rice in the rice cooker, then began chopping and slicing: 1 black bell pepper, 2 small carrots, 2 celery stalks, 1 head broccoli, 1 inch piece of ginger (grated), celery leaves, 3 green onions, and 2 small cans mushrooms. Once the liquid mixture became hot, I let the broccoli cook by itself for a few minutes  before adding the shrimp and other vegetables to the mixture. When I removed the wok from heat, I added coursely chopped pineapple and cucumber, along with a splash of lime juice, and served the mixture over brown rice. The flavor is mild, not the least bit spicy, and pleasing.  For a round-2 meal, I may add chicken broth to turn it into a soup.

I have a ton of salmon in my freezer and am always looking for a new recipe.  I cooked salmon filets on the stove, then broke the pieces up and added to the curry sauce.  I also added some ginger to my recipe.

This was really good!  The red curry paste was hard to find in the store but worth it. Nice change from the usual yellow curry.  Used the fish sauce with the picture of a squid on the label.  Next time will use even larger shrimp and throw in some sliced carrots and chopped green pepper and onion before adding the shrimp. This time I only added white parts of green oninons, chopped.  THis was so delicious over freshly cooked jasmine rice!

OMG!  Simply delish!  Only 4 stars as I had to alter based on other reviews.  I only used one can of coconut milk, garnished with sliced green onions and basil (cilantro would have been preferable, but I didn't have any) and used my own homemade red curry paste.   A perfect base for a variety of uses -- thanks!

After a long day working outside,this was a wonderful dish.  I added the cilantro, ginger and lime juice that one person suggested, and agree with the person who said the Lite coconut milk works well in this. We served over brown rice.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I followed the instructions very carefully however added some lime and cilantro based on other feedback. The aroma of the curry was amazing however I found the flavor very bland and nothing like what you would fine in a Thai restaurant.

2 TBSP red curry paste is way too much! Maybe a missprint and should be 2 tsp??? And I even took other members advice and cut it down to 1 TBSP. My husband who LOVES hot and spicey thought it was too hot! Also found it not very flavorful.

I used light coconut milk and a little cornstarch to thicken.  I also didn't have a red chili pepper so used 1 tsp. of ground red pepper.  This was served with jasmine rice at a party and there were requests for the recipe.

This was very tasty and easy, but HOT!  I had to go to two supermarkets to find the red curry paste, but I'm glad I found it.  Publix supermarket carries it, if you live in an area where that chain exists.  I added yellow and green bell pepper, would probably add more veggies next time.  I'll also reduce the red curry paste, probably by half.  I noticed a recipe on the bottle called for 1 T red curry paste to 1 can coconut milk, while this calls for double that amount!  Overall, a great recipe and a "keeper".

I liked this recipe as a starting off point.  I agree with some of the other reviews -- the Thai style curry is better if you add to it. I added:  1/2 a green and 1/2 a yellow pepper cubed; small onion chopped; 3 cloves garlic; 1/2 tsp. ginger (finely diced).  Before adding the coconut milk as per the recipe I sautéed the onion, garlic and ginger as well as the hot peppers from the recipe in peanut oil.  Then I went to step 1 of the original recipe.  Other additions:  small fistful of chopped cilantro and 1/2 a lime squeezed into the sauce and stirred up just before serving.

Keep the full amount of coconut milk.  The wetness of it is part of what makes it more authentically Thai seeming.    If I hadn't had to dress the recipe up a bit to make it a bit more tasty  I'd have given it 5 stars.

Very good, but we made some modifications, and I did not think it was spicy at all as indicated in a couple of the reviews. We added bell pepper and snap pea pods to give it a little more variety in the flavor. I would add the pea pods sooner than the shrimp next time - they were cooked through, but still a little crunchy for my husband. We also made oriental noodles and stirred those in at the end, which helped soak up the sauce. I used lite coconut milk based on another review and it was the perfect consistency with far less calories. I would definitely make again.

Good taste.  Substituted 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and added 3 Tbsp. flour to thicken the sauce.  Served with crushed pineapple.  Would add English cucumber and/or mango chunks next time.

Good for a very simple basic recipe! I added ginger, lemongrass, and sweet potato.  I URGE everyone who is making a thai curry recipe to try adding chunks of sweet potato, it's amazing!

easy, good recipe. definitely didn't think it was too hot! i actually added a bit more red curry paste. i also agree that it was missing something, for a more complex flavor. i added veggies to this to soak up some sauce. overall really tasty, just needs a bit of something to jazz it up!

This was ok as is.  I made it with chicken and added extra spices and seasonings, and it was excellent- especially on day 2.  Unfortunately, I added so much to it to get it there, that it was difficult to keep track of, especially as I did not write it down immediately.  I'll have to take it from the top the next time I make it.

I used chicken instead of shrimp, soy sauce in place of fish sauce, and green curry paste, which is a little hotter than red. It was delicious and very easy to make.

Great Recipe for a busy lifestyle! Takes little time and effort to prepare and the outcome is delicious. I didn't have fish sauce so just added some salt and one time I used beef instead of prawns. I also made the sauce thicker with corn starch. If you have the basic ingredients in stock this is a recipe to use if you get unexpected dinner guests and you need to make something quick.

I added chopped ginger and garlic, fried it in oil along with 1.5 tablespoons of thai red curry paste, and stir fried veggies and shrimp before adding the coconut milk, sugar, and fish oil.  Surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe!  My entire family loved it.

Great base for more..added ginger, fresh basil, brown sugar.  I used only 1 can of coconut milk and veggie broth mixed with a 1t of cornstarch to thicken just a bit.  Used the zest of 1/2 lime with juice and topped with some cilantro and green onion.   Served over basmati rice.  Yummy

I did not use red chili peppers as the red Thai curry paste was spicy enough (medium). Also I used only 1 can of lite coconut milk as with two it would be too rich (especially as I used a can of coconut milk in the basmati rice).


I added 1 clove of garlic, two celery stalks chopped, one carrot sliced on the diagonal and a can of water chestnuts which I pan fried with the onion, zucchini , mushrooms and red pepper. Then I mixed in the fish sauce and red curry paste. Once mixed and coating the veggies I added the can of coconut milk and raw shrimp. After the shrimp had cooked for about two minutes I added a 1/2 cup of frozen or fresh spinach chopped and a handful of chopped cilantro. Cook until the shrimp are opaque.

Served on the rice! fantastic!

I find that all the pre-made curry pastes are excellent for flavor and a mild spicyness.  Since my husband likes mild, I don't use any extra chilies, but, since I like real spicy I add Chili/garlic sauce to my plate.  I also find that cooking the curry paste briefly before adding the coconut milk does enhance the flavor.  Excellent starting point.

I made this with tofu and vegetables instead of shrimp, but followed the recipe exactly for the sauce except for adding one garlic clove. It's very easy and tasty, but a bit on the bland side. I couldn't add more red curry mix or it would be too spicy, so I wonder what else could have added flavor...I'd recommend looking at others' suggestions if you like flavorful dishes.
