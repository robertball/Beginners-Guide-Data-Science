This was an excellent (melt in your mouth) recipe. However, I replaced most of the oil with apple sauce. This also allowed me to cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup. I had to cook it longer also because of the apple sauce.

A great way to use up extra summer squash. I peeled the bumpy outer skin off and removed the seeds. I did not bake this in a 9x13 pan. The first time I baked it in two loaf pans, the second time I made muffins (bake 20 min.)! I also did not add any nutmeg. To make this even better add a crumb topping: 1 C. brown sugar, 3/4 C. flour, 2 tsp. cinamon, 1/4 C. butter. Mix together and put on top of loafs or muffins. SO GOOD! Even my 2 and 4 year old love this bread.

This recipe makes good use of summer squash. I agree with previous reviewers about the nutmeg; I only used 1/4 tsp because 2 tsps would've been too strong for my taste--I might even add more cinnamon next time. I adjusted the recipe by using 1-1/2 cups sugar and I melted a stick of butter & used that plus 1/4 cup oil, instead of 1 cup oil. I think the baking time is a little on the far side, because mine was a little dry. However the bread has a nice texture and good flavor. Thanks for a great idea Unforgetable; I will use again.

Delicious! Had a bunch of summer squash, so found this recipe! Added pecans and sliced almonds, and also sprinked top with brown sugar which carmelized during baking...added a bit more sweetness...a huge hit...made another batch the next day! Great way to eat that menacing veggie!

Very good recipe!  I read all the reviews before making it.  I cut back to 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 3/4 cup of oil, added 3 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, added 1/2 tsp salt.  I had enough for 2 med loaf pans and 2 mini pans.  I baked the minis on 350 for 30 minutes and the larger loafs for 45 minutes.  Before baking I also mixed a crumb topping of 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 TBS flour, 1/4 tsp cinn, and 1 TBS cold butter.  It was just enough for the recipe.  My family loved it!!  I probably will not be giving too much squash away anymore.

This is an excellent recipe for all that extra summer squash.  As a guy, I made this recipe on a Sunday night.  It turned out great.  I took it to work the next day.  IT WAS A SMASH HIT.  It disappeared so fast (I should have made 2).  I did take some of the other's suggestions (i.e. less sugar, nutmeg). The bread was not too sweet and had a wonderful taste.  Definitely will make it again, and again.

I have to give this a top rating. I made it myself.Instead of making my usual bread for Thanksgiving, I now have to make 5 of these and I don"t even like squash. This is excellant.

Loved it! My husband and 4 year old son loved it too.  Plus it freezes well.  I was looking for a variety of ways to use squash since we have a small garden.  This is definitely a keeper!

I made several modifications in making this recipe-cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c, using half white and half brown sugar, I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 AP Flour as well as using 1/2 unsweetened apple sauce in place of 1/2 the oil (all attempts at making the recipe a bit healthier!) I wish that I would have cut the nutmeg down to 1tsp, as it was a bit overpowering, and I like nutmeg!  Next time I may add a 1/2 tsp of salt or so, just seemed like something was missing.  I never made the recipe 'as is', so my rating is for the final product after the modifications!

Great bread!  I was worried it would be dry but it turned out great.  I didn't have enough rhubarb so I used 1 apple.  Also, only used 1 1/3 c. of white sugar.  Next time I think I'll use some banana or apple sauce.

I had to play with the recipe a bit because I cut it back by half. I didn't want to use half of an egg, what I did was use two eggs but cut back on the oil by a couple tablespoons. I also used half homemade applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. I made muffins out of this recipe, I was able to get 12 smallish muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done in 20 minutes. This is a good base recipe but for us, it needs more spices as it didn't have much flavor. Very similar to zucchini bread.

I loved this recipe, and so did everyone I let try it!! Even all of the neighborhood kids liked it, and they are picky. Of course, I didn't tell them it was squash until after they had tried it and liked it! Great way to use a lot of squash, especially for people like me who really don't care for squash,but get alot of it from my mother's garden. I also modified the nutmeg. I only put two shakes in. That way it wouldn't put my kids off.

This bread turned out very well. I did make a few changes, which I think helped with the flavor. I only used 1 1/2 c sugar because I added a brown sugar and cinnamon topping. I added an extra tsp of vanilla. I only used 1/4 t nutmeg, due to personal preference. Also, I added golden raisins and walnuts. It was very yummy and DH and DD loved it. When I make this again, I will add some salt and will probably use 3 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg. I used an 8X4 bread pan and 2 mini loaf pans. The mini loaves were done at 50 min and the 8X4 loaf was done at 60 min. Overall, a nice basic quick bread recipe.

This smelled so delicious while I was mixing it I could have eaten it then! I did make a few changes... I subbed 1/2 butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, used 1 3/4 cups of sugar, and I just added a dash of nutmeg rather than the whole 2 teaspoons but other than that I made as is w/ yellow squash from my garden. This tasted good, but was too sweet for me (and I love my sweets!). If I made this again I don't think id use any more than 1 cup of sugar

I liked this recipe, especially as a starting point for what I really wanted to make. I followed other reviews and used a little less nutmeg, only 1 tsp instead of 2. I also cut the 1 cup of oil in half, using a half cup of unsweetened apple sauce and a half cup of oil. I then negated my healthy change by adding cocoa powder and mini chocolate chips. The cinnamon mixed with the chocolate flavors reminds me of Mexican style chocolate. Everyone who has tried this bread has loved it!

This recipe comes out nice and moist and the loaves can be frozen and thawed for later enjoyment just fine.

We love this bread. It's so moist and a great way to use up squash! I use  butternut squash out of garden, and I roast the squash first and scoop  out the insides. I usually use two squashes (about 2 1/2 cups of squash). I also cut the sugar back to 2 cups (1 cup white; 1 cup brown), but I use 1 cup oil as per the recipe. I've tried substituting with butter, but it makes the bread heavier. I've also used half oil/half applesauce, but that makes the bread not hold together as well (it's doable, however, if you want to cut fat). I use 2 t. cinnamon and only 1 t. nutmeg, or the nutmeg flavor is overwhelming. I bake mine in the 9x13 pan at 350 for 40 minutes. It's very good with milk for breakfast!

This is the same as my zucchini bread recipe, just changing squashes. I wondered if somebody had tried this with summer squash and now, since my friend gave me some, I'm going to try it too. You can make any bread with this... strawberry, cranberry, banana, winter squash, pumpkin... just trade out the yellow squash for whatever.

This recipe is a great use of summer squash.  My family loved it.  As suggested by others I reduced the nutmeg from 2 to 1 tsp and increased the cinnamon from 2 to 3 tsp cinnamon.

This recipe is perfect for all the extra summer squash you have from your garden.  I have made this recipie numerous times and has always turned out terrific.  I added chopped walnuts which I think is a good addition.  The bread also freezes very well.

I would make the suggestion on reducing the sugar to one cup and one cup honey,  that will  keep it really moist, everyone will ask how it stays so moist

Delicious!  A friend gave me several large summer squash from her garden and we needed a way to use them up.  I read other reviews and only used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, and increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt to balance out the sweetness.  We loved it and will be making it again.  Perfect to make now and freeze later

I came to this recipe in an unusual way. I was given 2 fairly large spaghetti squash. I found a recipe on AR called Sweet and Easy Spaghetti Squash. I cooked it per the directions, only realizing halfway thru the process that, although I saw the recipe called for brown sugar it wasn't listed in the ingredients list and the quantity wasn't noted. I added some brown sugar, just guessing at an amount. On removing the squash from the oven I tasted it and it was bitter and not at all what I expected. I added more brown sugar and chopped up 2 apples I had on hand and baked for additional time. Still not good. I refrigerated overnight and had a flash of inspiration to use the squash/apple combination in a quick bread. That was what brought me to this recipe. I only used 1 cup of sugar since it already had brown sugar in it. I cut the oil to a quarter of a cup since other reviewers suggested that. Added a half cup applesauce, a half cup Greek yogurt and chopped pecans. I made a streusel topping before baking and baked in 1 9 x 5 pan and 1 8 x 4 pan. Wow, it turned out great and I was able to salvage the failed spaghetti
 squash and apple dish!  Additional  note: the spaghetti squash recipe has since been corrected if you are curious to look that one up, the brown sugar is now listed in the ingredients. So, I guess I am really not reviewing this recipe per se since I changed it so much, but it does show how versatile the recipe can be.

Great recipe!  I added a brown sugar crumble topping to give it more sweetness.

Very moist with a good texture! I substituted applesauce for half the oil and it worked out great if you're trying to cut back on oil. I feel the flavor is a little bland so next time around I may add in some more seasoning or maybe nuts or a bit of brown sugar. I substituted applesauce for half the oil and it worked out great if you're trying to cut back on oil. As it is, it's wonderful with a just a little cream cheese for a not-overly-sweet snack!

I use nutmeg and less cinnamon.  This bread is outstanding.  What a great way to use up Summer Squash from my garden.   I always use applesauce in lieu of most of the oil.   So much healthier.

Nice, delicately flavored bread.  I made as directed except for decreasing the nutmeg to 1/2 t. and baking in two loaf pans.  A great way to use up our bumper crop of summer squash.

I would have given this 5 stars, but the instructions were goofy.  I poured it into a 8"x4" loaf pan and it ended up overflowing in the oven.  That being said, the resulting loaf was very tasty though I had to add 20 minutes cooking time to get the loaf baked through.

I've made this recipe twice in the past week, (due to an abundance of summer squash, given to me by a neighbor!) and am falling in love with this delicious baked good.  Today I experimented with this recipe, and found the results to be extraordinary!  Here's what I did:  2 eggs, 1 Tbs low fat milk, 2 Tbs low fat yogurt, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, 1 1/2 c. flour, 2 tsp Baking Powder,  1 tsp salt, 2 Tbs veg. oil, and cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla extract to taste.  I also used 1/2 zucchini, 1/2 summer squash.  It took a LONG time to bake, I would start with an hour at 325, then go from there.  Very moist, very rewarding, and very difficult to stop slicing into! ~Cheers!

I'm awfully sorry to give a bad review, especially to a recipe I tried with such high hopes. I gave this two different tries, with a large squash and a few very small young ones. In neither case was this bread anything other than dry and crumbly. I had everyone in my local extended family try this and I ended up with the same reaction from all of them: they didn't like it. I did substitute with applesauce for part of the oil, but there's no way that should have changed things to this degree. For what it's worth, I did reduce the nutmeg down to 1/4 tsp and after that, I thought the spice taste was good.  Sorry.

Delicious!! I took the advice of other reviewers and used only half the amount of nutmeg called for (which was still quite a bit). I used apple sauce instead of vegetable oil. I may try to spice it up some more next time with raisins and more cinnamon.

This wasn't 5 stars for me, by any means.  I used less than half the nutmeg called for, as suggested by other reviewers.  I had enough grated squash to make 1 1/2 of this recipe, so I made 2 loaves and 12 muffins.  It worked out well that way.  I just found these far too sweet.  I will make this again, but will definitely use less sugar.

I made it and then made another by adding 1/2c applesauce and removing 1/2c oil and 1/2c sugar. I also added a crumble topping. Crumble Topping 1/2c Brown Sugar, 1/3c Flour, 2tsp Cinnamon and 2tsp Butter. I put crumble on bottom of pan. Flip out on a cookie sheet when cooked so the crumble stays on better.  Very good!

This bread was perfect AS IS. It's very light, moist and fluffy - not too sweet and I didn't think the nutmeg was overpowering at all as some reviewers thought. The only change that I made was that I baked it in 2 loaf pans and increased the baking time to 55 minutes. My kids, husband and mom LOVED it! Delicious!

This tasted okay, but it was WAY too sweet.  It would be too sweet to be called "cake" let alone "bread"!  I would make this recipe again, but scale the sugar way back next time.

I had made a squash soup that I was not excited with, so I quickly turned it into this bread, which was wonderful! I cut the sugar in half (just used one cup) and it was plenty sweet!

Very nice!  A bunch of squash was given to us and i had no idea how to use it up so i tried this.  I followed the advice and sprinkled the top with br. sugar before it baked and we found it very nice.  I told the kids it was coffee cake and they knew no different.  I think i will definately put a crumb topping on this next time i have squash to use.

This was a big hit at the office and at home!  We grew a bunch of summer squash in our garden this summer and didn't know what to do with it all!  So I tried this recipe and I'm so glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly as printed with only a few revisions....
I only used 1 tsp of Nutmeg and in the end, I folded 2.25oz Chopped Pecans and 2.25oz of Sliced Almonds with the grated squash.  I also used a "bundt cake pan" and it took about 1 hour and 5 minutes to bake.  Excellent recipe and I will definately use it again and again!!

This was very good except I think it has alittle too much nutmeg taste. I will make again except maybe only use 1 teaspoon of nutmeg instead of 2. This is a keeper for me.

I had an overabundance of yellow squash in my garden this year and needed a way to use it up. I have made zucchini bread before but never tried yellow squash in the same way. This recipe was simple to put together. The only change I made was to substitute half the oil for applesauce to cut some calories and fat. Unfortunately the flavor of this cake/bread was really bland. I think it needed salt and something else to bump up the flavor. This would be a good dessert for kids or anyone who doesn't like veggies though. You can't taste the squash at all and because it is yellow and not green like zucchini, you wouldn't know there were veggies in it.

Yay!  I was trying to get rid of some summer squash in my fridge that was limp and on it's last leg.  I cut the sugar in half, cut the oil in half, and cut the nutmeg in half after reading the reviews.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour and added two apples that I turned into applesauce using the "Sarah's applesauce' recipe on this site.  I did have to cook it an extra 7 minutes but it turned out great!  Thank you!

BEST EVER! This is the same as my zucchini bread recipe....so increased cinnamon to 1T and omitted the nutmeg. I was out of vanilla so used 1 t almond extract instead. Used a crumb topping as others suggested. Had a lot of squash so made a double batch which made 24 muffins (400 deg. for 20 Min) and 3 loaves of bread. Added a cup of raisins too. The almond in this is awesome!

YUM!  Just tasted my first piece, & it is VERY good!  It's a little sweeter than I'd like, and I did CUT THE SUGAR to 1 3/4 cups.  Next time, I'll use only 1 1/2 cups.  I used a scant cup of safflower oil, and I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  I also cut 24 squares instead of 16.
My husband likes it, too, always a good sign.  I sure hope it freezes well; it's just the 2 of us!   BTW, I used a small "kubota" squash from our CSA share.  It looked so tiny, but I had to freeze over 2 cups of shredded after getting the 2 cups for this recipe!

This bread is delicious! We had more squash than we could eat, and this was a great way to enjoy our home grown squash!

Bland, bland, bland.  Missing salt, maybe? Followed the recipe exactly, but turned out to be a heavy, dense practically tasteless bread.  Tried the second batch (made another two loaves) adding less nutmeg and more cinnamon and vanilla.  Still BLAND! Going back to my favorite Moms Zucchini recipe from this site. That bread is incredible. Very disappointing as I had high hopes for a great yellow squash bread. :(

I divided the recipe into 10 servings instead of 16, and added the seeds from one medium pomegranate.  I also cut the sugar way down and added a dash of honey and used only melted butter.  Oh so yummy!

I made this for work and received several compliments!  I made a few adjustments to it though.  I replaced most of the oil with applesauce, added lots pf chopped walnuts and dried cranberries, and divided it into two loaf pans, baking it just over an hour.

This was delicious. However, I added some salt as I never saw a recipe that used baking powder and no salt. I also only used 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I am wondering how the loaf pan would work -  it is pictured - and I was tempted to try it but stuck to the 9 x 13 pan. I also used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of Splenda ! ...will make this again.

Made this over the weekend to use up an abundance of gifted summer squash.  I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups and did half applesauce, half canola oil.  I also used half whole wheat and half ap flour....just a couple of healthier changes.  I thought the nutmeg flavor was a little strong, but I'm not a big nutmeg fan.  Hubby and kids both loved the bread, so I made again in muffin tins for dd to pack with school lunches in the fall (just froze the finished product).  Thank you for sharing a great baked option to use up summer squash.

I was VERY disappointed with this bread. With all of the rave reviews I followed it to a "t" and the end result was a moist bread with almost ZERO flavor. Sorry, but this is not a recipe I will be repeating.

It was moist and delicious but I'm reviwing the ease of directions and overall recipe for its ease in makeing substitutions based on what I had available.    I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as I ran out of cinnamon.  1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar for less sweet and more flavor.  1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce.  Used 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg as most reviews suggest and am glad I did.  Also added 1 teaspoon salt.

I follwed the previous advice, cut down on the nutmeg, used 1/2c less sugar, 3/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil. I used 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c plain all-purpose. I also made a topping with quick cooking oats and brown sugar. My kids have already eaten all but 4 of the muffins and I took them out of the oven an hour ago. This was a great way to sneak some veggies into their "I don't eat that" diets.

I shredded the squash and it seemed the pieces were a little large to cook down.......I was right. Mine ended up tasting like sweet bread with chewy chunks of squash. I would say they would have been great if there were not pieces of squash still intact. Make sure to FINELY shred your squash!

I loved this bread!!!   A had a ton of summer squash and this is the only way I could trick my kids into eating it.
I made some modifications in the recipe to make it more nutritious....

1.  reduced oil to 3/4 cup
2.  reduced nutmeg to 1 tsp and increased cinamon to 3 tsp.
3.  Put 1 cup xylitol and 1 cup sugar
4.  Added 1/4 cup flax seed
5.  Used spelt flour instead of white
6.   Subsituted 1/4 cup hemp to replace 1/4 cup of the flour
I made it much more nutritious and it was incredibly yummy.  No one would ever know that it was relatively healthy.

What an awsome recipe!  I used 1/2 cup of applesauce in place of 1/2 cup of the oil which did up the cook time, but WHO CARES! This was so good!  My family of 4 finished the WHOLE pan in 2 days!  I am going to try adding pecans in my next batch...Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe. It is a way to use some of the ton of squash I have from my garden.  I made it in 4 small loaf pans and froze it.  This way I have bread to give as gifts at Christmas or for bake sales.  It took longer than 45 minutes to cook the bread -- more like an hour.

OK recipe but not great. I followed the suggestions on sugar and nutmeg and cut back to 1cup and 1/2 teaspn.  Also used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  But the residual flavor is just 'cinnamon', not much else.  I'll have to play around with it to get something great.

My husband and 2-year-old son both liked this bread alot. I used a little less nutmeg and sugar than what the recipe calls for, and will do that again. I also substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. A great way to use that summer squash!

I made this recipe last year, following it exactly.  This year we had an overabundance of squash again.  I put the squash in the blender with a little bit of the oil and pureed it.  The kids absolutely loved it! It's definitely a treat from the savory squash dishes!

I tried my go at a gluten free version of this and it turned out to be the best gf thing I've ever made!
did a little research and used sorghum flour because it was said to be best for bread making. equal ratio swap for regular
flour, used 8oz unsweetened applesauce and about a tablespoon coconut oil for the veg oil, one additional egg, only 1 cup sugar instead of 2, and one 1tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg instead of 2. 
I also read that adding corn starch brings out the best in sorghum flour, and that you should use 1 tablespoon per 1 cup, so I added 3 tablespoons of corn starch too.
baked in muffin tins for 35mins at 325 and they are perfect. not too sweet, a little gritty (but it's gf so that's expected) but hardly noticeable. little bit of melted butter and enjoy!

I had some summer squash I needed to use up so I gave this a go.  2 medium yellow squash gave me the 2 cups of shredded squash. I squeezed the excess water out of the squash with my hands. I added 1/2 cup chopped Pecans and I'll probably add 1 cup the next time I make it. I subbed in 1 cup of whole wheat flour with the all purpose flour because I had it on hand. I was unsure of the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg but I went for it anyway. The spice is very good. You definitely taste it but its not too strong. This recipe made 1 9x5 loaf pan and 6 reg sized muffins. The muffins took about 35 min in my oven at 325 and I had to bake the loaf for about 1 hr and 15 min. Hubs likes it, i like it. Yum! I will be making this again very soon.

This bread is very good, however, I found the taste of nutmeg a little overwhelming (for my taste). Next time I will reduce the nutmeg to 1tsp.  The bread is very moist. I used 1/4 cup of applesauce and 3/4 c oil. I made 5 mini loaves instead of one big one so baking time was reduced to 30-35 minutes. I also  added a little cinnamon & sugar on top of each loaf. Over all these are very tasty especially for containing squash.

Yummy! I've only ever made zucchini bread before. I shredded and 'drained' my yellow squash like I would for zucchini, but turns out I didn't need to, there was no liquid. I followed the recipe and the only thing I might do different next time is to reduce the vanilla, maybe a bit less sugar--this is very sweet for a quick bread. I like doing it in a 9x13 because it didn't take as long as a loaf would have to bake. Thank you Unforgetable for the recipe!

Like other reviewers, the nutmeg was too strong. I made this again with half the nutmeg and it was better. I also made this in muffin tray the second time and liked it better that way. In the muffin tray, it still took about 35-40 minutes to fully cook through.  The reviewer who said 20 minutes was dead wrong. One last thing, I put a crumble topping on the muffins and it made this extra delicious. It's a pretty good starter recipe but needs to be fooled around with - to your liking. Thanks.

This recipe was awesome, but be careful don't overmix the batter or it will be heavy, kind of like when you overmix muffins. I froze my summer squash and made this again several weeks later with some of the recommendations and half the mixing and it was wonderful.

I love this! Someone gave me 2 crookneck squash from their summer garden and I was browsing for something to do with them when I found this recipe to try. This was great, really exceeded my expectations. The 2 squash that I used yielded nearly 3 cups of shred, so I just used that and it worked out fine. This is a lot more sugar than I'd prefer to use, but I used the 2 cups as recommended. The bake time took an hour for me using bread pans lined with foil.

This was a really great breakfast bread! I had to make some tweaks based on what I had around the house. I used sucanat instead of the white sugar and only used 1 cup of that...I did add 1/4 cup honey. Even cutting the sugar down, it was still plenty sweet for us. Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup melted butter. I used sprouted wheat flour. Everyone gobbled it up! I loved mine smeared with a pat of butter. YUM! :-)

My family loved this. I did alter a little by adding choc chips and chopped walnuts. We loved it so much and we have an ever bearing squash plant this year, that I will be making and freezing these yummy loaves for enjoyment throughout the year.

A really good recipe! And a great way to use up all that squash from the garden. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made the recipe in muffin pans, cooking them for 20 minutes.

This was way to sweet and I even cut back the sugar by 1/2 a cup.  Also it turned out a little dry and heavy.  I will find another recipe.

Due to friends giving us an abundance of squash, I searched for recipes to use it up quickly and found this one.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a normal size loaf pan.  To healthy it up a little more, I used coconut oil, evaporated cane juice and whole wheat pastry flour.  I made it today and tried a piece and I'm pretty sure I heard angels singing when I tasted it!  A really wonderful quick bread and great way to use summer squash.  I think the cinnamon and nutmeg are really what sends it over the top!  I may make more and freeze to give as gifts during the holidays. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

Absolutely delicious!  Better than any zucchini bread I've ever made.  Moist, full of flavor, and a very pretty bread! As written it is very good, but the nutmeg is strong and the bake time was a little long for a 9 x 13 pan.  Second time I made it I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. and used a full tablespoon of cinnamon because I just love cinnamon that much.  I replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce to reduce the fat and 1/2 of the flour with white whole wheat flour, and baked for 40 minutes. I drizzled a little bit of a powdered sugar & milk glaze (not necessary, just made a pretty presentation)  It was even better with the modifications and my fiance' loved it. A great way to use up the abundance of squash I am getting out of my garden.  I froze a ton of shredded summer squash in 2 cup portions so I could make this at holiday time for gifts.  It's that good.

I switched it around a bit like some of the other reviewers did, and it turned out great. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1 Tbsp vanilla, 1/2 c. veg oil + 1/2 c. applesauce, and only 1 tsp nutmeg. I agree with another comment that said they might up the cinnamon next time, it could have used more. I baked them in the large muffin tins, which took 28 minutes to cook. It made 12 big muffins. They turned out nice and moist and had a nice texture. I think they would have been even better with some walnuts or pecans added.

Love this recipe! I only used 1 tsp. of the nutmeg (2 tsp. seems like a LOT of nutmeg) and I used about a tablespoon of cinnamon.
I also added cinnamon chips to the batter and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the tops of the loaves before baking.

I baked in 2 loaf pans for somewhere around 65 minutes. Whole family loved. This one is a keeper.

Very good. Like other reviewers, I substituted applesauce for the oil and cut back the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon. I also added walnuts. Next time I think I will cut back the nutmeg a little more I think. It did take between 5 and 10 min. longer than bake time noted to finishing baking, probably because of the applesauce.

This is by far the best recipe for a bread.  It is so light.  I made it in two loaf pans and sprinkled some strussel topping.  I am going to try it again with 2 cups of wild blueberries instead of the squash.  I have been baking for over 30 years and this is the best!  Thank you for sharing.

Salt is what this is missing, I think.  Next time I'll try adding about a teaspoon of salt, which is what my favorite zucchini bread recipe calls for.  I might also cut the nutmeg in half.  I think this is pretty good though, especially hot out of the oven!

I agree these are really good; I made them with the one stick of melted butter and only 1/4c oil as recommended by another reviewer; Next time I may cut back on the sugar as some have recommended or I will substitute spenda for some of it; I made them into 18 muffins and I will freeze some of them. A great way to use the summer squash!!

Somehow I thought that summer squash would work exactly like zucchini and that this would essentially be just like zucchini bread - but it really was not.  I guess I also have found that with zucchini bread, you can "play around" with the amount of zucchini and have a moister or less dense bread.  This recipe felt less "forgiving" with the amount of summer squash. Like other reviewers, I thought it was somewhat dry.  It also seemed to "dry out" sitting on the counter over the afternoon in a way that zucchini bread does not.  All in all, interesting experiment with summer squash bread!  I think I'll stick with zucchini, though!

This makes 2 - 8x4 loaves. This also takes more than 45 min. - more like an 55-60. I added some blueberries and decreased the sugar just slightly and this was good - not great - hence the 4 stars.

This bread is a great way to put the excess crookneck or summer quash in your garden to use.  This is my second time making it in a week and this time I added a handful of chopped strawberries.  I love the extra zing and color that adds.  Very easy and very tasty recipe.  Thanks!

didn't change any of the ingredients.  The only thing I did was sprinkled the top with brown sugar and pecans per another users suggestion.  Fabulous.  I will make these up and freeze them since we have summer squash coming out of our ears right now!  LOL

This was a great way to use up my summer squash.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 8 oz. of "natural" applesauce.  I also used only 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  It was still moist and tasty.  I also added a little cream cheese icing!

this was so much better than I thought it would be.  I made it exactly by the recipe.  I was kind of worried that the batter was too thick but it turned out perfect!  will definitely make again and again.

I've made zucchini bread before so this squash bread tasted similar...I used less sugar as others suggested...and this time I used the pan size in the recipe not the loaf pan in that picture. Sometimes I add chopped pecans or walnuts.

Everyone that has tried this bread has loved it and asked for the recipe! This is a great way to use up all of that leftover squash and I found cutting the tough rind off and using a large cheese grater gives a nice texture to the squash.

The picture is misleading... DO NOT cook it in a loaf pan, or the crust will burn before it is done in the middle. Follow the recipe just as written and it is PERFECT.

A solid recipe: nice delicate flavor, moist bread.  However I had to bake the bread 20 minutes longer than the recipe instructed.  Next time I will decrease the amount of nutmeg (though I use freshly grated so the amount called for in the recipe was a little strog. I felt the finished product was also little sweet for my taste so I will probably decrease the amount of sugar.  I might add some of it to the top of the bread for texture.

This is a good recipe to use up the abundant summer squash. I used two loaf pans and baked it for 55 min. I'll be taking a loaf to work tomorrow.

this was very soft and moist. I used 3/4 oil and 1/4 of sunsweet brand butter and oil replacement and used sugar in the raw instead of regular white sugar.

This is a very good recipe. My bread turned out really good, except that it was a little dry and crumbly. The flavor is very good, esp. with brown sugar sprinkled on top before you bake it, so that it carmelizes.

A big hit at work! I made into muffins - here are the other substitutions: cut the sugar by 1/3, used a lil pumpkin pie spice since I didn't have nutmeg, added an extra tsp of cinnamon. Muffins took about 20minutes at 350'. Very similar to zucchini bread, for those of you who may be skeptical =)

I made this for my family and everybody loved it!  I followed the suggestions and used 1/2 cup less sugar and only 1 tsp nutmeg.  It was amazing and just the right amount of sweetness.  The bread stuck to the sides a little though when I tried to get it out of the bread pan so next time I will grease and then add a little dusting of flour!  Such a good use of extra squash!!

I followed everyone's suggestion and used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and half the nutmeg.  My husband slathered his with butter and loved it.  I went butterless and liked it but thought it was missing something.  I think I've decided it's missing a bit of salt and that's why it's so good with the butter on it.  It's definately a keeper though

So good!  Instead of Sugar, I used 1 cup of Sucanat, and I used half the oil and added a half cup of applesauce.  I also used whole wheat flour.  The batter seemed a little dry (probably because of the whole wheat flour) so I added a little milk.  The bread came out so tasty and moist.  Will definitely make again.

this was a good recipe for using up all that extra squash from your garden! I thought it was good, but it was way too sweet. If you make this, definitely follow the advice of others and cut down on the sugar.

this is a great recipe for an abundance of summer squash. I want to point out that the picture shown is a LOAF of bread whereas the recipe calls for a 9 x 13 baking dish...i decided to triple the recipe (which i dont recommend) and it ended up making 4 loaf pans of bread..the batter is very thick before addition of the squash..i suggest NOT doubling the recipe..it was hard to work the batter..

I cut down on the nutmeg by a lot..more than half and it was plenty..it's very sweet so next time i might cut down on the sugar..and add nuts as some of the other readers suggested.  

Overall a pretty good recipe though!

When I mixed the flour into batter it seemed crumbly. I thought I did something wrong but when I mixed in the yellow squash. The batter started getting more moisture and looked more like batter. Baked it. And it taste good.

Everyone who tried this loved it. I did make changes as per other suggestions - 1 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c applesauce for half of the oil, used 1 c whole wheat flour and 2 c AP, added 1/2 tsp salt, increased cinnamon to 3 tsp and only did 3/4 tsp of nutmeg. I baked it in a bundt pan. Will def make again.

Very easy to make. But it turned out dry. I will probably try again and go the less sugar and use applesauce as another posted. It made the kitchen smell like an apple cider donut bakery. I really didn’t detect the taste of squash at all. I thought it was kind of blah, but loved the cinnamon. It was more of a spice cake bread.

Yummy! This makes a nice, moist and hardy cake-like bread. To summer mine up I omitted the cinnamon/nutmeg and instead mixed in zest of 1 orange to the sugar. The orange bits look pretty with the yellow squash bits! Also made an orange glaze with toasted coconut on top, and added 1/4 tsp. of salt to the flour/baking powder.

This is a great base recipe for whatever type of squash/zucchini bread you like!

A little less sugar, a little extra cinnamon, very little nutmeg. I had an enormous squash and an old banana I wanted to use,   so made 1.5 of the recipe. Made 3 trays of muffins, and my 12yo son ate 5 of them right out of the oven! Very moist and flavorful. I cooked the regular sized muffins about 25 minutes and the large muffins about 30. I don’t feel these need a crumble topping.

Used applesauce and reduced sugar amount. Reduced nutmeg to 3/4 tsp and in the future, plan to drop it to 1/2 tsp. Topped with brown sugar before baking. Made one loaf and a dozen muffins (mini chocolate chips added to the latter). Both turned out delicious!

Pretty good recipe. I replaced 1/2 the sugar with Splenda (experiment) and used fresh ground nutmeg which I think elevated it. Coworkers and family loved it and couldn’t detect the substitution. So simple it leaves lots of room for experimentation. Since I used a sectioned bundt pan I reduced my baking time to 35 min and the texture was perfect. A very moist and somewhat dense bread.

Very good. Worked well with yellow straight-neck squash that my garden won't stop producing.

I make this Squash Bread every Summer because it is absolutely delicious.  The only change that I make is using a loaf pan instead if the 9X13 baking dish.

I added walnuts & chocolate chips, reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and used 1 tsp nutmeg + 1 tsp allspice instead of 2 tsp nutmeg. It was delicious and not too sweet! Definitely worth the effort if you have excess summer squash in your garden. I’m sure it would work with zucchini as well. FYI - if you need more / less moisture to suit your taste, you may play with either wringing out the excess water from the shredded squash (humid climates) or leaving it in (dry climates).

This was frustrating to bake in that the cooking time was way off for the temperature given- over 20 minutes.  It stuck to the pan.  Maybe flour would have helped?  It smells great, but has a strong taste of baking powder- way too much for my family to want to eat.

Way, way too sweet. Family members won't eat it. I hesitated about the 2 cups of sugar and should've heeded the advice from another reviewer to decrease the sugar and switch out some of it for applesauce.

Good recipe. I added more shredded squash just because. It turned it really good.  It did not last long. It really helped me to use up the squash that was given to me. I had an over abundance of squash so a sweet recipe was perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a church social and it was a big hit!

I did modify the recipe per previous comments - 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup unsalted butter in place of the 1 cup oil and reduced the nutmeg to 1/8 t (like an old zucchini bread recipe).

Also made it in loaf pans which required 60-65 minutes. 

Two loaves was almost not enough they loved it so much!

Used margarine instead of oil, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg instead of 2. Not sure if it was because it was humid the day I baked this, but it came out over-moist (even after baking it for 1 hour and 15 minutes); part of the bread stuck to the pans. I ended up putting one loaf back into the oven for an additional 10 minutes upside down in the pan. Tastes fantastic, though.

Substituted oil for 1 cup butter, and split between two loaf pans.  Bread is moist, but not too moist.  Actually cut & stayed together better than most fruit/veggie bread recipes.  Great combo of cinnamon & nutmeg, just right!  Was quick and easy to prepare as well!  Great treat!

Does the job if you have extra squash. However the taste was a bit bland. Recommend adding salt?  I made a quick cream cheese frosting and it tasted much better afterwards. Thank you for the recipe!

Great way to use this year's bumper crop of summer squash. Peeled off the bumps and thin layer of the rind, seeded, and chopped the squash in the food processor.  Made eleven jumbo muffins.  The batter was very thick, but the squash added sufficient moisture during baking. Baked at 325 degrees for 40 minutes. Nice high crowns. Great texture. 

Will make again with squash from the garden, but probably will not purchase a squash from the grocery store to make.

I have made this several times . Sometimes I modify it into a lemon bread. I substitute  2 teaspoons of lemon extract for the vanilla extract. Then after it has cooled, I top it with a lemon glaze, mixing  1 cup of confectioners sugar and 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon extract.

I've made several other summer squash and zucchini bread recipes before. This one is moist and has a good texture, but it's bland and too sweet. If I make it again, I think it could be improved by adding a little salt or swapping the oil with salted butter.

This was delicious and a great way to use extra yellow squash.
Based on the other reviews I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, only 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 3 tsp cinnamon.  I  also added 1 tsp of salt and some chocolate chips for my kids.  I love that my kids are eating a vegetable they would never touch without even knowing it!

I absolutely love this recipe, and my kids (ages 3, 5 and 9) are constantly pestering me to make more. It comes out more as a squash cake than a squash bread, but that's a large part of the appeal to the littles.

I've always been really bad about just letting yellow squash go to waste. I'm generally very conscientious and don't waste ANYTHING, but there's something quite unappealing to me about this particular squash when it's boiled, fried or cooked into savory dishes. I don't like the flavor or the texture. We participate in Bountiful Baskets, though, which is a food co-op where we have no idea what we'll get ahead of time -- in season, that includes a lot of yellow squash. I decided to try this recipe with it, and now I'm kicking myself for all the times I didn't use the squash or put it into something that no one really liked. This is THE recipe for yellow squash now.

I left the peels on and shredded them along with the flesh, but did remove the seeds. The peels were thin and tender, and completely unnoticeable once they were cooked into the bread. I used duck eggs instead of chicken eggs and whole white winter wheat flour, and then replaced a portion of the sugar with applesauce and about a half tablespoon of honey (no further compensation needed because of the extra protein in the duck eggs). I did use the entire recommended amount of nutmeg, but everyone in this household absolutely loves nutmeg so I knew it'd go over well -- if you prefer nutmeg as a background, def

I made this with spaghetti squash.  It took quite a while for the loaf to cook in the middle.  I was starting to get worried about it not cooking - which  is why I am giving this recipe only 4 stars.  I made a few into muffins, as I had extra batter for my pan.  The muffins turned out spectacular.

I made this recipe into muffins and baked for 25 minutes.   They are heavy and taste like flour.  I think next time I'd cut back on 3 cups of flour.  Good recipe to use up my crooked yellow neck squash from my garden but does not beat zucchini bread/muffins.

This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half and made a dozen muffins. I used two eggs, replaced all the oil with unsweetened applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, kept the full amount of cinnamon and reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp like others suggested. They were very light and fluffy. Definitely will make again

i make this recipe a lot during the summer months. I usually cut the sugar in half ( i like to use it for breakfast) and use whole wheat flour. This year i cut the sugar in half and added a 1/4 cup of organic granulated stevia to add some more sweetness for dessert. plenty sweet and plenty moist. great way to use those overly large summer squash that hide away in the garden.

I didn't have enough flour on hand so I used 3cups of baking mix and omitted the leavening and salt. I used a half cup of veg oil and half cup of applesauce to help lighten it and retain the moisture. Oops! Always scoop out the seeds from the squash before grating! I was picking out seeds for 5 minutes before I measured the grated squash. I also put chocolate chips on half and pushed them into the batter in the pan before baking. Blueberries would be nice too.

I really liked the recipe - only change I made was use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 cup oil...next time - I would add more cinnamon... I thought it needed a little more spice - made in 2 loaf pans and came out so moist - took 45 minutes to bake.

Combined two suggestions from above and used half applesauce & half oil and it came out so moist!  Cut the sugar back to just 1 1/4 cup. Also sprinkled the top with a little brown sugar to get a sticky crust.  Got raves from everyone.  Definitely goes in the "keepers" file.

Awesome. I would cut down on the nutmeg and cinnamon next time, but this still came out great.  I made it as bread and as muffins. The bread I had to cook much longer than 45 min until a knife came out clean

This was delicious. I did lessen the sugar and nutmeg as suggested and only had 1/4 cup of oil, so melted a stick of butter to make up the difference. Thanks for the recipe.

2 teaspoons is WAY too much nutmeg. It overpowered the other flavors. I would recommend a half-tsp at the most, plus the cinnamon. Also, I halved the sugar and added semisweet chocolate chips. Yum.

Have made this several times now with several combinations of white/brown sugar and stevia.  Sometimes its super moist, sometimes drier, but it's always a hit.

I cut the sugar and oil called for by half, and added a splash of soy milk. I also replaced 1 c of flour with oats. Delicious, and a great use of my extra squash from the garden.

Made muffins instead of bread for an on the go snack and school lunches. Was a tiny bit short on squash so I grated about 1/2 cup of apple to make up the difference. Used whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the total flour amount called for and the rest all purpose. Used all applesauce instead of oil and reduced nutmeg by 1/2 tsp. sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top before baking at recommended temp for 20-25 minutes. Totally fantastic - everyone loved them!

When I first tasted this recipe, I thought the nutmeg flavor was too strong. Then the more I tried it the more I liked it. I tried another recipe that didn't have any nutmeg and used 1 tsp of baking soda and no baking powder. I have to say that this recipe was much better! I now love it and will make it again.

This was a terrible disappointment. It was rather bland and had WAY too much nutmeg for my taste.  Seemed like the recipe was missing something - salt maybe?  I won't be making this again.

Holy oil, Batman! I was very skeptical at putting an entire cup of oil in these (I made muffins) but since I didn't have any applesauce and didn't feel like making my own or cruising to the store, I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and poured it in contributing to America's heart disease problem. Since I made muffins they only had to bake about 20 minutes. I am VERY pleasantly surprised! They are wonderful! And I figure if I don't eat the entire batch (I'm going to give some away), go to the gym twice a day every day for the next week I should be good. I will definitely be making these again but this time I will cut the oil with applesauce.

Fantastic! A great way to use up all that yellow squash that pops up in the garden come July/August. I sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking and it was delicious.

Very good! I went with 2 large squash and grated one coarse and one fine. Came in a little under 2 cups so I mashed a banana and added that in for some extra flavor.  Did 2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat and lessened the sugar. I poured into 2 bread pans (one loaf would have been small) and then topped with a crumble recipe I saw in the other comments. After in the oven for a few minutes I read another review that stated that they did not cook well as loaves. I removed them, scraped off the crumbs, retopped and then cooked in a 9x12 as recommended.  The crumbs were a little mixed through and it. After all of that, it came out great!! Will make again, just will start with the proper pan from the beginning.

After reading the other reviews, I modified the recipe in the following ways: reduced white sugar to 1 1/4 cups; substituted 1 c veg oil for 1/2 c veg oil and 1/2 c applesauce; reduced nutmeg to 1 1/2 tsp.  Also I only used 1 c shredded summer squash with 1 c mashed overripe bananas, and I sprinkled brown sugar on top.  This made it more of a banana-squash hybrid bread, and it was denser than regular banana or zucchini bread, but still tasty.  It's almost like a breakfast bread or coffee cake.

This was pretty good.  I also decreased the amount of nutmeg and a little less than 1tsp was plenty.  I read other reviews saying that the baking time was too long.  I cooked it maybe 10 extra minutes, continually checking it (checking to see if toothpick came out clean every few minutes).  When it was finally done after careful monitoring, it was a good bread, but kind of dry and nothing really special.  If I hadn't sprinkled walnuts and brown sugar on top before baking, I think this would've been still good, but pretty boring.  Lesson learned: Squash certainly works in bread, but doesn't pack much punch.

This recipe was too good to change a single thing! Was thrilled to find such a good recipe to use the abundance I had of squash. I shredded and froze some just so I can enjoy this bread all winter as well! My family and co-workers all liked this!

Ok, so when I made this bread, it was a disaster!!! It was one of those cooking casualties  never really thought it would ever happen to you. It was more like soup than anything even close to resembling bread. I must say, the flavour was good despite the soupy concoction that found it's way around the oven. Now (I must be honest, I was baking this with the assistance of little hands doing the measuring and despite what I was told, I believe that only two cups of flour found it's way into the batter. And for this I must take responsibility.) But with no idea what to do with the soupy mixture, I poured it onto a rimmed baking sheet and on 375 degrees in ten minute intervals (about four times [40 minutes], moving it around with a spatula to somewhat resemble granola, it made a excellent topping for your early morning oatmeal!! So I give this recipe 3 stars because it's flavour is quite enchanting (somewhat like a holiday bread) and it will suffice for using up all that garden squash you all of the sudden realized you had on your hands. (But be prepared with other ideas, it only calls for two cups.) :)

Great recipe.  I had been wondering if yellow squash can be used in quick breads like zucchini is.  Answer:  YES! I bet this is even better as written, but I did make some changes.  (Don't we all?)  Trying to control carbs a bit I did make some substitutions:  instead of white flour used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup rolled oats.  The pastry flour is more finely ground than regular whole wheat flour.  Also used 2 cups splenda, 1 cup non-fat dry milk, and 1 tsp baking powder instead of sugar.  Sugar adds volume to baked goods so because I used splenda, this only made one 9 x 5 loaf -- which was plenty. Next time will use sugar but only 1 cup instead of 2.  Also subbed 1/2 the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce.  Will use all applesauce next time. Didn't use any nutmeg. Moist and flavorful!  Thanks Unforgetable!

This bread is very tasty! I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf and it worked out perfectly. I followed the recipe completely aside from adding an additional tsp. of cinnamon and reducing one tsp. of the nutmeg. I will try the lighter version next time by substituting applesauce for the oil.

I don't know what I did wrong with this, but it's the most tasteless bread I've ever made!  I substituted half a cup of applesauce for the oil and cut half a cup of the sugar.  Maybe that was it, but anyway this is not a repeat for me!

Yummy!  I subbed splenda for sugar, and you'd never know.  My kids actually like this better than zuccini bread.  The yellow flecks are more inconspicuous than green zuccini flecks.  Very moist and freezes well

I really loved this!  I used others' suggestions:  I did 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, did 3/4 cup splenda, 1 cup sugar (I think), only added a few shakes of nutmeg b/c I thought it'd be overpowering, and sprinkled brown sugar on the top.  Yummy!!!  I had to bake longer since I did in two loaves and they were deeper than a 9x13 pan.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was very tasty. I omitted the spices and added lemon juice and lemon rind. Its a very tasty bread and worth the time it takes to bake. Will be using this one again to use up the squash from the garden.

Pretty good recipe--the boys at my house really liked it--I didn't read the other reviews, so if I make again I will read reviews first--however it is a great way to use up extra summer squash.

Good recipe. Following the advice of others, I too cut down on the sugar and nutmeg and sprinkled top with brown sugar. Will probably make again when I have extra squash.

I made this bread over the weekend. It was really good. I change it some. I used Strawberry orange yogurt and half the oil. I added Blueberries and walnuts. I also used half a tsp of Lemon extract instead of the vanilla. I thought it made for a fresher summer bread. The neighbors loved it.

It is really a very good bread, and something fun to make with extra squash.  I ended up using 3 tsp of apple pie spice instead of the nutmeg and cinnamon, and whisking it instead of using a mixer, and it still turned out really great!  I fixed it in a loaf pan.  It had to cook about half an hour longer, but it turned out really really good :)  I hope to make this again :)

My husband & I thought it was too sweet, but my stepdaughter thought it was fantastic. I would add apples and possibly some nuts next time I make it, for added flavor and texture.

Made this tonigh with my 4 year old. It was great but next time I would try it with wheat flour and the butter & oil. The nutmeg and cinnamon were right on for us but we love that pumpkin spice taste. We will make this again.

So delicious! I was up to my ears in squash courtesy of the community garden and this was a great way to use at leat some of it. I brought this bread to a cook-out and everyone loved it! I decreased the sugar to 1&1/2 cups because I was using dark brown sugar and the bread came out sweet enough. I also used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup milk instead of the full cup of oil, and following some of the other reviwers' advice decreased the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon. Whole wheat pastry flour also made for a wonderful flavor and texture. Next time I might add some chopped nuts though. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

I made this bread recently and was not impressed.  It was moist but quite honestly had no taste. I wouldn't make this again.

My family LOVED this recipe! My 22 month old could not get enough! And my picky husband who is not the fan of banana bread fell in love with the summer squash bread. The only thing I did different was I did 1 cup of canola oil and 1 cup of veggie oil. And I put them in two loaf pans.

This is more of a cake recipe than a bread recipe. My family said they would have liked it better if I frosted it. The only change I made was using 1 teas. of nutmeg instead of 2. Otherwise, I probably won't make it again.
