My crab cake recipe is very similar to this one, but mine has no breadcrumbs.  Why should crab cakes always have filling?  You want to taste the crab, not breadcrumbs.  Use 3-1/2 Tbs. flour and 1/4 tsp. baking powder, and add a splash of Sherry to these remaining ingredients.  Cook in a combination of butter and oil.  Trust me, the crab cakes will stay together without the breadcrumbs.  Fabulous recipe.

Super! Searched high and low for a recipe as good as the crab cakes served at Savannah Chop House and these come closest! Too many other recipes use too much Old Bay seasoning or peppers and other extraneous ingredients that take away from the crab flavor. If you like Old Bay seasoning, mix some in mayonnaise, a tinch of ketchup and lemon juice for a nice sauce to serve on the side. Truly wonderful crab cakes! The only improvement could be if I used freshly shelled crab vs. frozen crab meat. Made them for my husband's birthday and he was thrilled, thanking me over and over. Thanks for the recipe! Oh, they are soft when you mold them, but I just plopped a big spoonful right into the crumbs, then patted them together with my hands for a thick crumb coating. Helps if you use more oil to fry.

I like a minimal amount of filler in my crab cakes but I was disappointed that no crumbs at all were used in this recipe to bind the crab mixture.  It was easy enough to remedy, of course, but in my view it should have been included.  I used finely crushed saltine crackers, maybe 1/3 cup, just enough to hold those luscious HUGE chunks of lump crabmeat together.  I liked the addition of the mustard and I liked the omission of Old Bay Seasoning, so common in other crab cake recipes, even better.  In my opinion it only detracts from the taste of very expensive lump crab.  I added a tablespoon of melted butter to the crab mixture for extra richness. I packed the crab cakes firmly before coating them in Japanese panko bread crumbs.  I did not use high heat.  I wanted to be sure the crab cakes were cooked and heated through before the crumb coating became too dark.  Medium to medium-high heat worked well.  These were awesome.  Big chunks of crab, little filler, minimal additions and seasonings make all the difference in the world for perfect crab cakes.  To complement and garnish them I plated them with "Avocado-Mango Salsa," and "Mustard Cream  Sauce," recipes also from this site, and a few leaves of arugula.

So the crab cakes didn't hold together very well when we were making them, but they sure were tasty! I used canned crab since fresh is hard to come by here and requires a lot of work, and achieved similar results. Don't use a lot of oil, they'll only fall apart easier, and that aspect of this recipe really wasn't necessary. Just a bit of butter/margarine in the bottom of the pan is good.

Authentic Eastern Shore taste. Added a bit more Worcestershire sauce and also some Old Bay. I find that refrigerating breaded items helps them stay together. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a big hit with my husband. He said he wished he hadn't eaten earlier so he could eat more. I did add a little extra worcestershire, a couple tsp. of lime juice, & a little Old Bay. They held together just fine once the first side was done. This will be added to my regular meal rotation! Thanks!

I modified the recipe just a bit.  I used a mixture of real and imitation crab, added 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning, and 1/2 tsp lemon juice.  Once I molded (or tried to mold the cakes) they kept falling apart, so I re-mixed the crab mixture with the crackers (a sleeve of Ritz brand) and they held together much better.  My husband and I liked them, but next time I will use canned crab for a finer texture - it's hard to find fresh crabmeat here in the mountains of PA!

I couldn't find fresh crab and used imitation.  It needed to be run through a food processor or something (which I don't have).  Otherwise delicious.  Disappeared in no time!

Excellent!  I only did two tiny little tweaks - not based on any shortcoming in the recipe, but just on personal preference.  I added a couple TBS of very finely chopped celery, and about 1/8 of a tsp of cayenne...just for a little pop!  Loved them...even my "crab neutral" husband liked them.

I picked this crab cake recipe because I wanted a CRAB cake, not a crab and breadcrumb cake, and this recipe seemed to fit the bill. I used these ingredients, although I wanted a little more flavor so used a teaspoon of Worcestershire and a teaspoon of ground mustard and a few tablespoons of fresh parsley for the color. The only thing I really changed was the order of putting this together. I think that the best crab cakes have lumps of crab, not shredded bits of crab, so to achieve this I whisked together the egg, mayo, seasonings and then folded in the crab. Then I rolled the crab into 1/4 cup balls and refrigerated for about half hour while I got the rest of dinner together. Then I rolled some of the balls in Ritz cracker crumbs, and some in Panko, honestly I couldn't tell the difference, so will use Panko next time as it is much easier. I fried them in two batches in a mix of 1T olive oil and 1T butter per batch. You have to be careful putting them in and flipping them, but the flavor of the crab really comes through and makes it worth the extra care.

This was absolutely delicious!! Not only was it good, it was also very simple to make--this is coming from someone who is not very familiar with the kitchen. My husband couldn't believe i made this. The only suggestion i would make--if you want to add more texture and flavor--is to add finely chopped red peppers and green onions. Also, if you want a  creamy sauce add some mayo to the mix.

Very good.  Just a little on the bland side.  I added Old Bay.  Next time I will add some other seasonings.  My 2 yr old loved crushing the crackers and he even ate some of the crab cake.

Oh Mike! This recipe is wonderful!  Crab is SO expensive now that you do not want a bad recipe when you make them.  It just read like a good one and it certainly is. Husband loves them!

Great recipe w/o changes. I used Ritz crackers to cover and butter and oil to fry. I like Worcestershire sauce so i added more than a dash. Yum!

Much better than I expected!  Never had it without bread crumbs mixed in, so I was expected it to be too soggy and not hold together.  It did though and tastes much better than any I had before!  I did have to add a few things though...sorry.  I chopped some celery, onion, and carrots up fine and added 1/4 cup total.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of horseradish.  Incredibly tasty!

I'm sorry but I just really did not enjoy these crab cakes very much at all. I used fresh crab meat that had been packaged at my grocery store so it had the consistency of tunafish. I thought this would work out well since several members commented on the patties not wanting to stay together. I also added the Old Bay seasoning like others suggested. I didnt have any problems with the patties not staying together, but I just didn't like the taste of these at all. I want a recipe that has some sort of stuffing inside. These tasted kind of bland and I think with the stuffing you get a variety of flavors (not just all crab meat).

This was my first time making crab cakes and I must say they had a great flavor and browned very nicely. I was expecting something with a store-bought flavor, but they were MUCH better. I did have some trouble keeping them together and added another egg and a few more crackers along with the juice of half a lemon.  Delicious - I will make them again.

Used fresh crab meat from crabs that I caught the day b-4. It was good, my company liked them and that's all that matters. Must have a sauce that you put on them. I used a cilantro-lime sauce kicked up a notch!  It was very good too.=0)

I made these last night, my 4 year old son loved them! Instead of crackers I used Panko crumbs and I added garlic salt and a little steak seasoning. Like a few other reviewers, I had a hard time keeping some of them together, but it seemed to be because the lumps of meat where too big. I just let them break apart in the oil and cooked them the same; those ones were the perfect bite size for my kids :) I ate mine with cocktail sauce and the boys used ketchup (blech lol, kids and ketchup xD)  I will definitely make these again :)

I LOVED these crab cakes, I made them for my family and they were gobbled up!! I added green, red, and yellow diced peppers with a little green onion and parsley. I used butter instead of oil and I used ritz crackers to roll them in! They were FANTASTIC! I also made the spicy shrimp and grits to go along with the crab cakes.  They were the BEST shrimp and grits I have EVER tasted!! Follow the recipe exactly!!

Delicious tasty crab cakes. One reason I chose to make this was because there were minimal seasonings and no fillers (bread crumbs or crackers) on inside. I like that there was mustard inside the lump crabmeat. I did add a tadbit of dijon mustard to the crabmeat plus 1/2 tsp of ground mustard. I gently breaded the crabcakes in the crushed crackers. I chilled the crabmeat for an hour in the refrigerator so it would not fall apart easily while frying and maintain its shape. I heated up the oil on medium high heat. They took about 4 minutes on each side, nice and golden brown.  I think these turned out awesome, as they did not fall apart at all and had a nice balance of flavors. I could taste all the lumped crabmeat. I served these with mustard cream sauce, from this website. I will definitely make these again.

Had some trouble keeping the crab cakes from falling apart. Made them a bit smaller and coated them more with bread crumbs 2nd time around to help them stay in place. My husband loved them....

Like others, I had trouble keeping the cakes from falling apart, so I added crushed saltines until I was able to form a cohesive ball of crab mixture.  Other than that hiccup, I thought it was a great recipe in its simplicity and I will definitely make again.

First I would like to say that I have never made crab cakes before.  This recipe is supper easy and very good.  I used more mustard than the recipe called for.  I also made a spicy mayo as a topping.  (Just mayo, cayanne, and paprika adjust to your taste - I like mine hot).  I would recomend this recipe to any first time makers.  This is a can't miss!

We all really liked these, they were somewhat easy to make (hardest part was to make the patties) and they really were delicious and surprisingly filling! We did use breadcrumbs though, was out of crackers - but I'll use the crackers next time, I'm sure that would be even tastier :) and we fried in a little butter for the flavor - so good!! I made homemade tartar sauce as well and served on onion rolls - will definitely make these again!

I liked the base of the recipe but it did lack flavor, next time I think less crackers and one more egg and add more fresh herbs. Thanks for the recipe though, it's great to go from!

Absolutely fabulous! I was a bit skeptical because we used Starkist Chunked Crab Meat in stead of the expensive stuff, however these crab cakes tasted EXACTLY like they came from a restaurant! Thanks so much for such a phenomenal recipe!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I added a little more mayo since it was hard to keep the crab cakes together.  The end result was well worth the effort.  LOVED THEM AND WILL MAKE THEM AGAIN.

My husband and I made these today, they had a great crunchy coating and were nice and tender inside. He feels they were a little tasteless and I love plain seafood so I enjoyed the natural crab flavor. I would certainly add these to my Summer Menu. We served them up with Coleslaw and Corn on the cob for a wonderful meal

This is a great recipe.  The crackers added a crispy factor that you can't get from bread crumbs. Simple and delicous, which makes the crab stand out.

The first review on this recipe confused me as I couldn't figure out where they got breadcrumbs from, unless they meant the crakers. . . ??? Anyway this was a perfect pair for my husbands birthday steak dinner! He said they were the best crab cakes he's ever had! The majority of this recipe is crab meat so the end result is basically lump crab meat with a crispy outside! YUM

Felt that these cakes left a LOT to be desired.  Out of the four cakes, only one didn't crumble in the pan.  From the bits that I did eat, I noticed that there was a total lack of flavor - not something I was prepared for going off the rave reviews.  Good starting recipe but not something I'd do again.

Very good!  I added dill to the crab and on top afterwards.  Served on a spinach salad with feta, walnuts, and dried cranberries.  If I made a change, next time I would add more spice.

These were awesome! The only thing I changed was to add a couple of Tbs of crumbs to crab and then to form the patties in my hands with the crumbs. I also refrigerated for about 1/2 hr like a previous user mentioned. I also added 1/2 tsp of old bay. Yummy. I used left over king crab leg meat. I cooked in 1/2 marg and 1/2 O.O. till golden.

This was a wonderful recipe, though I did add 1/2 tsp Old Bay, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and a clove of minced garlic.  The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because they fell apart.  I used imitation crab meat and chopped it with a food chopper.  I did not use all the oil it called for.  I just poured some in the pan and fried them like pancakes.  They were so tasty my husband asked for more.

Fantastic!! I've read how others had problems with them falling apart. It is pretty loose but they seemed to do well for me, maybe the crab cake gods were smiling down into my kitchen or something close to that. LOL They were very good, as the recipe is written but I do look forward to trying a couple suggestions, such as green onions and maybe some Old Bay seasoning, as well.

These were amazing. Accidently added the crackers to the mixture instead of rolling them in them which I think was nicer. Added a little parsley and thai seasoning.Also used canned crab meat.

Very good! However, I did add 1/3 cup of breadcrumbs to the mix just to help hold the crab mixture together. Otherwise, did everything else as directed and it was awesome!

Very good. I used 1/2 the bread crumbs and, being southern, I had to add some cajun spice.  The trick to keeping the patties together is to not turn them until it is absolutely necessary.

This recipe made grocery store "canned" claw crab meat taste good, so I can only imagine how great these would be with good/fresh crab meat!  I added some finely diced green and red bell pepper for a little texture/flavor, as well as bit of green onion.  I hadn't read the recipe closely, apparently, and added some crackers TO the crab mix.  No biggie, I just crushed a little more to roll the balls in.  I chose to then flatten the coated balls into more a cake like shape.  I used a dash of EVOO and 1TBSP butter to fry 4 patties in (1/2 the recipe made 4 small-medium patties for me...more than enough for me and Mr. LTH).  Mr. LTH isn't even a crab cake fan and he commented multiple times how great dinner was this evening.  I served the crab cakes w/"Mustard Cream Sauce" from this site, which is a fantastic compliment to these crab cakes.  THANKS for the recipe, Mike Skirko!

One of the best of many recipes for Crab Cakes.  Excellent, and with the correct amount of crab.  NOT all filler.

Very good crab cakes, added a pinch more mayo, and only needed about 8 ritz crackers that I crumbled directly in as the last ingredient. then refrigerated the mixture for about a half an hour, allowed for better patty making. 2-3 mins per side in canola oil. and serve.

I'm from PR, and we love "tasty food"; your crab cakes are great! I serve it with a simple sauce of melted butter, smashed garlic and a pinch of just sqeezed lemon juice.

A very good recipe!! Everyone loved them. I was concerned about the cakes falling apart while frying, since I have had that problem in the past. I fried them in my deep frier and they came out perfect. I did end up using more crackers than called for in the recipe, but this is still definitely a keeper!!

After reading all of the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed with these crab cakes. They just weren't all that spectacular to me. To solve problem of them falling apart, I added additional crumbs into the crab/egg/mayo mixture until it reached a texture that would hold. I then gave the formed balls a quick roll in the crumbs to give the outside layer a good coating before frying them. Other than that, I made it as is. Just okay.

I tried it with canned crab meat and it was pretty good (though it didn't need any extra salt).  Needs some sort of sauce, though.

Ok, these crab cakes gave me a really good jumping off point.  We used imitation crab and we had to run it through the food processer to chop it fine.  Then I added dill and garlic powder and old bay seasoning to the crab in addition to the ground mustard. we chilled it for 20 minutes, and just as we were getting ready to form the cakes, we added the crushed crackers to the crab, instead of rolling them.  they held together MUCH better, and everyone in my family LOVED them!!  (even my 3 year old, and he's PICKY!!!) we will definatly be adding this to our regular rotation.  Also, for something different, add a teaspoon of dill and a 1/2 tsp garlic powder to 3 tsp of mayo and use as a dipping sauce or sandwich spread. Gives the cakes a different taste than just plain butter.

This recipe was fantastic. I didn't have fresh crab meat on hand, so I used chunk imitation crab meat which I was a bit hesitant about. However, I  had the brilliant idea to blend the crab meat in the Ninja blender along with the other ingredients. It was a bit too dry at first, and the blender stalled, so I added another egg, and voila! The texture was perfect, and the consistency lended itself to crab cakes that didn't fall apart. I couldn't believe how good these turned out, especially because I live in Maryland. (Shh... don't tell: New Orleans crab cakes are my favorite  :-) My husband was equally impressed. Thank you for the recipe - easy and delicious!

I'm sure this is a great recipe but I think I lack the skills to make it, lol. I can cook, don't get me wrong, but this one just didn't work for me.

My crab meat - or should I say fake crab meat... which I'm sure is why it failed... didn't seem to bind well with anything and so I just had flaky pieces of crab that didn't stay together long enough to reach the frying pan. 

I have no idea if I needed to have cut or blended the crab smaller, I tried that and it didn't really help much. I added biscuit mix in and dumped the crumbs into the crab mix to dry it up a bit and make more of a mush.

... that helped but I still lacked the frying skills. So I gave up. It's not often I give up on a recipe and it has nothing to do with the recipe itself as others obviously were able to make it just fine. So I chalk this one up as a "I need to learn to work better with sea food" on my list.

4 Stars because it's a simple recipe, tasted fine.  However I won't try this one again until I improve my skills.

These were better than I expected a crab cake to be - I took someone's advice and added Sherry and lemon juice - they turned out great but a little salty (probably my fault for adding salt and old bay lol) - definitely would make again

Used imitation crab in place of real, saltine crackers in place of buttery round. Added some dill & cajun seasoning. I also double dipped with crackers. Put them in crackers as instructed then quickly dipped in an egg mixture and re-coated with cracker. Served with corn fritters, Pillsbury southern style bisquits and southern style gravy, as well as some cajun red beans.
