Hi all.  I'm the submitter, and just wanted to clarify a few things.  

First, many people do not realize that when it calls for MAYO, it means real Mayonnaise like Hellman's or Kraft's.  NOT MIRACLE WHIP. 

Also, when you mix it up, it should sit overnight in the fridge.  That part was omitted when they posted the recipe...not sure why.

And last, I used Zesty Italian mix, which is much zippier than the regular.  It is definitely saltier than some may like, but if the cucumber is thick enough, then it cuts the saltiness.  I read where someone basically shaved the cucumber for some thin slices, but we like biting into a chunk of cucumber that's sitting on a dollop of the dip.  Like another reader, we've had this stuff for breakfast on many occasions!  It's THAT good!  

I've never had a left over when I take this to any function or event.  Best of luck!

WOW!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!  The hardest part is peeling and slicing the cukes...and how hard is that!!?!!  My kids LOVED this recipe!  And she wasn't kidding.  I took it to a company potluck, and SHAZAM!  They were gone immediately!!

I like to mix in an 8oz block of cream cheese with the mayo and dressing mix to give it a little more glue to hold the cucumber onto the bread.

I've made these twice-there have not been any left over.  They are really tasty.  I didn't peel the cucumber and I added a little more mayo-great.

This was the tastiest cuc sandwich I've had.  I chopped the cucumber very small, got rid of excess liquid and mixed right in with mayo mix.  Excellent!!

I had a large holiday party and served these sandwiches.  One small child ate three and the rest sat untouched. Although it is a simple recipe, it is unremarkable.

Very good, but they seemed a little salty? I halved the recipe maybe I misjudged the half of packet mix. Other than that they were really good. I'll probably make this again. Thanks.

This recipe was so simple. I think that it really makes a difference how much of the dip you put on each piece of bread and how much cucumber. If you don't have enough dip it's very dry and tasteless and if your cucumber is sliced thick all you taste is cucumber. I used my peeler to slice the cucumber and put three very thin slices on each little bread and I also put a nice amount of dip on each slice and mine turned out really good. I think it's great when the kids will each what you make and this is one way to get a cucumber in them and still make them happy. Great recipe, Thanks.

Took these to a party.  The men loved them; the women not so much.  I thought the mayo mixture was too salty.  I did add some grated carrots and that was well received.

If you had success with this recipe, then PLEASE tell us which brand of italian dressing mix you used.... I made this for a party, and it was absolutely horrible (even my eat-anything husband said it was foul).  Since it has so many other great reviews I can only assume it must be the dressing mix I used (I used the only one available at my grocery store, which was Good Seasons brand regular Italian dressing mix).  I tried to save it, but it was beyond help -- the flavors just did not go together at all.  Sorry...

I was looking for something simple to make and it was.  It looked nicer than plain sandwiches.  Flaver was OK, nothing special - doubt if I will make again.  Everyone has different tastes - so try it yourself....thanks

I didn't like  the taste.  Prefer just cucumber and cream cheese.  Also, the cocktail party bread is just seasonal.

Made for appetizer at party. Well received.  Rye bread is not my favorite so I switched to long thin French Bread baguette sliced and lightly toasted. Also, as someone else suggested,  I used about 3 oz of whipped cream cheese to add a little fluffy, thickness to the spread. Really enjoyed.
