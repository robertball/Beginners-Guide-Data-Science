Love it! Very simple quick yet elegant martini to make. It tasted like a dessert instead of a drink which I will say becareful they may sneak up on you:) I used regular coffee instead of espresso and drizzled a cold martini glass with chocolate prior to adding the mixed drink.  I also made a non alcoholic version of the drink using Baileys non-alcoholic creamer for the kids. Will definitely be making these again!

This was pretty yummy, but dangerous though cause this martini tasted like a delectable dessert drink. Forgot there was vodka in it for a minute and started drinking it quicker than needed. I shook a little bit of ground espresso in the drink as well as rimmed the glass with a little espresso powder and tiny bit of sugar. However this drink is already cloyingly sweet so adding any sugar is not needed even though the presentation is nice!

This martini is good!  I do have to say that it took 2 servings to fill the glass but it was delicious!  No changes needed! And, definitely no complaints!  Next time though, I want to try grating a cocoa covered espresso bean on top to just make it even more elegant.

Such a simple drink! I used coffee instead of espresso and grated some chocolate on top. Wonderful smooth flavor from the Baileys.

This is super easy to make and it tastes like adult chocolate milk! If you donâ€™t have espresso, iced coffee makes a great substitute. I garnished mine with some grated dark chocolate - yum!
