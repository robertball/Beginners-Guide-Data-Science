Very good, simple but different than regular asparagus. I made this exactly as written and was not disappointed. Sesame oil and seeds are a must--do not omit or change-- as those flavours are what make this recipe unique.

This was wonderful with a great fresh flavor. I used olive oil in place of the peanut oil just because I didn't have any. Everything else I followed exactly. It turned out great.

so tasty just like it is... but I found adding some mushrooms and shredded chicken turned it from a yummy side dish to a quick easy main dish!

I love the nutty taste of the sesame seeds and the sharp ginger taste combined with the earthy taste of the asparagus!  Great color and taste combination!

I made this today for Easter dinner, and everyone loved it. I didn't have peanut oil, so used olive oil instead. Also, used 3 cloves of garlic, chopped, instead of ginger, since I'm not a big fan of ginger. I'll make this again, but I'll cook the asparagus in the sesame oil for more flavor.

Excellent change for a veggie side dish we eat regularly. Don't omit toasting the sesame seeds. This is very good and I will make asparagus this way again soon.

Fabulous.  A new "go to" recipe for asparagus.  I usually roast asparagus but this was great -- and could all be done on the stovetop.  Great in hot weather.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Outstanding!! The only change I made was an attempt to use just a little less oil for stir frying as I'm trying to concentrate on lowering calories in my cooking. I can't wait to share this with friends and extended family. Yummy!

Pretty flavorful recipe! My advice on the timing. A 2 minute blanch will give you crisp asparagus. 3 minutes will give you soft asparagus. I prefer going a bit short. I added soy sauce as well. Great side dish for any Asian meal.

Quite tasty; and probably less calories than either the Parmesan or Hollandaise covered spears I usually prepare.  But there were too many steps and therefore it was too time consuming.

Stir-fried Sesame Asparagus Haiku: "This was just okay. Would rather roasted or grilled. Still, we're glad we tried!" Thanks for the new way to prepare asparagus as a side dish; the ginger and sesame seeds were nice additions (used only sesame oil - no peanut oil - and that was my only small change. For a side, we prefer grilling or roasting our asparagus; however, the flavors in this recipe would've been very good w/ the addition of chicken, onions and other veggies for an all-out stir-fry main dish.

I made a variation of this tonight, because I wanted to make a stir fry meal out of it.  I cut up 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and coated it with corn starch.  Stir frying the chicken until done, I removed it from the pan and then added the asparagus with 4 sliced green onions, stir frying with the ginger, until hot.  I then added the chicken back in to warm up total pan.  I sprinkled it with sesame seeds and a light amount of dried red pepper flakes, to add some "heat".  Once off the stove, I drizzled lightly with sesame oil and mixed.  We had it over brown rice and it was a hit!  Will be making it again!  Thanks for the idea and the jump start to a new dish!!

With a few modifications, this was an amazing recipe! This can be a side dish as is, or add some chicken for a main dish! Fantastic!

Way too nutty.  Over powered the taste of the asparagus!
