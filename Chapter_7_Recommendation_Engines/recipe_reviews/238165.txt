Yummmmmmy! Followed the recipe pretty much  as directed and man was this good! The wife and son approved.  People had seconds and thirds. I'd eat the whole tray if I had no self control! Here's how I did it:

I boiled the lasagna first, rinsed it with cold water and then laid it out on baking sheets covered with towels to get rid of excess liquid. While they rested I cooked the spinach (used a bag of frozen chopped), shredded the carrots (2 cups not 1, I would actually do 3 to 4 cups next time. We like carrots), I didn't have 45 minutes to roast garlic, so I took the skin off of all of the cloves and roasted them in a pan. To speed the garlic process up i added about 3 table spoons or water to the pan and covered it to cook them threw. The water boiled off and then they roasted some more. 

I made Alfredo sauce next. That sauce is to die for. I would double that next time or maybe quadruple and use it as a dipping sauce for bread or to put on top of the lasagna while serving. It was so so good  

I cooked it exactly as directed and it came out perfect.

Thank you! Happy family for dinner with plenty of leftovers.

This was a very good veggie lasagna. The flavors were well balanced, and I thought the texture was good. I think it could use a bit more sauce (that was good enough to use as an Alfredo sauce on its own). Overall, a great repeat recipe.  Thanks, carpiemae!

This recipe is awesome! I doubled it and made it for a church lunch this morning. I forgot to add the red pepper flakes, which may or may not have been a mistake for church. I thought it was a little bland without them. I also used all heavy cream since our power had been off and I wanted to use the cream before it soured. I didn't have quite the required amount of ricotta, so I threw in a scoop of cottage cheese to make up the difference. The next time I make this I am going to cut the Italian seasoning down to half of what the recipe called for and add fresh basil instead.
