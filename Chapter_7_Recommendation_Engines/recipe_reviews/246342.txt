I've been wanting Ingersoll to try a healthy alternative to pasta and decided to give this recipe a shot. Wow! The whole family loved it, in fact my family prefers it to real pasta. I just added a little garlic to the oil that I sautéed the zucchini in and followed the rest of h e directions to a tee. Delicious!

I love Zoodles and this is a new recipe for me. The avocado with pesto was a pleasant change, I used Morningstar vegetarian meatless chick’n strips in place of the chicken and it was very tasty. I could have used another zucchini, it was delicious but a bit rich.

My avocado had gone bad, so I substituted some guacamole in my freezer. It added a little zip.

I made it with some adjustments/substitutions because I have Mast Cell Activation Disorder and have to follow a low-histamine, autoimmune protocol diet. It was still VERY GOOD and satisfied a desire for something creamy and cheesy even though I made it without dairy except for grass-fed Kerrygold butter (the best kind of butter and is a healthy fat). Even my husband and friend -- who have no dietary restrictions -- liked it. We were impressed that the zoodles retained their al dente texture even with re-heating as leftovers. 

I only had 1.5 lb package of chicken breast and four organic zucchini and that ratio was waaaay too much protein. I bought 6 more zucchini the next day, and that ratio was perfect. So 10 zucchini to 1.5 lbs chicken breast ... means that I used almost double what the recipe called for. Oh wait, it doesn't say 1 lb chicken breast. It says 1 chicken breast. Then I guess I used a similar ratio. That's confusing and in my opinion the recipe should include more exact measurements since chicken breasts come in all sizes. 

I always buy organic zucchini because zucchini are on the EWG's dirty dozen list for produce meaning they retain a large amount of pesticide residues, so organic is best for health.

I made my own pesto (EVOO, garlic, basil, parsley, walnuts and macadamia nuts, S+P) and used the whole batch. 

For the second batch of zoodles I added a bunch of salt and let them sit for 30 minutes to sweat out extra liquid. Then rinsed and dried them in a sal

Excellent! I left my zucchini a bit crunchy. I also used cashew pesto and added some extra cashews on top. This is certainly a quick and easy dinner that will keep the family happy. Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe! Its a huge hit with my vegetarian friends as well! What I found worked well with keeping the moisture content down that would leak out of the zucchini while cooking, is after spiralizing the zucchini put it in a bowl with paper towel underneath and overtop to soak up the moisture. I’ve left it in for a day or two and it keeps the integrity of the pesto instead of diluting it. I like to serve it with a couple big seared scallops!

It’s a great “base” recipe!  I hate when people do reviews knowing they can doctor it up.  I didn’t do a lot different but the possibilities are endless to what you can add. Maybe some edamame for me next time? I will def make again!!!

I forgot the parmesan but it was still good.  I didn't have enough zucchini so I cooked some thin spaghetti.

Turned out okay. I tried the frozen zucchini noodles...prob a mistake but my daughter has my spiralizer....fresh would have been much better. I cut out the chicken to keep it veg friendly. We are HUGE avo eaters here...I used half to 3/4 a large one. Followed the recipe but to sauté thinly sliced onion and mushrooms for body, before trying to thaw that brick of zucchini....never again Green Giant! I think I like the idea of adding guacamole vs avo...I'll have to try that for more of a pop next time. I did add red pepper flakes but I think they were lost in the frozen menagerie of squash. Thank you for the idea HF!

I omitted the chicken to move this to a side dish.  I also used 2 avocados to make it creamier along with extra homemade pesto for a saucier dish.  I left the zucchini long which next time I will cut the lengths in half out of the spriralizer to make more individual servings.  It turned out great.  We will definitely make this again.

Yum!
Had to sub in some fresh guacamole for the avocado but otherwise I left the recipe as is, and it was great! Mom and I both liked it. Would definitely make again.
Sprinkled  some red pepper flakes on at the end for a little zip, as well :)

Super quick and easy recipe!  I used Costco basil pesto, garlic salt (instead of regular salt) and added toasted pine nuts to finish. As other suggested, I also cooked the zucchini just enough to keep it a little crunchy. Delicious! A big hit with our teenagers.

Well, this was lovely! And so quick to make too. 
I used tomato pesto and after the vegan chicken was cooked I put the noodles and everything in the same pan for a few minutes so the zoodles would still be firm to bite.
Thank you for the recipe HF...I'm keeping this one!

This is such a great, quick and easy dinner with a lot of flavor! I steamed the zoodles and turned out really well!
