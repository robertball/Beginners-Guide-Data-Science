Hands down, prepare it this way and you will love it!  Make two small patties and place a wad of blue cheese crumbles in the middle.  This will prevent the blue cheese from burning away like it does when mixed into the meat mixture.  When cooking, the blue cheese flavor will melt throughout.  Also, pair it will the "Texas Slaw" by: CINP on this site.  Great with or without a bun!  Trust me on this!  : )

3 out of 3 people in my home loved these so i have to give them a 5-star rating!!!  WE didn't change much about the recipe.  We did NOT mix the bleu cheese into the meat, we didn't have onion so we used onion and garlic powder and I used about 1-2 tbsp. of buffalo sauce instead of 1/3 cup.  The mixture seemed too mushy to add all of the liquid.  I also let the mixture stand in the fridge for a bit before forming the patties, so they could set up a little.  I think this was an important step.
We grilled the chicken patties, grilled the buns, sprinkled the bleu cheese crumbles on top of the cooked patties and  squirted more sauce on the buns.  Dip in Ranch if you want to be really bad.  
All in all, I wasn't too sure about my first go-round with ground chicken, but these were MUCH better than expected and will be made again.

This recipe was ok. The ground chicken just didn't mesh with the other ingredients. The next time I made it I used real half chicken breasts for these burgers and adding some melted jack or mozzerella cheese to it. Much better!

These turned out pretty good for something different but I wouldn't serve them for company. I used the log ground turkey from Aldi (1.19 for a lb). I also added some poultry seasoning for a little more flavor. I followed the advice of the reviewers and made 8 patties with the blue cheese in the middle. Then I froze them on wax paper for 15 minutes or so for easier grilling. I topped these with letttuce and wing sauce mixed with mayo for a condiment. If I make these again I would make them the same way but also add extra blue cheese as a topping (I couldn't really taste it)

o yum! i changed these a little, and with my changes i felt these were 5 star quality.  i subbed jalapeno cheddar for the bleu cheese, added ranch dressing to the burgers, upped the wing sauce to 2/3 cup, and added an egg to help hold it together better.  these were soooo stinkin good!  i mixed ranch dressing with hot sauce and slathered that on top, as well as some shredded jalapeno cheddar, lettuce, and tomato.  i will make these again for sure, thanks!!

We made these burgers exactly as listed. The flavor was good but the consistency left 2 starving college boys with most of their burger on their plate. The color made it very hard to tell when the patties were done. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Absolutely loved these burgers. Tasted like hot wings on a bun! Used Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce (not the original kind). I added extra blue cheese on top, and made a nice spicy sauce with Mayo & the hot wing sauce. Topped with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and onion. Will make many more times in the future!

These burgers were a hit with my kids...not so much with my husband. The flavor was outstanding...texture a little soft. Very important to chill mix before cooking. I also coated them in breadcrumbs before frying so they held together better.

I thought this recipe was great.  The consistency of the burgers is similar to a crab cake.  In fact, I served them without a bun.  The only suggestion I would make is that you either top them with extra sauce when serving or go a level hotter than you would normally like when adding wing sauce to the mixture because the bread and meat downgrade the heat.  Great recipe.

I did half the blue in and half on the bun after.  Drenched in buffalo sauce after cooking.  Seasoned salt and pepper before cooking.

Great! I did some changes thought. Actually used canned chicken and it was fantastic!  Didn't have ground chicken...so that's why I'm giving it four stars....thanks for the recipe! My boyfriend and I are huge blue cheese and wing sauce lovers!

The buffalo chicken burgers were really good!  I didn't have a grill so I fried them in a pan instead.  I took the advice of other reviewers and put the blue cheese in the middle. I added some more buffalo sauce and pepperjack cheese to the top.   I thought they turned out well.

All 5 of us loved these burgers! We aren't huge blue cheese fans so I swapped it out for mozzarella which worked fine. Topped with lettuce & ranch dressing- fabulous!

This is a family favorite!!!  We have these at least once a month (more if it were up to my husband).  It took me a few times to get them right as far as "staying together" on the grill but I now have it down to a science and the overnight refrigeration is a MUST!!!!  Enjoy.

Excellent recipe. I don't care for blue cheese so I skipped that and they were still delicious. This one has been a hit on football sundays and is one I make all the time.

Working w/ground chicken is a pain! As others suggested, I put the cheese inside the chicken. I brushed o.o. on the burgers by they still stuck to the grates..arg! I saved half the sauce to brush on after grilling. Taste is good, but this would be easier to grill a breast and add cheese and sauce after cooking.

LOVE THESE! My husband can't get enough of these. I follow the recipe exactly and cook them on my George Foreman grill. Great idea to get that wing sauce & blue cheese taste without the messines and difficulty of wings.

Great burgers! I did as others suggested and I put the blue cheese it in the middle of the burger. I also used goat cheese for a couple of them since I am allergic to dairy. Very yummy! I did not let them sit overnight before cooking, but I think they were great!

i thought this was pretty bad, but then again maybe i just don't like the consistency of ground chicken which is really mooshy.  also it wasn't at all spicy, and i found it hard to tell if the chicken was properly cooked since the wing sauce colored it orange.

Used panko bread crumbs, which I think made the burgers light and moist. Also used less cheese and wing sauce. Just the right amount of heat. We eat our burgers without the bun and these will be added to favorites!

I liked this.  I made the following variations.-- I used dried onion flakes, and made two thin patties and put a heaping tablespoon of blue cheese in the middle and pressed the two patties together.  Grilled these on a stove top griller.  Very good.

I added an egg and gluten free bread crumbs as we were  bbqing these on our green egg.  We also cooked for a few minutes on an ungreased  frying pan to make sure chicken didn't fall through the grill.  Everyone loved these!  We did not use the blue cheese sauce with celery.  Even my teenage boys loved them!

Pretty good recipe.  I didn't like the texture of the ground chicken so I may try burger or turkey.  It also needed more flavor so I added more buffalo sauce on the top.

I thought these were okay bf liked them.  I never see ground chicken in the stores here so I just used turkey.  Bf doesn't like blue cheese, so I used an aged, very sharp chedder which worked really well.  I could taste the buffalo sauce just fine, which is perhaps why I'm not enthusiastic about them, but it is probably why bf is (I'm not a huge fan; he is, and I made them for him).  I didn't tell him they were supposed to taste like wings; I really didn't think they did nor did I think they were going to.  If you go in with that expectation, you are sure to be disappointed.  If you think they will be a nice, spicy poultry burger, you will probably be happy.  Thanks for the recipe.

My 13-year old daughter went ape for this, my husband was willing to give them a 7 of 10 stars... hence my 4 rating here. I had no blue cheese, so figured I'd just dip in dressing. If you are in this boat, just cut back a little on the bread crumbs. I didn't love or hate them... was just sorta 'eh' about the meal.

The burgers were really good, and a nice change from the regular hamburger or turkey burger.  The only change I made was I added a little extra blue cheese.

Wonderful change and healthy! We used ground turkey (have a hard time finding ground chicken here) I put extra blue cheese and wing sauce on my burger.  With red onion, a little lettuce, tomato- YUM!!!

this was good, but not what we expected, the texture for us was more like a meatloaf. Nexttime I'll scrap the buns and just serve it as a ML. We liked the flavor though.

Made this recipe exactly, it was perfect. Ingredients mixed fine, the cheese made the chicken burger moist and tasty. Great job on this recipe

It was hard to tell if the burgers were done since the hot sauce made them pink. I felt the cost of the blue cheese was too high for my budget to make often, so I subbed a pack of ranch dressing mix, and added lots of garlic. Very good. Also made one with onions,garlic,hot sauce, BBQ sauce, and cheddar. Yum! Will make again and found this recipe very basic and good for interchanging ingredients.

a BIG hit @ our house! Only change I made was I added 1/2 the hot sauce to the mix and the other 1/2 I continued to baste 2 of the 4 burgers with while cooking, for those of us that like it very hot... GREAT RECIPE THANKS!
