We were snowed in this weekend and I did not go to the store before the storm settled in.  I found that I had most of the ingredients for this and it really was good. I did not have tomato paste so I used ketsup nor did I have any beer so I just used beef broth. I will make it again with all the correct ingredients. Thanks for another good recipe in my box!

This soup is excellent. I cooked potatoes separate and added a lot more sauerkraut, because we love it.
