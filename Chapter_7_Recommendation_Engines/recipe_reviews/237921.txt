I made this for brunch on New Year's Day - perfection!  The wine adds so much depth of flavor, as well as the prosciutto and onions.  I used Chardonnay instead of Pinot Grigio bc that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely be making this again. A great way to impress guests! I might try using brie instead of cheddar to change things up. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

A must have for the adult table at your next brunch. This is also a great "brenner" candidate. I used prosciutto crudo seeing that it isn't stated in the ingredients list which to use. I didn't cook it though, just added it in with the cheese at the end. I also used vegan cheddar cheese (from this website) and still it was phenomenal. Add some spicy peppers too and you won't be sorry.
