I recently submitted this recipe, and just wanted to add that f the pasta seems dry, add a little olive oil or vegetable stock. Non-vegans can top with freshly-grated romano cheese for a delicious dish. Non-vegetarians can add chicken and bits of crisy bacon or pancetta for a recipe closer to the original version. Anyway you make it, it's delicious!

In addition to being stunning in its presentation, this was also full of rich and lively flavor.  And what an interesting and creative blend of ingredients! I followed the recipe without deviating from it at all (except for using fresh thyme) and was rewarded well.  This was excellent, a great side dish for our prime rib along with "Broccoli Rabe with Roasted Peppers," also from this site.

This recipie is really very good.  The first time I made it I failed to drain the artichokes... my goodness... don't make that mistake.  I've now made it about a dozen times and it is easily my wife's favorite recipe from Allrecipies.  Very distinct flavor.

mMmm.  Bought a pound of fresh shiitakes and didn't know what to do with them UNTIL I found this recipe.  Very simple recipe to follow-  I actually used leeks instead of shallots, and added a bit of fresh basil as well as thyme from the garden and it turned out delicious.

Was a hit! I only used about 8 ounces of non-marinated artichokes and added about 5 fresh medium tomatoes. The family loved it!

Excellent tasting recipe.  I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I rehydrated beforehand, then added more garlic to the recipe and freshly ground pepper.

Really like this recipe.  Seems to make a lot more pasta than necessary, but no problem.  Only other issue I have is that it calls for a lot of artichokes.  I used two 6 oz. bottles the first time and used 1 6 oz. bottle the second time I made this recipe.  I can't imagine using 4 cans.

Other than those small problems, I love the taste, and my dad (who HATES mushrooms) ate it both times I made it.  He's tough to please and I didn't expect him to touch anything with mushrooms.  So, if it passes the dad test, it's a keeper recipe!

Very good! This dish has a great, delicate flavor to it. I skipped the shallots and served it over whole grain thin spaghetti. Thank you for sharing! :)

This was quite good.  Have to say I changed a few things-used oregano instead of thyme since I am allergic, used only 2 T olive oil and added 2 T butter.  Last but not least I subbed pan sauteed asparagus instead of artichoke but only because I didn't have any.  Turned out really yummy-leftovers warmed up well the next day.

Wow, that is a lot of artichoke hearts and a lot of pasta.  I cut pasta down to 1/3 lb and only used one can of artichoke hearts. When I folded the pasta in, the taste just didn't gel quite right. I had to melt about 1 tbsp of butter to give it a little more depth and it was still missing something. Served with Easy and Elegant Pork Tenderloin from this site.

Interesting flavor profile. I haven't had many artichoke hearts or capers. As was I did cut the quantity a little on each.  Added frozen peas (so I could give some to my sister) as well as broccoli, velveted chicken and TJ's Argentinean Red Shrimp for extra protein and added a dash of Tabasco sauce, butter and black pepper. Lets see what 98 yo Dad says and 63 yo sister.

I'm not an excellent cook but this recipe didn't turn out too well for me. We love shitake mushrooms but this didn't quite cut the mustard for us. Personally, we like our pasta to be a little more saucy.

Not impressed with this one.  My boyfriend ate it - but was too polite to tell me the truth.  Found it to be very bland and favorless.  Followed original recipe perfectly - don't know where I went wrong.

This wasn't a sauce exactly but more of a companion to the pasta.  It was a hit with the adults at my mother's birthday party but the children did not care for it - probably too flavorful.  I especially liked the little bursts of sour from the kapers.  The marinated artichoke hearts are always yummy.  It was an easy, delicious dish and I'll serve it to guests again.

This recipe was a real winner at my house. Everyone loved it!  I love the flavors in it, and it is super easy to make.  I made it with a Risotto which I made with safron and chicken broth, and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Next time I would probably make with less oil.  It ended up with a little too much liquid, so I had to drain some.
