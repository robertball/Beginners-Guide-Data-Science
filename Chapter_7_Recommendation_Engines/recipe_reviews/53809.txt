I really liked this as a base recipe to tweak so I gave it 4 stars for versatility.  This recipe is flexible to adapt to what you have on hand in the kitchen or what you want to throw in. Here's what I did:  I used a jar of diced tomatoes, a handful of Mexican blend cheese, dried basil, and a handful of cooked and crumbled bulk sausage (Neeses).  I didn't have parsley and omitted the salt and pepper at the front so I could season to taste.  
The first bite was good, but we both agreed that it needed just a little something to make it really, really good.  We both added a touch of fresh ground pepper and a shake of dried and grated parmesan & romano cheese.  This was all it needed and my husband declared this to go on heavy rotation as a quick dinner.  
This is quick, has a summertime fresh flavor and is highly adaptable.  I think the diced tomatoes are better than the halved cherry tomatoes as it distributes the tomato flavor more evenly with each bite.  I will probably plan to cook this next time and get fresh basil, tomatoes and mozarella cheese. I might look for fresh cheeze ravioli, but the frozen was very good.

I enjoyed this very much.  As written - 4 stars.  I tasted it and it seemed to lack someting.  I added some parmesan to the ravioli and some good balsamic vinegar / glaze the the tomatoes and this was plate licking good.  Serve with a crusty bread to soak up the sauce.  Beautiful, fast and perfect for those summer cherry tomatoes.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

My family loved this recipe, even my 22 month old.  We used meat ravioli and cheese ravioli and it worked well with both.  This is a very versatile recipe.  We are looking forward to using the cherry tomato and cheese mixture with many other dinners and salads.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I think this recipe is terrific!  I used cherry tomatoes from my own garden the first time I made it, so the freshness really got everyone's attention.  I usually "tweak" recipes with my own personal touch, but this one is great just the way it is.  Thanks for providing me with another way to use my abundance of cherry tomatoes!

Not a whole lot of flavor.  We were trying to go lower cal but ravioli really just needs a sauce, not just an oil.  We won't make this again.

I had to make this as a last minute side dish and included a few substitutes. We took out the basil and instead used spinach which we heated up in a frying pan for a few seconds. And we accidentally used cilantro instead of parsley. However, the outcome was incredible.

Yum! This was delicious- these flavors are what I like best about summer. I did only use two large cloves of garlic, and that was good for us. I used cheese tortellini instead of ravioli. We will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This tasted a little bland to me, even though I love all the ingredients. It didn't really make good leftovers either (even less flavor reheated). Maybe it would be better with a different ravioli instead of plain cheese.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I found this recipe to be extremely garlicky, and I like garlic!  Wasn't too crazy about the fresh tomatoes with the pasta.  Guess i'm just used to marinara sauce.  Was just so-so.  Nothing spectacular.

This has a very fresh taste and is perfect for when the weather is too warm and you don't really want to cook. Reminds me of the summers I've spent with my Italian family members. Would make this again!
Too much leftover oil and would recommend serving with some form of bread. Also, too much garlic for my taste.
Added oregano to the tomato/cheese mixture. Also added some ground beef since I had only cheese ravioli.

It would be better with sauteed garlic, raw was too overpowering.

I tried this recipe as a way to use up the bounty of cherry tomatoes I have in the garden. I made it as written. The flavor was good but it was WAY too oily! As it turned out in this recipe, the cheese melted into clumps that were difficult to separate evenly. The garlic was a nice amount. Next time, I will saute the garlic in about two T. oil along with some red pepper flakes. I would then add the tomatoes and basil for a minute or two, just long enough to release the juices. I would then mix that with the ravioli and just sprinkle the cheese over the top.

Fabulous, helped by a wonderful amount of basil. Didn't have cherry tomatoes so cut up plum tomatoes instead. Great summer dish.
