My husband used this marinade last night on some nice looking rib eye steaks and it absolultely ruined them. WAY too much vinigar - completely overpowered out the flavor of the meat. There are other maninade recipes in here that are quite good. Stay away from this one!

This is actually a really good marinade for rib eyes, but DON'T use all that vinegar and follow the instructions on timing.  You really only need enough red wine vinegar to coat the steaks which is about 1/4 the amount (depending on how big they are).  I put everything into a zip loc bag and let set in the fridge for an HOUR turning it a couple of times - then disgarded the marinade.  Let the steaks come to room temperature and then grill.  This way you get a nice hint of vinegar and the other flavors also come through - another big plus is the steaks come out tender and juicy.

I read the ratings about some people not liking this because the vinegar was too strong but I only let it marinade for about 45 minutes and then let it cook on low heat for about 45 minutes and it came out so tender! It was definatly a hit and I plan to make it again!

Recipes are so dependent on personal tastes. That being said, I am one rib-eye fan who believes that a good rib-eyes needs no marinade. However, this recipe caught my eye so I gave it a shot. You gotta like the taste and aftertaste of the red wine vinegar to enjoy this recipe. I did not care for that flavor, but that's why I started this review the way I did.  Any type of vinegar flavor on a good cut of meat is not my favorite. That being said, the rest of the ingredients, coupled with a heavy red wine worked for me the second time around. Most vinegars impart a unique flavor to every dish. This one was too much for me, but that doesn't mean it's bad for another taster. My suggestion is to cut the red wine vinegar at least in half, or one quarter and go from there. Good luck and happy eating.

Love this! We marinated the meat approximately 10 hours. We could definitely taste the red wine vinegar, which may not be to everyones liking, but it certainly was to ours! I wish we had had more time to marinate the meat longer. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this for my wife and I last night but I used Tawny Port red wine (had some on hand) and we loved it. I'll definitely use it again, probably with red wine again.

Didn't care for this at all. Didn't add anything to the flavor of the beef and we all ended up pouring on the steak sauce.

Used with sirloin and was still very tasty. The red wine vinager was obviously quite potent, I used a little less than the 12 oz. called for. It was a unique taste that is fitting for a summer day. Definetly give it a try!

It was good.  I was out of red wine vinegar so I just replaced it with white wine vinegar.

The vinegar was a little too powerful for us.  It wasn't bad, but not really what we prefer.

Instead of the red wine vinegar I used my favorite red wine which I had on hand already and followed the rest of the recipe, me my friend thought it was a big hit and I will use it again. Hope this helps some.

As written I can only give this a 3. Cut the vinegar in half and you have yourself a decent marinade.

Marinade makes the steaks extra tender and extra juicy but for 2 steaks I cut the vinegar down to just under 8oz.  Truly i'm not a fan of vinegar and I hate A1 sauce, but even this I love!

Bf didn't like this--he said he could taste too much of the vinegar.  I halved the amount of vinegar, but it marinated a very long time and it's pretty much his fault.  He was supposed to grill them last night, not tonight, so they were sitting in the marinade for an extra 24 hours.  I didn't really taste the vinegar, personally, but I also didn't eat much of it.  I'm not a beef person.  Still, for all his complaining he finished his meat, so that says something.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this last night.  Just bought a new stove and had to try the broiler.  Marinade was killer.  Have a steak waiting until I get home - that's been soaking all night.  Definite keeper...

We made this recipe because now my husband is in love with steak and he has to have it. lol... but we made this not knowing if we were going to like it because i can not have a lot of vinegar, the first time we made it, it was ok, just too much vinegar for me so we reduced it down and it comes out perfect!!

In a rush I mistook "red wine vinegar" for red wine, & so I used 1 1/2cups of red wine in the recipe. Absolutely delicious!! For those of you who say there's too much vinegar in it, you're right. Substitute red wine & you'll have an outstanding marinade.

I definitely agree to use less vinegar and, in my opinion, a little oil should be added with a hint of mustard. Great marinade with those additions.

I agree with Oregonguy, but alos like Roger's sub of port. I used a combination of red wine vinegar and an oxidized full bodied red wine and added a bit of soy sauce when I ran out of worcester. All have proven improvements to the base recipe.

Delicious! I like a strong marinade, and I like the taste of red wine vinegar. I followed this recipe exactly except for marinating in the fridge for 6 hours instead of 1. We thought it was delicious. Yes, you're going to taste the marinade--but what's the point of a marinade you can't taste? :) We'll definitely be making this again.
