I had never eaten pasta fazul before but my boyfriend is Italian and always spoke so lovingly of his grandmother's version. So I tried this version, and... It tastes very healthy. And not extremely flavorful even as leftovers. But if you want a huge pot of healthy tasting pasta and beans, this is great.

Easy, Basic ingredients, Healthy and Filling!  And the best bit is both husband and son liked it...I mean my 6 year old son ACTUALLY ate it!  This is a boy that does not combine food together, like veggies or beans in pasta...This time he picked out the beans but then reluctantly ate them anyway.  I only made this because I had the ingredients and was feeling lazy.  Will make again, definitely.  By the way, I added a bit of smoked bacon, because I had it.  They both noticed that flavour and liked it...a lot. Still would be good without.

Good, hearty pasta dish. My kids liked it. WAY more than 5 svg for our family, more like 8.  Paired well with a fresh greens salad and garlic bread.  Not a soup though as the play off of pasta fagioli might suggest.

This worked out great, with ingredients I already had in my kitchen. I added a little dry red wine in the simmering stage, which added a nice flavor! Was a great mid-winter, stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal.

My family LOVES this recipe.  I add some kidney beans and don't use as much crushed pepper flakes as the recipes calls for.  I've made this over and over since finding it.  It is easy and tastes better the next day as leftovers.

Made this exactly as written but found it to be extremely bland.  There seemed to be way too much pasta for the amount of sauce, also.  Now we have a mountain of leftovers, and I will probably add some spaghetti sauce to that just to make it more appealing.

What a great and easy dish.  I used fresh tomatoes and had to omit the herbs, because I didn't have them and it still came out great.

This was a great recipe and so easy to make.  I used a tin of San Marzano tomatoes and italian seasoning instead of basil and oregano.  Very tasty.

This was awsome! My grandma used to make this every Friday without fail.  A secret for me was to use ketchup to make it a little thicker. But I didn't have the reciepe. Thank you so much!

I agree with using only 1/2 pound of pasta for best results.  Tastes good but very "healthy."  I used 2 large carrots, 4 large tomatoes (unpeeled), 1 red onion, garlic, herbs and spices, and it came out very "carroty."  Blending all of the veggies in a food processor worked well.

This is really, and makes a lot.  I doubled the veggies, as the first time I made it it seemed like too much pasta for the amount of veggies.  This time it turned out great.  I also boiled the pasta in 1/2 organic chicken broth to add flavor.  My kids even like this dish.  Thanks!

This was just OK. I made it exactly as written and found it to be a nice filling meal, but nothing overly impressive. I think a pound of pasta is a bit too much; I used one of those enriched-with-Omega-3s-and-calcium types that only gives you 14.5 oz. in the box and it made way too much.

A decent, flavorful, quick-n-dirty version. I threw in a couple of fresh tomatoes since all the gardeners in my neighborhood are giving them away. Thought about passing it off as Gramma's recipe just to make myself look good but thought better of it. Thanks!

I used ditalini since that's what I've always known Fagioli to be made with.  I could tell it was way too much pasta, so I used only about 2/3 the amount called for, and even then, it was too much.  It wasn't like a thick soup, but more of a glop (like spaghetti would be).  And I think this is much of what made it lose its flavor -- all I could taste was a lot of pasta.  Maybe this recipe was meant to be this way, but I didn't think it was terribly exciting, though it was OK.

Delicious.  I only gave it four stars because it has too much pasta.  I didn't use as much pasta as the recipe calls for and it was still too much.  Not that it wasn't good, it just wasn't soup.  I even added two cups of vegetable broth and it still wasn't soup.  I also added zucchini and mushrooms with the carrots and onions and that turned out very nice.  I used all dry spices and the flavor was great.  An easy dinner to make that really is good.  I recommend.

This was a wonderful hearty meal that my italian husband just loved. I used 2 cups of basil tomatoe sauce and 1 cup fresh cut tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I also used celery instead of carrots. Plus I added 1/2 cup of pinot grigio wine and garlic olive oil instead of plain. This will defiantly be in our family for generations!!

I thought this was a very good recipe to start from.  I used 1/2 t salt, 1/4 t pepper, and added 1/2 t sugar to cut the bitterness of the tomatoes.  I used an undrained 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, thereby eliminating the necessity of oil.  We topped ours with goat cheese at the table, and I threw in some olives.  Very good.

Good and healthy. My husband doesn't like beans much, and this was a good way to slip them in- you don't notice them. I thought the sauce-to-pasta ratio was a little low, so next time I'll cook less pasta.
