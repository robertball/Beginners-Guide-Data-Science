I really enjoyed this smoothie. I omitted the ice because I used frozen fruit, used fat free plain yogurt instead of vanilla and 1/2 scoop of protein supplement.

I couldn't believe when I typed in an ingredient search with blueberries, kiwi, and bananas, that anything would come up with that match but here it was!  This was a quick and perfect way to use this fruit up before I head for home tomorrow.  I didn't have any yogurt, and prefer to make drinks like this with vanilla ice ceam anyway. It really was delicious, and what an attractive color! I don't know, however,  that the kiwi necessarily contributed much in flavor.  Besides, kiwi is so pretty it was almost a shame to just blend it up in a smoothie.  Using the ice cream it was just sweet enough, so I wonder if this might not need some sugar if using yogurt.  I'm not sure I'd make a point to make these again, but in this instance, given the fruit I had on hand,  it was a choice I enjoyed.

I had two kiwi's, so I threw them both in. I omitted the ice because my banana was frozen. We liked these. Next time, I'll add another form of berry.

I made the recipe exactly and we did not enjoy it; not flavorful. I added a little orange juice and that didn't help.  Won't make again.

It is delicious!  I cut the yogurt in half and just used 1/2 cup and used frozen blueberries.  It was so good! BTW, one reviewer complained about the Kiwi not adding any flavor but I think it adds a bit of tart and a ton of Vitamin C!

I used frozen bananas and blueberries so I left out the ice cubes.   It was very tasty.

In terms of ingredients, I made this exactly as is, using frozen blueberries.  I tasted mostly the blueberry, which in smoothies seems to tend towards tasting like grape.  I do like the blueberry ones.  I have to agree that the kiwi didn't add a lot to it, but kiwi and banana both are ones I prefer to have as a more subtle flavor anyway.  And purple drinks are always pretty.  My only issue with this is that it's harder to mix smooth.  I have to put ice in first or my blender doesn't handle it.  But unless I just let the ice melt, there's no liquid at all.  I just keep scraping the sides to try throwing that fruit down in the center and eventually it does mix up, and then I smoothed it out once the yogurt was added - but a bit of a hassle.

Not a bad smoothie, however it was a little tart.  I added a little amount of sugar. But it does have a great berry taste.

I omitted the kiwi (allergic) and added some wheat germ. It was super yummy and the kids loved it! I would almost double the recipe though because it didn't seem to be enough.

This was my first attempt at making smoothies and it turned out pretty good. However, even though it did not taste bad, it didn't give me that 'wow' effect I was hoping for. In all, a decent smoothie though.

I don't usually like smoothies that use yogurt but this was fabulous. I tried three different variations. As written, with blackberries instead of blueberries, and strawberry instead of blueberry. The blackberry was the best! Overall good and versatile recipe :)

This was interesting... I left out the ice because I used frozen strawberries and a frozen banana. I prefer strawberries as the base of smoothies though...It made a beautiful color though!

A nice refreshing breakfast.  I had all the fruits on hand and scaled this down to one serving.  My kiwi was very tart, which I liked to cut the sweetness of the banana.  Thanks Michaela for sharing your recipe.

If you like tangy smoothies without a strong taste of banana, this is great! I used fat free greek yogurt instead of plain vanilla, added a tsp of sugar instead. Also skipped the ice because I was using frozen blueberries. Turned out yummmmmy. Thanks!

Just got a new blender and had to try it out...since I had lots of blueberries and yogurt...this was the ticket. Was wonderfully refreshing on a late hot night...I didn't have kiwi, but still was great tasting.

Made this in my Vitamix last - so yummy and quick.  Put a vanilla lean shake powder into it for added flavor and extra punch - yummy!

I thought this was great. My bananas were frozen so I left out ice but to make it colder I could’ve used a little ice. Perfect for left over kiwis and blueberries.

Not bad! I changed it up a bit. Instead of the yogurt, I did a cup of milk and a cup of OJ. I did not have a kiwi, wish I had. It turned out great. not too sweet, so it must be healthy! Haha.
