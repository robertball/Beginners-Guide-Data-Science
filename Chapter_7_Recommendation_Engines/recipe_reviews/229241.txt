I added a dash of cayenne pepper but other than that, it was great. Will make again. We should start an Eat to Live tab to allrecipes.com Thanks for sharing.

Truly, truly, truly delicious.  I've searched far and wide for the perfect vegan broccoli soup, and this one is the best, bar none.  I happen to love heavy cream and was about to resort to it until I found this recipe.  It's so creamy!  And it's not cashew-y at all (not that there'd be anything wrong with that).  Another cow can live in peace.  My only tweak was to use Salish alderwood smoked sea salt instead of regular.  I'll say again -- delicious.  I might be able to hang with this vegan thing after all.

Delicious! I added three chopped carrots, exchanged an alternative salt product for the salt, and use used only one potato. This recipe is a comfort food without the guilt.

An amazing recipe!! After reading reviews saying it "needed something", I added 1 tsp dried dill, 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, an 1 tsp dried parsley when I added in the 4 cups of vegetable broth and the flavor turned out phenomenal.

Picking really good vegan recipes can be a crapshoot as they sometimes combine one or more ingredients to replace a tried and true one . . . like milk/cream in this case. This one makes ‘cream’ by blending cashews with broth. If not told beforehand, many people eating this soup would not identify cashews being used as the taste is surprisingly subtle. Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising as almond or soy milk might work fine here if subbed for cashew cream. For us, this soup seriously needed seasoning. Having made that adjustment, it was pretty good but more tinkering is needed to take this up a notch . . . like a glug of dry white wine. Overall a healthy choice but we used a low sodium broth and omitted the salt given the relative high sodium content for just one bowl of soup. Nakkeya, thank you for creating this recipe.

Added 1/4 cup nutritional yeast and herb de provence. Also, did 4 cups broth in pot, and then used water to mix with cashews. YUM!!!! my kids LOVED it. And my daughter who is the BIGGEST fan of the real one with cheese- she asked for seconds!

LOVED IT!!!  Never used cashew cream and didnt know what it was until I found this recipe. Now I use cashew cream all the time. This is an easy tasty recipe.  I add nutritional yeast to my serving bowl for a little cheesy flavor!!  This is a keeper.

All five of us loved this recipe!  Did substitute coconut milk for some of the broth.  My husband added a little Tabasco sauce.  I will try the cayenne pepper suggestion next time.  Definitely a keeper!

I used some of the tweaks other people suggested (i.e. added 3 carrots, used only one potato - I used a Japanese sweet potato, actually). I also had some left over chopotle peppers in adobo I needed to use so I added one to the blender with the cashews (just used a cup of water, not veggie broth) and a half tsp. dill.  The soup was amazing!

I am new to vegan cooking and looking for something I could make ahead and freeze for quick lunches on the go. I loved it!!! Just what I needed. I did make a few adjustments. I substituted one cup of vegetable broth with coconut milk when blending it with the cashews and cut the cashews to 1/2 cup. This is going in my box of staple recipes. You should try it!

I am new to cooking and this looked like an easy vegan soup. I was so sure I had some veg stock in my pantry and was so upset to find out that there was none. I looked through some of the reviews, and subbed coconut milk for the veg stock for the cashews. For boiling the potatoes and broccoli, I had to just use water with a veg stock cube. It was so delicious. I love it and will definitely make it again - next time with the proper veg stock. Making the cashew milk was such a neat thing to learn, and learning how to blend half and return that to the pot was something new for me - thank you!

Yum! I'm not vegan but wanted a broccoli soup without the cheese and this was perfect. Made it with chicken broth and italian seasoning instead of basil.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.

Wow!  This soup is amazing!  The only change I made was to use chicken broth because that is what I had.  So delicious.  Will definitely make again. Really hit the spot.

Awesome, I added the splash of coconut milk and dash of nutmeg, as recommended, which made the whole dish. (I only changed one thing and that was I blended the whole soup, so it was smooth) YUM!!!!

This is the BEST soup EVER!!  I’ve made it several times and follow the recipe to a “T”.  I’d give it 10 stars if I could; and no, I’m not the recipe poster’s mother ;). Love that it’s vegan!!!

Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! This soup makes my heart and belly happy with so little guilt. Better than any cheddar and broccoli soup we have eaten! I'm not one to measure ingredients and I have to admit I eyeballed this one as well. Added some red pepper flakes for the kick we love!

Love this soup - make it often in the fall & winter.  I usually add some carrots & garlic for additional flavor & to boost the veggies in this soup.  Except for the 1 cup cashews / 1 cup broth for creating cashew "cream", I barely pay attention to the recipe amounts and just eyeball the amounts of veggies & broth.  This recipe is very forgiving & flexible with whatever you might have on hand and if you prefer a thick or thin "cream" of broccoli soup!

This is an extremely easy and delicious recipe! Instead of just half, we out the entire batch of the soup in an emersion blender to get it all to one consistency. I can't wait to make this again!

My first time rating a recipe. Followed the directions and loved the end result.  I noticed it was thinner than I had expected . Then I realized I had left the potatoes out. I am not eating starchy foods. It was still great.  May add a potato next time.  Thanks for a the Vegan version of my favorite soup.

One of my favorites!   I did slightly change the recipe by soaking the cashews for 2-3 hours before adding it to the recipe. I also tried making the vegetable broth from scratch since I had to simmer the potatoes anyway.  My husband, who recently started a vegetarian diet, loved it too.

I love potato and broccoli and found this recipe to be exactly what I was looking for! I put my onion in a blender too and added carrots. Excellent taste, I made a big pot and plan to freeze some for lunch at work.

I am only giving three stars because the soup is only okay unless you doctor it up. It’s pretty bland without some extra Ingredients. Following other reviews we added three tablespoons nutritional yeast, teaspoon lemon juice and 3/4 teaspoon brown mustard to the cashew blend. This made the soup cheesy. It was better but still not perfect. We then added to our bowls a splash of franks hot sauce and some shredded follow your heart vegan cheese. After those changes it was terrific!  My daughter ate two bowls and can’t wait to have left overs today.

Love this soup!!! I added a bit more of the veggies and a bit more cashews as well as additional (just a little) broth. This soup is so yummy rich and creamy I can’t get enough of it.

Delicious!  I swapped the cashews with almond milk soup base to get the fat down to 1.5g and 155cal per serving!  That’s a ton of soup for very little fat and calories.  I will be making this again!

Didn’t have potatoes or any veggies but broccoli and onions. I’m sure it’d be much yummier with the potatoes but I’m working with what I’ve got! I also didn’t have the full amount of cashews ?? I’d love to try the recipe as written in the future. I did add some garlic and coconut milk (out of fear of missing one of the main ingredients), and herbs de Provence as someone suggested. Overall, it was still delicious and creamy!!

Maybe I have not had that many broccoli soups… But this was not incredible for us. My whole family kind of had to force themselves to eat it. But we did haha! Very easy recipe to make. We added a little Cayanne pepper like another reviewer suggested, and it helped to make it taste better. More salt also! But we likely would not choose to re-make it.

I've made several cream of broccoli vegan soups and this one is one of the best. I meant to add nutritional yeast but forgot and didn't miss it. I omitted the potatoes as I didn't have any, and added about a quarter pound of baby carrots I needed to use asap. Sautéed the onion in a little vegan butter, left it chunky because I puréed the soup leaving some tiny bits for texture, the carrots provided a nice toothsomeness. Used better than bouillon paste, added Italian seasoning, cayenne, basil and dill. Spices definitely help bring it to life. For such a simple soup it was fantastic. Used the cashew cream, no coconut milk. Was a great way to use up a huge bag of broccoli florets from Costco that had seen better days. You could turn this into a kitchen sink soup as the act of pureeing any vegetables then adding cashew cream results in a lovely soup.

I loved this recipe. My  six year old son also loved it which is really the win here.  I did make a couple of tiny changes, I used one large organic red potato and a chunk of cauliflower instead of the second because we are trying to stay away from foods that are too starchy.  I also added 1 Tbsp of nutritional yeast to add a little bit more cheesy flavor
This soup tastes like a mix between a creamy potato and broccoli cheese.  Its very good.

Fab. But, if you use regular broth, and not low sodium broth, DON'T add more salt. Mine was too salty the first time.  The second time,   I added nutritional yeast to make it taste like vegan cheesy broccoli soup.  Thanks for sharing.

It's my favorite soup ever! I've made it half a dozen times already and never get tired of it. The cashew broth is what makes it. I made it for company last night and they raved about it. I don't deviate from the recipe except I leave it chunky and don't purée part of the recipe.

This recipe is so perfect it's actually better than the fatty fat non vegan version. Followed the recipe. The only thing I added was one carrot for some color and I only blended 1/4 because I like my soup with chunks.

Delicious, hearty and very filling.  Before  I added the cashews I soaked them in 1 cup of water for 1 hour. Blend for 1 minute with the water and then allow to set until thickened, about 10 minutes. The result is a creamy  white sauce.  This would also work  on any other dish where a white creamy sauce is desired.

OMG!!!! This is SO GOOD!!! Reminds me of Panera's cheddar broccoli soup.  I only had 1 potato so I added a carrot, a little Rosemary & some garlic salt. It's definitely a new favorite. Thank You !!!

This is an excellent recipe.  the cashews give the soup a rich, creamy taste. Everyone though it had cream in it!
 The only thing different I did was I added 1/4 cup sherry at the very end.

I sauted the onions in 2T olive to add a little pzazz, then finished with some truffle salt, which transformed it from a tasty but one dimensional soup into an umami treat.

I used a can of coconut milk instead of cashew cream, and after reading the reviews I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and nutritional yeast. this was a good soup and my kids asked for seconds, so I'd say that makes it a winner! I personally would like more depth of flavor but that's probably due to the broth I used, and it's probably better with the cashew cream.

Not vegan but was attracted by the great reviews. My husband was turned off by the puréed cashews but later said, "This is pretty good soup I made fun of." My kids had seconds and we're grateful for leftovers. It's fine without a can of coconut milk at the end but we like it.

Very good.  I did add 1 carrot and 1 Tbl of nutritional yeast but the soup was delicious without the yeast. I also cheated (vegan wise) and sauted the onion in 2 slices of diced lean bacon. I have never made cashew cream.  What a healthy and delicious addition. This soup could be a base for any " cream free" cream soup.

I put in carrots and some celery.  the soup was creamy and good with nice consistency, but didn't particularly taste like broccoli.  I think in future I will cut the vegetable broth with water.  The store bought stocks have so many seasonings that I think they overpower the vegetables.

It came out great! I added about 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and about half a cup of coconut milk as it suggests. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder since I love garlic! Good idea, but next time I'm using fresh garlic and fresh basil!

Creamy and thick, and not bad at all, but not particularly flavorful. I've been on a soup kick lately, and this recipe just didn't quite stack up to a lot of other vegan vegetable soup recipes I've tried. The broccoli flavor is quite bland. Maybe it was the broccoli I used (frozen), but I added cayenne and that is basically the taste I experienced. Overall, it's just middle of the road for me.

Just made this soup exactly as recommended. It needs a lot of extra help however. It was very very bland and boring. Needed to add some sherry and a little cayenne and braggs liquid aminos and more seasonings.  Perhaps sautéed mushrooms would have  help it out. I made it on the basis of such a high rating but it's just so so.

Ok I didn't have cashews but I subbed (knowing cashews are vegan's cream cheese base) vegan sour cream (tofu blended with seasonings) and it turned out very good!  I'll try with the cashews as well someday lol!

This is by far the best broccoli soup/cream I've made. It was very simple to make and very satisfying to eat. A new staple in my kitchen! Remember you can adjust thickness to your liking by blending a bigger or smaller portion of the soup. For me about half was perfect.

Sooo good!  Looking to eat healthier, not necessarily vegan.  Only changes I made was adding a clove of garlic and using chicken broth (no veggie broth on hand).  It was beyond my expectations!  My teenaged son devoured it, too.  So yummy!

I made this yesterday while there was a blizzard here in Boston.  I didn't have any potatoes so I just used the stalk of the broccoli in place of that.    I was amazed at how tasty it was.  I used good vegetable broth and I also sautéed the onions and garlic (which I added)  vs just throwing it in the broth.

Wonderful soup!  Added a large garlic clove to the onion which I briefly sauteed in a bit of oil prior to adding the broth.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and this will now be added as one of our regular go to recipes.  I might try fully cooking the potatoes, turning off the heat, and then tossing in the chopped broccoli to lightly steam them while preparing the cashew mixture to add once the soup has cooled.

Loved it!  One of the reviewers said they added Japanese sweet potatoes and chipotle peppers. I followed suit. Except I just used a regular sweet potato and only one pepper.  I also added oregano and minced garlic.  Also since I'm not vegan, I sauteed the potatoes, onion and garlic with butter before adding the veggie broth.  This soup is simple and tasty.

I love this recipe! I recently became a vegan and was struggling to find hearty recipes. This soup is really yummy and filling. The only thing I changed was substituting cauliflower for the broccoli and adding a dash of cayenne.

As with many soups, the taste got better overnight.  I would have only given it 4 stars upon first tasting.  Nobody could tell there were cashews in the soup.  I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good and super easy. I usually read all the reviews before making a recipe from this site, but didn't have time. So I just followed the recipe. I didn't have potatoes, so chucked in two big carrots instead. And I misread the recipe and used 6 cups broth. Overall, it was good (and SO easy) but it needs a little tinkering. I mixed it with pre-cooked rainbow quinoa, and it was super delicious that way, but as a soup alone, I think it needs another ingredient (maybe the potatoes the recipe calls for :-) 
Anyway, great stuff! Thank you!

After I started making this, I realized I had no potatoes. Substituted some baby carrots instead for the starch. Used five cups water and two Knorr vegetable bouillons instead of broth, again because that's what I had on hand. Omitted salt and thought it was still delicious and creamy. This will go in my recipe box, thank you!

Love this recipe...all 3 of my kids love it and even ask me to make it...and trust me they are not broccoli lovers.  I add lots of fresh pepper to my bowl for some extra kick.  If short on broccoli we substitute with some cabbage and usually add a carrot as well.  A great soup recipe!

Fabulous and easy!  Even my carnivorous lumberjack husband raved and raved about this soup.  He ate the leftovers for breakfast the following morning before I could get my hands on them!

Loved it! I did end up adding Rosemary during the last ten minutes of cooking and blended the whole pot at the end but the taste was amazing.  I have been a vegetarian my whole life and just recently gave up dairy as well and really loved how creamy it was.  Also....my 17 year old, 15 year old, my 2 1/2 year old and my mom loved it too!

I love this recipe!  It's easy and delicious.  Liked by vegan and non-vegan alike.  When I made it for a soup exchange  my 12 year old son was very upset that I was giving it away.  I had to make a second batch to keep my family happy.  I always double the recipe when I make it so we have enough for left overs.  I have a family of four. :)

I felt this soup needed more seasoning so I added Herbes de Provence which helped.

This was super easy to make, even though I am one who cringes at having to break out the blender. It was also delicious! Even my mom, who loves all things dairy, thought it was great. Definitely going into the rotation!

This has become one of my favorite soups to make--creamy and very delicious! The only thing I changed is adding less salt since I found it a tad too salty the first time.  It probably depends on the type of vegetable broth you use though.

This recipe is fantastic. The texture is perfect. I added more spices, including a good deal of black pepper, some cayenne, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano. I also soaked the cashews for a couple hours in broth before blending. Otherwise, followed the recipe and, like I said, Loved it!

I have been a vegan for 9 months and have missed cream soups.  I made this soup exactly as written and I found it delicious.  I had two and a half bowls and had to put it in the fridge to stop myself from eating more.  The seasoning was balanced and it has a good flavor.  I did blend 3/4 of the soup as I tend to not like as many chunks. That was the only change I made.

Excellent! Very simple, nutritious, and my parents loved it. (Even though my dad is a dyed-in-the-wool carnivore!) I only had 4 cups of Swanson veggie broth so I just added a cup of water and the flavor didn't suffer. Had this at dinner with a vegan black bean burger, strawberries, and a glass of wine, and was so satisfied. Thanks!

So in love!  My whole family likes this, even those who don't care for broccoli. I soak my cashews for a little in the hot broth so it is very smooth when I process them in my little food processor.

I was so disappointed with this soup, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it too thick and flavorless.  I did't want to throw it out, so after tinkering with some spices, it was edible.  I had one bowl.  My husband enjoyed it more than I, so I saved a serving for him for later in the week.  I tossed the rest, sadly.  I'll be looking for a different recipe.
