I cut the recipe in half and made 1 serving. I omitted the ice since I found it to be thick enough with my frozen banana. A jar of Manuka honey was gifted to us and I'm glad I was able to use it in this recipe. Very good smoothie.

Delicious smoothie! Don't let the name of the recipe scare you! I found it had the right amount of sweetness, and I don't like smoothies to be too sweet. I used low-fat milk, 'banilla' flavor low-fat yogurt, and peanut butter powder. I used raw honey that I had on hand. Scaling it down to 1 serving was the perfect mount for me. Thanks for this good and healthy recipe!
