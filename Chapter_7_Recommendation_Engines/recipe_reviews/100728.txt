Yummy!   I agree with other reviewers who said that it didn't taste as exotic as you might expect given the ingredients, but it was very flavorful and the sauce was very rich.  The sweet potatoes and carrots were a perfect compliment to the sauce.  This would not have fit in my slow cooker so I did it in the oven, as explained in my review.  I also made a few modifications to the method which worked out great.  I made this a day ahead and it was delicious!    A great alternative to the standard pot roast.  My 3 and 5 year olds liked it too.   A few modifications: *Used brown sugar and reduced to 1 Tbsp *Used 3 fist-sized potatoes (cut in 1/2), 1 big sweet potato (cut in 1/4s) & 2 carrots for the veggies. *Browned meat.  Remove.  Saute onions and celery together in the fat.  Then add all spices (NOT flour) for 1 minute.  Then add flour and stir constantly for 1 more minute.  Deglaze with about 1/2 cup red wine.  Then add tomato sauce.  Boil.  Then add meat.   Bake just the meat/onion mixture in oven at 325 for 3 hrs, periodically adding more water.  Add veggies, reduce to 300 and cook 1 hour more.

I was in a "roast rut" and couldn't bring myself to making yet another roast.  However, when I stumbled upon this recipe this morning, I was thrilled to see a recipe that included some different, almost "exotic" spices/flavors.  I loved it and it turned out well even though I messed up the cooking method (mixed the flour, chopped onion, and all spices in with the tomato sauce which resulted in a paste..oops).  It all cooked down nicely, however, and everyone enjoyed it. I really liked the new flavors and will make it again.  My husband, who is a "no frills, try nothing new" guy liked it, but wasn't as thrilled about it as I was.  I think you have to be a little daring to really LOVE this recipe...but nevertheless everyone still enjoyed it and had seconds.

I had a hankering for good pot roast today, but wanted to do something different from my old stand by recipe with dry onion soup mix.  I found this recipe and tried it.  It was really good!  The roast came out so juicy and tender and my husband and 3 sons all had second servings!!  The flavor of the sauce reminds me a lot of Cincinnati Chile, and I loved it.  It was a very pleasant change of pace from our regular old pot roast.  Thanks for a really good recipe.

We really enjoyed this!  I followed the recipe exactly as written. The flavoring is just right, and no particular spice strikes a prominent or discordant note in the sauce.  My roommate, who loves pot roast and traditional flavors, thought this was delicious.  I cut the roast into three sections to help it cook more thoroughly.  Next time I'll add more carrots and celery, since there was lots of sauce and a bit of extra space in my crockpot.  What a great change from my usual pot roast!

I tried to make this on the stovetop, as I didn't have 8 hrs. I cooked it for 2 hrs. and it was done, but tough. I will allow more time for cooking or use the oven or crock pot next time! I love the flavors, very rich and great for dipping bread. Not as exotic as I would have thought with the cocoa and cinnamon. I think it adds richness without "weirdness".

My family enjoyed this! 

I used a larger roast, added some tomato paste and water to make up for needing more sauce. I also added some red wine, and did the spices at abut 1.5 times what is suggested.

I didn't have a crock pot, so I cooked it on the stove for about 3 hours.

This recipe was very different from any pot roast recipe I ever tried. I tried it with a pork roast, and it turned out amazing. And in the end, I didn't mind eating left overs not one bit!!

This was very good, even though from the large number of ingredients that went in, only a few came through... but I am sure the flavor was a combination of them all.  I tend to prefer easier slow cooker dishes where you don't have to use 2 separate pots on the stovetop and it can all be done in the crockpot, but other than that, this was great.

I used a little less than 3 lbs of meat and there are plenty of leftovers. I had to feed 3 adults, 2 teens and 2 toddlers. We did eat with rice though. I made exactly as written but didnt seem like there was enough liquid so I added 1/3 cup water and it still didnt make much sauce...might be because I had to cook for longer than 8 hours...?? darn job...lol. Anyway everyone ate it but not too excited about it. I thought it was good and had seconds. I will try again with my own twist next time.

I made this for my family yesterday. Following the advice of the other posters, I doubled the spices and left out the potatoes, carrots and celery.  (Instead, I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots on the side.)  Also, I took the roast out of the pot after eight hours, covered it with foil while I skimmed some of the fat from the gravy. I then cooked the gravy down on the stove for 10 minutes because my husband likes a thicker gravy.  Overall, my family loved it. They raved about the tender meat and the rich gravy. There's a battle going on over what we will go with the leftovers: hot beef sandwiches or soft beef tacos! Will be making again!

I made this as is.  my roast was 2.5 lbs.  sauce will eventually increase.  don't add more sauce.  just cook on low for 8hrs and it will be almost completely submerged in juice.  I did put some veggies on bottom.

I really liked this pot roast a lot. The sauce was delicious! The pot roast was also nice and tender. Since my husband didn't like it and didn't want me to make it again, I have to give it 4 stars. He likes a stronger flavor. I was hoping to make it again someday but I just wanted to let you know that I really liked this recipe.

Because I don't cook with salt, I doubled all the other flavorings, and thought it very good—although as someone else commented, not as exotic as one might expect.

I didn't have all of the spices required for this recipe (missing cumin and coriander) so I'm not sure I can adequately judge. I did think the meat was tender and flavorful. I thought the cinnamon was a bit too prominent. My husband was suspicious of the whole thing but had two helpings nonetheless.

Overall the taste of the sauce was very nice, not very exotic but the amount of sauce was SO off! I ended up having to dilute it with water thus leaving me with a blander recipe than I had ever intended for. I will probably make this again and double or triple the sauce. I overall was very disappointed with how it turned out because of that issue and didn't even finish my dinner which is a rarity around here.

I thought this was great although like everyone else I made a few adjustments. I added a can of diced tomatoes in with the sauce, I added about a half a cup of water to cover my veggies, added more potatoes and of course more of the spices, I dont measure spices when cooking so I cant give you an exact amount. I added a little more orange zest which in turn made me add more chili powder, coriander, cumin and I also added some chipotle and some Cajun seasoning to give a little more flavor.  Overall I thought this was a great variation from the traditional pot roast and will definitely make it again. I may try to find some other veggies to put in it besides potatoes and carrots.. maybe some green beans??? if I make any other changes I will def. write it up!! Hope you enjoys it as much as me and mine!

I followed this recipe except I did not use any tomato sauce, just extra water.  The flavor was fantastic.  I also, as I always do, waited to add the potatoes and carrots until about 45 minutes before the end of cooking (I don't like mushy carrots).  I removed the potatoes when I set the pot roast out and oven-roasted them "dry" with butter.   This was a big hit with my family.    The leftovers made a great roast-beef-hash.

Made a few changes...omitted potatoes, added 3 stalks celery used Splenda instead of sugar.  Added a can of diced tomatoes and some red wine.  Followed the spices exactly.  Also browned meat first.  When I was making the sauce, I tasted it and I thought it was going to be awful...BUT after slow cooking it the combination of the meat juices and the sauce was absolutely awesome.  Served over noodles for the kids and they loved it too.  Husband rated it a sure keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Good flavor, I liked that it was a new twist on your standard pot roast without being over the top.  I took the advice of another reviewer and skipped the potatoes, carrots, and celery - glad I did.  The only real change I made, and I'd do it again, I didn't have tomato paste and subbed with a can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  I'll make this again.

I had no tomato sauce so I used tomato paste and 1 1/2 cups water and did not have orange zest so I used 1/2 cup orange juice and omitted sugar. I forgot the celery. I increased the seasonings by 50% as some were potentially stale. The flavors were wonderful and I did it in a convection oven for over 3 hrs after the initial stove prep. I'd definitely do this again!

I am in the Florida Keys and was looking for something tropical and Cuban. This roast fits the bill! An aromatic blend of flavors sets this pot roast apart from the rest. I had most of the ingredients, and made the roast on the stovetop. I only omitted the potatoes since I had already begun to cook up some black beans and rice. Fantastic!

I doubled the spices, used diced tomatoes instead of the sauce.  The tomatoes and onions were the only vegetables that I used since I just was not in the mood for the other veggies (but I plan to add potatoes next time). I added 1 tsp. of chipotle seasoning and a an envelope of beefy onion soup mix....I let it cook over night and it came out beyond perfect!!! Great alternative to the traditional pot roast if you want something different, savory and hearty!

This roast was so tasty - it had a unique flavour that was mouthwatering!  It has taken over as my new roast recipe.  I prepared it in a crockpot and it was delicious.

If your looking for something that is different then this is it. I wasn't sure what to expect, with the cocoa and cinnamon but it was really good. The only thing that  I did different was that I added about a 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce. It helped in giving it a very good flavor.
