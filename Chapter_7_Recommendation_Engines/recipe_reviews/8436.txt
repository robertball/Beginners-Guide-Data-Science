This is glorious!  Buttery, chocolatey goodness.  Perfect for dipping cupcakes!! (Amount stated was a bit more than I needed to glaze 24 full size cupcakes) Instead of bittersweet chocolate, I used up the rest of my semi-sweet chocolate chips. And, I just microwave'd butter and chocolate - as opposed to using the double boiler.

Bittersweet chocolate is not generally my preferenence for either eating or baking, but since hubs prefers dark chocolate I prepared this glaze as the recipe directs, using high quality Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate, and whoa, this made for an intensely chocolate glaze! It is soft, yet still looks glossy and shiny even after it sets.  I used this to glaze the rather plain tasting "Neapolitan Cake," also from this site, and they were perfect for each other. This would be the type of glaze I'd expect to see on European tortes or petit fours -it has that kind of smooth, professional look. I used the microwave to make this but let it go a little too long, so it wasn't as perfectly smooth as it should have been -be extra careful and attentive when melting chocolate, especially when you're using the expensive, good stuff! Once melted, it was a little too thin to pour, so I just stuck it in the fridge, stirring every now and then, till it became the right consistency. Serious chocolate fans will love this glaze!

I made this yesterday and it worked beautifully on a pound cake.  Great taste and easy to make and use.  I did it all in the microwave.

Perfect. Just what I needed for my son's birthday cake. NOTE: I used 8 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips, semi-sweet, and it worked perfectly. You don't have to have a fancy double-boiler. I just did what Grandma taught me and fit a bowl over a small saucepan. Wa-la, instant double boiler.

Wow, yummy, shiny, and easy.  I cut the recipe in half for 24 cupcakes.  I used half semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 1oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate since that is what I had on hand.  Even though I halfed the recipe since I used some unsweetened chocolate I used a whole tablespoon of honey and I melted the whole thing in a pyrex dish in the microwave.  I heated it for 20 seconds and then stirred and repeated until it was smooth (about 70 seconds total).  I will definitely use this again and again.

This was amazingly easy to make!  I substituted the corn syrup with honey, and it worked great!  Will definitely keep this recipe!

use a microwave!! put all ingredients in a glass measuring cup and microwave for 15 seconds, stir, then another 15 seconds, and stir, until smooth. It was a little thick for my preference so I added a few TBS of hot strong coffee to thin it out (have used rum too!) and it was perfect. will use this 283928908 more times!

This was so bitter, I would not use it again. It ruined the cake I made. No one commented on the cake at all and no one definitely asked for a second piece. When I tasted it I knew why. This was way too bitter, ended up scrapping it all off. I saved the cake by making a torte with the crumbs. This was embarassing as I took it to an event without trying it first. It was the worst item at the party.

Oh! this was so easy and very good.  I used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 dark chocolate chips. It was a little bit thick, but spread onto brownies very easily and oh so smooth.  Very decadent! Yum!

I didn't have any bittersweet chocolate on hand, so I used cooking chocolate. And I didn't have any corn syrup, so I just added 1 tbsp. of icing sugar. Turned out shiny & tasted good. My mini cupcakes looked very nice with the shiny glaze, with white chocolate rice sprinkled on top. Thanks for a simple & great recipe :-)

Super easy and impressive results.  Make sure you realize it calls for 8 ounces chocolate, not 1 (another reviewer gave it a bad review and mentioned she used 1.5 ounces!).  Shortening would work too and have more shine I believe.

Easy and delicious.  I used honey since I didn't have corn syrup.  First time I made it I poured it over the cake while still warm. I had some left over which I refrigerated in a plastic container.  Next morning I opened the container to find my glaze had turned into a scrumptious frosting.  I will never buy store frosting again.

Great, easy, beautiful! I poured it over a molded chocolate bunny cake and it looks like a giant chocolate Easter Bunny.  It even gives you just enough time to smoothe it over missed spots.

Once again my friend I knew you wouldn't disappoint with your recipe.  When looking for a glaze recipe I saw you posted one I knew right away that is the one I would try.  I didn't have the bittersweet but did use semi sweet and made half the batch because I was using it on a bundt cake.  However that all being said it is delicious smooth satiny buttery chocolaty what's not to love!  And half a batch works PERFECT for a bundt cake.

So amazingly good & easy! I made this for the first time to go on cupcakes last night and don't think I'll ever need to try another frosting recipe because I'm sold.  People raved about how beautifully shiny and professional looking it was as well how great it tasted.

Oh my goodness!  Absolutely the best glaze recipe I have ever used.  I halved the recipe to use on a Bundt cake.  It was perfect.  My family is not too happy though, because the cake will be going to a church function tomorrow, so they can't eat it.  Can't wait to try it on a dessert we will be eating at home.  Thanks.

I know some people love the dark bitter taste, but I don't and neither do the people I was making my cake for, so I added 2 more T. of corn syrup after I tasted it to sweeten it up just a little.  Next time I would even use this recipe with German chocolate with the 1 T. of corn syrup.  Texture-wise it turned out fantastic.  Nice and shiny and wonderful consistency for pouring over a fancy bundt pound cake.

This recipe tastes great, I poured it over a bundt cake.  I needed more glaze than the recipe called for, and I wanted the glaze thicker too.  So I added an extra 4 - 1oz. squares of chocolate (used a total of 12 - 1 oz. squares and did not increase the other two ingredients).  Yum!!!  Everyone loved it!

This stuff is very thin, it runs right of the cake and is about the same as oil. I did not like it and will never make it again, there's far too much butter in it, when you taste it you can not even taste the chocolate, only butter, and i used 1 an half ounces of chocolate. I did not care for the taste, and it's far too thin, i know its a glaze, and it do cover well but you can see the cake right through it. The only reason i made this in the first place is because it was liked to the Petit Fours page, and it's awful for them. I did not care for this recipe. I'm highly disappointed. I'm hoping I'll be able to save it by making a different one and pouring it on top of it, it really do not want to throw out the filled cake.

Well, wasn't that easy!   Quick to make and tasty to eat.  I wish my final product had a little more shine to it, but nevertheless, a great go-to recipe.  I probably need to experiment with different brands of chocolate and perhaps the quantity of corn syrup.  Maybe someone out there has ideas on how to make this a pinch more shiny...?  I'm all ears.

This is the perfect in between frosting and a glaze.  It is a shiny beautiful finish.  The recipe is forgiving I have used different mixes of chocolate types and honey or corn syrup.  I prefer using honey.  Agree with other reviewers do it in the microwave all ingredients.  Do 20 second intervals mix and mash until smooth. Really great recipe!

I was in the middle of making mine and i decided not to use  the double boiler and instead put it on the stove at medium heat. I worked out fine great! but it was to bitter for me so i added a lot of sugar.

Absolutely delicious! I used this on a super moist chocolate cake  (recipe from here "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III") and everyone said it was like a lava cake. 
Highly recommend!
Tip: pour icing over cake right before you serve. The warm icing adds an extra kick of delicious to the whole thing.

I made this as a try out for next time I make Madeleine cookies and dip half in chocolate. I made 1/4 the recipe and that amount will be perfect for 24 madeleines.  Recipe is so easy to make in microwave.... next time I will use round glass bowl instead of measuring cup to make dipping easier.  I used good quality semisweet 64% Guittard chocolate and as a practice run I covered some strawberries, orange segments and plain butter cookies.  My 1/4 recipe was 2 TBL butter, 3/4 teas. corn syrup, 2 ounces semisweet chocolate.  Nice and shiny and delicious!

Lives up to its name.  And it's very easy and quick  to make in the microwave.   I may reduce the amount of butter next time, just to make it set up quicker.  I'll be using this recipe a lot in the future.

I made it exactly as the recipe said as I actually had a box of bittersweet chocolate, light corn syrup and butter. So bitter! I'm only giving it two stars instead of one because I was able to fix it to make it palatable. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla, two more tablespoons of corn syrup, and it was still bad. I ended up using about 1 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and couple of more tablespoons of butter. Basically, a whole new recipe. The reason I used the original recipe in the first place was because I didn't have the 3-4 cups of powdered sugar the other recipes on this site called for.

Very good!  Especially on donuts.  Sets up perfectly.  Perfect consistency and the taste was great.  This would be great on a bundt cake too.  My kids loved it.  I used 8 oz of semisweet chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate squares.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried to prepare 1/2 the recipe for 4 small chocolate chip cakes that I baked.  I used unsweetened chocolate because that's what I had on hand.   I had to increase the amount of syrup and add some milk to make the glaze smooth rather than thick like a frosting. It's ok, but I think there are easier ways to prepare a quick chocolate glaze and that's what I was looking for today.
