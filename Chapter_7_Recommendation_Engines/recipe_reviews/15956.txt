very quick and easy to put together and make. tasty too! be sure to stir them after ten minutes and "drain" evenly on paper towels to take away some of the greasy-ness.

Love these! This recipe is my favorite because only 1/4 c. oil is used vs. as much as 1 c. in other recipes. Last time I made them I was out of the ranch dressing mix, so I just used the spices and added some seasoned salt and pepper. They were great that way too!

This recipe was o.k. I thought mine turned out a little bland, and I used all of the "optional" ingredients except the garlic powder. If you use garlic salt in place of garlic powder I am certain that they will turn out too salty as someone else mentioned.  In addition - if you use a standard box (15 oz.) of oyster crackers you will probably need to increase the oil. My son loves these.. so I will continue to experiment with the recipe.

Wow, how have I never made these before?!  Such a simple party staple.  I followed the directions, thought I do always sub canola for veggie and I chose to leave out the optional lemon pepper for personal preference.  I used the new HVR spicy ranch packet and it has a nice little kick.  FYI-5C of crackers is one standard size bag.

Easy and delicious.  Omitted the dill weed and lemon pepper and added 1/4 tsp cajun seasoning.  Shook it up in a ziploc and poured it onto a foiled lined sheet.  Baked for 16 minutes and the crispiness is perfect!

I have been making these crackers for sometime and I love them. Especially around the holidays.  Their savoriness is a nice change from all of the sweet stuff that is out around Christmastime.

To a previous reviewer - When you read the recipe and nutritionional information, you must have realized that it was going to be very salty!  [AllRecipes estimation - Amount Per Serving - Calories: 275; Total Fat: 14.1g; Cholesterol: 0mg; Sodium: 1116mg; Total Carbs: 32.4g; Dietary Fiber: 1.4g; Protein: 3.8g]  My only suggestion is to use only half the package of ranch dressing mix.

these are very good.  made as the recipe stated, although i did make my own dry ranch mix with a recipe from recipezaar bc i didn't have ranch seasoning.  didn't have any issues with greasiness.  the flavor is very strong, so you could reduce mix part by half if you don't like strong flavored crackers, but i do and it was perfect for me.  thanks for the recipe!  bf and i both like them.

These are delicious and sooo easy!  I used twice the amount of oyster crackers (1 whole box) and substituted cajun seasoning mix for the lemon pepper.  This cut the saltiness and added a little spicy kick.  Yum!

Good, but very salty.  I added the optional ingredients (and extra dill), but had to "brush off" the baked crackers to reduce the pure salty taste.

These were so tasty. For those that complain of too salty, or too much seasoning, I suggest analyzing the ingredients you're using. First, I think a brand name ranch mix makes a difference. I've bought several and make my own dressing - they're not all the same. Second, are you using an especially salty cracker? I used Premium crackers. Love them, but don't find them in every store. Last, look at the package of ranch mix. Mine are all 2 ounces. If you use the whole package you're doubling the seasonings.

That being said, you can't go wrong with this tasty recipe.

Definitely reduce the salt when making this one, very flavorful, but way too salty.

I remember my aunt used to make these for our family vacations to appease us kids and I haven't had these since. I made these today and not kidding...they're already gone!! Didn't last the hour (good thing I bought extra ingrediants to make another batch). I added all spices, including the optional ones, and everyone loved these.  My roommate wants me to make some just so he can use them for his lunches at work. Thanks Jackie!!

This recipe is very good.  I did make a few changes to how I prep this though because my family likes them especially zippy. I upped the oil to 1/3 cup,  and raised the dill and lemon pepper to 1 tsp.  Makes some seriously zippy crackers!

I LOVE this recipe! Always a huge hit wherever I take it! For me, the crackers baked too quickly so I shortened the baking time to 5-6 minutes then stirred, and baked 5 -6 minutes more. Turned out great! Will definitely make again and again.

Easy, cheap and everyone loves these crackers.  I combine the dsg mix, dill, oil, lemon pepper, etc and put it all together with a box of oyster crackers in a gallon sized plastic bag and just gently toss around.  You can actually coat the crackers more evenly that way and not have a big bowl to clean.   Anyway you make them, they are a hit.

I love these things - certainly not the healthiest, but who cares. I substitute Orville Redenbacher's Butter Flavored Popcorn Oil for the vegetable oil for a little extra flavor.

I am on a low sodium diet so I used only a half of a package of the ranch dressing mix. The crackers still had a great flavor, but less sodium. Very good!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because it's so simple.  My 10 oz. bag of Nabisco Premium crackers measured about 5-1/2 cups.  I used Mrs. Dash's lemon pepper and twice the indicated garlic powder because my family loves it so.  Next time I'm going to sprinkle in just a tad of cayenne.

These were great! I made these for the kids today and they loved them! I used the "dry ranch style seasoning for dip or dressing" from here instead of the packet of ranch. Turned out great!

Very nice, standard recipe. I like the garlic powder but not the lemon pepper. Store these in an airtight container. Thank you.

So-so recipe.  I think the whole package of ranch dressing mix was too much.  It had a very intense flavor, almost a bit too overwhelming for me.  The next time I think I will half the amount of dressing.

Agree with others - way too salty. Use only a half packet of ranch mix, then it will be very good!

These are great especially during the holidays for a snack! My advice would be to make your own dry ranch dressing so that you can add just a touch more seasoning if you'd like.  I just added my recipe on here for that called Dry Buttermilk Ranch Dressing mix.

These are a tasty snack...just be sure to have breath mints and a tall glass of water on hand if you're going to use the specified amount of garlic powder. I felt 1/4 tsp garlic powder was a bit too much--a dash would've sufficed. I used Buttermilk Ranch and omitted the lemon pepper as I had none on hand.

I love this recipe as is as far as ingredients go. Instead of the oven, I put them in an air tight container and turned them every 5 min for 1/2 hour. Great and no oven needed! No complaints on the recipe, 5 star all the way!

We didn't really care for these. They were awfully salty and I think the ranch powder has a weird after taste. Thanks for posting though it's clear lots of others enjoy it.

The optional ingredients are a must!  I tried mixing it all up without the lemon pepper and it was okay, but after adding it, these are outstanding!  My husband and girls are munching them up pretty fast!  Very good and nice change of pace for snacking.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were very tasty and VERY easy.  I always have oyster cracker handy because my husband likes chili year round.( Weido! It can be 90 degrees out and he wants chili). L.O.L.   Anyway, loved the recipe.

Where HAVE these little babies BEEN all my life???  I had some goldfish crackers that were starting to get a little stale, so I went looking for something to make with them...and this is what I decided on.  OMGosh!  These are so good it makes me sad I only had two cups of crackers to work with (reduced the servings to 4 for the 2 cups of crackers).  I'll be buying more snack crackers to make these on a regular basis, for sure!

Be very wary of the lemon pepper you use! For years I assumed that it just had, well, lemon and pepper, but the cheap stuff is LOADED with SALT! Look for the salt free version, and I believe it will resolve the over-saltiness!  LOVE these addictive little crackers!!

Lovely flavor!  For ease of prep, though, pour everything but the oil in a paper bag, then add oil, roll the top closed and shake shake shake... This mixes everything up really well, and gets rid of any extra oil.

These crackers are so good. A popular name brand of crackers now come in small squares (like cheeze-its) and it is fun to make this recipe using them and mix them in a bowl with cheeze-its.

These crackers were super easy to make and they taste so good! I gave 4 out of 5 stars because I did tweak the recipe a little. I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 tsp of dill weed. I mixed them by shaking them in a covered bowl, and the coating was perfectly even! Thanks so much for sharing this fun and simple recipe!

Yummy!  I didn't think they were too salty, for crackers it seemed just right. I added all the extras and thought they were a good addition, not too garlicky at all and the dill was delish.

Yum!  I got these once in a Christmas package from my band director's wife, and I fell madly in love with them.  I was so happy to find this recipe.  These were delicious and easy.  The people around me loved them very much, and they are a nice addition to many soups.  I now make these every year for Christmas to give as gifts.  Everyone loves them!  I have only once added the lemon pepper, as it's not something I keep stock in my kitchen.  I think they taste fine without it.

This is a classic keeper recipe to me! First time I had these was about 25 years ago and they are still as popular as then. Easy, inexpensive and even the little kids like them. Don't need to change one thing.

I make a variation of these crakers that are much easier. All you do is mix the oil, ranch dressing packet, and oyster crakers in a large zip lock bag and let them sit. These are soo much easier to make and my whole family loves them.

I make these every Christmas and they are so good.   The only thing is I like the better if they are not cooked.  I just mix everything together the night before and let it sit on a Ziploc bag.  Great for male teacher gifts!!

So good!  Going to try with a low-sodium ranch pack, though.  I was raised eating very little salt, so the saltiness was a bit much to handle.  Made it no less delicious, though, and it was a hit with my friends.

We loved this.  Dried dill can be strong so I used 1/4 tsp dill and 1/4 tsp italian seasoning.  I also used a little more than 1/4 C oil.

These are really good! I used Dill Harvest flavor ranch packet and added the lemon pepper, garlic powder, and oil.  This was really easy and I cant stop eating them! Thanks for the recipe!

Made double batches of these for two separate parties. The crackers did not seem to go over well at either one. I personally like them so I would make them again for movie night at home.   The garlic powder and lemon pepper IMHO are essential to this recipe so do not omit them!

These are a Holiday tradition at my house.  I make several batches and give them as gifts, too.
I use a 12-16 oz. box of crackers, 3/4 cup oil, the ranch mix, 1 tsp dill, 1/4 tsp lemon pepper and 1/4 tsp garlic powder.

These were OK to snack on.  I would probably only make them again if I had oyster crackers to use up.  I included the optional ingredients - did not find them over-powering or too salty or some of the other comments I've seen.  I do see the baking time as way too long.  I went to stir them at 10 minutes and they were already over-done and had gotten a bit dry & bland.  They were very strong before baking, so they do need baked, but I just can't imagine 15 or especially 20 minutes.  (And my oven does not run hot.)

I halved the amount of ranch dressing, omitted the dill and lemon pepper and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I'm very happy that I used olive oil instead- it added a really yummy olive taste.  Thanks for the recipe Jackie- I'm sure I'll make this again.

This is a great recipe.  Every time I make it, someone asks me for the recipe.  I have to make twice as much as I need because my husband and daughter will eat it as soon as it comes out of the oven and I don't have any left.

I used lower sodium crackers and the store brand of the ranch-dressing (as the packet showed it had lower sodium content than the name-brand).  Using all of the optional ingredients, these turned out WONDERFUL!  They are super-easy to make and still had enough saltiness to satisfy a salty craving.

Great recipe!  It was a definite hit with my family at a cookout a few weeks back.  Can't forget to mention, so easy to make!  The only change I made was to use buttery popcorn oil rather than the vegetable oil.

these are a really tasty snack!  if you like a little spice, i have sprinkled these with crushed red pepper flakes after coming out of the oven!  i have never measured how much, i just eyeball it but it gives it a spicy flavor that really adds to the ranch!

Very Good!  I omitted the lemon pepper, but left the rest of the recipe the same.  I made them for snacks for the holiday weekend.  Now they just have to last until my company arrives!

For some reason there are two recipes for this exactly the same, submitted by the same person, so I'm rating both.

These crackers are so good!  The recipe is simple and inexpensive.  I made these a few days ago just to snack on and I've decided they're on the list for my next get together.  I left out the dill weed because I don't really care for dill, I also left out the optional lemon pepper because I just can't imagine lemon pepper with ranch dressing, but maybe it's good.  I did add the garlic powder though.  I had an 18 oz package of oyster crackers, so I'm not sure if that was 5 cups or more/less.  I cut back on the oil a tiny bit and it didn't compromise the recipe a bit.

I definitely give this recipe the full 5 stars, which I don't often do!

This recipe has become a holiday staple in our house! I use a 14 oz. box of crackers and increase the oil to 1/2 cup.  I've not noticed any additional "greasiness" with the doubled amount of oil... instead it allows the crackers to be coated more evenly as noted by another reviewer.

To cut down on the salt content, I only used a half package of the dressing, but added in more of my own seasonings to make up for it. Kids loved them and thanks!

Not sure if I did something wrong but these didn't turn out like ones I've tasted before. The seasoning mix was all clumpy so some had no flavor and some had way too much. Think I'll try another recipe for this next time.

Great recipe.  I made it as one of the appetizers/snacks before Christmas dinner.  I recommend adding the optional seasonings, in fact I added a little bit more of everything - (we like our food to have lots of flavor).  Everyone loved it!  My father-in-law even asked for the recipe and my husband wanted me to make more with the leftover crackers!

I have been making these for about 3 years now. Never thought about as a side dish. I make them for a football snack. Delious!!! And more healthier than chips or pretzels. But I eat those too. Real easy to  make.

These are good and a bit salty. They are good in tomatoe soup and chili. I have also made this using pretzels. I baked the first batch but haven't baked them since- they don't seem to need it.

Made these a year ago and my boyfriend STILL asks for them.  Need to make them again, alwasy forget how quick this is.  I do remember it being slightly salty though - it's definitely the Ranch dressing mix; might try to find sodium free or something next time.  Definitely cant wait to use on soup.

THESE ARE WONDERFUL!  I've made these for several years now and always keep them on hand for the holidays.  They are so easy & just delicious.  All my family begs for more...I can hardly keep them in "stock".  The dillweed is one of my favorites spices. I use it a lot in the "soup sauces" over chicken.  It's really the flavor-maker for these crackers!

I adjusted some of the measurements for less salt. I also used butter instead of oil. Added sesame seeds, goldfish crackers as well and extra dill weed. LOVE These!!

FYI: 3 tablespoons of Ranch Dressing Mix equals 1 (1 oz) package.
I buy the large seasoning containers of the mix, so this info comes in handy.

Instead of vegetable oil I use olive oil. I just prefer the flavor of olive oil.

Like other reviewers, I chose this recipe because it calls for less oil than similar recipes.  You really don't need that extra oil.

I will definitely make this my "go to" recipe for this tasty snack. 
Delish!  :)

The vegetable oil can be overwhelming so I replaced it with Orville Redenbacher's butter flavored popcorn oil.  Heat it on the stove on medium low heat until warm and add all the seasonings.  Stir and heat until mostly dissolved before pouring over the oyster crackers.

Hadn't made these for years & came across this recipe. Quick & easy. I mix the oil with the spices in a small bowl, then gradually  add it to the crackers while slowly stirring. I use 2 nine oz bags of crackers & there is plenty of seasoning. Do not mix in a bag, it holds to much if the seasonings. I also don't find it necessary to blot on a paper towel. My husband us addicted to these crackers

So easy, and much better with the 1/4 cup of oil, rather than almost a cup of oil. After the baking the crackers seemed less salty than tasting them before the baking.

I'm saving this recipe, but making a side note to just use 4 c. of oyster crackers, since I too thought it was a bit on the bland side.

These were good and very easy to make.  I used the "dry ranch mix" from this site, a dried dill mix from the Pampered Chef and Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning.  Will be making this again for sure.  Not too over powering!

Love this! I had a big bag of small pretzels leftover after making candy corn bark from this site (which was a huge hit!) so I did a combo of oyster crackers, pretzels and reduced fat cheez-its. I also added a shake of red pepper flakes to give it some kick. It turned out great and not too greasy.

These crackers are great, but make it easier on yourself...put oyster crackers, dried RANCH mix (package or homemade from this site), and olive oil (to YOUR taste for both) in a gallon size bag/bowl and mix. I do NOT bake...takes 5-10 minutes max and still a hit with my family and friends. (Yep, they ask for the "recipe"!!)

What a nice treat and so easy.  I did bake for exactly 15 minutes and it was perfect, turning once at 7 minutes in.  Great little snack cracker, almost like a "Chicken in a Biscuit" cracker.  I bet this would work with regular saltines too so you could use them as dippers into some dill dip.  Thank you for this easy, tasty recipe.

This was a good recipe but we didn't like the addition of the lemon pepper. While lemon pepper is one of our favorite spices, it seemed to over power the ranch flavor.

Love this snack! Have been looking for this recipe for years! My childhood neighbor's mom use to make this for us at sleepovers,  however we called it "bolts and screws" because she would add pretzel sticks as well and the oyster crackers favor the tops of bolts...anyway, thanks so much for sharing!

My mother's made these as long as I can remember! We tend to mix it up with the spices, but dill is the most important part.

Great snack that is very easy to make.  Apparently the recipe must have changed since several of the older remarks refer to using less salt, but the current recipe doesn't show salt as an ingredient.  Definately do not use galic SALT to make this, but use garlic powder as shown in the receipe.

Everyone loves these, although I never seem to have dill, but always use the lemon pepper, which really perks the flavor.  Today, the store was actually out of regular HV ranch dry mix, and I substituted Fiesta Ranch for one batch ... definitely a different flavor, although the original was better.  (I'm an oyster cracker "snob" ... the big fat Nabisco ones are much better, IMHO, than the cheaper store brand I've tried.)

We call these "Grama Crackers" because Grama always makes them. Only use Nabisco Premium Soup and Oyster crackers (2- 10 oz. bags), they are a better cracker and not as salty as the cheep ones. Also use Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing mix,(better flavor). I use 1 cup of oil, it coats the crackers with all the flavoring and be sure you use the GARLIC POWDER not garlic salt!

An excellent snack.

Have been making this for years(am not sure where we first got the recipe) and everyone from kids to adults rave about them. I never had a complaint about them being too salty, oily or strong of taste.

My only issue is that I want to eat them all myself!

Hallelujah! This is the originnal HV Ranch cracker recipe that I had many years ago and now cannot locate! 

I used the dressing mix in a 'family size' canister where 3 T = 1 packet of mix and ended up sprinkling more of the mix over the crackers in my large roaster pan before baking.

Thanks for posting this recipe! I have added it to my recipe box to save for (savor) for ever!

I've been wanting to try this for a long time. Since I did the marinated pretzles, I thought I'd give this a go next. Only thing I changed was up the garlic powder and add 1/4 tsp. ground red pepper for a little heat. Good recipe. I plan on making this again, since we prefer homemade salty snacks over potato chips.

These are good crackers.  I used a little more than half of the dressing mix and it was very flavorful without being too salty.  I omitted the lemon pepper.  I added these to some other snacks such as pretzels and cashews for a party snack mix.

For some reason there are two recipes for this exactly the same, submitted by the same person, so I'm rating both.

These crackers are so good!  The recipe is simple and inexpensive.  I made these a few days ago just to snack on and I've decided they're on the list for my next get together.  I left out the dill weed because I don't really care for dill, I also left out the optional lemon pepper because I just can't imagine lemon pepper with ranch dressing, but maybe it's good.  I did add the garlic powder though.  I had an 18 oz package of oyster crackers, so I'm not sure if that was 5 cups or more/less.  I cut back on the oil a tiny bit and it didn't compromise the recipe a bit.

I definitely give this recipe the full 5 stars, which I don't often do!

This is just one awesome little snack recipe. I left out the dill, because my family doesn't like it, but these crackers were still terrific and so easy.

I think the inexpensive brands of oyster crackers work best (less greasy) and I just use the whole 12 oz package per batch. I always double 
the recipe then use 1/2 the amount of the garlic, dill, and lemon pepper for each batch. Very tasty.

Very yummy! Made with the optional ingredients and used about 1/3 cup of veggie oil. Baked for 15 minutes.  Other reviewers said it perfectly when they described these as addictive and I didn't find them to be too salty at all. Will definitely make again.

I love this snack!  We used to eat it as kids, and it's still great.  I never had it with lemon pepper, but I think that was a welcome addition.  Makes it a little tangy and even better.

Quick easy snack!  I think I will add another
 1-2 cups of crackers to the mixture next time, may balance the flavors out a little more, it was pretty "zesty"!  I will definately be making these again though...better than store bought.

I made this, but might have done something wrong.  The mixture clumped on the cracker, some crackers had a lot and some had none.  The flavor was great but if you got one of the ones with a big clump on it, it was overwhelming.

These came out very good, but I think it could've had more ranch flavor. Every persons tastes are different, so I just need to add more ranch powder next time. Thanks for the recipe!

My dear departed neighbor lady turned me on to these years ago.  However, she (and now I) do it a little differently.  Instead of oil, use spray butter and spritz the tops.  Don't skimp on the dressing.  A touch of sea salt and garlic sprinkled on top is all that's needed.  No need to stir them when in the oven.

I found some crushed red pepper flavored oyster crackers at Kroger earlier in the week, and thay make a wonderful addition to the plain ones with just ranch dressing.  Mix erm 50/50 with the plain ones, and you'll be impressed/

I've done this with oyster crackers, as written, and it's fabulous but I also used goldfish crackers and they were delicious, also.  Fun way to mix it up.  Love this recipe!

Super easy and so yummy. Didn’t have lemon pepper seasoning, so I’d like to try it with next time to see if I like it any better.

These were pretty good. Seemed a little dry but I used minimal oil (1/4 cup). Great for soup or salad toppers though.

Coat the crackers with the oil first before sprinkling on mixed seasonings. Just eye measured seasonings so I'm sure I added  slightly more than what's in the recipe.

All I can say is WOW!  You can make this as spicy or flavorful as you wish.  Add your own flavor combos.  

I made this one exactly as the recipe called for, however, my mind was running rampant on all the things I could use in place of the ranch.  Very tasty snack.

I remember my mother making this when I was a child (and I'm 47 now), so this recipe holds a lot of love and holiday memories for me. It's very simple and pops with flavor. I get requests to bring to parties all the time!

Great recipe. This was a quick, easy and addicting! I used name brand oyster crackers and have sometimes subbed in olive oil, depending what I have handy. I added the optional ingredients and next time I might even add in something spicy like cayenne or Cajun seasoning to kick it up a notch. I individually bagged these as gifts for Christmas and everyone couldn't stop eating them. Be prepared to get really thirsty afterwards! Super salty, but in a good way. :)

I  made these so my family could have a tasty snack. I did follow the recipe exactly. I used premium oyster crackers instead of store brand. While shopping i noticed the store brand crackers had salt on them so that's why I chose the premium. They were rather salty but very yummy. Before making i skimmed a few reviews and noticed that one suggested to cool on paper towels. That this would help to soak up the grease. Instead of vegetable oil I opted to use olive oil and they were not greasy at all.

I didn't add the optional lemon pepper seasoning but I did add the garlic powder. My family prefers it with the garlic powder. I also doubled the amount of crackers to stretch the dressing and it worked out beautifully for our tastes! Anytime I can stretch a recipe without compromising taste, I do. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

You can try mixing everything in a clean paper bag. Just pour everything in and shake and the bag will absorb the oil.

This is the first time I made this. I omitted the dill weed. I think it's too strong along with ranch dressing mix. I also nearly doubled the lemon pepper. This is by far the best batch I've ever had. It was a big hit at my son's first birthday party.

I just used 1 box of crackers. Measured about 7 cups I think. Used just a touch more oil. Maybe 1/3 cup. There is absolutely no need to use 1 c. as other recipes call for. Because I had a few more crackers I used a little more dill and a little more lemon pepper. The optional ingredients are a must, they shouldn't be optional. Stir very well. Baked only 15 minutes with a 10 min. Into it stir as they were browning just a little bit.

it is great!  At first I thought it was too salty, but the more I  ate the more addicted I became.  I want to ttys it with Italian dressing mix.  A 1/4 cup oil is perfect, not too greasy.

Very easy to make. Put the garlic powder in it but opted out of the lemon pepper. My 8 year old son loves it and he is the worlds pickiest eater!  I may opt out of the garlic powder next to see the taste difference.

Made a huge batch to take to a tailgate, and they turned out great! I ended up making about 7 cups with the full packet of ranch seasoning, but it was the perfect amount of seasoning. Easy and tasty.

Loved it! My Grandmother made this snack all the time and I was trying to find a recipe like hers. This one is very simular, without the lemon pepper. It's a nice base to any dressing mix too. We used Italian dressing mix once and that was just as good! Thanks for sharing!

I made these without the dillweed, lemon and garlic powder. I made it with oil, crackers and sour cream and onion mix. It's ugly. But it tastes alright.

Delicious and addictive!  If you want snack that tastes like this but is better for you, you can replace the oyster crackers with 2 or 3 cans (depending on how strong you like your flavors) drained, rinsed and dried garbanzo beans.  Dry roast the beans 10 min @ 425F, shake, 10 min, mix with seasonings, back in the oven for 10 min, shake, 10 min, done.  Just as delicious, but fewer carbs and more protein and fiber.

These were not bad. However, I will probably double the seasoning for these crackers next time. My sister used to make these all the time and I thought they were so good. I did omit the dill weed as I didn't have any, but they still tasted good.

I have made this recipe so many times, I practically have it memorized!  We love it!!!!!!!!  I have made it with and without the optional ingredients and our verdict is, keep the lemon pepper, skip the garlic powder.  I guess the dry Ranch mix I use has plenty in it! This is a great recipe and you can make a LOT with very little effort!  Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years. Pretty much the way it is written. These crackers are GREAT on cream of brocoli soup. And, if you're having a party, they go great with beer, too. (or so I am told!)

I love these crackers, but I make a small, unhealthy (but yummy) switch.  Instead of vegetable oil, I use Orville Redenbachers buttery popcorn oil, and just one envelope of ranch dressing mix.  I can't keep them in my house, they go so fast!  I took some to work and people went crazy!  They are so buttery and delicious!

These were good, however, I guess I agree with the one reviewer that they were a bit bland compared to a recipe I had used years ago.

Tasted like the ones my grandma makes... but a little too salty. I think next time I'll use not quite a whole package of Ranch seasoning or I'll add an extra cup or two of crackers. Otherwise - great snack and my kids love them. They tasted good on chili too.

Try using broken-up pretzels instead of the crackers.  They are also good - a favorite of all my grandchildren.

Good finger food - m friend brought them on a lake trip and were great to snack on on the boat. I made them for a swim meet and everyone loved them.  If you skimp on the oil - the spices will not stick.  I add parmesan, too.

We didn't care for these much -followed the recipe exactly.  I thought they were just ok but after eating them a few times  I realized that the more I ate them the less I liked them.

These were surprisingly tasty!  Also, a nice, inexpensive and easy recipe to make with little kids, particularly if you have 3/4 of a bag of oyster crackers going stale in your cupboard!  My daughter enjoyed mixing the ingredients, and she liked the finished result.  Didn't have any lemon pepper so I omitted it - these little crackers still tasted good!

These are always good at a party, make sure you use garlic powder and not garlic salt, or the guests will be drinking all your beverages to get over the saltiness.
