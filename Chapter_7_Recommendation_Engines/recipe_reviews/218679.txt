I didn't have any of the old style mustard, so I winged it. Cut the bread, toasted it in the oven, rubbed it with garlic (I didn't think it would give too much flavor by just rubbing-boy was I WRONG) I diced 1/2 of a large shallot-it was a little strong so I took the edge off by sauteing in a pan w/a little evoo added some diced heirloom tomato (saving some fresh dice) sprinkled the toast w/evoo added the saute mixture, topping with the rest of the fresh heirloom tomato and torn pcs of fresh basil......YUM will make again!

This was a good recipe - I like the mustard in it. Although the red onion was too strong for me. I would use a third to a quarter the amount of onion. All in all, I would definitely recommend this recipe to someone who wants a good, classic Brushetta.

this was so good, left the mustard out as we didn't have any and used dried basil and put under the broiler on a middle rack for 10 minutes approx and served with fresh grated romano
