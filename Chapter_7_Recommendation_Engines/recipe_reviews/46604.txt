Sometimes Orange Roughy has a very fishy taste, but the tomatoes, spice and sherry add a unique flavor that compliments this meaty fish.  I used stewed tomatoes rather than fresh tomatoes and the results were excellent!

I substituted flounder because my market didn't have fresh orange roughy. While the fish was moist after baking 40 minutes, there was an overpowering flavor that we didn't care for.  I'm guessing that it was the amount of thyme.  If you wanted to experiment with the seasonings, this recipe could have possibilities.

Such an easy-to-prepare meal that tastes fancy.  We loved the sherry and herb sauce.  It was subtle yet flavorful.  I baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  The sauce would be great over chicken or pork, too.

Easy to make.  Very tasty.  Used thin slices of tomatoes and sweet sherry.  Took a full 40 min. to bake.  Will surely make again!

Substituted chicken, cooked for 40 min at 325.  Also added sauteed mushrooms in another layer.  Truly tasty.

This is a wonderful recipe!  We've tried it with tilapia and it also worked out well.  The only changes we made were that we added some minced garlic with the melting butter and increased the salt a bit. And at times when we haven't had fresh tomatoes, we've drained a can of diced tomatoes and used those instead. Otherwise, we pretty much followed the recipe.  Thanks, Doreen!

I really loved the flavor and delicacy of this recipe - my husband commented that this is good enough for "company" - I only had 2 fillets so I surrounded the dish with spinach using the remaining sauce - also I diced the tomatoes on top - looked pretty and the whole presentation was lovely plus it tasted GREAT !  I did use a bit of salt in the sauce as well !

This is a delicious recipe! I have made it quite a few times and my family loves it. I have also varied the recipe by adding white wine instead of sherry and that works well too. Thanks for sharing!

Super yummy!  My daughter thought this recipe tasted like it was cooked in a restaurant. I omitted the salt and put capers on top of the tomato slices.  After 30 minutes, I spooned the sauce over the fish a couple of times, and baked it for another 15 minutes.  I doubled the sauce, but next time I would triple it if serving with rice.  It's a keeper!

I made this per the directions, omitting the sliced tomato, I don't like my tomatoes cooked.  It's good, but I think I'll reduce the salt next time!  The sherry was just a bit overpowering, I think a dry white wine would be suitable as well.

Wowza! This was so tasty. I altered the recipe for 6 servings and made 3 roughy fillets. I also used stewed tomatoes and I think I would prefer them over fresh tomatoes in this application. Served over a bed of lightly steamed spinach and brown rice. Oh, I also used veggie broth instead of chicken and it was tasty, tasty. Thanks for the quick and impressive recipe.

This was good but a little bland.  It needs more flavor. Next time I'll probably add garlic and more herbs.

This was fantastic ... it's just my boyfriend and I ... so I used 2 pieces of fish and 14 med shrimp ... we like our food saucy, so I made the whole recipe ... next time I'll add a shallot and some garlic to the butter/flour mixture and double the sauce because I served this over rice and it got a little dry ... will definitely be making this recipe again ... it's a keeper!!!

Very good, I'd really give it 4.5 stars, but not quite at the fabulous 5 star mark for me.  I used frozen orange roughy filets and subsituted diced tomatoes with basil and garli for the tomato slices.  It did take the entire time to cook, and I even let it cook longer since using frozen filets. Very tasty.

OMG so good! I did this with frozen Chilean sea bass (which is really a cod) from Costco. It's hard to understand the people who said this was bland. That's a worry I have about white fish in general, but not this!

I made this for my husband and he loved it. I left out the tomatoes because he can't have them and added a 4 cheese blend during the last 5 minutes. This also works with my low carb diet

It was easy and very tasty.  I used organic brown rice flour instead of all-purpose flour for a gluten free recipe and it worked well.

Made this recipe for the first time - used Patagonian tooth fish because that's what hubby came home with from the store - added some garlic and capers to the sauce and some sliced mushrooms on the fish per other reviewers.  Easy to make, smelled wonderful while baking and served it over whole wheat noodles with steamed broccoli.  Three of us loved it - very moist and fluffy fish, great flavor.  Son didn't like - he's not much of a foodie or a fish lover.  Next time I would double the sauce recipe but do everything else the same!  Also curious to try over chicken and other fish!

I made this and my husband and I loved it.  I used Cod because I couldn't get orange roughy. I also added cooked spinich around the edge of my baking dish. It gave the dish some color and tasted great.  The sauce was delicious and I think it would be good on chicken.

Very yummy!  To make this Gluten Free just replace the all-purpose flour with equal part rice flour and a touch of arrowroot starch (which helps makes the sauce thicker).

This was a good recipe.  My husband and I didn't love it but we enjoyed the different flavors and a fresh way to cook the orange roughy to disguise the fishy taste it has!

The sauce was really good and easy to make.  I may try with different types of fish.  My family really liked the tomato on top even though I didn't think it brought much in terms of flavor.

This was delicious!  I added garlic that I sliced up very thin.  I also used whole wheat flour and canned tomatoes.  We will definitely do this again!

This was my first time making orange roughy. It was very good. I added more sherry and chicken broth because I like my food saucy. I also added capers which was a previous reviewer's suggestion...this is a must for this recipe.

Tender and delicious. I had a last minute substitute of white cooking wine for the sherry. Even my picky 15 yr old liked it!

With a DH who doesn't really like fish, I tried this and it was a real hit!  He said it should be on our regular rotation of meals.  I did add the capers like someone suggested.  The sauce is truly AWESOME!

Great way to add flavor to orange roughy!  I added a side of zuchini in the herb sauce.

This recipe is great, I would serve with some lemon slices but other than that wouldn't change a thing.
