Delicious! I made this in my panini press with gluten free bread instead of pumpernickel. I squished the chickpeas with a fork before adding to the sandwich to keep them from rolling away. I thought one slice of prosciutto was not enough, so I added one more. My prosciutto is transparently thin though. I also added some hot peppers. Great flavor, no need for salt. Thank you for the recipe.
