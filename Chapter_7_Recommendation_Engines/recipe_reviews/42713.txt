This is exactly what you need on a hot summer day.  I felt like I was back in Cancun after sipping on one of these!  Thanks so much for my new favorite drink.

I used to say "Tequila'll kill ya" and then someone gave me a holiday gift of a bottle of tequila. What to do? 2 years later, I finally pulled the bottle off the shelf yesterday after reading this recipe and its reviews. We've been experiencing record-hot temps and humidity for days and days this summer; I needed a quick fix.

So easy!! There is no more-refreshing drink out there that can be so easy to make - except maybe a tall glass of water, but that's no fun. Especially no fun to say! Thanks for the recipe.

This was SO good.  I served it with my homemade enchiladas.  I made just a couple of adustments - first, I used equal parts of salt and sugar for the rim of the glass and second I combined lemonade, tequilla, ice, lime juice and limes in a shaker and then poured into the glass.  I used Patron - delicious!

YUM!  I've been looking for an easy drink to prepare for my guests at an upcoming party and this fits the bill perfectly.  You cannot taste the tequila at all which makes this delicious drink a little dangerous!  Love the name too!

I had to try this because I have two chihuahuas and a bottle of tequila. I loved it. Not fond of the salt so I skip that step. Great drink for summer. Love the name!

I made this on a whim with fresh lemonade made in my Vitamix.  I used a good silver tequila, and it was delicious!  Thinking it might also be good with a good quality whisky for a little variation.

I am a tequila fan and would never have mixed with lemonade.  Very enjoyable.
