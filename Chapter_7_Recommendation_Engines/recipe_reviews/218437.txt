OMG!! Absolutely delicious. Just made it today, my husband and I have already eaten a third of it. Picked the cherries this morning and decided I was going to make this. I used whipped cream but would love to have had the ice cream. Next time. I had 4 cups of cherries and that worked out just fine.  I don't know why this is called a "pudding" cake. It isn't like any pudding cake I have ever eaten.  Made it again today, but only used 1/2 c sugar for the cherries. Still pretty sweet. I'd cut back on the sugar,.

This cake reminds me of a cobbler. It is much easier to make than cherry pie, but it still gives you that great tangy sour cherry flavor. Will definitely make again.

This is the exact recipe that my family has been making for years and we all love it. We eat it warm with a little milk and a sprinkle of sugar and it is SO GOOD!!!

I halved the sugar in the batter and cherries and it was sweet enough for us, used melted butter for the oil, reduced baking powder to 2 tsps and omitted the salt. I found this too thin, next time I would double or bake in a 9x9 pan instead of a 9x13. Tasted good and was enjoyed with ice cream.

Really easy and yummy!  I substituted coconut oil for the veg oil, but otherwise followed recipe exactly as outlined.  I made it with fresh sour cherries and used a strong straw to push the pits out, which worked great.  This recipe would work great with other fruits/berries as well.  Will definitely make this again!

This was good and the cake was light. I halved the recipe and used an 8 x 8 pan, though still cooked it for the full 30 minutes.  I eyeballed the amount of cherries until the top was covered and I thought that worked well.  The cake wasn't what I think of when I hear "pudding cake", but good nonetheless.  Served with vanilla ice cream. Will make again.

This was really good.  It seemed to be lacking a little something to put it into the excellent category.  I'm sure whipped cream or ice cream would give it more umph, but I'm rating it on it's own.  I found it hard to spread in the pan, so I Pammed my spatula multiple times while spreading.

A friend gave me several pounds of frozen tart cherries and I was looking for a good recipe that wasn't cherry pie, cherry pie is too syrupy for me, but this recipe makes a a crazy good coffee cake. I tried it warm with ice cream on top but I liked it better the next day when the ingredients meld together. The cake part didn't harden, it stayed soft and moist. I didn't refrigerate it so it wouldn't dry up. Just covered it with plastic wrap. Next time I make it I want to try baking it with oatmeal crumb crisp or streusel topping for a yummy brunch cake.

Very bland, sticky on the bottom (uncooked dough in parts, with sides and top all browned, isn't the same as pudding imo), way way too sweet (and I used very tart cherries from my yard).  You're better off making pancakes and tossing cherries in the batter and it'll be tastier.

We were all disappointed with this dessert. Even served with cream/milk it was  heavy and bland.    Not a keeper.

I made this for a family lunch and everyone loved it.  There were eight adults and this cake was gone before they left!  I did get a small piece and agree it’s a keeper and is included in my favorites file.

Been struggling to use sour cherries and this is a tasty and very simple cake. My sour cherries were frozen so I strained them and used four cups. I used 3/4 cup sugar in cake batter and 1/2 cup sugar in cherries. Also used vanilla extract instead of almond. Cooked for about 4O minutes. Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was yummy.

Very close to Grandma’s cherry Kuchen. Use a can of sour/tart cherries. Reserve the juice and combine with 1/4 c sugar and 2-3 tbsp of corn starch to create sauce.  Cook sauce about 10-15 minutes over medium heat until it thickens. Cut and place cake portion on plate and Spoon sauce over cherry cake. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

We went to a U-Pick farm that had sour cherries and I was looking for something easy to make with my girls. This fit the bill and they loved it! We substituted vanilla for the almond extract due to a nut allergy and it still tasted great.

My husband pitted an entire bag of Bing cherries this afternoon because he wanted to make us a treat. I found this recipe, that seemed easy enough for him*, and told him what to do step-by-step. (*Not that he doesn't know how to bake -- he memorised my brownie recipe and makes some for me every month -- but he doesn't like using lots of ingredients.) He used reconstituted powdered milk, melted butter in place of the oil [thinking that would make up for the taste of the powdered milk], vanilla instead of almond extract [we don't have any], and baked it for exactly 30 minutes. After he accidentally broke a plate, cared for my subsequently cut feet, and sliced his own thumb while halving the cherry tomatoes for our dinner salad, we were *so* ready to eat this cake! We both loved it. Honestly, the only reason there is still some left is because we're too full to eat any more.

Our sour cherry tree just became ripe for the picking, so naturally we needed some new recipes for our abundant harvest. We searched AR and came across this one. Like one of the reviewers mentioned, we used closer to 4 cups of sour cherries and also used almond milk, as I am lactose intolerant. This recipe rocked the house! It is absolutely delicious and I didn't even have ice cream ;)

I had to double the milk in order to go from dough to batter. It turned out very gummy. The second time I made this I skipped the sugar in the cherries and halved the sugar in the batter as it was waaaaaay too sweet the first time around.  I also used whole wheat flour.  I also mixed the cherries into the batter because the first time, the cherries on top were the best part and the rest was *meh*.
