Made this for thanksgiving. Increased cornbread and decreased dry bread mix as I had cornbread to use up - would do this again next time. I also added a handful of cranberries which made it look beautiful. I also used more sausage links and less sausage meat as that is how I could buy them, again the links were a huge hit and people have requested more next year! I assembled the dry ingrediants the day before and just added the broth on the day. It made enough to stuff the turkey and have a large casserole dish to bake up. It was a huge hit and will now be on our families 'official' thanksgiving recipe list! Delicious

I followed this recipe exactly and it was tasty. However next time, I will use sausage with a little more punch like andouille to add some spice. I made this recipe the day before Thanksgiving (minus adding the chicken broth) and it turned out the same as those that were made on the same day. I used up both cans of chicken broth.

DELICIOUS!!! I added a couple of handfuls of Craisins and used more like 32 ozs of chicken broth, but this is the BEST stuffing recipe I have ever had. It's going into my permanent holiday recipe collection! :)

Honestly, THE BEST stuffing I have ever had, and it is such a hit, I have found my staple stuffing!! Thankyou so much for submitting this.
Even if you leave out the sausage its still fantastic.
I like to spice the apples first: boil apples in cranberry juice/cranberry-orange juice, reduce heat + simmer, add cinammon & nutmeg.

This is definitely the best stuffing I've ever had. It is very rich I would recommend taking out some of the sausage and bacon if you are making it with an already rich meal like thanksgiving.

This stuffing was wonderful!  I made it for Thanksgiving to the letter.  My family loved it.  Next time I will probably add dried cranberries, but just a little.  The apples give the stuffing a sweet, but not too sweet taste.  The breakfast sausage links adds just the right amount of texture.  Thank you sooo much!

Finally a stuffing recipes I can live with for life! Every year I search for the perfect Thanksgiving stuffing recipes, but haven't been satisfied until this one. The cornbread and sausage made it fabulous. All of the proportions of ingredients seemed just right. Thank you JakesMom311!

Great moist stuffing.  I didn't like the bacon in it, didn't like the smoky flavor it added.  Otherwise it was really good.

BEST STUFFING EVER! I made this for Thanksgiving and making it again for Christmas. The only thing I did different was follow others recommendations to use sausage with sage in it instead of adding the extra spice. Kids and adults loved it.

By far the best stuffing ever.  I made this for Christmas and everyone went crazy for it.  I followed the recipe exact.  I'll be making it again and again.  I didn't have a giant mixing bowl so used the pan from our roaster to mix it all.

This is now my favorite Thanksgiving dressing recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  It is time consuming to prepare, but well worth the effort.  It makes a boatload... much more than the stated 12 servings.  When I make this again (and I will definitely make this again), it will be in a bigger baking dish so I can fit it all.

This recipe is great.  I did not stuff the bird so I used twice the amount of liquid that the recipe called for.  I also did not have enough sage so will add more the next time.  Everyone loved it.  It made A LOT more than I expected it to.

I hosted my first Thanksgiving dinner this year and decided to make this stuffing recipe- I've never made stuffing before and normally am not a huge fan of stuffing. Everyone- including myself- just loved this stuffing and went back for seconds. I used the cubed bread stuffing mix and cornbread I made. I used my chopper and finely chopped canned mushrooms instead of leaving them sliced. I also ended up using about 2 1/2 cans of chicken broth and it was so moist. I will definately be making this again next year!

This is AMAZING my husband hates stuffing of any kind so after much failure Thanksgiving after Thanksgiving...I finally did it he LOVES it! I would take the advise of other users and add cranberries it really makes it flavorfull and does not add that tarty cranberry taste. I will use this for years and years to come... Thank you

The recipe as presented made way too much.  I will cut back on everything except for the broth next time.  I split the broth between what went into the pan and what I froze and it was way too dry.

Good, but not amazing.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I did omit the sausage links because I thought it would have plenty with just the crumbled sausage (and the sausage content seemed just right that way).  I also added a handful of craisins, for color and tartness.  And I used 2 boxes of cornbread stuffing mix rather than making cornbread separately.  But otherwise I followed the recipe.  And it was good.  I can't say there was anything wrong with it.  But no one made any comments about it or gave any compliments.  Personally, I thought the bacon threw off the flavor a bit.  It's hard to imagine bacon not making anything better, but stuffing has its own flavor and the bacon sort of confused my pallate a little.  I may try this another time, but I will omit the bacon and add less salt.

Have been making this for at least 4-5 years now and my coworkers and family won’t let me stop when thanksgiving rolls around! I don’t do the bacon or the sausage links. The ground sausage is enough for us and I usually use the sage flavored sausage. It’s also easy to set aside a portion and make some vegetarian servings by using no sausage and veggie stock instead!

Everybody loves this stuffing and demands that I make it every year. I like it, but I don't think it's the best. It's a little, dry, I add more stock than called for to make it a little stickier. This stuffing will soak up a lot. I've also added walnuts and dried cranberries  or diced dried cherries, also, which I like. Oh, and I think I mix in up to two sticks of melted butter, also. This makes a HUGE amount of stuffing.

Made this and LOVED it!  The only change I made was  I put more cut up apples in after it was done baking because I just love green apples and their crunch! :)

First of all I'm so glad I cut this recipe in half which was plenty to fill a 9x13 baking dish.  Secondly I really (and I mean really) wanted to love this.  I made it once for our thanksgiving and found it needed more flavor, more liquid, and just more wow.  The next time I added mushrooms,  dried cranberries, more apples along with a whole collection of savory holiday spices sure to amp up the cozy, warm holiday yum factor, but to my disappointment it was not enough to earn a place in my recipe file.

This recipe is delicious!  It was very different than what our family is used to but everyone loved it. I will say that I needed at least double the stock listed but other than that everything was perfect!

It was great! I didn't bake it and it was wonderful. I did make it a day before being served so it did firm up. I would recommend keeping the apple pieces really small. I used precooked sausage (beef Polska Kielbasa and something that said mild sausage) because I didn't want to deal with cutting up uncooked sausage

This is an outstanding stuffing recipe.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  Will make again next year.

i made it and everyone loved it!! maybe because it was very unexpected that I bring something for thanksgiving, but either way it was a hit! I did make a few slight changes; I used cornbread stuffing, and didn't include the mushrooms or sage. I did however use crumbled sausage with sage flavoring. it made way more than a 9x13 pan though, I had a 9x13 and a 7x11.

I have made this recipe for the past few years and we all love it. I agree that this recipe makes a lot more than anticipated but I have a huge group coming this year and don't mind the extra!

I made this twice. First time I accidentally grabbed Maple flavored links. Lets just say it did not work. The second time i made sure I had everything exactly. I cannot believe the difference. The entire pan was eaten in one sitting. My very picky wife could not keep her fork away. This Thanksgiving I am in charge of the stuffing ;)

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving. I didn't use mushrooms or parsley, but otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. My husband said it was the best he ever tasted, and his family really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this dish again.

AMAZING! I now make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  EVERYONE in the family expects and loves it.  I personally omit the mushrooms and use sage flavored sausage. Exceptional recipe!!!!
