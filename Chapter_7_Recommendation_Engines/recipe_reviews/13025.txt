This was delicious!  Instead of the ground beef, I kicked it up a notch and used ground spicy Italian sausage, which I added garlic to while cooking. I added a chopped green bell pepper, used spicy V-8 instead of the tomato sauce and since I hate the flavor of Tobasco sauce, I used Sriracha chili sauce in it's place.  Threw everything into the crock pot and cooked on high for 5 hours.  Delicious!

I have made this many times. It is great as directed, but my favorite thing to do is add a diced up zucchini and a handfull of barley, some frozen corn and a can of stewed tomatoes. YUM!!

Very yummy! I substituted extra lean ground pork for the ground beef since I just bought it on sale and served the soup with shredded mozzarella, which the kids loved, and sriracha hot sauce on the side for the parents who like it extra hot!

I tried this for my husband and myself - and my husband is VERY picky. We like things really spicy, so I doubled the Tabasco.  Oh my goodness, this was wonderful! And the best part is that my husband really liked it, too, so now we have a new recipe to add to the slim selection of "acceptable meals", haha.  He even took the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It was really easy (I'm not the most experienced cook) and it tastes sooo good!

I did quite a bit to this recipe, so I don't even know that it qualifies as the soup it was meant to be, but here goes...  I did everything as the recipe described, then when there was about 20 minutes of cook time left,I mashed the potatoes just a little bit and I added one can of drained black beans, about 1 tsp of garlic powder and about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro.  It thickened up beautifully and then we sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on the top of each bowl.  Served with warm flour tortillas. YUM!

I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef but it still was very lovely. The soup was wonderfully filling. I was worried that it might be a bit too hot for me at first but after the first bite I knew it was just right. This recipe was definately a winner!

This was ok.  My teens didn't like it (one of them is a spicy fanatic), and neither did my husband.  Won't be making it again.

Great soup, I did add two dried habanero peppers instead of hot sauce since I like things spicy.  And cut back drastically on the salt due to diet restrictions.  Used none instead of 2 tsp.

Was not to bad at all.  I changed the  cups of water to Beef Stock and added in some Garlic.  I also roasted some Tomatoes and put them in the blender to replace two of the cans of sauce and therefore cutting down on the sodium.  Helps for the Kidney patients out there like me.

I used sausage instead of ground beef, 1 Tablespoon of dried minced onion and I made this in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  My roommate thought that it could use a little less ground pepper but I thought it was just right.

This was delish, only changes I made were I  added 2 cans of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste to make it thicker.  Did 1 tsp of Frank's Hot Sauce and also added crushed red pepper.  3 chopped cloves of fresh garlic and topped with Colby Jack Cheese. Served with crusty dinner rolls.

This was ok, not even 4 star worthy.  I even seasoned the ground beef while it was browning and used manwhich sauce instead of tomato sauce for more flavor.  However, it was just ok to help me get rid of some things i needed to cook.

We love it!  Its a great cool weather/winter treat and I always serve it with fresh/homemade bread. Most of my family/guests prefer it a little thick and add grated cheddar cheese and/or a dollop of sour cream into their bowl. 


I adjust the spiciness depending on who's to eat it and sometimes if for folks on bland diets, I'll toss in a bag of frozen veggies.  Also, instead of tomato sauce (24oz) I use tomato paste and water to an approx 24oz mix. The tomato sauce doesn't sustain as much flavor as the paste and its also saltier.

This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever tried.  A very hearty, cold-weather dish.  Leftovers reheat well too.  Easy to make.  We enjoy it made with meatballs (either homemade or ready-made).  White Rose or red potatoes stay firmer.  If I don't have an onion on hand, I use a bit of onion powder.

I was dubious about making this.  I made it and Reubens (Reubens for 4 and soup for 2).  I left out the hot sauce for the kids.  5 outa 6 people loved it!  My son said it was bland (told him to add the hot sauce).  My husband kept saying it was "the best beef stew he had ever had!"  I kept telling him it was 'potatoe soup', but he just said it was "better than Dinty Moore"  (which is high praise from him.  LOL)  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making it many more times.

Excellent.  You can have toppings for this at the table:  cilantro, cheddar cheese, bacon bits, sour cream, sliced green onions, croutons... and, of course, a bottle of tobasco!

Really good soup.  I realized midway thru preparation that I only had 1 8 oz can tomato sauce, so substituted a can of diced tomatoes, 2 cups of V-8 juice and 1 can tomato soup.  It still came out good.  I also used a hand blender to blend the soup to more of a smooth consistency.

YUMMY!!! So we forgot to go shopping and I looked at what we had on hand so I get on the internet typed in turkey meat and potatoes and low and behold I come upon this recipe!!! I substituted ground beef for ground turkey and the hot pepper sauce for 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper then I added 1 cup sliced yellow zucchini, 1 large garlic clove minced, 1 red bell pepper, and 1 cup frozen corn. We all loved it including my 5 year old son!!! So you get a total of 8 thumbs up from this household!

Yummy!  Using what was on hand, I used 2 cups of tomato puree & 1 cup of canned stewed tomatoes (with celery, green peppers & onions) instead of the tomato sauce.  I accidently chopped 1/2 of the potatoes instead of cubing them all, which I was pleased with since it helped thicken the soup up.  I also added a little more sea salt before it was done cooking.  My fella & I are from the south so when he decided to add some brown sugar to his serving, I tried it too & loved it.

We loved this recipe but did make a few changes: used ground turkey, added garlic and fresh jalepeno, and substituted a can of stewed tomatoes for the tomato sauce. We'll be making it again - thanks!

My family liked this recipe. I made it last night, and it was good. To me it was pretty bland though. It definately needed more flavor! I added more hot sauce to my bowl, and that helped a lot. I also added more spices than were in the recipe, to the whole pot. I added some lemon pepper (i put that in alomst everything) also some chilli powder. It was pretty good. I used red onion to give it more color. I also prefer to cook with red onion. Not too bad, but will spice it up even more if I try it again! Thanks

I really needed to go to the store, but was waiting on a check. Luckily, I had ground beef and potatoes. I was great! Quick and easy. Topped with shredded cheese. Thanks for this!

I was in the mood for something cheesy so I added 16 oz. Velveeta Light - this is why I give it 5 stars.  It was Cheesy Spicy Soup!  I love finding soup recipes that use ingredients that I wouldn't normally use... tomato sauce and tobasco.  Yummy!!

Braving hurricane Sandy put us in the mood for soup, and we like spicy!  Very easy to prepare with so few ingredients.  We added cabbage and swapped the hot sauce with two habanero peppers and it was perfect.  Flavored liked stuffed cabbage, but thicker red sauce due to the potatoes.  I may add a touch of nutmeg next time.

I had to change some ingredients, based on what I had available.  I used one pound of pre-cooked meatballs, sliced in half, instead of the ground beef.  Also, I only had one can of tomato sauce, so I made up the remaining 16oz with a combination of spicy V8 and a bit of beef broth (and I cut down on the hot sauce).  VERY spicy, but we both liked it.  I thought the leftovers tasted even better.

I used onion powder because I didn't have onions and it turned out great!! It was also really good topped with shredded cheddar cheese. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have been making this soup for years. This is the very same recipe I use. Mine came from the Collector's Edition of "Taste of Home" Magazine. You even used the same picture!

Delicious! I didn't know what I'd get when I made it, thought it might be a little bland, but it turned out really well. We put shredded cheese on top of each bowl. Kind of like chili with potatoes instead of beans.

This was very good, and also very easy to make.  I was out of onions, so I used onion soup mix, and it turned out really nicely.

I have made this several times. It is so easy to prepare after a long day at work, and makes a great meal with a side of garlic toast and a salad. It's a favorite at our house.

I have made this soup for years - my family loves it.  I swap out the three cans of tomato sauce for 24 ounces (3 cans) of mild salsa and omit the hot sauce.    Love the flavor it gives the soup

I Decided to use Spicy V-8 (48oz) in place of the tomato sauce and water and a 1/4 cup of diced jalepenos. Absolutely loved this!

This is my second time making home made soup and it came out great! It was so delicious I added corn and instead of tobasco sauce I used Louisiana hot sauce because it's my favorite and it came out amazing my husband loved it (:

I've been making this recipe for years. I've tried it with beef, ground turkey, chicken, and mango-jalapeno meatballs. Everytime its awesome. I've also added diced tomatoes for a chunkier soup and I add Caribbean hot sauce for the best heat and flavor. It's great for the crock pot too on days when its really cold. Just add crusty bread - and its a meal! A real favorite in my house.

This soup is really good.  I've made it with ground turkey and spicy Italian turkey sausage and both ways are great.

Sriracha gives it a good flavor.

This recipe was easy to make.  We enjoyed it very much.  I was a little spicy and great flavor.  The only substitute was that I two teaspoons of medium salsa versus the Tabasco and it was absolutely delicious.  Yummy!!

I love this recipe.  I like it a little spicier though so I add canned diced jalapeños which compliments the already great recipe.  I also serve it in bread bowls with a little dollop of sour cream on top.  Made it many times for different people and everyone raves about it.
