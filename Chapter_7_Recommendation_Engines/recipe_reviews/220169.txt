Wouldn't make this again.  The balsamic vinegar was extremely overpowering.  I like the idea, but if I were to do something similar I would probably use more sugar and make a balsamic reduction rather than the way it is prepared in this recipe.  The cake, however, was WONDERFUL on the grill.  Did not take anywhere near 3 minutes on each side on a charcoal grill, though, so keep a close eye on it.

Awesome! In response to the other review that the balsamic was too overpowering, I used 5 tbs sugar and 3tbs balsamic and the result was delightful! Toasting the cake is the only way I will have it again. Thanks for a great idea!
