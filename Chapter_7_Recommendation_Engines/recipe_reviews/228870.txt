I think that the core of the recipe is really good. I just made the recipe and it came out pretty tasty. I didn't have any apples on hand and I hate onions so I left them out. Used apple juice instead of cider. I really liked how the dish turned out. Chicken was really tender. Juice and cranberries added just enough sweetness. Bacon did better crisping up under the broiler so I did broil it for about 3 minutes. Next time I might try using fresh or frozen cranberries and see if there is a major difference. I must say that you must like mustard for this dish. If you have a child or guest who doesn't like mustard then they probably wouldn't like it. I'm thinking about trying this recipe with pork chops or pork tenderloin.

Excellent! with some changes of course. Following the advice of other reviewers I substituted "Motts for Totts" apple juice for the cider. I used twice the apple sauce (1 cup total) but mixed in a little cinnamon instead of mustard. After adding the cranberries I poured the remaining apple juice over the bake but prior to pouring stirred about 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar into the juice. I omitted the bacon. Instead I baked the dish for 40 min removed the foil baked for 10 min uncovered then added 8 oz of brie cheese for the remaining 10 min uncovered. Yum!

Chicken turned out very favorful. Apples were too mushy though. There is no need to soak the cranberries for hours - I started soaking them as I cooked the bacon and had it all in the oven 20 minutes later and they were totally juicy when they came out.

We loved this. I made a few substitutions from my pantry. Orange juice instead of apple cider was great. I also substituted honey mustard for the stone ground. I also added about a table spoon of brown sugar to the apple sauce.

This recipe is really really good. I did make one big change and that's using a cinnamon pear balsamic vinegar instead of mustard. That made it amazing--my kids and I ate it right up. I also used boneless skinless thighs with the one chicken breast I had defrosted and they cooked down to falling apart. Being out of applesauce I just put some fresh apples in my Ninja and blended them up with the vinegar and I think it was more than the half cup of applesauce but it ended up being amazing. One other change I recommend: skip the bacon. You really don't need it and it just doesn't add enough flavor to justify the cost.

This recipe was pretty good. It had a good balance of sweet and savory. I added sweet potato and apple to the dish but only half of one onion. Two onions seemed like a lot of onion. I did not use cranberries because I cannot get them where I live. So instead of adding juice to the dish I added extra home made apple sauce. It was pretty good. I would make it again.

The chicken was really tender but we thought there was too much mustard. The apples and bacon were both soggy too. Definitely wouldn't make again.

Chicken was good and moist but the bacon was not crisp at all and the apples and cranberries tasted overwhelming of vinegar. I won't make it again.
