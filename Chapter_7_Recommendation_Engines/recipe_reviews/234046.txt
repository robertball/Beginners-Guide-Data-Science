Absolutely awesome, amazing and magnifique!  Had a potluck with 12 people and they all requested the recipe.  I hate chopping so I did pulse the mushrooms and onion in a small food processor.  I think this would also be good on those small cocktail bread slices baked and served more open face.  As you might guess I hate putzing since the recipe sounded good I figured a way to minimize the putzing and still have a great recipe.

The instructions really don't say how to place the bread rounds on the baking sheet...seam side down or cut side down?  I started out cut side down and then saw that they were oozing out a bit and browning too much on the end.  I pulled them out of the oven and continued to bake seam side down, and that's what I would do in the future for a nicer presentation.  The mushroom flavor is intense and fantastic.  The only negative comment I have is that they are a little on the dry side and could benefit from a flavorful dipping sauce...thinking roquefort/blue cheese or maybe even honey mustard.  It didn't say to cut the crusts off the bread, but I did (just looks better) and I used fresh mushrooms (not canned) pulsed in my mini chopper.  I'll make these again and, hopefully, I'll be able to find a complementary dipping sauce.  They are great finger food, definitely 1-bite, and taste really good!

Easy, delicious appetizer. I halved the amount so I thickened the mushroom mixture with grated Parmesan cheese instead of corn starch and added a bit of thyme. Will make again!
