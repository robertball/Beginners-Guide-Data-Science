These were delicious! I used regular vanilla yogurt instead of greek yogurt
After baking in the oven, I mixed them up in a pot with warmed up teriyaki sauce instead of bar bq sauce 
They were fantastic

We really worried about blandness with this recipe but the barbecue sauce took care of that!   It was a little sweet but I think this depends as much on our brand of marmalade as anything else. All in all it was very quick, very easy, and we'll make it again. Thank you for a different and interesting recipe.
