Delightful!  I prepared this at a BBQ last weekend and it was a big hit.  The avocados and apples go surprisingly well together and the seeds add a nice touch also.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a nice refreshing treat on a hot day! The apples and avocado do go well together. I used crushed almonds instead of sunflower seeds and also threw in some dried cranberries just because they were sitting on the counter in front of me as I was making it. Very tasty!

I thought this dish was incredibly bland. I wouldn't serve it as a side dish or dessert.

This is wonderful!  So easy and healthy!  I'm not even a huge fan of avocados, and I loved this!  I did substitute toasted walnuts for the sunflower seeds.

Delicious and a quick fix.  I didn't have enough raisins so I ended up with a bit of golden raisins and a bit of dried cherries...it was great!

Very cool and refreshing salad! This is a must try recipe if you want to try something different with avocado. I'm not a big avocado fan, but this was tasty!

overall, a very good salad that I will most likely make again.  I love avocado, but there was almost too much (or maybe I was just using larger avocados) - maybe some jicama would be nice to lessen the concentration of avocado. . .

I've started to experiment with some new foods to cook with. This was my second recipe to use avocados. I appreciate how quickly this recipe came together, using ingredients I always have on hand. I only used one avocado this time - as the rest of the family isn't sold on it yet :) I used walnut pieces instead of sunflower seeds (personal preference). I liked the creamy texture the avocado gave the salad, and the tastes and textures worked really nicely together. Thanks for sharing!

It sounds like a strange salad, but it is surprisingly good!  I whipped this up really quick as a midnight snack.  If I was taking this to a potluck, I would double or triple the recipe.... as it was, it was a nice snack for three people. Thanks for the recipe, Gurtess!

As an avocado lover, I'd say this salad was as good as having a perfect avocado on its own.   The flavors harmonized while the textures varied.  Sunflower seeds are a must as the salt keeps the combination from being too sweet.  Suitable for a summer lunch or as a side.

Didn't care for the raisins, but very much liked the rest of it.  May try with yogurt covered raisins next time.

Very good salad, but I would reduce the honey by half in the future...very sweet as is.  You'll wonder why you never had apples and avocados together before.

Really liked this. I added a mango to the mix. Never had an avocado and was a litte aprehensive about it but this was nice. I think the avocado was too ripe...very mushy. That is why I did not add a photo! :) Too ugly. Hubby didn't really like the avocado by itself but liked the salad.

A great salad!  I make this at work for lunch. Several coworkers have put this recipe into their lunch rotation. I use one avocado to one apple. I use jumbo raisins not soaked, and reduce the honey to 1 tablespoon. It's a perfect lunch for two.
