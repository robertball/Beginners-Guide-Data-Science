This is delicious!!!!!  I used everything out of the garden and it was such a better recipe than the others I have tried.  I wasn't quite sure about 1/4 cup of garlic powder????  I used a teaspoon and it was plenty.  Just perfect proportions and very, very, easy.  Thanks

Being in a state where red and green chili is readily available it's hard to find a salsa recipe worthy. This was bland. Not something I would recommend to anyone.

I used fresh garlic, roasted tomatillos, chiles (along with the garlic) and sub'd fresh lime juice in place of the vinegar. I think 1/2 cup olive oil would be an overkill for this salsa. I just used spray garlic olive oil ontop of everything before roasting. Roast until just slightly charred, then toss everything into the blender with the fresh cilantro. If you like a chunkier salsa, just use the pulse setting instead of pureeing. I also added a splash of honey to take away some of the bitterness of the tomatillos.

So yummy!  I added a little lemon to it, and also simmered it a little longer, close to 45 minutes, perfect!

Didn't have green tomatoes so I only used tomatillos and the salsa still turned out terrific.

I have a question about this salsa- mine comes out more viscous, gel-like, and the taste is nothing like green salsa, i have to add a bunch of water and salt to make it more runny.

also lemon is usually overbearing. I've tried all sorts of things and its usually not bad after customization, but never out of the gate.  Im trying something new with adding 1 habanero, an onion and we will see how it goes

This green salsa turned out good and zingy. I used only tomatillos, reduced the garlic as mentioned in other review as well as adding lemon juice that was suggested. I roasted my own jalapenos so it has some heat. I may need to reduce the olive oil. Thanks for the great recipe- it was my first try!

So easy and delicious!! I'd never worked with tomatillos before, so I had no idea what to expect. The salsa turned out slightly sweet and tangy. 

I added garlic cloves when cooking instead of garlic power, and I left out the oil. I also added a one green pepper and added the shallots and cilantro to the food processor raw (instead of cooking with the salsa). I think it gave it a bit more bite and a fresher taste.

Overall, great recipe --- I will definitely make it again!

I served it with rice and corn, but honestly, it's so versatile and would go on anything.

This was pretty good, but didn't have the complex flavors I've had in good salsa verde.  I would definitely skip the vinegar if I made it again; the tomatillos and green tomatoes already have plenty of acidity, the vinegar just makes it taste vinegary.
