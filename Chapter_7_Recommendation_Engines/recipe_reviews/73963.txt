I looked up this recipe solely for the dressing.  This makes a lovely red vinegar dressing.  I use it with cold cooked pasta and a meat such as crabmeat or tuna.  Very tastey.

I made this according to recipe, only using all red pepper because none of us care for green bell pepper. I agree with other reviewers that the dressing really should be doubled if you plan on chilling it all day, which I did not. Just a couple hours was all I had today. I think if I make this again, I'd double the spices (salt excluded) and I'd add chopped tomatoes. As is, it's a very tasty salad!

Plan ahead to make this one. Note the 8 hour chilling. Good for potlucks, it makes a large bowl of salad. Lots of ingredients, some of which you won’t have on hand. I bought some exclusively for this. Gets pricey too if you don’t have some of the stuff. I did have quite a few things. Very colorful with the meat, cheese and veggies, so don’t substitute or omit and ruin that. Cut the cost a little by using a couple of ounces less of sliced pepperoni, provolone and olives. Instead of chunks, cut pizza size pepperoni slices into quarters and provolone slices first into strips, then cut again into ½ inch squares. Only a 2 ¼ oz. can of sliced olives, drained, is needed. I used only ½ a red onion. There was still plenty of everything to distribute thru the salad. Will make again.

Sorry everyone but I only made the dressing in this recipe and it was good! I did add about a teaspoon of honey to get rid of the bitter taste!! Great dressing!

I also only made the dressing in this recipe, but it is wonderful. Good balance of oil, vingegar, and spices. I only substituted ground dried mustard instead of the ground mustard seed b/c that's what I had in the spice cabinet. When I make pasta salad, I just use up whatever I happen to have in the fridge!

Pretty good pasta salad. I did change a couple things. I omitted the cucumbers and black olives (per our preference) I also chopped the vegetables & onion instead of slicing (more evenly distributes the flavors) and I used roasted red peppers (chopped), for more flavor and used balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine. Stable base recipe, that is easy to play with to suite tastes.

This is a very beautiful, very delicious salad!  I didn't change a thing.  It was a HIT at the baby shower I threw.  Prep time was much longer than what it said because of all the chopping.  Save some of the dressing for later just in case the salad dries out.

I followed the recipe with the exception of two items I didn't have; the cucumber and mustard seed.  I used some mustard powder instead.  I thought the dressing was very good.  One recommendation I have is to make this the day before you plan on serving and to double the dressing.  The pasta did absorb the taste better by the next day but it was dry.  I also would add more salt & pepper.  It tasted a little bland.  I added halved cherry tomatoes to mine.  It was very good.  Just need a little tweaking.

The best pasta salad I have ever had.  The dressing, I think, is what makes this dish so good!  I used turkey and ham instead of pepperoni and mozzerella instead of provolone.  It was still very very good.  I took it to a potluck and I came home with an empty bowl.  I will make this again and again.

The dressing is awesome!  I didn't have basil so I used Italian seasoning in place of both basil and oregano.   I don't like the meatiness of this salad recipe so I added my own favorite veggies - green pepper, green onion, green olives, sun-dried tomatoes, savoy cabbage, parsley and carrots.

Very colorful and tasty salad.  Prep time took a little longer than 20 minutes - lots of chopping.  After the salad had marinated overnight, it seemed a little dry so I mixed up another small batch of dressing and stirred in to moisten it up a bit. Would definately make again.

My tweaks are to replace the dried basil AND the fresh parsley with fresh basil.  I replace the cucumber with halved grape tomatoes.  I use slightly less garlic, and I omit the pepperoni so that vegetarians can it it too.  I followed the advice of another reviewer to save some of the dressing until just before I serve it, to re-moisten the salad, which works great!  And finally, I have tried this recipe with both regular provolone and expensive sharp provolone from the deli counter.  I definitely prefer the sharp provolone if I can find it.  It really adds a kick to the recipe.

I only made the dressing portion. I threw together whatever I had in the fridge (which included steamed broccoli - nice touch!) and tossed it.  I might have done with a little more salt since we didn't have any sausage in our mix, but overall, very nice, light taste.

Great recipe!  I omitted parsley because I had none on hand and it wasn't missed.  I did dress the salad about 24 hrs before serving.  That may have resulted in the pasta tasting a little bland.

This recipe is wonderful! The dressing is so good and has a great flavor.  It has a zesty flavor, kind of tangy vinegary taste but not over powering and so very good.  It is a nice change from the same old italian dressing I use all the time.  I definelity recommend this.  I used medium shell noodles along with all the other ingrediants it calls for and it was a colorful and appetizing salad.

The dressing for this pasta salad is delicious!  I would probably double it next time since a lot of it was absorbed into the pasta overnight.

The dressing was amazing! I have to admit as well, that I was looking for a dressing recipe.  Nonetheless, I omitted the meat and merely used quartered grape tomatoes, halves of both yellow and red peppers, red onion to taste, a small cucumber, parmesan cheese (finely grated), sea salt / freshly ground pepper and whole wheat rotini - all this combined with the dressing was amazing!

This has been a crowd favorite everytime I've made it. I tend to double the recipe and make a little extra dressing to put on just before I serve it because the salad really soaks it up.

This is a really good salad. It is a complete meal with bread sticks. It makes a large quanity---but was, if anything, better on the second and third day! None was wasted, and I am not a big pasta salad person. I followed the recipe exactly and plan to make it again and use a combination of chicken and pepperoni. After making the dressing--which was very good---I did go back and make another batch of dressing---I thought it needed more.

Love this recipe! It is very versatile, but I loved the dressing as much as the others. I used dijon instead of ground mustard and summer sausage instead of pepperoni- yum!

i found this recipe by searchin for a homemade salad dressing recipe, and it was delicious. my only criticism of the salad recipe is that i'm pretty sure 8 oz boxes of rotini are not standard, and instead they're more commonly in 12 oz boxes. the dressing recipe didn't make enough for 12 oz of pasta so i doubled it, and it turned out well. i also used diced mozzarella instead of provolone and i adjusted some other ingredients to my own taste, but in general this is a great recipe, thanks!

This dressing is always a HUGE hit when I take this out. I just throw the veggies and cheese in with some cooked whole wheat pasta and then use the dressing.

I don't think there was enough dressing for my preference, but the flavors were good.  I didn't let it sit 8 hrs, but it was dry even after 3 hours in the fridge!  I would double the dressing if I made it again.

I used this recipe because I wanted to make a pasta salad with a homemade Italian dressing instead of bottled.  I followed the directions exactly and loved the dressing once it had time to meld overnight.  I left out the pepperoni since I was making this pasta salad meatless.  Thanks for a wonderful pasta salad with an excellent dressing recipe!

This is a 5-star salad in this house, and it has a fabulous dressing! I used all the ingredients, except the black olives, as we are not fans of those.  You really do need to let this cure for the 8 hours to achieve the maximum flavor.  This makes a large amount, which is what I wanted for lunches during the week.  I liked how the the flavors and the texture held up nicely for the 4 days it lasted.  Definitely will be a repeat in our house. Thanks, BONNIES for sharing your recipe.

My pasta salad was close but not exactly like this. No meat or olives, and I had some spinach corn and grape tomatoes thrown in. However, I used this dressing - pretty tasty! I found that a dash of lemon juice helps lift it up some.

This dressing was perfect! My salad had salami and feta instead of provolone and pepperoni. I also threw in some fresh basil and real Kalamata olives. Canned olives are a no-no in this house.

Best pasta salad I've ever made! I used the hint by another reviewer to save a little of the dressing to toss on just before serving.  Also, I did not have a cucumber, so used what I had which was a small zucchini sliced and cut into quarters, tasted great!

Yum, yum, YUM!! Made this as a side dish for my homemade pizza (which is pretty darned good!) and everybody ate more of the salad than they did my pizza!! Made the dressing first so it could blend flavors a bit, using just a touch of sugar to mellow it out a bit (maybe 1/2 teaspoon), used mini bowties for the pasta and the only real change I made was to nix the bell pepper and use an anaheim as I like the milder flavor better. Seriously, it is the BEST pasta salad I've had. Major epiphany for me was to just go the the deli section of the supermarket and ask for a small slab of the meat and cheese instead of buying a whole sausage. Came to a little over a dollar a piece for all three. Will definitely do that again, too!!

Omitted the parsley (didn't have any) and olives (my fiance doesn't like them) and added some grape tomatoes, halved, that I needed to use.  I also accidentally added marjoram to the dressing instead of oregano, but after realizing what I'd done, also added the oregano.  We ate this as a main dish over baby lettuces.

Very good! Only put in half of the mayo called for, only because I wanted to lower the calories and taste the freshness of the veggies more. Thought all of the various elements of this dish went well with each other. Will be sharing with others! Thanks.

This Is a really great recipe. I did make a few changes to suit my tastes. I used hard salami instead of the pepperoni. I did omit the cucumbers this time will will use them next time. I also tried it with sm shell pasta. The dressing is awsome!! This is a recipe that will be used for all gathering from now on.

Great dressing for any pasta but I used whole wheat penne for mine.  I used 1/2 c of red wine vinegar and about 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese.  To make a quick lunch I warmed up a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and a roma tomato and kept the salad vegetarian. I didn't have mustard seed so used ground mustard instead.  A little more salt was needed for my taste.  Again, very good and I will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe just for the sauce (like a few other readers) to add to a pasta salad mix that had things we had on hand. It was a great addition to spruce it up with a little bit of kick. I made to modifications; 1) I used Balsamic Vinegar instead of Red Wine and 2) used a bit of Dijon Mustard instead of mustard seed to add that extra kick. The result was very tasty! Make sure you add the vinegar in stages and test as you go to make sure it doesn't become too strong for your liking.

I have made this several times this  summer for outdoor parties, always with great success. I knew it was  a winner when my [very picky] brother-in-law requested that I make it for a dinner he was having to introduce his girlfriend's parents to his parents.
I do leave out the onions, but only because my husband doesn't like them. Other than that, I follow this recipe exactly as is.  
This pasta salad is great - definitely a winner.

This was tasty, but I only used 1/4 of red onion since a whole one would seem overpowering in only 8 oz. of pasta.  Also used roasted red pepper instead of fresh, omitted the cucumber and added halved grape tomatoes. An important point is to make additional dressing.  It gets dry when marinating for 8 hours.  Added extra dressing at serving time, and it was moist and delicious.

The dressing was bland to me, tasted like just plain vinegar and oil and my husband didn't like it at all.  So I added 1/3 cup of sugar with a tablespoon of mustard and that improved the flavor.  It is a very pretty salad and I will make again but will use a different dressing.

I substituted sweet sopressata for the pepperoni, and added 2 Tbsp. white sugar to the dressing.  Magnifico!

Made this tonight.   It was a big hit with the family!   The only changes I made were that I added sugar to the dressing, about 1tsp.   It was just too tart for my kids the way it was.   That could be because I didn't have mustard seed so I used a 1/2 tsp of mustard.   Any way it was really good and it was really different than my usual pasta salad

Everyone liked this recipe. Changed a few veggie ingredients to what I had on hand, but this recipe is great to be able to make changes to particular tastes. I do think I'll double the dressing next time...but the dressing had great flavor!

I forgot to add the provolone!  I even had it in the fridge, but it was good anyway.  I also added marinated mushrooms... just because I like them.  No one noticed it was missing the cheese.

This is a great summer recipe!  I followed it exactly except that I used chorizo instead of pepperoni.  I also added the zest and juice of one lemon.

This is a most awesome pasta salad!!  I made a few changes, but all in all, followed it pretty close.  I did use actual pepperoni slices and just qtrd them.  I also used all fresh herbs - as I have them in my garden.  I probably used WAY more than the equiv. would have been, but we love herbs.  One last thing was the olives.  I used kalamata olives because we love them! :)

Just made it.  I didn't have any pepperoni so I used a very good hard salami.  I am allergic to provolone cheese so I left it out as well.  OMG!!  Hasn't even refrigerated yet, and talk about good. WOW.  I'll be making this again for sure.

This is the best pasta salad ever. I made few changes like calamata olives, feta and mozzarella cheeses, added sliced grape tomatos, left out the pepperoni added honey to the dressing as suggested by another. Oh man was it good!

I only used the dressing and it was really good. I did add about 3 or 4 teaspoons of honey, and about 2 or 3 teaspoons of white sugar, it got the bitter taste out. I put it over a pasta salad that had carrots, cucumbers, and celery in it. It was great. I will make this again.

Pretty wonderful!  I used mozzarella (fresh) instead of provolone as a personal choice but I left everything else the same.  I felt like this was missing something.  I tried adding more salt and garlic powder but that wasn't it.  It needs something but other than that, pretty good.  Unfortunately, I took it to the party and came home with a ton so I'll have plenty of time to figure it out.  Good or bad thing?  I'm not sure yet.

This salad is a lot of work...but it is well worth it. I have taken this to many parties/BBQ's and always get compliments on it!! I use turkey pepperoni and mozzerella cheese to cut down on the fat and caloires. This salad is a meal in and of itself!

Skipped the pepperoni, chopped the cucumbers and added tomatoes.  Used all fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried.  This was very pretty and very tasty!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit every one loved it.  Save some of the dressing and add it just before you serve the salad or it can be a little dry.  Otherwise I love it.

I made this as is, and it turned out perfect! The sit time with the dressing on the pasta was vital to soaking up all of the vinegar flavor. It was a huge hit at the potluck party!

This was an amazing and light pasta salad. The dressing is to die for it is so good!! The only change I made was I didn't use cucumbers and added garbanzo beans. I also doubled the dressing to have some of needed later. I will definitely be making this again!!

So good with homemade dressing!  I don't like cucumbers so left those out. I added green salad olives for one half olives.

I didn’t have all the veggies; just had green pepper, onion and garlic. Used sliced pepperoni (cut in half) and cheddar cheese.
But the dressing was good (the parm cheese definitely completes the flavor!)
I would absolutely make this again!

I serve the meat and cheese on the side so this dish is vegan and vegetarian if needed. I also replace the green peppers with other, ripe, colors.

Gotta confess that I was just after the dressing part of this. After all, I know I am not the  only one who usually just looks for pasta salad recipes for ideas and to make sure I am not forgetting some cool ingredient. 
Anyway, I was never a big fan of pasta salads until a year ago when I got one as a side at Coco's Italian Restaurant in Nashville. Their pasta side salad was so exquisitely delicious that I had to figure out what was going on. It was obvious that it had NOT been marinaded in the dressing as is the usual habit, but just what kind of dressing WAS it? The waiter assured me that it was their own recipe of sun-dried tomato vinaigrette and that I could purchase some at the deli counter of the attached store. Did I neglect to mention that the attached store is replete with interesting Italian kitsch and ingredients? And that they do multiple tours of Italy every year in search of more cool stuff? Yes, you can go along, too. Needless to say, I brought home some of the dressing and then tried several commercial varieties when that ran out, since it is an 8-hour drive to Nashville. So for Thanksgiving this year we were cooking home-made everything  (with help from AllRecipes.com of course!) and I went in search of a dressing recipe. This one sounded promising, despite a glaring absence of dried tomatoes, so I ran off to Eurofresh and grabbed some dried tomatoes and fresh basil leaves and minced them up. I made the dressing a day before Thanksgiving so it could blend a

This was good. I docked it a star because the red wine vinegar was a bit more pungent than I like.
I also made the mistake (my mistake) of using shredded rather than grated cheese. The cheese never blended in because the shreds were too large.

This is so delicious! Absolutely the best pasta salad I’ve ever eaten! I didn’t have fresh parsley, so I used half the amount of dried. I omitted the black olives because I’m the only one who likes them. I followed another reviewer’s advice and quartered sliced pepperoni and used slices of provolone that I cut into strips. I took it to a 4th of July picnic today and I got so many compliments. Usually pasta salad tastes sour because of the Italian dressing, but not this. This homemade dressing is so good. You could add any ingredients you want to this salad and it would be delicious as long as you use this dressing recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as printed.  It was the most bland, tasteless recipe I've ever made - it was like it needed some dressing - so I poured on my old standby Italian drsg which was tasteful.  So disappointed in this recipe!

This is the best pasta salad ever! I took it to a Girl Scout  camp out and everyone asked for the recipe.  I doubled the dressing and used a little less olive oil. I didn’t have any mustard seed so I omitted that and I only had mozzarella string cheese, which actually made it easier to dice

This recipe is flexible!  I made sure I had all of the fresh produce on hand...  didn't make certain I had some of the staples.  When I made the dressing, I didn't have red wine vinegar or ground mustard - two items I typically have! I used a raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine.  Left out the mustard and added a package of ranch dressing.  I'm not a ranch addict but so many people are.  It was a hit - I even got a text a few days later requesting the recipe...  I sent the original and my variation.  I never look at a recipe as 'the only way to make it.'  My favorite recipes are solid to start and can be varied as desired (or needed!).

3.26.18  First, this absolutely needs to chill in the fridge for the flavors to develop; I left mine in the refrigerator overnight.  If your review is based on how it tastes right after you’ve mixed it up, you’ll be disappointed.  I find pasta salad a good side kick to so many things, have made quite a few recipes, and I will say that I particularly liked the addition of the pepperoni.  As with many pasta salad dressings, this was has a red wine vinaigrette, but I think it was calling out for more tang, maybe to complement that pepperoni, not sure?  It was good, we liked it, but I wouldn’t say it was my favorite, and there’s a lot more prep time chopping and cubing than with many other recipes.

This is the closest recipe to the PASTA SALAD that we always made when I was a child. I use Cucumber, pepperoni, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, pepper jack cheese and Colby jack cheese and if I have a lot of people to feed I'll add in some chicken. Family FAVORITE

I was disappointed in this recipe. For the cost and effort, it just wasn't good. It almost didn't have taste... 2 stars because my husband said it was alright, but I couldn't tell if he was just trying to be nice or not... made a huge bowl of pasta that my family of 4 barely ate :(

I tried writing a review and mistakenly hit "done".  As I was saying I eliminated the cheese and meat because my daughter is a vegan. I substituted with blanched broccoli and raw chopped baby carrots.  For the dressing, I didn't have fresh garlic so I substituted with garlic powder and used a dash of cayenne pepper and agave nectar to give a sweet tang because the vinegar was a bit overwhelming.  I used Gluten-Free brown rice rotini pasta.  I also love using adobo and ground white pepper. It turned out delicious.

This is a KEEPER!   It's great because you can use whatever  veggies you have in the fridge.  I used pepperoncini, roasted red peppers,  sliced mini-peppers, sliced red onion, no olives or provalone mainly because I didn't have them.  Also didn't have pepperoni, but will include next time.  The dressing is terrific, I agree.  I only used 1/2 the dressing to lighten it up.  Only problem is not eating all the leftovers tomorrow when no one is looking...

I use this recipe for the dressing, as I prefer home made ones over bottled. I don't really ever have mustard seeds in the house, so I put a scant teaspoon of Dijon in. For the rest, I use whatever shape pasta I fancy and whatever veg is on hand. Always keep in the parmesan cheese! It makes it lovely! I sometime go meatless, and it is yummy as well.

I Love this recipe!! I really pump it up by adding more veggies (sweet corn, edamame, chopped purple kale, all 4 colors of peppers, artichoke hearts, etc cuz possibilities are endless!) I omit the pepperoni to keep it vegetarian. I use cubed vegetable jack cheese & I add ground flax seeds to it. Thank you so much for this delish dish!!

Very simple, great tasting  recipe. I didnt have mustard seed so I used mustard powder,  but everything else I had on hand which is always a huge plus.   I took other reviewers suggestions and doubled the dressing  for 1 box/lb macaroni. This recipe will be the starter for my future pasta salads.

This is very good. I used sliced pepperoni cut in half and 3oz was plenty. I used generous teaspoon of dried parsley instead of fresh. About 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard instead of ground mustard seed. Followed the suggestion of other raters and saved a little of the dressing to  moisten the pasta right before serving. It did take me one and a half CSI reruns to prepare though, a lot of chopping involved.

Lots of prep is the only bad thing about this recipe. Would love to know how BonnieS did it in 30 minutes. This salad is colorful and delicious. I could eat it everyday. I followed almost exactly.  I cut my cucs and olives in half, used parsley flakes and only used about 1/2-3/4 of the red onion and chopped it because red onion is strong and I didn't want it to overpower the salad. As someone else wrote, make a double batch of the dressing. Pour half over before chilling and save the other for after as it dries up a little in the frig and you will need more. I may use a different cheese next time, something with more flavor, otherwise, this is my new dish to bring to outings.

This was a great pasta salad. I made it for a large family crowd and it got eaten up. You can add any vegetable you like and leave out what you don't like.. It is the homemade salad dressing that makes us so special.

I didn't add the cucumber or black olives. I used American cheese and otherwise left it unchanged. This is quite possibly the best pasta salad we've ever had!

This is almost identical to a pasta salad I've been making for years, but usually for  parties. It's easy and quick enough to make more often...and delicious! I never added pepperoni as it overpowers the other flavors (I think), but rather, cubed ham. I also find that red wine vinegar doesn't add enough flavor to justify the weird color.  A pre-made, balsamic dressing is fine. I also leave out the parsley (don't like the bitterness) and use fresh or dried basil. I like Rebecca's idea of adding crabmeat or tuna--nice and light!

I love this dish. I make it a lot and just love the sauce that goes with it. Even if I don't have sausage I use mushrooms instead. You will love this dish vegetarian or not.

I looked this up for a pasta salad without a mayo base and one that wasn't Greek.  I picked this one specifically because it had homemade dressing -yummy!  I'd bet it's great as written and I will do it that way in the wintertime, but since I had fresh basil, I used that instead of the parsley, oregano, and dried basil as another reviewer suggested.  I also chopped the red onion and included it in the dressing jar to let it "pickle" before mixing with the  salad - I don't like raw onions much.  I'm sure you could use any veggies you wanted to -I used 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 green pepper, and small crown of broccoli.  I didn't have provolone and didn't want to add pepperoni so I used caraway cheddar we had on hand - fantastic!!!!

I liked this recipe because the dressing is done from scratch! Though I omitted the olive oil provolone cheese, olives, and sausage... And replaced the green pepper with red and yellow. It turned out beautifully!!! Also, I made and ate it within an hour... I'm sure the flavours will be even better tomorrow.

Wow! Best pasta salad ever! I made this yesterday using a 12 ounce box of 3-color rotini, so I increased the cheese & pepperoni to 8 ounces each. The dressing I increased all by about 50%.  This was the best pasta salad I've ever eaten, by far. Hearty, rustic, super flavorful and really colorful! I served it about 4 hours after making it, it was great! Today it's even better! And here's the bonus...today I made another batch of the dressing (with chopped parsley) as a marinade for pork chops....they were awesome! So yeah, thanks for this recipe, I'm a fan!

This was a huge hit. I made this with some changes. I used feta cheese instead of provolone since provolone is rare where I live and didn't add olives.  I also substituted rosemary for mustard seed. It came out great though. The olive out balances out the feta and parm cheeses and you get a creamy cheese flavor.

A really good cold salad meal for hot summer days.  I substituted green onion for the red. The dressing is really simple, includes ingredients most people have on hand, and is what makes the salad.

Next time, I may use different meat and cheese; maybe add some tomatoes just before serving (or use sundried) or try artichoke hearts instead of black olives.  Lots of room for "play" in the ingredients.

Best pasta salad ever! The only changes I made were using salami and mozzarella cheese. The dressing is what makes this salad. I did take advice from other reviewers and I doubled the dressing. I used half when I made it and the other half the next day to refresh it; otherwise it might have been a little too dry.

What do you do with leftover veggies from a vegetable platter? Make Pasta salad of course! Veggies were already prepped so all I had to do was slice them up, added grape tomatoes, substituted mozzarella for the provolone & totally forgot the parsley, oops. Like many others I really only came here for the dressing recipe but since these were the ingredients I had on hand anyway this is what I made, using cavatapi instead of rotini. I always add another batch of dressing before serving pasta salad since I don't like it too dry & this dressing was simple to make.

This is very versatile. I made extra dressing for the comments of others. I also made my salad with less noodles and lots of vegetables. I added some Broccoli and baby kale. This was very delicious and I used my leftover dressing on something else later too.

I mostly used this recipe for the delicious dressing.  I made my pasta salad with a pound of chopped rotisserie chicken, a cup of grated Parmesan,  cucumber, diced sweet mini peppers, artichoke hearts, olives,  chickpeas, and bow tie pasta. It was absolutely delicious and my whole family loved it. I'd definitely make it again!

I have made this 3 times using different meats each time. I used the pepperoni, cubed ham & grilled sausage links.  I think I like the sausage the best.  Everyone that has eaten this salad rave about it.  Love this!!!

I made this pretty much following the recipe. I was going for 1 1/2 of everything. With all the dry ingredients I went ahead with 2 times the pasta. It was a good portion of all. For the dressing I went ahead and made 3 batches. I put 2 on the night before. Added a small amount of the 3rd just before serving. Next time I'll add the cucumber in the last minute, as it wilted too much. Very tasty.

This pasta salad is delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  For the dressing, I did not have red wine vinegar on hand, so I used balsamic vinegar instead.  My husband loves this recipe!  Great for BBQ side dish, or an easy meal during a hot week!

I found this recipe for the dressing, and I thought it was missing a little something.  I made half the recipe at first so I didn't waste ingredients in case I didn't like it, and thought the garlic was going to be a little strong for my 3yo (I used old garlic, which has a stronger bite too). When I doubled my batch (to make a whole recipe) I left out the second clove of garlic and added 1 Tbsp sugar and about 2 teaspoons lime juice; it was perfect for our tastes. Probably just a personal preference on sweetness, but overall a great mix of flavors.  After cooking my penne noodles I poured 3/4 of the dressing onto them while still hot so it could soak in, refrigerated, then the remaining dressing right before serving so they were nice and juicy.  Tastes very Italian, but not like Italian salad dressing (which is what I normally use, but I ran out).  Fast and easy, we will make this again!

This was delicious. The dressing was very good. My only changes were substituting broccoli for cucumbers and adding chick peas. Also I used red and yellow peppers as opposed to green peppers. Makes a very colorful and tasty pasta salad!

So easy to make and tastes great. I usually leave it in the fridge for an hour, as I forget to give it time to marinade. It tastes great. A fantastic side dish, I use this all the time.

I found that the pasta salad was OK.  It definetly needed more dressing.  The pepperoni added a nice twist to it.

I thought this salad was great! As with most other people, I did change a few things like adding dry mustard instead of mustard seeds and I omitted the sausage just because I didn't have any.  Since first trying this recipe, this has become my "go-to" vinaigrette salad dressing as well. It makes a mean greek salad dressing!

Absolutely delicious!!  I used different salad ingredients from what was listed, but followed the dressing recipe.  The second day, it tasted a bit of vinegar, so next time I may add a touch of agave nectar when I make the dressing.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  We made it exactly as the recipe stated with the exception that we are vegetarians so I omitted the meat and we used green olives.  I will definitely make this again!  It's a keeper!

Now my go-to pasta salad recipe. You can vary slightly depending on what you have on hand. I have had to omit olives or pepperoni when I was out. I've also tried adding sun dried tomatoes, and switching up the cheese (cubed pepper jack at my husband's request, or little mozzerella balls, both good!). The original recipe is still 5 stars, though!

VERY GOOD!! I had several compliments on this one!! I replaced the olives for Pepperchini's, and the provolone for Pepper jack. I also sprinkled Crushed Red Pepper over the top before cooling in the refrigerator.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  I signed up a username just to rate it.  I have been making it for years.  I omit the red onion because it can be really strong and dominate the flavor.  Use pepperoni sausage as it suggests of the pre-sliced pepperoni. ENJOY

The homemade dressing makes this great but to speed things up you can use a good seasonings packet with/ oil and vinegar instead.

Made this for a pot luck and it was a hit! We reduced the onion to 1/2 other wise didn't change anything. The second time we made it I soaked the onion in balsamic vinegar before adding it to the salad.

I made this for 50 people - of course adjusting all the ingredients. It turned out wonderfully. The only thing I would do next time no matter what the size portion is, is either make more dressing or only toss it with half before chilling. After chilling for 8 hours it needed some more dressing as it had all soaked in. Even so, it was very tasty and it is now in my recipe box to make again! Oh also, I added Feta cheese - just cos Im a feta fan! ") YUM!

I love this salad and, as usual, made some slight changes...I used green onion instead of red (my girl doesn't like to smell like raw onions,) I added  sun-dried tomatoes, and celery. I almost doubled the recipe for the dressing, and I subbed Keen's mustard powder for seed, and added a bit of sugar and worcestershire sauce. This salad I'm sure is beautiful the way it is,but I am positive it rocked the way I made it too. (((((Peace n Love to you))))
