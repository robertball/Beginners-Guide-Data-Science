I'm only writing for one reason, as this dish was amazing. I'm a personal chef and enjoy coming here for new ideas. On just about every pork roast recipe i've seen, instructions have said to cook until 160 degrees, give or take. this is a mistake..it's called carryover cooking. any piece of meat that large is going to continue to cook for 30 to 40 minutes, and continue cooking about 10 to 15 degrees. thanksgiving turkey ever seem dry?? pork does NOT need to be fully cooked, 155 at the most.

I cooked this in the crock pot. Added all ingredients (including fruit, wine, clove, brown sugar used in the sauce) and cooked for 8 hours on low. Thickened the sauce with cornstarch and water and served with garlic mash potatoes. Excellent!

Wow!! This truly is a great way to make a loin roast. I used a crock pot to cook mine, it came out great! I did find it very sweet, so next time I won't put any brown sugar in it I find the apple juice will make it sweet enough.

My boyfriend made this for me and followed a few suggestions, used apple juice due to the lack of drippings and added marjarom. It was very tasty, but I would use less fruit next time. I didn't want a prune or apricot with every bite of pork I had, and there were plenty still left in the pan when we finished.

As we don't have alcohol in our home, I used straight apple juice- and it turned out wonderfully!

My first go at cooking a pork loin and I don't think it could have come out any better. Mine was only 2lbs so I cut the time in half. It came out nice and juicy. The sauce came out really yummy, but my loin didn't produce much, if any, drippings so it was mostly a wine sauce with some apple juice.

Great and easy recipe.  I used a 2.5lb roast, and I added a little marjoram and thyme to the mustard, and some ginger and allspice to the simmering fruit.  There weren't many drippings at first, so I used a little apple juice in the sauce, which worked fine.  The roast came out beautifully - moist and very flavorful, and the fruit is great with it.  Wife loved it!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Very easy to prepare and a big hit with the family. Only modification I made was to add 1/4 teaspoon each of finely ground rosemary and thyme to the mustard/sugar spread on the roast.

Wow!!  This was wonderful.  My whole family loved it (including 4 very picky kids!) .  I made sure not to let them see the ingredients before tasting (prunes & apricots would freak them out).  This will definitely be a regular meal at our house.  I made it exactly like the recipe and it didn't seem too time consuming at all.

Wow I was very skeptical about this recipe because of the prunes but dont let it scare you!!! I dont think I will ever look for another pork loin recipe again. This was very easy to make and so juicy!! 3 hours in the oven would have been way too much. I put the roast in the oven for 15 minutes in 450 then turned the temp down to 250 for the rest of the time. It took only about 2 hours to reach 150 and then I let it sit for about 15 minutes before carving. The degrees is everything for this recipe. You should cook it slow to keep it from drying out. The meat was just slightly pink and the gravy was unbelievable on the pork. I cant wait for leftovers tomorrow!! A must try recipe!!

This recipe was good but far too sweet. I added some chopped garlic and onion, which made it more savory and better balanced. Don't cook your pork to 160 degrees - cook it to 150 or 155 and pull it out for a few minutes. When you slice in, it will be finished and not overcooked.

Great reciepe.  I have made this three times now.  I modified it by browning the roast cooking all in crock pot.  I add fruit last hour. I take a 1/8 cup of cold water and two tablespoons of corn starch mix well and add to the roast the last hour too.  I like to use the hash brown bake to serve with it.

Excellent!  I loved this recipe!  I used a 2 lb. roast and apple juice with a splash of apple cider vinegar instead of the wine.  I added thyme and rosemary to the mustard coating and cut the cooking time in half.  I would advise others that  155 internal temp is ideal- perfect after resting.  I served it with steamed acorn squash which my husband and I thought was the perfect veg, especially with a little of the pan sauce drizzled on top.  Delish!

This was a good recipe.  The cook time was way too much the first time I tried it...3 hours made it very dry!  The second time I cooked it, I did it for two hours and it ws still almost too much.  I would try an hour and a half for a 4 pound roast next time.  Definitely use a thermometer!  Decreasing the time unfortunately cuts down on the basting opportunities which affects the sauce.  There was also way to much dried fruit.  I'm sure with some tweaking this could be an excellent recipe.  But it really needs tweaking....

I made this for our annual Christmas party we have with some friends. This was absolutely amazing!  I used dried cranberries in place of prunes and CranApple juice instead of just apple.  It was wonderful!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I LOVED!! this pork recipe. I am always nervous when trying new recipes, but this was sensational. The sweetness was just right for me. I did alter the recipe, and cooked mine in a crock pot as some suggested. I still mixed the mustard/brown sugar as directed, and then mixed the rest of the ingredients and poured in around the pork loin. I cooked it for about 4-5 hours on low, and it was sooo perfect - juicy and tender! I wasn't totally crazy about the bits of dried fruit - they gave great flavor, but for fruit to eat with the pork, I think I might try apples next time. DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing!

I usually only make recipes that have 5 star ratings and a lot of them, but this one I chose because I had a pork loin and most of the ingredients.  I substituted apple cider for the apple juice and raisins for the prunes and apricots.  The night I made it, I sliced the pork and seved the slices with juice poured over it...my husband ate it said it was good, but only after I asked him what he thought.  I took the leftovers and shreded them and then and poured the remaining juice and raisins over it, and the next day, he raved over it....and I have to agree with him!  I will make again...with cider (because I am afraid to tamper with a good thing), and I liked the smallness of the raisin, so I think I will stick with a package of fruit bits (the ones that have raisins, apricots, pears, etc. all chopped into dried bits. And I think most importantly, I will be sure to shred the pork in the juice.  Nice flavor!

This recipe was delicious and fancy without much work. I made it for Easter dinner but I highly recommend it for a romantic dinner date. It will definitely impress! Dont be afraid to use a more apple juice than what it says for    basting. You might need the extra juice for the gravy. Im not a gormet cook but this recipe made me look like one! A+

I followed the directions exactly. The pork was very bland and the gravy tasted exactly like prune baby food. I think I may have added a little too much corn starch because the gravy also had the consistency of baby food. As others have stated, this is a very sweet tasting dish. I think if I make it again, I will marinate the roast first and use less apple juice and fruit. I have noticed that a few reviews stated that they had very little pan juices. I think they may be using pork tenderloin instead of a regular pork loin. I leave the fat on the loin and then trim it off while eating. The fat gives extra drippings and helps keep the roast moist while cooking.

Reduced the liquids, reduced the sugar, added marjoram, cracked pepper, little salt, and onions cut in 1/8's. Threw everything except cornstarch together in a crockpot on low. Oh, for the apricots and prunes, I subbed the dried fruit that I had and needed to use up. Ended up with dried peaches, cranberries, and cherries.

It was really tasty! I think the fruit was a bit much for my family and me, maybe next time I will just cut back on the amount used other than that we loved it.

Excellent. I keep kosher so I used a brisket. I rubbed it with the Dijon mustard, brown sugar and thyme and put in the crock pot. Then I boiled the apricots, prunes, wine, apple juice, cloves, ginger and allspice  and boiled it for fifteen minutes until thickened. I poured the sauce over the meat and cooked it on high for an hour and on low for eight. It was delicious.

I didn't enjoy the sweet fruitiness with meat, however, if you do, you may enjoy this.

I made this in a crockpot cooking on low for 8 hours. I added all of the ingredients from the start, which worked fine. I think next time I will still wait to add the fruit mix until the last hour because the fruit dissolved and made a more pruney gravy. Either way, it was delicious and I will definitely be making it again.

Used the slow cooker and grape juice instead of wine.  It was really sweet and yummy (cut out brown sugar). I just mixed all the ingredients in the slow cooker on high for 3.5 hrs for a smaller roast and it tasted really good. I would cut back on the fruit next time for a small cut of meat it was way more than I needed (just to save money ya know). Ate it w/bakers and everyone even the 1 1/2 yr old liked it.

I honestly tried to give this recipe a chance because pork roasts can be such comfort food but the way this was prepared was just too darn sweet.  So, if you have a sweet tooth and want to combine the main dish and dessert into one course, this is the recipe for you. Myself, I'm taking it out of the Recipe Box. :(

I'm glad that I cook to temp and not time, this would have been bacon at 3 hours. I used a full 4lbs of roast.  It presented very well and looked pretty but the meat was not particularly moist or tasty.  Maybe the crock pot is the way to go for this one as others have suggested.

Very yummy!  It was tender, and not dried out! The flavor of the sauce and the prunes really were fantastic. This would be a great holiday dish.  Everyone loved it and are still talking about it.

Good, but takes too long to cook and too much attention. 3.38 (that was what I had on hand)pounds was way too much for us, may want to cut meat amount in half for less than 6 people. Not a keeper for us.

My whole family loved this!! I had a smaller roast and used a thermometer, cooking until it read 143°, (about 70 minutes at 350°) then letting it rest covered with foil for 15 minutes. PERFECT! I used Sun-Maid dried mixed fruit and doubled the recipe. I didn't have any wine, so I substituted apple juice and chicken broth instead. Loved the spicy- sweet flavor the fruit and cloves gave!! YUM!! Will be making this again!

I made this recipe for Easter dinner, I used two 3 lb. pork tenderloins and cooked for 1 1/2 at 350. I used apple juice instead of the wine and basted every 15 minutes. Everyone loved it!  I will definately make this again.

AWESOME! I usually crockpot cook my pork loins, but this looked too tempting. It turned out wonderfully.  I subbed apples and dried cherries for the apricots and prunes and white for red wine since that is what I had on hand, and it seemed to be very well liked by all!

One of the best pork loin roast recipes I have eaten.  This is very flavorful, but not overly spiced up as some recipes can get.  The gravy turned out nice and thick.  I had accidentally used 1/2 a cup of apple juice at a time, but that made more gravy in the end.  Otherwise, followed this recipe to the letter and everything was eaten up.  This recipe has been added to my binder.

This was just OK. Not good enough to make again only because i wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. It was a lil to sweet for me and that might have something to do with having to use apple juice to make up for the lack of pan dripping.(my loin was very lean) The fruit was also on the mushy side.

This was good, but not great.  I made it in the crockpot, which I probably wouldn't do again.  The crockpot made the prunes and apricots mushy, and the pork, while moist, shredded easily and thus I ended up with kind of a shredded pork in a mushy sauce.  I served it over rice with some vegetables, and while it was decent, I probably won't make again.

I agree with others who didn't want fruit in every bite-I cut back on the fruit- still good-although more people liked the apricot than the prunes!

From now own my new Thanksgiving centerpiece. It made an absolutely beautiful presentation for my Thanksgiving dinner--I don't think I've ever seen a turkey look that good. Everyone raved about the taste and tenderness of the pork, and we loved the gravy it made too. I didn't think it rendered quite enough gravy for the crowd I had, so I added some apple juice, more red wine, and even a dollop of creme fraiche to try to bulk it up. It was devoured. I had plenty of pan juices when it was time to simmer the fruit, but that's probably because I had covered the pork in foil (per my butcher's suggestion) for part of the cooking time. I have a fan-assisted oven, so the tempurature and the cooking time were decreased accordingly. I want to make this again soon just so I can take a picture of it! Very impressive, thanks for this.

Wow!  I served this at a dinner party of really good cooks and everyone loved it.  I chopped the prunes and apricots by mistake, but it ended up nice.  I kept some aside for a chutney like finish and had some with more liquid for gravy.  Will most certainly make again.  A 4 pound bone-in roast fed 8 people with leftovers.

This was a truly marvelously delicious recipe, making a delightful pork loin with rave reviews from the family.  I added a few dried apples to the fruit, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Easy from start to end, and a real show stopper.  Enjoy!

This sauce is everything!  I had no red wine so used extra apple juice. Also, no prunes so used dried apricots and cherry infused craisins. Cooked the meat in a slow cooker, adding 1/2 sliced small onion. Added a little extra cloves, because I love cloves. Everyone loved it! Will make again for sure.

I should have paid attention to the comments and planned to cook the meat for less than 3 hours. It was overcooked already (150 degrees) when I checked an hour and 45 minutes in. You're supposed to take it out at 140-145 degrees and let it rest for 10 minutes. I was roasting two 4-lb loins.  I made a few modifications: used grape juice instead of wine because I didn't feel like opening a bottle just for this, omitted the brown sugar altogether, and used half apple cider vinegar and half apple juice. Next time I will add onions. I didn't love the cloves in the sauce but everyone else loved it. The prunes and apricots go great with the pork.

The pork roast was very good.  Marinating it with the apple juice made it nice and moist.  The sauce was good, but a little sweet.  I might use less brown sugar, and use apricot preserves instead of dry apricots.  I might chop up the prunes in the chopper a bit too!  Will definately make this again!

Noone seemed to like.  They definately didn't like the prune sauce and the mustard dressing was questionable.  With some changes, it may not be too bad.

I am giving this four stars only because I used a small roast and it did not hardly give any gravy. But other than that it was nice and moist.

This recipe produced a tender, flavorful roast. However, there were no pan juices.

I'm a novice cook at best and this was a fabulous roast and very easy to make!!  I tweaked it ever so slightly.  I had a 2 3/4 lb roast.  I browned the roast on ALL sides first in a enamel covered cast iron dutch oven.  Once it was browned, I removed the roast and deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup of apple juice.  I covered the pot and placed it in the oven on 275 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, basting every half hour. Also, I only used about half the amount of fruit.  My four year old who only eats chicken fingers loved this roast. She even asked for seconds!!  My husband, who is also a picky eater, asks me to make this roast.  For him to ask for something speaks volumes about this recipe.

This dish was delicious!  If and when I make it again , I would eliminate half the fruit. It was overly sweet. I would use unsweetened apple juice and more spices. Less brown sugar too. Otherwise Sooooo Good!

My husband loved this!  I used port instead of red wine, added fresh chopped apple and a handful  of dried cranberry in my fruit since I was short on dried apricot. Those were the only changes I made to this fabulous recipe. This  is  wonderful on a cold evening with friends, or just family!

I made this FODMAP friendly and in the crock pot. So, I exchanged apple juice for white grape juice. I left out the prunes and apricots and used raisins instead. I put in the crock pot using the rub only and had it on low setting for 8 hours and then put it on Warm for about an hour. I put together the modified sauce and poured it over the roast and put back on low for about 40 minutes. Came out juice and delicious still. I'm suspecting in I had put about 1/2 cup of the white grape juice along with the rub it might have been a bit more juicy but not by much.

I have been using AllRecipes for years, but never before left a comment.  This was far and away the best pork roast anyone at our Easter celebration had ever tasted.  I basted it and prepared the fruit as directed, but I did not make gravy with corn starch at the end....I just spooned the juices over the sliced meat on the platter and arrayed the fruit along the sides. Doing it this way was NOT difficult or time-consuming at all.  It was perfect.  I'm sure you could use other fruits as well.

The dish was absolutely delicious but the sauce was a bit on the heavy side for us.  Will be making adjustments to the sauce next time, but the pork was so tender it fell apart !

Amazing flavors and among the best sauces ever. Used crockpot 7- 8 hrs on low, added a good splash of Armagnac and thickened sauce with cornstarch slurry.  Shredded leftover pork into sauce for a very elegant "pulled pork" to serve over polenta.

Finally! A moist, full-of-flavor pork recipe! Being my first time, and following the recipe bake time rather than my oven thermometer, I pulled the loin out at 170 degrees — 30 degrees higher than the recipe recommends. Should have been overcooked and dry, right? But no — moist cut-with-a-fork! Recommend using more fruit and juice for a fabulous sauce that everyone wanted more of.

I've found only one problem with this recipe it's kind of bland. I think the addition of some salt rubbed into the meat just before the mustard and brown sugar would go a long way to making this a better recipe.

We loved this-the fruit sauce was awesome with the pork and with mashed potatoes.
