My family and I liked this quite a bit. The texture was nice, but I think it needed a little something else for some more flavour.

Loved this - freezes great.  Let it sit out for a while so the cheese softens before serving.

Add green pepper or hot pepper jelly instead of the cranberry sauce.  Loved the way the flavor popped in your mouth.  Great on crackers.

I also changed from cranberry to a spicy jelly... I added more coconut to coat the outside for appearances

This was super yummy, just the right combination of sweet and spicy.  The only change I made was using a cherry-jalapeno jelly instead of cranberry.
