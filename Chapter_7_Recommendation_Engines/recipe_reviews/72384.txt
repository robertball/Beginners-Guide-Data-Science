I was looking for a light treat that would help me use the frozen fruit I'd recently purchased (trying to eat better).  I saw this and was initially turned away by the calories, but decided to try an altered version.  I used 1% milk and a few tablespoons of Ovaltine instead of the hot chocolate & syrup.  As advertised it is very light and sweet -- a simple treat for someone with a sweet tooth.  I'm not sure how chocolately the "real" version would be...mine had a nice balance.  Thanks!

The first time I made this, I made it as is, and I still liked it.  The second time, I used one scoop of Slim Fast chocolate mix instead of the hot chocolate mix, and I threw in half of a banana. I didn't use any chocolate syrup at all. I was looking for something a bit healthier and more of a breakfast substitute... so this way it just kind of amps up my slim fast drink and gets some fruit in my diet.

This was.....not good. I used whole milk instead of skim because that was all I had. The packaged cocoa mix gave the smoothie an odd texture and flavor. My kids drank half of it and then refused, I didn't care for it. I won't make this again.

Great delicious smoothie. Little chunks of blueberries make it SWEET! I put a little more chocolate syrup. Great activity for children like me!

This was ok, but not the greatest.  I don't like blueberries very much, but was able to handle this.  My boyfriend thought it was good, but a bit different therefore making it hard to get used to.  Otherwise, it was a simple recipe and very easy to make.

I used fresh blueberries and I didn't add chocolate syrup but I don't think it was needed. This is a super simple and pretty good smoothie.

So easy and quick! My fridge needed replenishing but I had frozen blueberries and, and I had all the ingredients for this recipe. Nothing super special, but it gets 4 stars for being so convenient, and still tasty. I replaced the chocolate syrup with dark chocolate chunks, giving it a great texture.

Hubby really liked this one. I personally prefer a "smoother" smoothie, but as he can't have bananas, this is one of the few recipes that are appropriate for him. He said it hit the spot!

Made this as a snack for the grands...they both loved it! I only used one packet of hot chocolate for 3 smoothies & I added several tbp. of vanilla yogurt. I froze some of it in ice pops for them to enjoy another day.

I'm indifferent to this recipe. It doesn't require a lot of ingredients, which is great, but it doesn't taste particularly great. Granted, I used a low-fat milk, fresh blueberries, ice, & no syrup, but I don't think the listed ingredients would have made much of a difference. I doubt I'd use this one again.

I recently purchased a smoothie maker and wanted to try it out, but couldn't find a recipe that I had everything for until I came to this one.  I wasn't sure about mixing chocolate and blueberries and even though it was ok, I wouldn't make it again.  As I was drinking it, I was reading the reviews.  I came across one that mentioned the amount of calories and after checking how many calories in one serving, I quit drinking it.  I proceeded to share it with three other members of my household and between them they couldn't finish off the remainder of what was left as they didn't like it at all.  I know I won't make this again.  I guess I should have went on my instinct that mixing chocolate and blueberries wouldn't be so good.

This was very good.  I think next time I'll add some yogurt in place of some of the milk.  I think it will work well with strawberries and raspberries too.

Delicious.  Blueberry smoothies are very hit or miss at home, but this one worked.  I had no chocolate syrup, so I substituted with Godiva milk chocolate liqueur.  Excellent nightcap.

I am a HUGE smoothie lover. I have tried about every smoothie imaginable, and this is by far my favorite!! It taste like a chocolate milkshake with a blueberry twist...absolute delicious!! (Although I did leave out the chocolate syrup to save a few calories:) Thank you so much for this recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except I substituted strawberries for blueberries.  I did not like it - I love chocolate, but the hot chocolate gave this a strange flavor/texture.  Will not make this again.

i really didn't like this that much.....it didn't even really taste like blueberries or chocolate...there were a lot of blueberry skins in it too.
