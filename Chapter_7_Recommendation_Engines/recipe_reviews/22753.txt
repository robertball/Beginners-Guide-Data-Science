Awesome!  This is such a quick and easy dessert.  We grilled our peaches though.  The combination of brown sugar and sour cream is delicious!  I used toasted walnuts instead of the pecans and drizzled a little honey over top.

Fabulous!  A keeper. Good cold or heatup and then top with the cold sourcream. Great little number to serve guests at a intimate summer get-together.  Even tastes good with canned peaches which is how I tried it the first time. Mmmm...
You could probably do bananas this way too....

Made this exactly as written, except that I just stirred the brown sugar into the sour cream. It was very tasty, fairly healthy (I used fat free sour cream) and best of all, VERY VERY SIMPLE! Thank you.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could! I was skeptical about the sour cream but I'm glad I tried it... it is DIVINE with the peaches and combined with brown sugar: perfection!

Very nice indeed!  I skipped the sugar because my peaches were so sweet and replaced the pecans with warm toasted almonds because I had no pecans.  Delicious.

I made this, except I used regular sugar, mixed the peaches with the sugar and sour cream, served it over pound cake slices and sprinkled the pecans on top.  Everyone loved it!  The peaches are so creamy when mixed together.  I could eat it by itself, or with vanilla wafers or shortbread cookies.

Not a huge fan of peaches.  I really don't care for canned peaches, but fresh ones are often too tart, so I'm always on the hunt for something that will solve that problem.  I took others suggestions and substituted whipped cream for the sour cream.  It wasn't bad though it didn't completely illiminate the tartness.  The pecans were a very good combination.  Next time I might give it a go with the sour cream and maybe some slightly riper peaches.

Was very good and easy to prepare as stated, however, as Im preparing it, Im wondering why I am not using Ice Cream in place of the sour cream.  The brown sugar does smooth the sour cream well, and canned peaches in their own syrup would prob add to the sweetness and make this a great dish.

Extremely quick - used fresh peaches and didn't peel them - light, simple and tasty sweet treat!  As other reviewers suggested - I simply stirred the brown sugar into the sour cream.  We did't have any nuts on hand, but it was still lovely.  I will certainly be trying this with other fruit and likely using the sour cream/brown sugar combo on other items!  Terrific, thank you.

I LOVE quick yet fairly nutritious recipes that work for 1 or 2 people. This tasted like a fruit/peach salad when the sour cream, fresh peaches, and brown sugar meld together. I used reduced fat sour cream as my only tweak and because I used fresh picked sweet white peaches I did not bother to peel them. Ty

Well, I wasn't wowed by this.  I liked the idea of it and I used beautiful fresh peaches, but the sour cream just didn't work for me.  The sour taste took away from the sweetness of the peaches and the little bit of brown sugar wasn't enough to compensate.  The pecans were nice with the peaches.  I toasted mine (350 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until fragrant).

I gave mine a quick poaching with a little sugar and lemon in the water so I could prepare ahead and not have the peaches discolor, also then easy to peel!  Excellent simple dessert!!

Nice and easy dessert that seems healthy, too! It could probably be used with other fruits, as a reviewer suggested, like bananas, apples, pears, etc.  I also added some brown sugar to the sour cream, as well as sprinkling over the fruit (so probably used more than the recipe states). This will be a repeater. Thanks for the recipe.

It tasted good, but not much better than some cream poured over some peaches.  Toasted pecans are great on it or on the cream version.

I was skeptical about this with the sour cream. I mixed it with the brown sugar, and was very surprised. It tasted similar to cheesecake or cream cheese. Would be even better with baked peaches. Going to try that too. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! I added a little cinnamon and put on top of homemade pancakes since I don't like syrup. I also just went ahead and mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon, and sour cream together before topping. Very delicious!

Good light summer dessert-not too sweet
