My daughter requested this today for her birthday... I made the cake as directed - The only exception was I folded in the contents of 2 single serve Snack Pack Vanilla Pudding cups to  the filling.  It gave it a little substance (in fact, next time I will fold in 3 pudding cups).  I did not add pudding to the portion set aside for the topping.  My father in law like it so much he requested it for his birthday in a few weeks.   
Will also try a chocolate version as well.

Absolutely delicious!  I used strawberries and blueberries on top and used cool whip instead of whipping my own. It was fab!  Oh, and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I didn't make any changes except food colouring, I substituted with a little vanilla for the topping and some roasted almond slivers. It's light and refreshing, I made it for New Year's Eve dinner, a light dessert with champagne with a strawberry in each glass was perfect. My guests where very impressed.
