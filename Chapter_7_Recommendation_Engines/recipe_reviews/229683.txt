Have you ever substituted the queso fresco for Parmesan cheese? I prefer that taste to queso fresco.  I also prefer substituting crackers for white bread, it tastes slightly sweeter. Yum...sweet and spicy. Overall, this dish is great. My favorite.

The taste of this is awesome BUT even after blended well, the fresh cheese is still a little chunky and doesn’t have the same texture as I’ve tried in the restaurants or authentically made in Peru.

There is a Mexican cheese that I found that is exactly what is needed for this recipe "el queso Panela" (you can find it at any Mexican mercado, if you cannot find it in your local supermarket) any other substituted cheese will change the original flavor. "Queso Panela" looks like a "queso fresco" , but its flavor and consistency is softer and not  salty at all.

it taste really good  with mozzarella cheese, or white cheddar cheese instead the fresh cheese.
