I decided to make this soup without the cream just to make it slightly healthier and and just used a little more water to thin it out [I also absolutely love the rich colour of this soup}.  After blending the whole batch I poured most of it back in the pot but I left a small amount (1/2 cup to 3/4 cup) of soup in the blender and tossed in some roasted garlic goat Chevre (soft white goat cheese) and blended further.  I used this as garnish poured into each bowl as the colors contrast well.  It was a fabulous soup and I will definitely make it again.

Made this soup last night, with the following changes: I added a can of crushed tomatoes in place of one cup of chicken broth; I added a dash of hot sauce; I used plain yogurt as an optional garnish, instead of adding milk (dairy product issue for a family member). We loved it! I have been asked to make it again often. I think  it is a great, flexible recipe. Thanks, Pam Anderson.

Made same as recipe but used coconut milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and substituted veggie broth to make vegetarian.

This soup is fantastic!!  I've made it twice: once with fresh dill & once with 2 teaspoons dried dill.  I substituted "Better Than Bouillon" vegetable soup base in water for the chicken broth, and added a can of kidney beans before blending to thicken it & add protein.  Used only 1/4 cup half-and-half to lower the calorie count.

This soup is so delicious, I keep craving it.  I'll make it again & again.

Love the dill/beet/caraway flavours!  Don't skip toasting the caraway seeds - makes a bit difference to the flavour.  Used chevre instead of a boiled egg for garnish.  Wonderful soup!

This was a great dish for beets!  The only change I made was to use 1c half&half vs. 1.5c.  I may substitute yogurt next time - as some of the others said.  The caraway seeds add a lot of flavor.  This is definitely a make again dish.

I wish 4.5 stars was an option. I didn't have any chicken stock so I made a tomato broth by watering down marinara which was really yummy. My pinch of sugar was heavy handed and too much for this recipe, so it turned out a little sweet for my taste, but definately delicious. I garnished with shredded mozarella cheese which was really pretty with the raspberry color. Definately a keeper of a recipe.

I love this soup! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. The only substitution was that I used a higher fat cream (18%) because it was all I had in the fridge. I'm about to make my second batch this week!

Tasty!  The cayenne adds a subtle zing.  Made it with no-fat evaporated milk to cut the fat/calories -- worked just fine.  The boiled-egg garnish was OK, but seemed more suited for a cold soup/borscht.  In fact, this soup tasted fine cold ... just not what I was looking for in mid-February!

I am on the site to make this recipe for the second time. In the words of my husband "This is now my favorite soup you make!". I hadn't had beets before deciding a month ago to try them. They were so cheap and beautiful in the grocery store. This recipe looked easy and delicious, and I have to say I am a fan of dill. The flavors are wonderful, the soup is hearty without being too heavy, and you just feel healthier after you eat it.

I loved this soup. I substituted the cream for 2% milk to make it a little less fatty and lower calorie. I had big plans to freeze some, but it was too delicious and didn't last that long.

Nice soup...a dash of red wine adds a good flavour.  I prefer using beef broth instead of chicken.  I pureed half of the soup and then left the other half chunky and added some carrot chunks.  The chunkier texture makes the soup heartier if you are serving it as a meal.  Goes well with a rustic style bread.

This soup grows on you.  I wasn't sure I liked it at first, after re-warming it was pretty darn good.  It took a lot of time so I will only be making it on special occasions.

The directions are questionable when it says to wait until the squash turns golden brown, and again when it says all vegetables take on a caramel color.   My beets are red and after putting onions and garlic with them, everything is still red.   After sauteing them and cooking a little longer they are still red.

Wonderful.  I agree that beef broth is more authentic.  Skipped the cream, just added sour cream to the bowls (a must!).  Also add two potatoes for a little bulk.  Love love love, reminds me of my summer in Russia.

I did not have caraway seeds, so I substituted a tsp. of celery seeds (not toasted).  I added a few carrots and used a small can of evaporated milk since half and half is not sold here in Peru.  Hubby is on a soup diet, so this was a great change.  Delish!

This was fine, but just not my favorite way to eat beets. It was better after it sat in the fridge for a day and the flavors mingled. I would suggest rye croutons instead of hard boiled egg as the garnish. The soup had a beautiful magenta color that would be great for Valentine's day if your sweetie likes beets!

Quite tasty with just a little kick from the cayenne. I garnished with a little chopped cucumber. I may use this recipe as a base, the jack it up, I'm already thinking of ideas for it. I think I can make it 5 star. By all means everyone should make this recipe, it's pretty darn good.

I think this is one of my favorite recipes of all time. The caraway seeds are the key I think. I left out the sugar since beets are so sweet already and used 2% milk, and it was perfect. My parents also raved about it....more than once after I gave them some.

This was a wonderful way to use some fresh organic beets.  The caraway gives it a smoky balance to the sweetness.  I replaced the half-and-half with greek yogurt (mostly because that's what I had on hand) and it was very filling.

I like it! I didnt put sugar and added some carrots instead. Also, I only had a bit of half and half and a bit of whole milk, like a few spoons of each, so I only used that and I really liked the end result!

This soup was delicious. I forgot to add the dill to the blender, but it tasted just fine adding chopped dill after blending. I also added a few chopped radishes while cooking the beets, and used almond milk instead of half and half, and it tasted great. After blending, I added celery, mushrooms, red cabbage, and some roasted potatoes, carrots, and cauliflower. Garnished with egg, radish, and parmesan. Perfect!

Wow, I forgot to add the dill! Yet the soup was delicious, and I will make it again. Hopefully it will be even better with the dill included. I used 1/2 cup 2% milk instead of 1.5 cups half and half, and the soup was the perfect thickness. The recipe says 8 servings, but without the extra cup of liquid it only serves 4 if you are serving in a bowl as a main course rather than in a small cup. I don’t know what kind of beets turn caramel colored when they are cooked.... mine turned the usual beet red color. Nevertheless, a great recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

I liked this soup very much, however I added a couple extra ingredients at the end. 2tbs of Apple Cider vinegar and a slice of jalapeño into the blender. Added a little extra zest, I enjoy!

We made this recipe exactly the way  it was written.  It is delicious. The recipe didn't specify whether to peel the beets or not....we peeled them. I'm not sure what the recipe poster meant by "squash"..."golden brown"...or "rich spotty caramel color"...I just cooked everything according to the time frames given, and the soup came out just fine..

I am a beet freak, so I LOVED this soup!  My kids not so much.  Wasn't sure what a pound and a half of beets were I used about 5, which included the largest beet I ever saw.  Love the cayenne pepper, just the right amount of punch.  Will make again and again.

Wonderful depth of flavor.  Fresh beets and dill from mom's garden.  I have to point out, because I can't help myself, that a beet is a root vegetable and not a squash.  Not that it changes how good this recipe is.  I had to switch to the regular blender, because I was making a mess with the immersion blender.  Also, I actually garnished with crumbled feta cheese instead of the hard boiled egg.

I had to use up a few beets a friend had given me from her garden.  I cut the recipe by a third, but still had too much soup to hold the egg. The egg sank and soaked in a lovely color.  I also used only a dash of cayenne. I didn't want it too spicy. It was awesome.

Excellent recipe! I made some changes, because we're trying to eat plant based diet. I also wanted to stretch it a little, since others said it didn't make much. I added a grated carrot for sweetness, a diced potato to make it creamy, a shallot to add a little more garlic/onion flavor since I also added 1 cup extra liquid. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and tofutti sour cream (1/2 container) instead of dairy (1/2 and 1/2).  I also cut the beats in 1/4 inch slices and may have cooked just a bit longer. I gave this 5 stars, because I'm sure it would be fantastic the way it is written. The caraway seeds and dill make this dish unique and fabulous!

It was just ok, and I love beets!  I found myself saying "bluh" after the first few spoonfuls, so I gave up.

this was my first time cooking with caraway, which is why i wanted to try the recipe in the first place.. i nearly tripled the pepper.. used dried instead of fresh for both the dill and garlic.. added a touch of vinegar bc the yogurt i used in place of half&half wasn't pungent enough.. used canned beets (w/o vinegar) bc i didn't have any fresh.. i like the recipe but am trying to figure out what it's missing.. it's like nothing i've ever tried before.. ty for introducing me to something new
