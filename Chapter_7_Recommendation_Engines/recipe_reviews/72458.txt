This dish had no taste. I added more dill and a honey mustard sauce and it was edible. I will not make again.

I will not make this again, the veggies were under-done & the fish overdone... it gets 1 star because it does look pretty.

I liked the flavor of this but after 30 minutes I checked it and the potatoes and carrots weren't done. I left it another 20 min and the potatoes were still a bit undercooked (and I did fairly thin slices... under 1/4") even though the fish was nearly cooked to pieces. Otherwise, it was a good steamed fish and veggie dish. Doesn't do well (for me) reheating the leftovers though...
