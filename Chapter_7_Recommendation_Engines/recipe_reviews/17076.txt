I used the small phillo cups you can buy at the store in the frozen food section instead. They were really good and could be served bite size. The recipe made enough for 30 little cups.

You don't need tartlet pans to make these.  Just use flaky biscuits, which halve easily.  Split and flatten each half.  Fill with the crab mixture, then fold up so that it forms a cup.  Line on a greased cookie sheet and you're ready to go!

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving appetizers. A big hit! Delicious filling! But I rolled out Pillsbury refrigerated crescent roll dough, then cut small circles and lined them in the cups of a tartlet muffin pan, then filled them and sprinkled paprika on top. The dough really puffs up nicely and made them tasty. They were sooo good!

Thank You Catherine for such a great recipe.  Have now made these twice for both formal and informal gatherings.  Considering I find this "review" section as a most helpful and valuible tool to "tweak" the recipes I find on this site I hate to be repetitive.  But, I also chose to use to "ready made" store bought phyllo cups.  Saves much time and $$ if you do not already have tartlet pans.  I have found this recipe is best served hot but is also quite good served at room temp.  Have not yet found any reason to variate from the original recipe as well as if you choose to use the store bought phyllo cups, once prepared, the individual plastic moldings they come in make for perfect transporation to serve an elegant app that appears time consumming.

These were very good and easy - I used the premade phyllo cups as well which not only cut down the work time but also made them look very attractive. I used real crab meat out of the shell, not even the canned stuff, and that was a dumb mistake. You don't even need to use canned crab - use imitation crab and chop it up small. You cannot taste the crab over the cream cheese and cheddar cheese, so it's mainly there for texture. I could have saved myself some dollars if I had used imitation, and you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. I will definitely be making these again (they were a hit at the party) but with cheaper ingrediants!

I served these appetizers for my Hawaiian Swim Party.  I MADE CHANGES: I used Puff Pastry Shells by Pepperidge Farm.  I cooked the puff pastry on a cookie sheet until golden brown.  I let them cool 5 minutes on a wire rack, and then I added two teaspoons of the crab mixture on top.  I'm now the best cook my friends ever met.  Note: Add two 6 oz. cans of crab meat for more crab flavor.

Easy, tasty, attractive...could you ask for more?  Yep!! Most ingredients you will have on hand.I added a bit of horseradish and a few lemon juice squirts.  If you use the phyllo cups you can leave them in their individual plastic molds to freeze or to transport! You have enough mixture for 30 servings.

I made these for a cocktail party last weekend and they were received raved reviews. I used the mini phyllo dough cups as some other reviewers suggested and them came out perfectly. I omitted the green onion and added minced onion in lieu, they turned out perfectly! Not only did they tasted like they were from a gourmet caterer, but they looked really great too! Thanks for a wonderful receipe! This is a keeper.

I made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and were they ever a hit! After eating only one, he commented that I should make them everyday. They were very delicious and very easy as well. I used phyllo cups and halved the recipe and they turned out great. The phyllo cups turn out nice and crispy and saves a step. I also dipped mine in cocktail sauce - an added bonus. This one will be a staple in my appetizer collection.

Really good.  Really easy.  I used tomato, spinach and regular phillo cups that I found in the freezer section of my local grocery store.  The colors red and green colors will be on my table for the holidays for sure.  This recipe filled three trays of  the pre-made phillo cups.  I made these in the morning, cooked them about 10 mins removed and put them in the frig.  I took one tray out before my before my guests arrived and finished the cooking until they were slightly browned on top.  I served other apps as well at my party so I had some left over.  (in the frig not on the plates :)I popped the left over trays into the freezer.  I will take them out and cook them tonight so that I can take them with us to a friends get together.  For ease, taste and presentation these get 5 stars from us.   Oh and I should say.... my mother found this recipe first ... made it for my brothers birthday.  It was a great hit.  When I asked her... no surprise to learn that she found it here on Allrecipes.  I had to laugh... I swear by this site and the rating system.  Hate to tell too many people about it... they can find all my secrets.

These were really good. I used fresh crabmeat and I also used the phyllo cups which made this a very easy recipe. My brood loves lemon so I squeezed fresh lemon juice over the tarts after they were done baking. Very good recipe, thanks for sharing.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The ingredients were fairly expensive and the end result was a doughy lump with a bit of bland filling. I'm glad I tested this out first before bringing it to the party I was going to. After the first small batch I added spices, lemon juice, and fresh minced garlic to the filling but it still wasn't anything spectacular. I even ran out and bought more crab. After doubling the crab and green onions and adding cajun seasoning, fresh ground pepper, lemon juice, and garlic the filling was alright but still nothing great. The refrigerated biscuit dough was too doughy so I tried using phyllo cups which were definitely better but still nothing really good. Even hubby thought it was edible but didn't really want to eat it and he loves crab. I was supposed to bring an appy to a party and planned on bringing this but ended up scrapping it altogether and made something else.

DEE-licious! After reading the reviews, I decided to try these both ways. I made half of them in phyllo cups and the other half with the biscuit dough. Although both were good, my personal preference was for the phyllo cups. I liked the crunch when you bit into them better than the soft biscuit alternative. The crab filling was extremely tasty... I did double up on the green onions though for added flavor. These were very well received at the pot luck I took them to and I will most definitely be making them again!

I added extra green onions and a dash of garlic powder for flavoring. I also used the mini fillo shells that I found in the freezer section. I also turned the oven on broil to brown the tops for bout 2 min.  These turned out amazing! will definetely make them again.

I made these for a Christmas party and they were a major hit!!  I used the frozen phyllo cups and there was enough filling for 30 of them (or two boxes).  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  The only thing I added was a little garlic powder.  I did mix the filling a few hours before and let it sit in the fridge, filled and baked just before they were served.  I will be making these again on Christmas!

After reading the reviews, I used Phyllo Cups, added a little garlic, dash cayenne, doubled the green onions and crabmeat.  Also had leftover chive/onion cream cheese, so use half of that mixed with low-fat cream cheese.  These were a big hit with my friends.     I had some leftover filling, which I baked and served as a hot dip and served with crackers.

I made these for a New Years party. I used expensive lump crab but agree it was not necessary as the mixture is quite creamy and cheesy.  I used the pre-made phyllo dough cups as well which was extremely easy and turned out well.  I had one or two people who really liked them but these weren't a total stunner.  Granted it takes a lot to truly wow me.  I used the leftover crab mixture as a dip for crackers which people enjoyed as well.  Overall, these were good but they didn't have that wow-factor I was looking for.

Great recipe I'm not sure if someone already mentioned this adding small chunks of boiled egg will help strecth the crab meat (same texture) if you are looking for an alternative. Also it does need a little extra something like onion and garlic powder and I use Season-all instead of ordinary paprika

We really liked these, but they needed a tad more flavor. I used puff pastry in a mini cupcake pan, making 1/2 the filling as written, & the other 1/2 with Old Bay seasoning. We much preferred the latter. Placing 2-4 slivers of green onions on top (after baking) was extra tasty. I will make these again.

These were pretty good. I did use the phyllo cups but I had to make them as I could not find them anywhere. A few changes for next time- I will double the crab meat and the onions for more flavor. I will also undercook the phyllo cups and then bake with the crab mixture.

excellent little cups. I made my own biscuit dough and these were put together no time. The parmesean and worcestershire sauce really liven up the dip.

I made these for a neighborhood progressive dinner. They were a huge hit. I also used the frozen phillo cups and it worked out beautifully. I only baught two boxes of the cups and had allot of leftover filling. I ended up putting the filling in mushrooms and baking them. These were also yummy. They disappeared a few minutes after putting them out.

These were very good! I used frozen phyllo cups instead of the biscuit dough. I tripled the recipe because I used a big can of "fresh" crab from the seafood department. I made them a week before, put them back in the phyllo cup tray, wrapped with saran and froze. I just popped them in the oven, frozen, and baked about 25 minutes. I also made some with a spinach filling and alternated them on the serving plate for a nice presentation.

I made this for a party for my Sunday School class and my girls LOVED them! So much so that every party we've had since then, they always request them. :) I just press the dough into a mini cupcake pan and that works great. Thanks for the awesome and EASY recipe! :)

Super easy to prepare.  Enjoyed them but did add the Old Bay Seasoning for a little more kick. Really like making these ahead of time and then freezing them.  Now I have an additional appetizer for the last minute cocktail party.

Use hot and spicy mayonnaise!   It gives it just the perfect amount of kick this recipe lacks! Super easy.   Question... Cook before freezing or not?

Easy and quick.  I, too, used 2 cans of crab meat for additional crab flavor and the phyllo cups. Both were great suggestions made by previous people.  Still, I found the mixture to be relatively tasteless.  I would probably never make it again.  However, since there were quite a few left over, I'm going to attempt to freeze them and try to reserect them once again.

Took the advice of others and used 2 packages of frozen Phyllo cups (15 to a pkg.) which worked perfectly. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly except I used 8 oz. of immitation crab meat.  I took this to an outdoor party where they were gone in a flash!  Super easy, very tasty.

Made them for appetizers on Christmas, came out very well.  Use the pre-made phyllo cups.  They're the perfect size and keeps the prep time down!

We love having these around to snack on or when we made chinese. We do not have tartlet pans so we have been using regular cup cake pans. The first batch I made I split the rolls like the recipe called for and we didn’t care for the rolls flavor so since I had bought multiple packages i tried it a little different the next time. I didn’t split the roll. I simply rolled it out very thin and placed it on top on the cup cake pan, filled it with the mixture and folded over the sides. I also added a little garlic salt and a little kickin chicken seasoning I really enjoyed them more than the first batch.

I accidentally bought a tart/quiche pan instead of tartlet pan.  Instead of 12 individual appetizers I had 6.  I timed the appetizers for 15 minutes thinking that this would not be enough time because of the size but when I looked at the tarts the dough was already brown and the color of the filling golden color, I decided to keep the tarts in another 2 more minutes.  When I cut one of the tarts in half to taste it the first thing that came to my mind when I looked at it was that it was very doughy.  After eating it, I think I should have kept them cooking a little longer because I was not sure if they were cooked enough because the cream cheese was still a little mushy and I am not sure how they are suppose to taste.  They are still good but I think they would have turned out better if I used the correct pan

LOVED IT!  I was looking for something different for Easter and found this recipe.  It was a HUGE hit!  My sister in law asked me at first where I bought them from.  :)  When I told her I made them, she was quite impressed.  I used the little phylo cups and that made these elegant as well as tasty!  We're looking for a reason to make these again!

I made this recipe this past weekend for our group of friends that get together for food and games. The only substitute I made was to use the pre-baked MINI phyllo cups that came 15 per pkg in the freezer section of the grocery store. Being pre-baked, I was able to simply grease a cookie sheet and bake them on it - no need for purchasing tart pans. The recipe filled 2 pkgs or 30 of the phyllo cups. Everyone raved about how great they were and the women all asked for the recipe. I don't care for seafood personally and even I LOVED them! I will definitely make them again.

I LOVED this recipe! I'm not a huge seafood fan BUT this recipe was really good! I made no changes other than I purchased the phyllo cups. I made over 100 of this little tarts for my recent cook out and they were GONE! You can leave them at room temp or there even better right out of the oven! GREAT APPETIZERS! This would be good for any reception! This is a KEEPER!

This has become one of my go-to appetizers. I use phyllo cups, always double the crab, add lemon juice and hot sauce, and sometimes Old Bay. I usually make a double batch and freeze some. I put the filled cups back in the tray and box, stuff it in a zip lock and freeze. Just bake from frozen when ready to eat.

I did not care for this recipe. Biscuit dough is a bad choice for this appetizer and completely ruins it. The crab mixture is great but the tartlet should be much lighter such as pie crust or even filo.  The biscuit overpowers the crab and you can't taste it.

Very good.  I baked in a pie plate because I wanted a dip with crackers.  I also used Vidalia onion because that's what I had.  Next time, I'll double it; gone fast!

Fabulous, fast, and so simple!  Due to writer feedback and a diabetic in the family, I also used Fillo Mini-Shells, doubled the crab, and used imitation crab. I'll make this again, my mom will make this, and the four of us scarfed them up so quickly that I can't verify whether they freeze well or not. Great recipe--thanks for sharing it.

I made this for my New Years Eve crawl, neighborhood party! They were a hit... Every single person wanted the recipe. The only bad part, I clearly did not make enough ;)
I will continue to bring these to parties thru out the years.
I too used the phyllo cups for the vessel. It's a perfect bite size serving!!!! I wish that I had made extras for myself.

I liked this recipe.  I wasn't too crazy about using biscuit dough.  It didn't really seem like it went well together.  Next time I'll try Phyllo cups if I can actually find them in the store.

Delicious! I used mini muffin pan and pressed small circles of biscuit dough in. Definitely needs full 20 minutes in oven. Huge hit at my Oscar party!

Family and friends rave over these and beg for the recipe. Great party pleaser. For a lighter version, I have used wonton wrappers instead of the biscuit dough.

I made this for a NYE party and we loved it!  As per other reviewers instructions, I used the mini phyllo cups instead of biscuits and doubled the crab meat. They were delicious and I can definitely see us making them again in the future.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Good basic recipe, but a little bland for my taste. The second time, I added some chopped up artichoke heart, a bit of garlic, and some cayenne pepper.  Much tastier with a bit of kick!  I used the leftover mix to make stuffed mushrooms. . .  Delish!

Very good.  Used tin crab.  For you canadians, I used President Choice Butter Puff Pastry, I box made 32 tartlets.  Next time I will make double batch and freeze them.  Mine took 20 mins. to get them lightly brown on the bottom.
Thanks,
Michele Cambridge Ontario

I made these for a family Chritmas get-together.  They went over really big!  I did use the puff pastry as suggested.  Will definately make again for any special event.

I made these for a Christmas party. I used one container refrigerated 16 oz flaky biscuit. I rolled each biscuit and then cut it into 4th, then rolled each one flatter. I put them in 2 mini cupcake pans.  For the filling, I used a 8 oz container of crab from the refrigerator section at Trader Joes. The crab to cream cheese ratio was perfect. I added seafood seasoning and a few splashes of hot sauce for added flavor. I baked them in a 350 degree oven for 10 minuets. They were very good. I will make this recipe again.

These were phenomenal, and so easy to make! I even accidentally bought the wrong kind of crab, and they still tasted good (meant to get "lump", but got the plain Starkist "white crab" flakey stuff instead). Next time I will get the correct kind of crab, and maybe try adding a little lemon juice. I was also pretty heavy-handed with the cheese and green onions, and would repeat that choice ;). These were easy, delicious and seemed super-fancy. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe!  I also used phillo cups- easier and fewer calories!! I also was confused on the servings stated in original recipe.  I made half a batch, except still used a whole can of crab and it made 21 phillo cups (box and a half).  They could have been fuller maybe, but that still would make at least 18 in the phillo cups.

These were creamy, yet light and delicious. I'd call it California style due to lack of Old Bay Seasoning. (which I very much prefer)   I was very pleased with the as written version, but I will add a clove of crushed garlic to the cream cheese next time.   Great appetizer paired with white wine.  I used lump king crab (fresh).

Added 2 cans crab, lemon, tabasco and garlic powder to the mix. Forgot to pick up phyllo cups at store so made my own with puff pastry dough. They burned a bit but were still good. Phyllo cups next time for sure!

After reading the reviews I doubled the crab, used the phyllo cups (Yes!), added some "heat" seasoning and squeezed a lemon over them before serving.  The lemon is a MUST and they still needed more "oomph".  (I used 1/2 t. blackening seasoning and could have at least doubled it.)  The creaminess of the filling with the crunch of the phyllo is wonderful, you just need to punch it up a bit.  I will make these again.  (and probably add some lemon zest to the filling)

I made this recipe two ways - one using the biscuit dough and the other using Tenderflakes Mini Tart Shells. Tart shells were way better and less work. Plus they come out in nice easy to serve sizes. I'll definitely be making these for my Christmas party.

Such a wonderful recipe!  These are a staple at any of our get togethers!  I have found that they can be made faster by using premade phyllo dough shells found in the freezer section at the grocery store!  They turn out just as good and saves a lot of time!

My husband and I absolutely loved these. I thought the biscuits were a little too much bread, I would have preferred something more crisp, like a phyllo shell instead. But the filling was incredible. The only thing I did different is I used chipotle mayo instead of the plain, it gave it a great kick!

We thought these were very good.  After combining all but the crab, family tasted the mixture and all agreed it needed that bit of something else for more flavor so I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1/2 teaspoon of Cajun Blackening seasoning. I will add a little more Cajun next time.  I did use Fillo as suggested by many.  Very good!

I did try this recipe and I very much liked the filling but I found the dough to be a little too much.  I would definitely make the filling again and put it into another type of pastry.  I did amp up the flavour a little, going by what I had read from some other reviews.  For example, I doubled the crab and added some lemon-dill seasoning, some lemon zest and juice and some fresh ground black pepper.  I had some bought some extra biscuit dough and decided to use the general idea of the recipe and sauteed some bacon, drained it and added some mushrooms and shallots.  These were also quite delicious.  I think the recipe is a very good, basic recipe.  Thank you to whomever submitted it!

I really wasn't impressed. I made them for Christmas Eve, using king crab legs (like I always do when making crab dip, crab cakes, etc.) and I thought they tasted real fishy. Perhaps they need lemon juice? .

These were excellent! Everyone has raved about them. I used a cupcake pan and filled the filling in that way, but outside of that, I kept everything the same. Delish!

These were good and I'll definitely make again; but I had to make a few changes and they were on the "bland" side.   As others did, I added about 1/4 tsp of red pepper.  I also added some Old Bay seasoning.  Between the two of these, it gave the crab filling a bit more kick. I also used phyllo cups as well.

The mix tastes great, althought I couldn't really taste the crab. I used Athens small phyllo cups and it made for a nice snack lunch for my family. Oh, I also did not have any worchestershire sauce, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of Dale's Seasoning.

Very yum!! I made these last night and they were gone in no time! They were REALLY salty though, which is good for me, but the others thought they needed to be toned down a little bit. I will make these again for sure, but use lower sodium ingredients. Thanks for the recipe! Very yummmmmmmmmy!

Just did a few changes to use things I had on hand. Instead of cocktail sauce, I put 1/3 c of ketchup in a bowl and mixed in 1 tsp of horseradish then added it to the crabmeat and cream cheese. I also didn't have enough crab meat so I thawed out about 10 medium cooked shrimp, cut up and added them to the mix.I used Grand fridge biscuits, rolled them out to about a 5 inch circle, put 2T of mix on one half, folded over and fork sealed the edges. Baked just like the recipes says but it took just a few minutes longer for them to turn golden brown. Very tasty, will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I liked this recipe. It got rave reviews from my friends. I also used the phyllo dough shells. I did everything else exactly like the recipe. I liked it. My husband said it needed some "kick"..maybe some cayenne pepper or minced jalapenos. I will definetly make it again. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is really good & so simple. Made these for Thanksgiving & they all vanished in minutes. I really wanted to try the puff pastry version, but I think I got the wrong thing. I also made the biscuit version & thought they were great. Didn't taste like a biscuit. I think this would be great as a spread too. Thanks!

Great appetizer. I doubled the recipe for 2 super bowl parties and they were a hit.  I couldn't find the mini phyllo cups so I used the biscuit dough and they were fine, I might experiment with something different next time. The filling was also good as is as a spread on crackers. I will be making this again.

Truly a success.  I added a teaspoon of lemon zest, and the paprika was smoked paprika.  And the refrigerated biscuit dough was "cheddar flavored."  YUM-O-LICIOUS!

I added 4 tbs. minced water chestnut for a little crunch and let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight.  I was totally ready to take the other suggestions to put in phylo dough, but I tried it on a cracker first. I found that this is the crab spread I have been searcing for!  With just a little bit of Trader Joe's cocktail sauce, this is AWESOME!

I gave this a 5 for the convenience and overall good flavor, but I didn't really like the packaged flavor of the biscuits, I think it would be better with homemade dough. I couldn't find phyllo cups in my area. I thought the filling was really good, even my sister who hates crab liked them!

Nice presentation and yummy hot or room temperature. I Cut the cream cheese in half, and used one package of phyllo tartlets which made 15 and used up all the filling that I used a sandwich bag to pipe.

All I can say is that these were very bland. I tried with both biscuit dough and Phyllo cups and neither were worth it.

These are a keeper!  I used mini Grands flaky biscuits, torn in half and pressed into 18 regular cupcake tins.  I used krab (fake crab) and it was very flavorful made as written.  I liked the hint of the Worcestershire sauce and the creamy cream cheese.  Even my picky hubs liked this.. I'll make them again.

I made these VERY last minute (as in, I decided to make these when I had just 5 minutes to make and get out the door...) So I skipped the tartlet/baking and simply served the filling with gourmet crackers. That 5 minutes sure paid off! I skipped the Parm, simply because I didn't have the time to putz with grating it, but everything else was pretty spot on (didn't measure). The flavors all blended perfectly together - I may have added about 1.5x the crab called for next time, just so I could enjoy even more crab flavor.

This was average for me.  I used real crab in mine. Too much cream cheese overpowered the taste of the crab and seasonings.

Yummy! I used the frozen phyllo cups and it was super easy. Just put them on a cookie sheet and filled them up. I used the fancy blue crab from the seafood counter that comes in the bigger can (kept the remaining to make crab cakes) and I also added some finely diced red bell pepper for color and crunch. Everyone loved them! Thank you. Will definitely make again.

These got gobbled up.  Though I put the filling into fillo dough cups, subbed garlic for the onions, and put extra crab.  9 oz instead of 6.

This were meh.  They went, but nobody went to crazy for them.  Had a couple myself.  I used the phyllo cups, added Old Bay, squeezed lemon on them after they baked and doubled the crab.  I wouldn't make again.  There are far better recipes out there.

These were great.  I made them ahead of time, froze them and cooked them at the event.  I made some of them with the cream cheese tart crust and some with the pyllo shells, we preferred the crust, but both were great.

I actually added a little bit of chopped shrimp, frozen corn, and sirachi for a bit of heat.  I like it on the biscuit but want to try phyllo cups next time.  Very easy and tasty recipe.

Very good.  Followed directions to a "T" but I think they would be better with a phyllo dough as other reviewers suggested.  The filling is very good.  My kids loved them!

Loved these.  Omitted green onion and used minced onion from a jar instead.  Also, used the phyllo cups per other reviews.  Great party appetizers.

I also used the pre-made pastry cups and they came out great. I made a triple batch and had enough for 3 holiday parties. So easy to make and they reheat easily. Many people asked me for the recipe.

Too much work. Didn't care for the taste of the canned biscuits.  I'd rather make the crab dip/spread/casserole and serve crackers or sliced baguette with it.

This was excellent!  I took it to a party and everyone wanted the recipe.  I followed the crab spread part of the directions exactly except for adding 1t lemon juice as was suggested.  Instead of using the biscuit, I spread the crab mixture over toasted & buttered english muffins and baked them the recommended time.  They didn't look quite done, so I turned the oven up to broil and baked them a few more minutes.  Great Recipe!

These crab puffs are delicious, and easy.  I was really pleased that I used up all of my crab filling and had just the right amount without coming up short or throwing any out.  I added some horseradish (1 tsp.) for extra pep, which is a typical move of mine with seafood.  They were lovely, easy to work with and puffed up to have a nice light puff with creamy filling.

I didn't care for these at all. All I could taste was the cream cheese. It definitely needs some added herbs for flavor. I used the phyllo cups as some suggested, but I doubt that was the problem.  They looked pretty, but I will not make these again.

Super good!  Took others' advice and used the phyllo tartlets in the grocery store freezer isle, for a time saver. (And to be sure we like the filling, before we make them again for New Year's Eve!) Very rich and perfect. I used a small melon baller to portion each scoop into the mini phyllo tartlets. Bake for 20 mins and they're perfect!  I had some filling left over after filling 15 tartlet shells, so I would say you may get 22-25 if you also use the minis?  Just a guess.

Love this recipe! Sooo easy to make and a hit everytime! I used philo cups instead of refrigerated dough. It cuts prep time way down and it eliminates the need for a tart pan.

This recipe is great but I did make some changes. Instead of 1 8 oz pkg of cream cheese I used half. I added 2 cans of crabmeat, added lemon pepper and used tex mex cheese inside and springle some on top. I did use phyllo and rolled it out thin and cut it into circles and put them in muffin tins. Great taste great recipe. I will make them again to freeze and serve around the holidays. TD from Northern Ontario

Never mind the phyllo cups - I'm watching carbs.....put the ingredients in mushrooms!!  Stuffed shrooms.  (I didn't garnish with the paprika). Heat about 10 to 15 minutes or until the cheese looks melted and hot inside.  THE BEST!!!

I used the mini phillo cups. Added 1/2 cup chopped imitation crab for color, flavor, and chunkiness. I used chedder/jack cheese, double the paprika, and a dash of garlic salt. Filled 30 mini cups perfectly and they disappeared quickly at a party.

Delicious and simple!  I took the advice to use the phyllo cups, and used finely chopped red onion instead of scallion and the appetizer was a hit at Thanksgiving. Thank you.

I tried the filling with the pre-made phyllo dough cups.  It wasn't as good as I thought it would be and the flavors didn't meld very well.  Maybe with some recipe tweaking it would be worth eating, but I really wasn't a fan, and I usually love anything like this.

I first tried this over Thanksgiving, and have made them several times since!  (And it's only been a month!)  Everyone loves them!  Like others, I purchased the already-prepared phillo cups.  That helps a lot and makes for a pretty presentation.  I used canned crab meat & low fat cream cheese the first time, but switched to sushi-type imitation crab sticks and full fat cream cheese.  I hate to go that way but they were WAY more flavorful!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe w/ mini phyllo tarts, which were lighter and brought out the crab flavor more so than the dough flavor.

These are delicious.  I used the Athens mini phyllo cups, and they are just the right size for appetizers. I also added Tony Chachere seasoning to the mix before baking.  I keep several of these in the freezer, to use if I'm in a hurry.  Perfect little side dish to boiled/grilled shrimp and pasta.

Recipe was so simple it was almost too simple. I need things to be more difficult! I have a very bad habit of adding my favorite items to recipes. I sauteed the onion, a 1/4 cup of diced green pepper and a finely sliced clove of garlic, added a couple tbsp's of cooked spinach and a couple tbsb's of  cooked diced broccoli spears. Instead of using phyllo cups, I used Pillsbury Crescent roll dough. Each crescent roll made 2 King Crab bites. So, 2 crescent roll packs made 32 bites. These are unbelievably delicious. The Crescent rolls were commented on the most. It was a bit tedious rolling the dough and putting this little things together but it was worth it! Great recipe! Next up is Stuffed Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon with add-ons of course!

Filling is absolutely excellent.  A very quick, easy, and cost-efficient way to impress your friends.  We did not care for the biscuit dough as it overpowered the flavor of the filling, but we are making this recipe for company again this week and will try another recipe for the pastry dough.  I think it would taste wonderful with any pie crust or tart dough.

Fantastic!  Served with Classic She-crab Soup from this site.  So good!  Best appetizer I've ever made.  Did make a few changes.  Used a tub of chive and onion cream cheese because the date was almost up and used mozzarella cheese since I would have had to grate cheddar cheese myself and was running short of time.  Everyone raved and raved about this and the soup.

I made these last year for the holidays and had forgotten how great they were.  I used more crab meat than suggested and put more of the mixture on top.  They were so good I ended up eating most of them myself. (Not all in the same day!)

I used the Mini Fillo Dough Shells. We thought these were okay as something a little different, and would prepare them again if I were making several appetizers, but I would not serve them again as the one and only star of the show. The flavor was a bit bland. If we make them again, I would add something to spice them up a little.

Very easy appetizer when you sub the phyllo shells.  When I first read the recipe, I thought, "Where's the Old Bay?"  I added about 3/4 tsp and a very generous shot of habanero pepper sauce (any hot sauce would do) and the finished product had the kick that I think it needs.  Perfectly fills 30 phyllo cups - 2 packs of them.

I made these for our Christmas party with my own biscuit dough and a mini muffin pan. They were a hit! Then, I needed a quick dip for a club meeting and I used the filling ingredients in my dip crock pot and brought crackers for it and, again, it was a hit!

Added garlic powder (not garlic salt) and seafood seasoning - several tablespoons for spiciness.  Added 2 cans of crab WITH liquid for taste. Thickened with a bit of flour. Used the flaky biscuits & split them in half. GREAT RECIPE for the holidays - went like crazy.  Spice it up with garlic, horseradish, seafood seasoning (Phillips, Old Bay, etc.) - loved the tip of adding cocktail sauce with them.  First batch - tried to pre-cook the biscuit a bit - totally didn't work - overcooked them.  if you cook 15 min on 375 - biscuits NOT lumpy.

I made these for Thanksgiving yesterday and they were sooo yummy!! You can't eat just one!!  used the mini Phillo shells, baked them for about 16 1/2 mins and the put them under the broiler for another minute or so for some extra crispiness and they were perfect! Will definitely use this one often.

I used phyllo cups as others suggested.  I also used Old Bay seasoning... as this recipe mimics traditional Maryland style crab dip.  Came out great.   Making another batch to freeze for Christmas appetizers.

I made this recipe twice. First following the submitter recipe step by steps and the second time I made some changes. First time, I really did liked the recipe reason why I rated 5 stars. But DH and I really like flavors soooo I added 1 tbsp lemon juice, tripled the worcestershire sauce, add 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, salt and pepper and dashes of tsbasco. I also put half salmon and half crab and it was DELICIOUS!!

I used biscuit dough inside of a muffin pan. I like the idea of bite sized little crab cakes, but the filling was horrible. You really only tasted the cream cheese. If I was going to make it again I would add an extra can of crab meat, with some chopped boiled eggs, more cheese, and more spices

These were very easy, but I thought lacked in flavor. I will make again but as others have suggested I will use twice as much crab (real crab, not surimi) and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and maybe up the worcestershire a bit. I used pre-made phyllo cups, as suggested, and thought they left sort of a pasty aftertaste. Next time I will try pre-made puff pastry cups and if still not great, I will use the ref rig. biscuit dough in mini muffin tins. Still a very nice, easy appetizer.

Flavorless.  Needs something to make it special.  If I try it again, I will try the phylo cups.  The biscuits were not so good.

I'm not sure if this is a review or just thanks for the idea - because I had to substitute such a lot.  I started to make it, and realised my cream cheese had gone bad :( so I used mozzarella instead.  Had no green onions, so I used onion powder and minced garlic, and added cayenne for zing.  Added salt because the crab seemed saltless.  BUT the end result was an absolute wow as an appetiser for dinner guests, and the leftover mix I ate all myself on crackers for lunch today.  Almost better that way!  Will definitely make again trying other things, like maybe following the recipe a bit more closely LOL

Loved it!  Big smash at our open house and so easy.  I tried pre-made biscuit dough and crescent rolls.  The biscuit dough was too doughy, but bring on the crescent dough. More than fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing!

I THOUGHT THESE WERE GOOD BUT I USED TUNA INSTEAD OF CRAB. PLUS I USED FAT FREE CREAM CHEESE TO MAKE THEM LOWER IN FAT. NEXT TIME I WILL DOUBLE UP ON THE TUNA.

These were great!  Everyone raved.  I personally thought I should have added some onion powder - meant to, but I forgot. I added a touch of salt and fresh ground pepper, and more onion than it called for - one small bunch to be exact.  I also used PF puff pastry sheets, and a round cookie cutter to make the tart shells.  Crab flavor is very mild. Very good, easy recipe.

Excellent, I did use the phyllo cups, it made a bit more filling. I ended up putting the remainder in a ramekin and dipped crackers in it. The only changes I did was, did not have any green onions, so I used a little onion powder, a little horseradish and a bit of lemon juice. I will make this again for company.

I agree with many that the phyllo shells worked amazingly. I actually baked them with the filling even though the shells are sold fully baked. The second baking did fine. They came out tasty and my guests raved. Looks elaborate, but actually quite simple to put together. I lean toward the spicy side so a bit of cayenne pepper did the trick for me. Great appetizer! Highly recommend!

My guests loved this recipe!

I, too, like other folks, did make some changes, actually omissions, if you will.  

I bought 2 cans of crabmeat, after reading one of the reviews, even though I was going to make only 1/2 the recipe. 

Needless to say, I did, indeed, use both cans of crabmeat, but only used 1/2 of the other ingredients.  I'm glad I did; the additional mayo and cream cheese would have made it 'wetter' than I prefer.

As I do not like the taste or smell of Worcestershire sauce, I omitted it and used Old Bay seasoning, liberally.

Guests liked them better with a sqeeze of fresh lemon.
(Made all 30, had 4 left, before dinner, and I only had 5 guests!)

The phyllo cups were a great idea!  Appetizer looked great!

Will, no doubt, make them again!

Thanks for sharing!!

easy and quick!  We made it three ways, with premade phyllo cups (15 in a package), with pillsbury crescent roll dough and pie crust (premade), all came out good! (was using up refrigerated holiday stuff!) for New Years!  would make them again.

Used mini fillo cups, made about 28. I can understand why some people add lemon or horseradish, they are good  but could use a little more oomph. I think I'll adjust the recipe a tad when I make them again.

I made it with King Crab from Crab Dynasty, which was the cheapest that I found online. It came out great. https://www.crabdynasty.com/products/c11-King-Crab-Legs/

I used the mini phylo shells. I doubled the amount of crab, added a dash of cayenne pepper, and used whatever cheese I had in fridge (a mix of provolone, Romano, and Parmesan).  Everyone at our gourmet club gobbled them up and asked for a copy of the recipe.

These were a huge hit! Used frozen phillo cups and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and folks wanted to know how I made them. I was almost ashamed at how easy they were to make, but they were truly so good, I just accepted their praise! Don't waste the money on fresh crabmeat. You'd never taste the difference with all the cheese.

Huge hit!! I made them with wonton wrapper cups and the only thing I wish was that the bottom of the cups were crunchier.  I also substituted Old Bay seasoning for the paprika. Delicious!!

These were delicious and simple. Only change I made was to use phyllo cups, which made the perfect appetizer for our Christmas Eve party.

I really like this recipe, but found the biscuit dough was, too bready.  I also found I needed a more savoury flavour, added a bit more Worcestershire, tabasco and horseradish. Going to try a phyllo pastry or puff pastry.  I will make it again.

I agree with the majority of reviewers, as is this is bland.  After adding more crab (12 oz), some lemon pepper seasoning (1 tsp)and hot sauce (about 4 shakes) it was much better.  Using the phyllo cups not only cuts the prep time but makes for an attractive display as well.  Will definitely make again with the changes.  This made enough for 30 mini cups with a little left over for us to put in a ramekin and enjoy before the party :)

Made it for a cook out.. they were really a big hit and even as they cooled off they were eaten.  I used the fillo shells instead of the biscuits.

I used the small phillo cups from the frozen food section and I also used the imitation crab and no one knew. Made them for a ladies night card party and there were none left at the end of the evening.

Made this exactly as is except I used mini-phyllo cups.  Made the crab mixture the night before so the flavors were well blended.  I ended up with about 40  cups and they were all eaten by my family and friends within minutes of serving.  Very good and will definitely make again.

I made these as an appetizer for Mother's Day last year. Used the frozen phyllo cups as I saw recommended by others , and prepared the filling as written in the recipe and they were an absolute hit ! Easy to put together and rave reviews from the whole family.

I used wonton wrappers - one per mini cup. Needs more crab. I used two cans and my husband thought it needed another can. Not much crab meat in a can.  These are very good and the wonton wrappers are crunchy. Make sure you let them get golden brown.

I made this recipe baking two packages of 24 Pillsbury Puffed Pastry Shells.  It was faster and easier.  After baking the shells, I then stuffed them with the filling, and put them back in the oven about 10 minutes to warm up the filling. We all liked them, and they were easy to make.

Delicious!!  My husband agreed with a previous suggestion that I should have doubled the crabmeat but I liked it with just the one can.  I didn't want the crab to be overpowering.  Also, I I used phillo cups.  I just love the light, crispy crunch of the phillo shell and would never try this recipe with biscuit dough.  Would definitely make again!  Allow them to cool a bit as the filling is extremely hot.

Like other reviewers, I used phyllo cups which worked out well. Other than that, I made the recipe with no modifications.  We found these to be bland. If I made them again I would definitely double the crab, which you couldn't taste.  I'll be searching other similar recipes for ideas that will add flavor. On the bright side, they were simple and quick to prepare.

We made these with phyllo cups. I really didn't care for them as they cool off quite quickly and I think they really should be served hot. There is nothing wrong with the recipe. I just think it's a personal preference. I will not make again, but someone else might like them more than we did.

Very good recipe.  I put half the filling in mushroom caps and half in biscuit dough.  Also sauted the mushroom stems with garlic and onion and added that to the filling.  The mushrooms were a big hit and a good low carb option.  Thank you for posting the recipe!

The crab dip portion was delicious. I tried this recipe with mini phyllo cups AND the recommended biscuit dough in a shallow tarlet pan. After baking the dip in the biscuit dough, I felt the dough overwhelmed the dip and was a bit doughy. Any recommendations out there?

This recipe was really good, but needed... something. I made them in pre-cooked phillo cups and the crispiness was perfect. If I made them again, I would add a touch of heat. ??

I made the recipe as written, adding slightly more crab meat than called for as suggested by other reviewers. Unfortunately the flavor was bland. This was an expensive appetizer to make and it was the only one barely touched at a recent party I hosted. Most everything else was completely devoured. Not sure I would make this exact recipe again.

Everyone at the party loved them...I froze half the batch and microwaved them for a minute. Popped them onto a plate and they were just as good as the first time!!!

Brought these to a friends house as an app for dinner. While they were easy and looked impressive, I found them to be lacking. They seemed well received at first but there were plenty of leftovers. Overall, just OK.

These were good! I'm going through a crab-loving kick right now, so I've been on the lookout  for really good crab recipes online.

Not a bad recipe.  Could have tried more crab meat and less of the other ingredients.  Really only tasted the cream cheese.  Will try again with a couple of twists.

I doubled the crab as suggested by several others, added lemon pepper and they still didn't taste like much more than cream cheese.  Since I need them for a party I am going to grate Gruyere cheese over the top and add some fresh parsley

I used the Phyllo Cups also as so many others have too, they are easier and taste every bit as good.  I also used 8 oz. of fresh crab from the seafood section of my supermarket.  These are wonderful.

Very good! Did as stated but added more crab (about 7 oz) to make them crabbier. :-) Used junior size flaky biscuits- separating in half was perfect size for mini muffin pan. Done in about 12 minutes. Mixture puffs a bit after baking so don't overfill.

Changes that I made ...
cut the dough into 1/4th's and stretched a bit before putting in the mini muffin pan and filling with 1 tsp of crab mixture ... (which was a little bland) ... IN THE FUTURE (because I will try this again) ... I would add some Old Bay or similar seasoning to my family's taste, just needs a little zip

Next time, I will use the phyllo cups-even w/halving the biscuits, it was too doughy for me. The filling was good, and I liked that using canned crab still made a very tasty app!

Very good. These are phenomenal if you put the filling inmini phyllo tart shells instead of using the biscuit dough.

Tasted yummy but too much bread for me. I like the idea of phyllo cups.  I'll try that next time!

This recipe is very good, but instead of using biscuit dough making tartlets, I added a cup of Panko bread crumbs to the mixture, spooned into mini muffin pan (24)...turns out beautifully!

I liked this recipe, but felt it needed salt and pepper to taste. I wanted to test this recipe as bite-sized portions, so I rolled out the biscuit dough and used a circle cookie cutter for a mini muffin tray instead of tartlet pans.  I also tested it with Cresent croissant dough, which I liked better than the biscuit dough because it wasn't as dense.

These turned out amazing!!!!! They were a big hit at my party. I used canned king  ($10.00) and mini pillo shells (Athens). They turned out just like the picture and were full of tasty goodness!!!

What a great appetizer! I made these for Christmas Eve and used the phyllo cups so I had extra filling which I used for crackers. My husband liked the filling better as a spread for crackers.  Everyone enjoyed both. Thanks for sharing.

Recently served these at a party and everyone raved and wanted the recipe!  I did use flaky biscuit dough and baked them in my muffin pan and they turned out great.  Will try splitting the flaky biscuit dough in half as another reviewer mentioned the next time.
