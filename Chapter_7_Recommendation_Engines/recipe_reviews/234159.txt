Like drinking pumpkin pie but so much healthier and refreshing. I used frozen bananas (I keep in freezer since I do lots of smoothies) and did not freeze the pumpkin. I also increased milk to 2 cups. With the frozen bananas it is still very thick.  Thanks for the recipe! I am always looking for a new smoothie idea that is not full of fats and sugar.

This was really good. Instead of using vanilla extract I used a scoop of vanilla protein powder. Very filling and healthy fall breakfast!

I doubled this recipe. I threw in two raw eggs and used Truvia sweetener instead of brown sugar. One of the best smoothies I have had in a long time--the kids really liked it, too. VERY filling.

Loved it.  We made this for the staff at work and they said by far the best smoothie we've made.  After you make the first one you can add additional sugar, spice and vanilla to taste.  We added just a bit more and it literally tasted like pie in my mouth.  I was originally skeptical when my coworker suggested it, but came to love.  We added a little whipped cream on top with sprikled cinnamon and a cute straw.  Oh yes, the pumpkin was frozen a bit so it made it nice and cold!  perfection.

I used frozen bananas and pumpkin pie spice in place of cinnamon. Would definitely make again! My whole family, including picky kids, enjoyed this one.

This smoothie is amazing!  It is like drinking pumpkin pie, but not as sweet.  It is very filling.  I will be making this one often.

This is a good recipe, but when I made it as-is, it was lacking a bit. I added 2T of Crema Mexicana, (a version of whole cream), and it was PERFECT.

I just made this smoothie tonight and I instantly fell in love. It is AMAZING! I used the exact ingredients and ingredient amounts that the recipe called for, and I will definitely be making this again in the near future. I used vanilla soy milk. The banana really brings out the flavor. So filling, but now I want more!!  I even dressed it up with a little whip cream. My taste buds are jumping for joy!

I combined all of the ingredients except the milk and froze the night before to make it easier in the morning. It was easy & delicious! My toddler keeps asking for more!

It was delicious and filling. I can actually skip the slice of pie for this smoothie.

Absolutely the best! Made it around Thanksgiving with fresh pumpkin and ripe bananas. I'm craving it now but refuse to use can pumpkin. Will have to freeze some next time. Also, did not use sugar and used pumpkin spice in place of other seasoning.

I made this but since I’m lactose intolerant I used my soy milk! Also I was so anxious to try it that I didn’t bother freezing it. I just added about 6 ice cubes and ground them in the blender. I also add protein powder. I have protein powder in individual packets but it probably equates to about 3 tablespoons. I’ve made it twice and both times it was absolutely creamy and delicious!

This is a great tasting healthy smoothie! I did make a few  relatively minor changes. I used  half a frozen banana, omitted the sugar and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, added a 1/2 tsp mixed spice for baking (pumpkin pie spice equivalent), a 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and a scoop of unflavored, unsweetened whey protein powder. The milk I had to double as the smoothie was very thick - but oh so delicious!

Really good. Made with homemade almond milk (2 cups and added 1 cup ice cause two cups made it a bit thin) and fresh roasted pumpkin that is frozen. Added unflavored whey isolate for a nutritious breakfast.

I really dislike it when people change a recipe and then rate it.....but guilty as charged!  I used 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, 1 packet of Stevia instead of the brown sugar, added 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder and some ice cubes.  It proved to be an absolutely delicious and nutritious start to my morning!

We have been trying to have more healthy snacks for the kids and this is not only healthy but also tasty.  We refrigerated the pumpkin and banana but may freeze the banana next time.   It was absolutely delicious!

If you think you will enjoy pumpkin and banana together, I recommend this shake. It has a great texture and did taste a lot like pumpkin pie...but with a hint of banana. I enjoyed it, but might try adding some  nutmeg, clove, or ginger next time to further mask the banana.  Thanks for the recipe, it is definitely a healthy and novel treat!

I would rate this between a 3-4. Instead of using frozen pumpkin, I used frozen banana and added 2 ice cubes for half the recipe. It was better than some other pumpkin smoothies, I have had but don't be expecting an ice cream like or pumpkin pie like flavor, as it's not too sweet. I did have to add considerably more milk also.
