I wasn't too keen on the plain yogurt so I substituted vanilla yogurt. I would HIGHLY suggest using Walkers Shortbread cookies as it's the purest shortbread available - outside of homemade. I garnished my smoothie w/ whipped cream crushed shortbread cookies and a strawberry.  Nice "pick me up" beverage :)

This was a nice quick treat for my daughter. I tasted it as well, and liked the tang. She said it tasted too sour so we added a bit more Truvia. With skim milk the calories come down even more. I would send my husband off to work with this as a quick breakfast. I wouldn't, however, have a 300+ calorie snack.

I used regular sugar instead of splenda.  I did not use the protein powder, but would do so if I had some on hand.

I used nonfat greek yogurt, lowfat milk and Truvia sweetener in this recipe. Not bad, I think it would have been better had I cut back on the yogurt/milk by half. I liked it more than the kids did, they didn't finish their smoothies. The sour flavor of the yogurt was what stuck out the most out of all the other ingredients.

Yum! This is so good. Finally a strawberry smoothie recipe that I love. The only change I made was using 1 cup vanilla yogurt in place of the 2 cups plain due to what I had on hand. Will definitely make again.
