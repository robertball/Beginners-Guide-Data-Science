This is so good! I've made it several times. I bake my Cooke dough a little longer simply bc it does tend to go soft after a few hours. This is a hit every time. I also skip the red food coloring bc it's pretty without it.

This was nice. Hubby loves it and keeps going back for more so that's good. I didn't use the red food colouring as the strawberries made it plenty red itself. Will make again if I have a bunch of strawberries to use up.

I made this dessert for a Bunco party at my house. I went by the recipe posted and it was easy to make and was a hit at the  party.  My crust was a little hard, so next time I probably won't bake it as long. Even with the hard crust, it was still good. I will be making this again.
