I really like this recipe, and it was a huge hit at my party. My only criticism is that it could be a little spicer and I added some shredded cheddar, and it made it even cheesier! The cream cheese is nice for thickening it, but I thought it need a little more "cheese" to it - since all the canned soup took away from it. I threw in some chopped bannana peppers and people were asking for more!

This is a great dip recipe!  I added 2 cans of diced chile's to the mixture and it is just right!

My mom made this for me while I was visiting recently and I couldn't get enough.  It was absolutely delicious!  Great with cubes of french bread.

**EXTRA SPICY VERSION** A girl I work with often brings this in to share with all us co-workers, albeit, her variance is she doesn't use the tomatoes, but just canned peppers and you can get the diced peppers extra hot too.  I have maded it myself and I also like to add a little cheddar to mine.

this is a really good crock-pot recipe as well.  i've used this as a base but i like it with some salsa or taco seasoning in it.  some finely chopped onions are nice as well...and velveeta.

I read other viewers' comments that this was lacking something, but decided to make it as written first.  I made this as written (except that I used frozen chicken instead of canned), tasted it, then added chili powder and shredded cheddar cheese.  I also put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled the top with cheddar cheese and paprika, and put it in the oven for a few minutes just to make it look nice.  When it gets cooked on the stove like the directions call for, it tastes fine but the presentation is sloppy and unappetizing.

A good base, but I will definately make additions next time to keep it from being bland. Perhaps a boullion cube, a packet of mexican seasoning for a mexican flare, or even some cheddar near the end of cooking time.

This was a great base to make hot chicken sandwiches!  I cut up about 4 large grilled chicken breasts and mixed it into this base, added the peppers and a little extra shredded cheese and WOW...great mexican chicken sloppy joes!

I love this recipe! I used Johnsonville hot Italian links (remove the casing) so I did switch proteins but this base is so tasty! I made my own taco chips in a frydaddy....quick and delicious!

Like the others said, this is a good base recipe and had to make my own version. I only used 3/4 of the cream cheese, used cream of mushroom (vs. chicken) and only used 1 can (vs. 2), and added some chopped up jalepenos (or banana peppers or whatever you have to give it a little more kick). Enjoy!

Have you ever had Chicken A La King? This is very similar. I made it for a dip the first time I tried it and liked it but the next time I served it over rice with some broccoli and it was amazing.

I tweaked it just a bit; shredded chicken instead of canned, and also added tabasco and pepper to add a little zing to it. HUGH Hit!!!

Very bland.  To make this more interesting, added cheddar cheese, salsa, hot wing sauce, and chopped jalapenos.  Much improved.

This was okay.  I thought it was decent, my husband didn't like it at all.  I added some ground cayenne pepper to give it a little more flavor.  Probably wouldn't make again.

I follow the recipe exactly and it's always a huge hit at parties. To keep it warm, serve it in one of those tiny crockpots.
