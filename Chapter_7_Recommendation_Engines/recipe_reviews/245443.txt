Re-Edit - Here's how our smoker gets a turkey workout  - in the backyard, up in the mountains while camping off grid,  at my mom's, etc.  Seriously, the easiest turkey recipe ever.  
A few tips - I use Alton Brown's rapid thawing method - In a large cooler.  After dry salt brine is done,  rinse and then submerge the turkey in fresh cool water (in cooler) for about 15 minutes to make sure as much salt is removed as possible.  Remove and pat completely dry.  Do the butter bath and let it sit.  Then if you want you can season with any other spices, fruit, etc you want.  We like unadulterated turkey with just the butter bath post dry salt brine. But regardless if you season or not...Be prepared for the best turkey you've ever tasted!

*****TIP on temping***** Do yourself a favor and go out and buy (got mine off Amazon) a dual probe wireless meat thermometer. Long pointy one goes into the thickest part of the thigh. Short stubby one goes in your hot box (oven, grill, smoker) there will be a little clip to attach it to the rack. Set the temps (hot box, and meat ) and then you're free to walk away...kinda.  You'll still need to keep an eye on the water pan and replenish as needed in your smoker.  I love smoking but hate babysitting the smoker for 5+ hours.   The wireless thermometer allows me "some" freedom.  Happy Smoking!  :D

We made this for Fatherâ€™s Day. My husband wanted to cook outside and we thought it would be a good way to experiment with his Acorn Charcoal Cooker I got him for his birthday. He made sure that the coals were perfect temperature and I seasoned the turkey the way I like it. I made a rub of sage, rosemary, crushed garlic, olive oil and salt. I make little holes in the skin and stuff it under the skin. Then I rubbed the outside with olive oil and sprinkled Tones rosemary garlic seasoning on it. I put a sliced orange, onion and lemon  into the turkey cavity and placed the whole thing in the roasting pan with a foil tent. We also put an extra pan of water and blueberry ale in the cooker. We followed this recipes instructions for cooking and it was absolutely amazing! I loved how juicy and tender the meat was and the flavor was incredible! I had invited my parents and sisters and their families for dinner ( which might have been crazy because we had never attempted to smoke anything!) but Wow! We got rave reviews from everyone! My brother in law actually said he might have found something he likes better than fried turkey! Then everyone wanted to inspect the Acorn and wanted to know about this recipe. I have a feeling my family members are going to be purchasing an Acorn in the future and logging into Allrecipes for this turkey recipe! It was a great day and I really enjoyed the cooking time spent with my husband because we just sat together (making sure the temperature stayed corr
