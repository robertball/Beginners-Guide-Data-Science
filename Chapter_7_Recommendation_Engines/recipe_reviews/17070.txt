Having very little experience with this sort of sauce, I was a little nervous. It turned out wonderful. I also only used 2 cups milk, and real bacon. First I cooked the bacon, then cooked some onions in the bacon grease... After that I followed the recipes pretty much as is except less milk, and at the end added the bacon and onions back in. We put this sauce, chicken, and  asparagus in a crepe and it was AWESOME. My 8 years old loved it!!

Really versatile, and so delicious! I always use extra-sharp Cheddar and real bacon for maximum flavor. I have this on a baked potato. Love it! Thanks, Michelle!

After adding flour to butter to make the roux allow it to cook a few minutes to avoid it tasting like flour.  Good basic cheese sauce ~ add more or less milk to make it thinner as a dip or thicker as a sauce

The submitter of this recipe indicated it would be good over pasta so that's how I served it. I decided to cook real bacon instead of using bacon bits, but otherwise followed the recipe. It's really good over pasta. Bacon mac & cheese anyone?!

As this recipe stands it's a 3 but I made some changes which turned it into something my family want again. I used only 2 cups of milk as I'd read reviews about it being runny. I used real bacon and added in some chives, some leftover chicken and some mushrooms. I filled crepes with the result and it made a good dinner. Thanks for the starting point.

It's good.  But it is alot like cheese soup.  My husband loved it over a filet.
