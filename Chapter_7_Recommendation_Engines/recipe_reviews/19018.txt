This really is velvety and delicious--an excellent no cook custard-style ice cream. Be sure to beat your egg yolks for 1-2 minutes, until they are light and fluffy, before continuing with the recipe, which will help ensure the very best consistency of the ice cream. Knowing that using all heavy cream can result in a greasy mouth feel, I substituted half and half for 2/3 c. of the cream, tho' milk could just as easily have been used. To intensify the flavor I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp. vanilla, and a pinch of salt. For the chocolate, I added small chunks of a good quality semi-sweet chocolate bar during the last minute or two of churning. Just perfect.

The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because this is much more like chocolate mousse than ice cream.  It is delicious and we added mini marshmallows and nuts.  I also added more cocoa powder which I'm glad I did.

O.k. I take back the four stars and gave it five because after leaving it overnight in the freezer, this was some of the best ice cream I've ever had!  Soooooooooo good!

This is the BEST. So very rich and creamy. You could use 1/2& 1/2 and it would still be very rich.

all I can say is, WOW!! this recipe is so simple and the outcome is just as promised. I didn't have any ice cream maker but the ice cream turned out just fine. What I did was to whip the cream a little bit, then add the chocolate+sugar+egg mixture. Froze it in the fridge overnight and voila! Homemade chocolate ice cream. The taste is excellent and you'll never go wrong with this recipe. Thanks for sharing :)

I made this last night, it was the first time I tried my new Ice Cream maker. My family loved it!!! I used egg beaters instead of raw eggs and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and mini choc. chips, next time I think I will try the heavy cream and grated chocolate. Thank you!!

DEEElicious! I often will use straight evap milk-altho cream yields a creamier result and always sub in egg beaters for the yolks (I have little kids). I dump all ingredients into my blender (so I don't have to use a hand mixer, it incorporates the cocoa better and turns the chocolate to tasty tidbits)--give it a mightly whirl and pour into my ice cream machine for divine results!YUM! Thanks for an awesome recipe! Don't be afraid to jack up the cocoa amount if you are a chocoholic. =0)

I was looking for a fast ice cream recipe that didn't need to be cooked and could be converted to sugar free.  This was wonderful.  I used splenda instead of sugar and left out the chocolate chips.  Superb!!

LOVED IT!  I am going to try 1/2 & 1/2 next time, just because.  Also, I used pasturized egg product (carton in dairy section) because raw egg grosses me out.  Turned out great!

I really hate adding raw egg yolks but this was fabulous. Tastes like chocolate mousse. I will definitely make again. Would be fabulous with bits of brownie in it!

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  So silky and smooth and even with all that cream, no greasy mouthfeel.  It hardens nicely and doesn't get icy.  My biggest complaint about store bought ice cream is that it is often too sweet.  That is not the case with this recipe.  The chocolate level is perfect is you use good quality cocoa.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of salt, which is the secret to perfect chocolate ice cream.

This is delicious. I used 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup of milk, and used egg beaters. It was really velvety, and sooo chocolatty. It is really hard to find a recipe that dosn't give you that filmy feeling in your mouth, and this one dosn't. Next time I will put in toasted almonds.

I used my ice cream maker for the first time and was greatly impressed with this recipe.  The texture, flavor, and consistency was perfect.  The only change I made was to double it.

An excellent recipe, especially for those who have just gotten their ice cream machines and are looking for a basic recipe to start with.
I changed it a bit, fearing that using the whole 2 2/3 cup of heavy cream would be too rich. I only used 2/3 c cream and 2 c half and half. It tasted wonderful. I also omitted the choclate chips simply because it is rich enough on its own without added chocolate. It reminded me of the chocolate soft serve you can get at a popular fast food place. Exact same flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper, perhaps next time I will add some mint extract, or perhaps some almonds and marshmallows.

Yummy! We have tried several chocolate recipes with our ice cream maker, including the two in the instruction manual, all of them have been nasty, gritty, eggy or lumpy. This one is awesome.  The taste was good and the texture good. I love not having to cook the mixture. 
Very Impressed!

i chose this recipe because i always have cocoa powder. the first time i made it i didn't print out the recipe and ended up using the wrong measurements! i used a half cup of cocoa and a cup of sugar and i didn't add the chocolate chips and it was GREAT! the second time i used dark chocolate cocoa and added the chocolate chips and it was totally different (but i should have realized everytime i substitute dark chocolate i end up with a totally different texture in whatever i'm making). then i made it again using my first screw up with the 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 c. cocoa and it was good again. the altered version has made it into my cookbook!

GREAT recipe!! I've made this several times and have noticed that unless you scrape the bowl many times during the mixing process, the choclate doesnt mix all that well. And you HAVE to add the cream painfully slow as you mix, stop and scrape, mix and add cream, stop and scrape. It seems like it takes forever (because the ice cream is so good it's painful to wait for!), but its worth it because you wont have a glop of chocolate at the bottom of the bowl when you pour the mix in the ice cream maker. And when I process the chocolate chips, I leave them kinda chunky becuase its fun biting into the chocolate when you eat the ice cream! I'm pretty sure that this recipe would be AWESOME with extra stuff like oreos, toffee bits, mini marshmallows, maraschino cherries, etc!

So good, so creamy, so simple.  I love dark chocolate, so I grated a bar of Ghirardelli 60% cocoa.  It complimented the milk chocolaty-ness of the ice cream.  It was still delicious after 4 days.  Could've been longer, but I ate it all.

I have never made an egg based ice cream before, not to mention a RAW egg based ice cream. I was a little scared. I wondered if we'd all die of food poisoning. I threw caution to the wind, though. Mostly because I'm too lazy to heat it all up. I took a deep breath, pulled up my sleeves, and made a double batch with a full cup of cocoa powder, a teaspoon of salt, and two tablespoons of vanilla. After we'd frozen it, I took my first bite, and my whole culinary world changed. I was in taste bud heaven! I found chocolatopia! I heard the Hallelujah Chorus coming out of my ice cream container! I have NEVER had ice cream SO good, SO perfectly chocolate and creamy, and SO SO SO (!!!!) addictive! You can throw anything in there with it, and it'll be fantastic! I will say this, though...and I really really mean it...add the salt. It isn't going to have the same life altering effect on you without it. I will never EVER buy ice cream again.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and used 4 cups whipping cream and 1 1/3 cup 1% milk. Substituted a dark chocolate bar for the chips. Yummy.

Great recipe!  I added a little vanilla.  I don't know if this improved the taste, because this was my first time making this, so I can't compare.  But it definately won't be my last time making this!!!!

Great recipe, I added a couple of scoops dark chocolate cocoa powder and ran about 1/3 of a cup of almonds through the food processor for about 2 seconds and added them.

My sister bought me the Kitchen Aid Ice cream attachment for my Kitchen Aid mixer. I've been dying to make homemade chocolate icecream and came across this recipe. OH MY GOD!!! THIS IS THE BEST HOMEMADE ICECREAM THAT I EVER TASTED!!! This was my very first time making icecream and I gotta say WOWOWOWOW!!! I love how it taste. I added brownie bits along with Doves fudge sauce to the icecream as it was mixing just to give it a little kick ( I love brownies and fudge sauce) and it tasted even better. Even without the sauce and brownies it still taste GREAT!!! This recipe is a definite keeper!!! 10 stars for sure!!!

Creamy, rich, delicious...I could continue gushing with one adjective after another to describe this fabulous ice cream; I can certainly understand why the word velvet is in the name. I shaved good quality dark chocolate into the mix instead of chocolate chips.  My family is pretty fond of the chocolate ice cream I have been making for years, but I think that this one may have gone to the top of our list!

Fantastic!! As suggested, put in 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of 1/3.  Also, added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and 3 tbsp of Kahlua.  (Alcohol is said to help the ice cream keep better in the freezer.)

WOW!!  How can you not say great things about this recipe?!  I wone first prize at a "churn off" at the hospital I work at during our annual employee picnic.  I veered from the recipe a bit based on other feedback.  I, too, used egg beaters.  I also combined it all the ingredients in the blender to mix them.  I used Baker's semi-sweet chocolate and grated 1 square using a microplane grater...made the chocolate very fine and incorporated it wonderfully!  I then added the grated chocolate to the other ingredients.  The end result was just like chocolate velvet....smooth & creamy!!

Incredible! I doubled the recipe. For the cream, I used mostly heavy cream and about 1/3 half & half. It is still plenty rich and creamy! I also added extra cocoa (probably 2-3 Tablespoons more) and skipped the chocolate chips. For those who like lots of chocolate, I will serve with chopped gourmet chocolate on top of the ice cream. I just got it out of my ice cream maker and it hasn't gone into the freezer yet to harden, but I had to have some. It is so good! This one is a keeper!

I scaled this down to use in my "pint" machine....and I can honestly say this recipe gave Hagen Dazs chocolate/chocolate chip a run for it's money.  YUMMY and so super simple.  Thanks a billion!

I added Andes Creme De Menthe chips to the recipe and a small amount of peppermint extract. I used my electric ice cream maker. It was fabulous.

Made a double batch for a BBQ this weekend and it was WONDERFUL. I added all of the ingredients but the chocolate and heated it to 170. Then added mini chocolate chips, which melted just fine. At the end of the ice cream maker cycle I added an additional 1/3 c. of mini chocolate chips which gave it a little something extra. Excellent recipe, definitely a keeper.

So creamy and delicious! I made this with my Kitchenaid ice cream maker and it turned out heavenly. Next time I will add a fudge sauce or brownish chunks...possibly both. it's truly fantastic without the additions though.

Creamy, smooth and rich.  I made the recipe with the ingredients just as written but I did take another reviewers advice and simply put all the ingredients in a blender and gave it a good long whirl, scraped the sides with a spat and whirled it again.  Ice cream turned out perfectly and it is even better after curing in the freezer overnight.

This was the first time we made home-made ice cream and it came out pretty good!  This is very rich and chocolaty! I would describe it as eating a frozen chocolate truffle- very decadent!

The texture was divine!  Aptly named, this ice cream is absolutely smooth and velvety. It reminds me quite a bit of the Baskin Robbins flavor "Chocolate Mousse Royale" that they no longer make. I did think it was a little eggy and not quite chocolatey enough, but overall, a pleasure to eat.

I received a kitchenaid stand mixer with a kitchenaid ice cream attachment at my bridal shower last week. I was eager to try out an ice cream recipe and I settled on this one. I only had 2 cups of cream so I subbed whole milk for the extra 2/3 cup the recipe called for. I did a mix of chopped up semisweet chocolate chips and nuts (instead of just chocolate chips) that I put in the ice cream maker during the last 2 minutes of mixing. It was pretty good straight out of the ice cream maker, but it was exceptional after freezing over night. Very creamy and delicious, but not overly heavy at the same time. Everybody should try this! It's so easy that even a 1st timer can do it. Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I tried to make chocolate ice cream....and it came out great!!! Tasted very expensive and rich...I substituted just 1/3 cup of cream for milk for a bit less greasiness, and added 1 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of salt. Used 2 bars of Hershey's Special Dark chopped up and put into ice cream maker last few mins. of churning. Was very chocolatey and will make again!!! Thank you!!!

Soooooo rich and creamy!!  I used 2 cps heavy cream &  2/3 cp half/half. I increased the cocoa powder to a 1/2 cp for a more intense chocolate flavor. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 Tb of Kahlua. I finely-grated Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate Bar into icecream mixture in the last 5 minutes of churning. If eaten like softserve it tastes like chocolate mousse with a more subtle chocolate flavor. When frozen more firmly the next day all the rich flavors of cocoa, cinnamon, and Kahlua blend together for an unbelievably smooth and creamy treat!

I couldn't make myself use the full amount of cream.  I used 1 cup of cream and made up for the rest with skim milk.  The soft serve came out so heavenly.  Not too sweet with strong cocoa flavor.  When I let this ripen in the freezer, it froze solid.  Next time I'll add some coffee liquer so it won't be so hard.  Still tasted good though.

This is a great recipe.  It can be easily changed to make vanilla or strawberry ice cream.  Omit cocoa and chocolate chips.  Add vanilla flavoring or strawberry jam - it's great.

Excellent.  Haven't had ice cream in a long time due to lactose intolerance.  Luckily I don't have any problem with heavy cream.  This ice cream is great.  Smooth and velvety.  If you use your ice cream maker, it will churn for a long time due to the high fat content.

Fantastic!  Smooth, rich, every bite was so tasty!  You might think about regular cream instead of heavy cream - healthier and yields ice cream that is lighter in consistency.

Loved it! Best recipe for homemade ice cream. I used 1/2 heavy cream & 1/2 whole milk and it was great. I think the recipe is pretty flexible that way. We also loved adding chopped almonds to it! A great dessert!

I have used this recipe for years. Came back to get a 2nd print the first is so well worn I can barely read it. Variations work well with this recipe too. I have done strawberry, raspberry, vanilla, chocolate chip, and today I am making fresh peach. I am sure you will love this one!

Super!  Used half and half instead of heavy cream; didn't seem to detract from the flavor at all.  Chopped up Butterfingers instead of chocolate chips. This recipe will clearly stand on its own or support any additions (I'm going to add chopped brownies next time!)

Very good, rich and creamy.  Followed the recipe exactly, next time I will probably leave out the chocolate chips, not sure they are essential to the taste.  We really enjoyed this - thanks for sharing.

Smooth, chocolately, but not as dark-colored as store bought ice cream. Rough chopped a mix of semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips in the chopper, then placed in refrigerator to chill. Added 2 Tbsp cocoa to the original cocoa-sugar blend, and a pinch of salt. Liquid was 1/2 whipping cream, and 1/2 half-and-half. Chilled the mixture for half hour, then churned for a total of 18 minutes. Added the chocolate in the last 3 minutes.   Made 1 and 1/4 quarts, if you use the quart-size chinese take-out soup containers. It's chilling in the freezer again to harden. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

AMAZING. Best ice cream  you will ever make. I've tried so many recipes and they've all failed in the taste or texture category. This was great. I had difficulty getting to firm, but I think that's because my machine has trouble with every recipe.  I told everyone I know how I made delicious ice cream. I added two teaspoons of vanilla extract and I used a mix of chocolate, white chocolate and butterscotch chips for a total of 2/3 cup chips. So good. I'm eating right now as I review.

This was the first ice cream I made with my Kitchenaid ice cream attachment, and it was AWESOME!  Next time I'll add a little more cocoa.  I recommend you use the best chocolate possible for the chips, I chopped up some Special Dark Hershey bars into chunks this time, and the quality of the ice cream's chocolate flavor really cried for a more high-end chip when tasted together.

I'm not a big fan of uncooked eggs....so I warmed the sugar, cocoa, 1 2/3 cup f/f half and half until it was almost ready to boil...I beat the eggs until foamy and then added them a little at a time while whisking..I had no clumps and the eggs cooked...added vanilla, 1 tsp salt . let it cool in the fridge until cold...whipped 1 cup heavy cream with a sprinkle of cinnamon and folded it in...added both to my 4 cup capacity ice cream maker and voila...awesome ice cream!!

DELICIOUS!!!! This is by far my favorite homemade ice cream recipe!  I did overflow so I would cut back the heavy cream just a tad.

Family did no care for mousy taste so it was no eaten well. I think I may have not  put the right amount of cream since I doubled it and it came out with about 8 servings instead of 16 so it might be a 5 if I did not mess up.

Wow! I was a tiny bit skeptical that I would not like the consistency, but on the contrary, it was heavenly!! Extrordinarily smooth- Unlike any other airy ice cream I've had.  
I omittted the chocolate chips and it was by far sweet enough, very rich too!! An Aboslute keeper.

***UPDATE:  
I also made a sugar free version of this using splenda and it was very very good.  Not nearly as rich as the original, I would have liked a stronger taste ( more splenda? cocoa? not sure) but I will definitely make sugar free again too!

This is now my goto chocolate ice cream recipe. Doesn't make a lot, but then this is so rich that one can't eat that much at a time anyway. I recommend sifting the cocoa into the sugar if your cocoa is the least bit lumpy.

This recipe was really fantastic tasting. I was, as many others, disappointed with the consistency. I took the advice of some other reviews and froze the ice cream over night. This made a dramatic difference. I also added a little vanilla a inch of salt to the recipe. Rather than using the chocolate chips I chopped up some chocolate covered almonds I had been given as a gift and added them into the mixture towards the end of the ice cream machine cycle. It tastes like I got from an ice cream shop!

Fabulous!  I was nervous about raw egg, so I cooked it as I did other ice cream recipes... just to 170.  I don't know if it was the use of the mixer, but this was by far the best homemade ice cream I've made!  Perfect consistency and smoothness! I used all half and half instead of heavy cream.

This recipe was SOOO yummy. I tried to blend the chocolate chips in the blender (my chopper broke) and that did not work at all, so I just threw the chocolate chips in as is. I also added a half cup of almond slices into the ice cream while turning and it came out great!!! I will do it again but with less chocolate chips

I think this is a good starting point, but I havent found a way to 'perfect' it just yet. Made just as, it was just too sweet to me, and I've got a sweet tooth. I've made it a few more times doing different things-less cocoa, more salt, etc etc...and still not there. Until another reviewer can find the thing that tops this recipe off, I might have to venture off with my search for the ultimate homemade chocolate ice cream.   Thanks though, sooo close!

I made this ice cream to rave reviews at my birthday party. I utilized pasteurized egg yolks (had to make them myself), and then about 2 minutes before it was done added in some brownie bits (also homemade).  I will make this again!!

The cream cream had really great flavor! I used brown sugar instead of white, and added peanut butter, and it gave it a rich flavor. But the heavy whipping cream made it TOO fluffy.   I should have thought to cut down the whipping cream and perhaps halved it with whole milk or half and half.   Again, great flavor, but I'll probably be using this as a whipped topping on top of brownies this time.

I loved the airy, marshmallowy texture of this quick ice cream.  I felt better about using a pasteurized egg product, as another reviewer suggested, rather than use raw eggs.  It wasn't quite chocolaty enough for me!  I will add more cocoa next time.  My husband loved it as is though.

This ice cream was great! I did add some really good quality white chocolate that I chopped up as well and it's fabulous! I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla, but I think next time I'll leave it out. It really doesn't need it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Uh-oh... I could see how this could become addicting. It is absolutely wonderful and so easy to make.  I chose to increase the cocoa as other reviewers had suggested and also added a splash of vanilla.  I used 2/3 cup half and half and the rest heavy cream.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I finely grated some of the chocolate and some I left as slightly larger chunks, the size of mini morsels. Decadent!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This ice cream is amazing!!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 and it turned out great.  It reminds me of Cold Stone ice cream.  I'm sure it would be a great base ice cream to add other toppings into and experiment.

Wonderful recipe!!  

The last time we made it, I ran out of cocoa.  I used 1/2 cocoa and 1/2 chocolate-flavored Carnation Instant Breakfast.  We liked the more subtle chocolate flavor better, so we're keeping that alteration.

I used 3 whole eggs and half cream/half milk as recommended by one reader.  I was disappointed by the lack of intense chocolate flavor.  Next time, I may double the cocoa.  Otherwise the flavors were good.

I used half-n-half instead of heavy cream, because I had none. Also, I grated semi-sweet cooking chocolate and a (partial) bar of good quality lindt chocolate, because I had no chips. In the end, I didn't like the texture of the grated chocolate much (though otherwise it was grand). It was too gritty for my taste. I think next time I would either melt the chocolate into the cream before adding, to make the whole thing smooth, or I would chop the chocolate coarsely. Otherwise, this is a  fine recipe. It's going in my recipe box.

This ice cream is so delicious. It really does taste velvety. I had it at my brother's house and plan to buy an ice cream maker just so I can make this myself. So yummy! I can still taste it . . . yum!

Family loved this.  I did sub the chocolate chips with mint chocolate chips which worked great.  Will be making again.  UPDATE I have made this recipe again several times minus the chips as family was wanting just chocolate ice cream.  However I have been adding a small amount of vanilla extract.  It is over the top good.

This is our go-to chocolate ice cream recipe.  I make my mixture in my blender.  I blend it up, throw it in the ice cream maker and let it spin.  LOVE IT:)

This is in a league of its own.  I have made this several times and found that it works best when using heavy cream or heavy whipping cream. I can freeze the leftovers, set it out for a few minutes, dig in, and it is still so soft.  I have attempted with half & half as well as whole milk as other reviewers suggested, but found that the result is not as velvety and freezes with more of a fine ice particle consistency.  Both options taste good, but the heavy stuff gives you that velvet richness.

I found this is a good base for whatever you want to put in your ice cream. I'm a fan of the ben and jerry's ice creams, so I make my own like them, starting with this recipe then adding things like brownie or caramel.

made this ice cream last night, I may add thi is the first ice cream I've ever made. After watching Alton Brown's show "Good Eats" on You Tube I made a few minor changes. I added a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon of unflovored gelatin on top of 1/4 cup of the cold mixture (in a separte cup), then heated up 1/4 cup of the mixture in the microwave so that it was very warm and added to the gelatin mixture and stirred until mixed, then added the gelatin mixture back into the cold ice cream mixture before adding to the ice cream maker. I was hoping to eliminate any ice crystals from forming creating an icy ice cream as well as making it scoopable. This worked perfect, I am making a lemon sorbet today using the same method .I also added Scor pieces and pecans....awesome ice cream !

Absolutely delicious!!!  Pumped up the cocoa powder a little bit as I did not have any chocolate chips.  Also used 2 c heavy cream and 2/3 c half and half per another review.  Chilled the mixture overnight and froze it for about 8 hours after churning in the ice cream maker.  Hubby and kids loved it.

This is the 5th ice cream recipe I made with my new ice cream maker. By far the very best ice cream. It truly is like velvet. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using chopped Kisses instead of chocolate chips.

It tastes like fudge pops. :) I throughly enjoy fudge pops, so that's wonderful, but if you don't...I used half and half instead of heavy cream, so that might have mad the difference. I find it delicious! :) *****

one of my favorite ice cream flavors is chocolate mousse from baskin robbins (right after pralines & cream) so I was looking for something similar but still not expecting it to be the same. I was right because I loved this but it is different from what i had in mind. baskin robbins' ice cream has more chocolate and is more chewy. I wonder if adding another egg yolk would make this more chewy and elastic. I used whipping cream instead of heavy cream. I'm not sure about the difference but I can't find heavy cream where I live so I used regular whipping cream (30% fat). the only thing I would change is add more chocolate because I like my chocolate ice cream very chocolaty and use maybe more cocoa powder or more grated chocolate. 

it was also very rich and very creamy so maybe next time when in the mood to cut a few calories i'll try this with half whipping cream and half half-and-half (or light whipping cream - 15% fat) but i'm not sure, since adding the chocolate might change the taste anyways.

This is so unbelievably easy and excellent.  It's my first recipe with an ice cream maker. Thanks to the other reviewers, I adapted the recipe to lower the fat content and increase the sugar and chocolate. I used 2 cups half and half and 2/3 c 2% milk, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa powder.  I was hesitant to use the grated semi-sweet chocolate chips, but did and don't regret it. I added them in the final 10 minutes. Out of the ice cream maker it is velvety smooth with a bit of crunch, and spatula-licking-good, just like soft serve.  I will be having the official taste test after an overnight freeze.  Make this recipe!

This recipe has spoiled me!  This was the first time I ever produced homemade ice cream.  Now any other recipe I try does not compare!  I even created a vanilla recipe and a mocha based on these ingredients.  My family loves it!  Of course my hips may say otherwise- it's worth it!

Super easy, really amazing homemade ice cream!  Included a shot of Kahlua and finely ground up peanut butter chips with nuts.  My husband loved this- we gilded the lily by pouring on melted dark chocolate truffle.  Took the previous reviewers' advice and mixed the ingredients via blender, let it sit in the refrigerator to set for a few hours, and then blended with the ice cream attachment on my KitchenAid.  Amazing soft serve and even better after it ripened in the freezer for a few hours!

This is the best chocolate ice cream ever.  I did double the cocoa as others suggested, but I think I will only do 1/2 cup cocoa next batch.  My husband and kids love it and want me to make it again.  I will never have to buy ice cream again.  The whole reason I wanted to make my own was because I couldn't hardly find any ice creams without high fructose corn syrup or partially hydrogenated oils in it.

If you like frozen custard this is IT!  OMG it was so good!  It reminds me of a place back East, Culver's.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe!  It was soooooo good!  NEXT I'm going to try adding other things to the chocolate ice cream other than the chips.

I'm rating it 4 stars because I had to alter this in order for it to turn out properly. I cut down the cream to just 2 cups and then substituted 2/3 cups of whole milk to make up the difference. I increased the amount of cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and added about 1 tsp of salt and vanilla extract to help bring out the flavor.

I also decided to make this with just an electric hand mixer. Instead of chilling in the refrigerator, I put the well-beaten mixture into the freezer for about 2-3 hours and made sure to beat it very well afterward. I repeated this two more times (basically until it got to the soft-serve stage) before finally allowing it to sit in the freezer overnight. It turned out wonderful! I will make this again with the alterations, but this is a very good base to work with otherwise!

Good ice cream; very creamy, smoothy.  I thought it could use a little more sugar, a pinch of salt, and a lot less cream.  As the instructions directed, I used an electric mixer to combine the ingredients and slowly added the cream.  This does indeed produce a very mousse-like texture.  I would replace a cup of the cream with a cup of milk and would not beat the mixture.  I would also add 1 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup, and add a pinch of salt.

I've never been much of a chocolate ice cream fan, but for a very special dinner I was serving homemade chocolate cake and homemade vanilla ice cream (used Alton Brown's Serious Vanilla Ice Cream recipe), so I thought I'd accommodate ALL the guests by offering a chocolate ice cream as well.  It was SOOOO rich and smooth. Used 2/3 cup cocoa powder, an additional 4 tablespoons of sugar, and had only 2/3 cup heavy cream in the fridge so I made up the difference with 1/2 and 1/2.  For silky, chocolate-y goodness, this is a keeper. My guests went ga-ga over it. Thanks for sharing!!

The ice cream was very good but we didn't care for the grittiness of the chocolate chips.  We feel it would have been better had they been left whole. Thank you JKINFLA for sharing a very good recipe!

Very good.  We didn't have heavy cream, so we substituted with milk/butter.  Came out great!

This is very good ice cream. I haven't used another chocolate ice cream recipe since. I'm  going to make it into rocky road ice cream next time. :))

Delicious!  I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and 2/3 cup of half & half, but only because that was what I had.  I also used almost 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and still thought it could handle more.  I made mine more rocky road, adding mini marshmallows and chopped almonds.  I will definitely make this again - so velvety smooth and delicious.

My roommates and boyfriend LOVED this! I thought it was pretty good as well.  :)  I made one small change that I think made a difference.  I had leftover dark chocolate from Italy (I don't eat choc straight up very often), so I grated that and mixed it in, instead of using semi-sweet chips as suggested.  I also think this makes more than one quart as my 1.5 quart maker was quite full at the end of the freezing process.

One of the best chocolate ice creams I have ever had!  It tastes very similar to Parlour brand ice cream, but without all the chemicals!  I omitted the grated chocolate and added a few teaspoons more cocoa instead - it was heavenly without it and I thought I'd save a few calories, but I ended up pouring chocolate fudge all over it later anyway LOL.  Delicious!!!

Amazing! It was so creamy and light. I have a kind of cheap ice cream maker and the ice cream always seems to come out with ice crystals in it. With this recipe it was incredible. Extremely rich and yummy.

Delicious, smooth, light chocolaty flavor ...  I subbed in 1 cup half & half (fat free) for 1 cup of the cream.  Used a fine sieve to strain the mixture as I poured it into the ice cream maker.

This turned out great!! Used no fat half and half. I am sure the consistency and richness is better with the heavy cream, but for fat free it was pretty good.

This recipe was pretty good. The first time I made it I did not have any semi-sweet chocolate chips. It tasted fine. The second time, I added it the chips. I thought it was a little too chocolate-ty for my taste. I will probably make this one again, because chocolate ice cream is my all-time favorite.

This recipe was very easy to follow and easy to prepare.  The ice cream was smooth, creamy and not tooo chocolatey.  It was more of a pudding texture.  Delicious!  I'll make it again.

Used this in my Cuisinart 1 1/2 qt electric ice cream maker last night. We LOVED it! We ate some when it was done, and then put the rest in the freezer to firm it up. I made this just as the recipe said, but used Dutch processed cocoa.

in a word:  mmmmm.  my daughter works at baskin robbins and agreed it was heavenly.  per a friend's recommendation, i added 1/4 c. more cocoa powder.  she was spot on abt that.  what she did NOT tell me, however, is to be prepared to have cocoa flying all over your kitchen once you take the mixer to the cocoa part of the recipe.  NOT a fun job to clean up, but the end result tasted fab!

Mmmmm!  Smooth & creamy, a wonderful chocolate flavor.  I did make the change of using 1/2 half and half & 1/2 heavy cream since that's what I had on hand.

Will definitely make again.

Excellent flavor, and not much bother to put together.  It was not quite enough to fill a 1 quart ice cream freezer, so I will be increasing the quantities in proportion.

Recipe as written is good, but next time I will use 1/2 c. Cocoa, and add some salt and vanilla.

This is the best ice cream. It is so smooth and velvety, the name is perfect. I've made it several times because it is my go to now. Its rather simple to make to. I've tried to use half and half as some people suggested but its not as smooth as just heavy cream (of course). That was the only modifiation I've tried and went back to the original. Absolutely recommend this one.

This was fabulous!!! I went with my better instinct and per manufacturer's recommendation when having to cook anything before adding-- I let it chill OVERNIGHT. It was perfect. My 4 y/o could help me with this. We let it chill overnight and the next night we made ice cream for dessert. The first night it was like soft serve. After I put leftovers in an airtight container overnight it was firmer but it hard. It was just like store bought ice cream only creamier! Being Christmas just passed and we are stocked up on chocolate right now, I chopped up some chocolate to add at the very end for a little crunch. That was the only "change" I made! But seriously- if you have an issue with it not thickening, LET.IT.CHILL.OVERNIGHT! So worth it.

i was hesitant about the eggs, but decided to try it. OMG , I was so glad I did. like silk. I doubled the recipe and added 3 tbsp. malt powder, used my Whynter ice cream freezer{no freezing bowl in between batches} to make chocolate malted . In 35 minutes  each batch,we had enough for a chocoholic's birthday dinner. everyone raved! this one goes right in my recipe file .

After mixing the ingredients, I put in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to chill.  Instead of chocolate chips, I added Heath toffee bits in the last couple of minutes of churning.

The name says it! This is absolutely divine, rich chocolate flavor, not sugar-y sweet & superb texture.  I did sub half & half as I do not care for the "greasy tongue" you get from heavy cream, also added the review suggested pinch of salt.  Even with half & half, it is rich & creamy.  Thanks for an excellent ice cream--this will be my go-to for chocolate!

Best chocolate ice cream -oh my goodness!  Wish I had egg beaters but didn't so used real eggs.   I'm sure we'll be fine.  Only had 2 c of heavy cream so did 2/3 c. half and half.  Couldn't even imagine it richer.  Another 5 stars to the woman who said to add mini marshmallows (and we used mini semi sweet choc chips).  My daughter is allergic to nuts so has never had rocky road.  WOW - we are all in heaven.  We didn't even freeze it - just ate it straight out of the ice cream maker.  Making it again tomorrow!

Terrific. I used mini chocolate chips and added them the last ten minutes the ice cream was churning in the machine. This avoided having to chop them up and the attendant mess that would go with it.   Definetly a keeper.

Update: After using this recipe as written for the last few years I decided to try using powdered sugar and see how it came out. It was dynamite! Definetly much smoother and silkier. Try it, you'll be glad you did.

No cook and rich and creamy, YUM! I halfed this recipe (except for the cocoa) and made it sugar free by using 1/4 c. splenda and leaving out the chocolate chips. I also used half whole milk and half heavy cream so I didn't get that waxing mouth feel from using all heavy cream (personal pref). This recipe is a keeper.

velvety is right! maybe a bit too velvety. I recommend freezing overnight then eating the next day. It was soooo good then! I added peanut butter chips because I have a slight addiction:)

It just does not get better than this.  I had this mixed up and ready to put into the ice cream maker at my friend's house and could not find the lid.  She decided we'd just put it in ice cube trays and put it into the blender when done.  Guess what, no blender or ice cream maker necessary.  The result was velvety smooth right out of the regular freezer.  It was amazing.  I'm making more tonight!

Love it! Added 1/3 cup extra cocoa powder, and some very finely ground instant coffee and it was perfect! Usually the grounds would add an unpleasant texture, but with the chocolate shavings they blend right in.

Made this for a neighborhood ice cream contest and it was the first to be eaten! I even lowered the fat a bit by doing 5 egg yolks and 4 liquid eggs.  Also I did half cream and the other 1/2 and 1/2.  I also made brownies and rolled them into tiny balls and stirred them in after the ice cream had frozen.  It was a definite show stopper!

I omitted the extra chunks/shaves of chocolate for personal preference and added about 1/2 tsp of salt.  WONDERFUL!  Really super yummy!  My 3 1/3 year old godson was beyond amazed at the yummy ice cream we made together!!!

Made this in my Cuisineart this week.  Very easy, but will leave out the extra chopped chocolate as I think it detracted from the finished product and kept it from being smooth.

This ice cream so rich in flavor that I didn't want as large portion as I normally do.  It's a good recipe for chocolate snobs.

This is super ice cream and I would leave 5 stars, but it doesn't make very much ice cream at all.  There is no way this recipe serves 8...maybe 2 people.

This is my go-to recipe for chocolate ice cream.  It's delicious, and depending on what dairy product I have on hand, I easily substitute half&half, or part milk/part cream, etc., and it turns out great every time.

I made this ice cream as the recipe states with the only exception of doing half heavy cream and half half-n-half. This didn't leave a film in my mouth as the whole heavy cream usually does. Excellent recipe and the family loved it. Thanks!

What a great recipe. We've made this several times over the last few weeks. Mostly we use this as the base and then change up what we add to it.

This is the best chocolate ice cream recipe I have found.  We use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder and chips to make it extra yummy!

The ice cream we made was very good!  The eggs give it a rich texture and everyone loved it!  It was also rich and filling.
