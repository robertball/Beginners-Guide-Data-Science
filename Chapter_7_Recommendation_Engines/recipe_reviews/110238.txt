Simple and delicious stew recipe.  At first I wasn't sure about all the caraway but it takes on a mellower flavor after simmering all day.  I cooked my stew in the crockpot.  I browned the beef and cooked the onions as per the recipe and dumped it into the crock.  I ommited 2 cups of the broth and cooked it on high the first two hours then kicked it to low and let it go all day and it came out fabulous.  Lovely autumn dinner!

Easy and absolute comfort!    Consider not adding salt to the meat browning step if you use a packaged broth instead of homemade.  Adjust the salt to taste at the end.

I wasn't sure how the ingredients would work together, but this turned out to be delicious squared. Don't skimp or substitute on the spices that are called for, as they make all the difference. I added in a sweet potato because I didn't have enough regular potato and I only used as much broth as was necessary to cover the ingredients.

I halved the recipe for my husband and me and we loved it.  It reminds me of my Austrian grandmother's cooking.  This will go into my permanent files.  Thanks!

I made this and did not add the sugar, it was very good! This dish tastes exactly like the food I grew up eating in a prodominantly German family. Great dish!

For wheat/corn allergy: I used potato starch as my thickener. Works perfectly.  I also added some tamari sauce to deepen the flavor of the broth. (Mushroom umami might also work for the soy allergic.)

Beautiful aroma :) what a great stew for the autumn weather, such an earthy rich taste! Very much enjoyed it. Made a few tweaks to the recipe to incorporate some pumpkin chunks also, was fantastic!
