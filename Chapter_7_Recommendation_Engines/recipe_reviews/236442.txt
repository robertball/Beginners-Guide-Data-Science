Delicious! I mixed the eggs and milk in the blender to ensure that they were well combined. I used 3 slices of 2% American cheese and 3 slices of muenster that I needed to use up. Very flavorful, and I liked how the cheese made sort of a 'crust' on top. Super simple...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used part-skim low-moisture mozzerella because I didn't have provolone.  My casserole was a bit wet though thoroughly cooked.  I like my eggs a little dry.  Moisture aside, the meat, eggs and cheese together were a little much for me.  I think I would prefer a vegetable-egg combo, but this is just a matter of personal taste.  Also, if you decide to make this use very little salt on the eggs.  The ham provides more than enough saltiness.
