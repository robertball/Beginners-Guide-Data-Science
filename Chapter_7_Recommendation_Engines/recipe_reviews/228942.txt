This was good, but it was missing... something.  My guess is salt.  I used some fresh mango salsa from a friend (heavy on the mango), and my guess is that there wasn't much salt in it, like there would be in commercial salsa.  

That said, it paired quite nicely with macadamia-crusted fish fillets with mango cream sauce!

The salsa that I had on hand was Summer Fruits which really enhanced the sweetness  of the couscous.  The cumin was too dominant for us, so I would cut that in half the next time.  My husband is much more a curry fan than I, but I thought the balance of the curry was perfect.  Served this as a side dish to a grilled lemon-oregano chicken breast.  I love the ease of couscous and will make this again.

I bought some whole wheat couscous on a whim from the clearance rack, and I found this while trying to decide what to do with it. Love it! I don't add the mango and drop the water to 1 1/4 to make up for that, and serve it with steamed corn. Makes a wonderful meal and leftovers for one!

This was wonderful! My family loved it! The only thing I changed was that I used a fresh mango because that was what I had! I also threw in a handful of currants! Definitely a keeper!

Fruity and spicy, easy to make. I liked it. Limited by what I had on hand, I used a fresh chopped mango and 2/3 c salsa. Also added a dash of salt. Maybe because I used fresh mango instead of dried, it could have used a little sugar or honey.

I love to mix sweet and savory in my cooking.  I also normally have mangoes and salsa on hand so this was the perfect way to dress up some couscous to go with my jerk chicken.  I used fresh mango which I just stirred in just before serving.

Good recipe.  Didn't have mango or curry...just used the salsa, cummin and paprika.  THANKS.
