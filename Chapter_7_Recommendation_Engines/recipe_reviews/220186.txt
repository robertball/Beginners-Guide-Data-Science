Tomato and basil are a classic combination and when paired with mozzarella you have something so simple and so delicious without a ton of effort! I used plum tomatoes that I added a little sea salt to along with the fresh cracked black pepper. I also baked it at 450 vs. 500. If you want to add a little pizzaz add some thin sliced red onion or roasted red peppers- perfect served with a garden salad and a nice wine for a quick meal or makes a great appetizer!

I made my own dough, used block mozzarella, used a large tomato, and sprinkled on a little salt and fresh garlic with the pepper.  Also, I baked the crust with oil for 7 minutes, then added toppings and baked for another 7 min.  This was delicious.

This is an easy and delicious pizza. Really fresh and a welcome change from the usual sauce type pizza.  I made it with puzza dough from my bread machine.  One recipe of the dough I used was enough for 2 pizzas.  Husband gave his approval as well.  Going to make it for the grandkids.

I took other reviewer's suggestion and added red onion.  I also sprinkled the bottom of the pizza dough with garlic powder before adding the other ingredients.  I'm not normally a fan of making my own pizza when you can get a great one delivered, but this is delicious.  Thanks!

I found this recipe several years ago and this is my go-to meal for when I'm in no mood to cook, which is about once a month. So easy, so simple, so danged tasty. What may be a cardinal sin here (considering who posted this recipe) is admitting that I have used any shredded mozzarella that's on sale, even the store brand. Sometimes I use Kraft, too. ;) At any rate, it always tastes so good. Tomatoes and FRESH basil are what make this pizza.  Sometimes I get adventurous and throw on some sausage, olives or mushrooms but, really, it's the best when it's made as-is. Thank you for this recipe!

I really like this recipe for a few reasons. First it is delicious and easy to make (me and my mom can whip it together and throw it in the oven in 5-10 minutes). Second, you can throw other things on it and it still tastes great (have had success with artichoke hearts and mushrooms). I also like using pizza sauce but to each their own

This pizza was quick and easy and a real hit. We use fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden and a Pillsbury pizza dough classic "roll out", no preservative dough.

I low carbed this recipe! I didn't change it a lot but I scaled it down to one serving and replaced the crust with a mission brand low carb tortilla. I added all the toppings and baked it til the cheese melted. it was very good! thanks for sharing! always looking for tasty low carb recipes or ways to convert recipes to low carb.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make! We had a ton of tomatoes this year from our garden so was the perfect recipe to use some of them. The only thing  I would change is the time it went in the oven. I used a thin crust pizza dough and it was starting to get a little too brown when I took it out after 11 and a half minutes. Next time I think I will try taking it out after 10 minutes.

I love this recipe. I did change it a bit though. Instead of cherry tomatoes I just used regular tomatoes and I also added mushrooms that I saut√©d in garlic butter. :) .

So yummy!!! Based on reviews, I added some red onion. I didn't add the sea salt, but wish I had a little. I baked mine for almost 12 minutes but wish I had taken it out about a minute earlier. I will definitely make this again!
