This was a very easy recipe to make. I got lots of compliments from all the Mardi Gras goers that it rates up there with the cakes made down in Nawleans, as well as those who have never had King Cake before. This is a keeper and I will make it again for future Mardi Gras celebrations!!

This cake was fantastic! I made it for an annual Christmas party that features a king cake. Most times guests just order the cake from out of state. I just couldn’t justify the expense. The cake is easy to make provided you have enough time and follow the directions EXACTLY. Everyone at the party said it was the best king cake they had ever tasted!

My daughter graduated from Tulane ( in New Orleans) last May and this is her first birthday home. I wanted to make her a King Cake for her 23rd because she loves them !  I’ve never made a yeast cake before but instructions were great. Loved the video !
