The recipe is too much for my older rice cooker so I made it on the stove in a large sauce pan.  it was very difficult to keep the rice from sticking-- if I made it again, I would cut the chili powder and cumin in half.    Just OK.

This WILL NOT work in an 8 cup rice cooker. We transferred it to the stove, but it couldn't be salvaged. I give it 3 stars because it has potential. We are going to cut the recipe in half and try it again.

Easy and delicious.
I put all the ingredients into my rice cooker before leaving for work and came home to the wonderful aroma.  Will definitely make this again.

This was excellent! The recipe submitter notes this can be done in a skillet on a stove and this is what I did since I do not have a rice cooker. I somehow let myself run out of rice so I used a box of the rice/vermicelli mix and just kept the season packet aside for another use. I left out the optional corn and bacon. This was super simple but tasted like I had fussed over it  for hours. Definite keeper!
