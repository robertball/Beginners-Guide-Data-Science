Perfect Colorado green chili recipe!  After browning the meat, onion and garlic I cook mine in the slow cooker - and boy is it ever good.  Try and use roasted green chiles - we can get them at farmer's markets and frozen during the off season.  In the fall, I usually buy a half bushel of XXX dynamite and half bushel of pueblos and freeze them for use throughout the year.  This green chili is PERFECT for breakfast burritos!  Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe just won us first place at a chili cook-off. Everything was perfect except like GarlicHead said, it was too liquidy. We made a roux (gravy base) of flour browned in olive oil to thicken the stock. Worth the extra time to get the right consistency. YUM.

I really enjoyed this.  I used my own homemade salsa verde. Since I didnt have any green chilies, I used about 4 cans of diced fire roasted green chilies.  I served mine over cheese enchiladas!  MMM.....Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have to admit, I'm from Colorado and I am a Green Chili Snob... I've been making green chili for as long as I can remember and understand that everyone who makes green chili has their own recipe. I tried this recipe on a whim, and Was pleasantly surprised. 
The onion and chicken broth give it a really nice flavor. If you're looking for a good green chili recipe.. This one is worth the time. The only thing I omitted were the cloves.. I'm just not a fan of cloves.

I love Chile Verde; but, despaired ever finding the perfect recipe.  This is it and soooo easy to make! I didn't have any fresh roasted chilies, so I used canned-5 of the little cans to equal 2 cups or so.  I increased the garlic to 6 cloves as suggested.  I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes with added chilies.  I chopped the onion, 2 of the cans of the chilies, the can of tomatoes with juice and the garlic together in my food processor.  I browned the cubed pork in olive oil and seasoned it with salt and pepper.  Then, all of it, including 4 cups of chicken broth went into my crock pot.  Near the end of cooking, I added the dried oregano and the pinch of cloves.  I never would have believed that the clove pinch would make such a difference, but it did.  I don't usually add cloves to recipes because I don't care for it; however, in this recipe, it is a must! Just before serving, I made a roux of olive oil and flour to thicken the sauce.  We made smothered Chile Verde burritos and it was delicious!

Pretty good, but needed some modifications. The obvious is double the garlic ;-). Add one or two fresh tomatoes. Halve the broth. Double the oregano. And for the final touch, add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar. This thickens the chili and adds just the right amount of underlying smoothness to balance out the fire of the peppers. Also, depending on your peppers, you may want to add a few at a time. I had about 2 cups of good NM Hatchs that I added to a double recipe and it was plenty hot! A chacun son go√ªt!

THANK YOU Rosie55 for posting this fabulous recipe! Delicious!! My husband lived in CO many years & craves this kind of green chili, but it's almost unheard of in MN. I made a few little changes to suit us: I added in 2 ears of fresh grilled corn, doubled the garlic, added in a few shakes of roasted cumin, and used about 2# of pork butt/shoulder total in the recipe. I floured the pork cubes lightly before sauteing to help create a little extra thickening as we like it thicker to go over burritos, omelets, etc. I used the Salsa Lisa brand of tomatillo/green chile salsa.  For the peppers I used 2 poblanos, 2 anaheims, 1 jalapeno & 1 small can of roasted diced green chiles. For me the heat was just right. I'll be making this for years to come, Thanks again!!!!

Wow!  I lived in Colorado for several years and had lots of chili verde but this is the best I've ever had, or made!  I must say that I wasn't keen on the tomatillo sauce because I don't care for it but after cooking, resting, reheating and eating that and the pinch of cloves made the dish fantastic!!!  I recommend that each person make the recipe for the first time exactly as written.  If you want to make changes after that then do.  I also recommend making one day, cooling in fridge overnight and then reheating for best taste.  Once again, the biggest surprise was the pinch of ground cloves......really makes the dish.  Served ontop of freshly mashed potatoes.  OUTSTANDING!!!

so delicious.  i have never had green chili before, but my husband had some (in okinawa of all places) and loved it, so i searched for recipes and made this having no idea what it would taste like.  can i just say its super delicious? holy. cow. i used the canned green chills, the cheapest salsa verde walmart sold and a teeny little pork roast that i chopped up, and it was awesome.  i can only imagine how much better it is completely from scratch... so awesome.  thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!!!

I loved the flavor of this chili. I would definitely make it again. My only problem with was that it just never got to the consistency that I would have hoped for, such as is with a conventional chili. It was much more loose, almost like a soup. Even after I put almost all of the veggies through the blender as prescribed in the recipe, the chili stayed too soup like to "pour" over anything, much less a burrito. I ended up making it in a slow cooker so perhaps that's the reason. I will be trying it again so we'll just have to wait and see.

I lived in Colorado for a few years and missed green chili so much! This was amazing. I let it simmer for almost 2 days and near the end, put 4oz of cream cheese into it (a trick I learned in CO. Adds a smoothness without taste). This thickened it that last bit it needed and I have been eating Green chili breakfast burritos for days now. Thank you so much, my neighbors here in Ohio have never even heard of green chili and love it!!!

Just won first place in the company chili cook-off with this recipe!  I doubled the recipe to yeild 12 servings, but reduced the liquids...only used 4 cups chicken broth and drained the tomatoes; this gave a perfect "chili-like" consistancy. Substituted pablano & anaheim for Big Jim chiles since I live in the mid-west and couldn't get any Big Jim. It was a sure hit!

I thought this was good the first day and much better the second day. I followed the advice of making a roux and thickening it because mine was too thin. I had to used canned chilies, so it's probably five stars with fresh roasted ones. I really liked it with melted cheese and tortilla chips on top.

We LOVED this recipe.  It was a nice change from tomato based chili.  Being from Ohio, I could not find the right green chilies.  So I roasted two poblano's in the oven and used a can of diced green chilies and a half a can of jalapeno.  We served it over mashed potatoes which balanced out the heat from the chili nicely.

I started off with some dried onion, chicken base, chopped hatch chilies,  garlic powder & a bottle of dark beer. I added this along with pork chunks to the crock pot. After 8-9 hrs, I fried a little with some of the juices adding the canned tomatillos,  chopped fresh tomatoes, cilantro, a dash of GOYA Adobo seasoning. Tossed on green onions and tortillas and you have a WINNING DINNER!! My husband is Mexican, he gave this an 11 1/2 + , he loved it so
 much, his eyes rolled in the back of his head!! Need I say more? Just make it and you too will see what I'm talking about! THANK YOU ROSIE55! !!

Good taste, but still really soupy even though I cut the chicken broth down by a lot. Will tweak more if I try this recipe again.

This stuff is amazing! I got my roasted chiles and tomatillo sauce from work, browned the meat (pork shoulder), onions and garlic, then threw all ingredients in the slow cooker. I used 4 c. chicken stock and diced tomatoes with jalepenos. Cooked undisturbed for 7 hours on low. At this point still very watery, so added olive oil/flour roux. This is also when I strained out my 2 c. of veggies and pureed in blender. Do not omit this step!! Then I turned slow cooker up to high and simmered one hour. It was perfect!!! Quite spicy, and so delicious on breakfast burritos. Really took me back to the first and only time I ever had Colorado green chili, which I've been dreaming about for the past decade! I brought half the pot to the cooks at work for their professional opinion, and they loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

Hey all!
So glad you like it. I totally agree, making a roux is a good idea. Or, you could add some diluted corn starch to the end to thicken it - mom does that and I forgot to add that part!

This is an amazing recipe. I don't eat pork, but I was able to substitute for chicken. I roasted my own pepers. Dumped it all in there together and used an immersion blender for a few seconds. Man. Best green chili ever!

DH is a native Tucsonan who spends quite a bit of time in New Mexico. He asked for green chile tonight, and I knew I didn't have enough time to go low and slow with a traditional recipe. Followed this using other posters' suggestions and my own alterations. Most importantly, because I have Celiac, I found a husband-delighted (he is a tough one!), gluten-free way around the roux other posters felt was necessary. Browned pork; put onion, 2x more garlic than called for, two 8 oz. cans of Herdez salsa verde, and one 13 oz. tub of thawed Buena roasted green chile in food processor, pulsed. Removed pork to a plate. Put processed veggie goodness into pan with a bit more heated oil, scraped up browned pork goodness, added a heaping tsp. of ground coriander, 1 good Tb. of cumin, and the pinch of clove called for. Simmered down; added tomatoes, pork. Simmered another 20-30 minutes; added 1 15 oz. can refried beans (gluten-free) and 1 can pinto beans, drained and rinsed. Simmer again for a bit and good to go. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I used beef which was good. I didn't care for the clove in the recipe, so will leave that out in the future. Used 3c chicken broth rather than 5 and that was perfect. Will make this again in the future.

I have made this three times.  I didn't love the pork cubes but loved this flavor.  So now I take a pork shoulder/butt and sear it, then cook it overnight on warm (not low) in my slow cooker with some salsa verde and a little white wine.   In the morning I add all the other ingredients listed  (but lighten up on the stock so it is more of a chili and less a soup) and keep it on warm all day.   I shred the shoulder when it has no more pink.  Only then do I remove the flavorful fat.  By dinner it is the most amazing bowl of flavor I have ever had.   

Other slow cookers may work on low setting - mine cooked it on warm like it was braising...just perfect.

There is something about Colorado style green chili you just can't find anywhere else.  This recipe does a great job capturing my home state's flavor.

I definitely recommend using fire roasted chilies.  The canned stuff just doesn't cut it.  Also, I used Rotel in place of the canned tomatoes.  You can go as hot as you like here if your chilies are a little mild.

Instead of pork chunks, I used ground pork.  I know, not the traditional way, but I like making big batches so I can make tons of homemade burritos for breakfast and lunch.  You get a little pork with every bite.

Made this recipe tonight and will serve it for dinner tomorrow night when my kids come over. It has a wonderful rich flavor.  I'm guessing the roasted green chiles really make it - but the whole thing tastes extremely flavorful. I didn't have the diced tomatoes but used Mexican diced tomatoes.  I also made a rue to thicken it at the end.  Expecting it to taste even better tomorrow after it sits in the fridge. This recipe is definitely a keeper and worth all the steps it takes to make it.  I will use it for green chile burritos for dinner.  Yum Yum! And I am a fairly seasoned (no pun intended) cook regarding Mexican food.

I used a slow cooker and it's cooking right now! Smells so yummy! I made a few changes I found from other reviewers. I cubed about 1 1/2lbs pork shoulder then I used Target's Archer Farms Roasted Salsa Verde with 1/4 jar of Archer Farms Roasted Tomato and Chipotle (both picante style salsa). I only used 1/4 b/c my husband doesn't like things too spicy. Added canned Fire Roasted Tomatoes, 3 cups broth and from Walmart can of Tres Hermanas Fire Roasted Whole Green Chilis  (mild, of course) chopped, (didn't see any blackened chili flakes in the can like with the tomatoes so I'm not really sure of the quality but probably good for this recipe) and doubled on the oregano (mexican). Side note: I actually liked the taste from the jar AF Salsa Verde. Most I have found aren't very favorable or poor quality. AF really is delish on it own for dipping, on burritos, tacos, etc. I know without all the changes this would be an excellent recipe all on it's own. What a great idea to use cloves. Thank you Rosiess and am now a follower!

Delicious!!! Used 4 cups broth and thickened with alittle cornstarch. Used 1 cup fresh roasted hatch chiles cause Im a wimp and my hubby added more to his bowl. Did not add cloves as I believe it would taste weird. I will save them for the pie and ham. Used fire roasted tomatoes for that extra smokey taste.

Excellent recipe, I roasted my own green chilies in the oven at 500 degrees until blistered, then peeled and chopped them when cool. I think it made a great recipe even better. This is a recipe worth jotting down.

I think that there was too much liquid in this recipe, which diluted the spices and made it bland.

You can roast chiles on the bbq. It only takes 15 min.   I cook them till they're brown and toss in a plastic bag for about 1 hour.  The peelings slip right off and they taste amazing.  Fresh!  Can chiles do not compare.  

I also sprinkle flour on meat prior to browning.  This will help create a thicker base when you add green chile.

I love green chili.  My favorite is from King Chef Diner in Colorado Springs.  Despite loving it, I have never made it, nor any chili, until tonight.  My son's crew team had a chili cook off, and this recipe won 1ST PLACE -- "BY A LANDSLIDE!"  Reading the comments, I did add twice the garlic and thickened it with an olive oil/flour rue.  I also added a pinch of cumin when browning the pork. I would say it is beginner's luck, but I think you have a keeper, Rosie!  Thanks for sharing!

I am Colorado girl and huge green chili fan. I added a little flour to my pork and onion mixture to make it thicker. I also had to use beef broth instead of chicken and it still turned out most excellent. I recommend this recipe!

This recipe lacked the green chili flavor and was far too 'soupy.'  I used two cups less of the chicken stock, and I still had to eat this with a spoon like it was a stew or soup. If I were to make it again, I'd use a lot more green chilies, omit the tomatoes, and cut down on the broth.

Made this for Super Bowl '14....Rave reviews. I agree with the reviews and cut down the Broth. I did roast some of my own peppers for a fabulous fresh flavor. I served it in a bowl, like a chili, topped with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and grated cheddar with warm flour tortilla's for dipping....A REALLY BIG HIT!

I like this, the boyfriend REALLY liked it.  We're having leftovers tomorrow.  I put in 2 cups broth and it was still extremely liquidy like soup though.  And the cubed meat we bought was cubed pork chops, not the best...  Pork shoulder cut into cubes would have been 100% better but I bought what my grocery store offered that I could make in a timely manner, on a weeknight.  To make it the best, it would have taken a lot longer and I didn't have that kind of time tonight.  I will try again with pork shoulder.  Thank you.

This recipe reminds me of my Mom's version of chili verde. I absolutely LOVE it. I had been making another recipe from this site for the longest (one that does not have tomatoes in it) until I found this one. Wish I had seen this one first seeing as how my husband hates this one. He never tasted chili verde before I made it & he is not a fan of tomatoes so when I tried this recipe on him he was shocked to say the least. 
Great recipe, just wish I could make it more often.

Loved this recipe, and I've tried a few!  The only 2 adjustments I made were I increased the garlic to 6 cloves and decreased the chicken broth to 4 cups.  If you want it a little thicker, decrease the broth by another cup because you always add more if it's too thick.

I LOVED this recipe!!  I had leftover meat from pulled pork so I used that. I prefer my green chile shredded instead of chunk so it was perfect. I cut down the broth to 3 cans and omitted the clove only because I'm not a fan of clove so I was afraid to use it. I made sure some of the seeds from the chilies made it into the pot so it would have an extra kick....and WOW!!!!!!  Rosie....you made me a very HAPPY girl with this recipe!! THANK YOU!!!

Only used about 1 cup of broth, otherwise kept the recipe the same.  I used roasted NM Hatch chilis, a jar of salsa verde from Trader Joes.  Placed it all in the crock pot 2 hours on high, 4 hours on low and ate the next day....delicious!

Holy is this a good recipe. Seriously. Green chile was never on my radar until a good buddy tipped me off on the only spot he visits in town, which is El Taco de Mexico, so I checked it out. That was the most amazing chile I ever tried, and legit changed my life.  I tried numerous other places around town, but nobody came close to theirs.  So I gave this recipe a shot, only swapping out the cubed pork for country style ribs that I smoked for about 6 hours at 200. I also threw it into a crockpot and let cook on low for another 6 hours or so.  I also used some roasted, seeded Hatch chiles I got from a place off Federal in Denver. Kinda tough to really pull off good verde without Hatch or Pueblo chiles, but they probably aren't readily available everywhere...

Anyway, this is absolutely sublime, and there will always be some of this chile in our freezer now. 

Thank you for sharing!

It was my first attempt making green chili. Recipe was easy and clear. I followed it pretty closely other than putting it in a slow cooker after it had all come together in the Dutch oven. I used an immersion blender to puree some of the chili in the cooker rather than use a blender. I used freshly roasted Pueblo chilies that I got in Pueblo, Colorado. The flavor was out of this world.

This was delicious! I browned the pork butt chunks,  removed the meat and added the chopped onions to fry. Put meat and onions in pressure cooker for 10 minutes. Then added the rest of the ingredients (used one can of undiluded Campbell‚Äôs chicken broth and twice the garlic). Simmered on stove for ~an hour.  I would use a lot less tomatillo sauce next time because it was way too spicy for us. Thickened with corn starch. Served it over white rice. Wonderful recipe! Gracias!

I was ready to toss it out after accidentally adding too much clove but instead of 1 1/2 cups, I added 2 full jars of tomatillo salsa (Frontera brand from Target) and literally could not stop eating it. I was up at 2 am having it on crackers then again with eggs for breakfast. Definitely will make again.

I was looking for a green chili, but don't know anything about Colorado green chili.  Those who used a slow cooker had it right.  I don't, but put mine in the oven at 250 for much of the day because the pork wasn't close to tender after just an hour on the stove.  Also, it is too soupy.  I ended up doing all of this:  making a roue to begin with, putting 2 cups of soup in the blender as the recipe directs, AND adding a slurry about an hour before I served it.  Finally, I would use more pork next time.  It packs a kick, which is fine with me, and the flavor is good.  It's not my favorite chili, but we liked it.

This is a fabulous green chili! I doubled the recipe, and cut down the chicken broth to one cup total. Doubled the garlic, too.  It is still fairly soupy, and you can always add chicken broth if you‚Äôd like later. Used Big Jim chilies that were roasted here in Colorado, and they were awesome! I chickened out on adding the cloves, but went ahead and added a fair amount of cumin. My favorite chili!

I didn't add cloves, because didn't have any..added 1.5 T cornstarch slurry to thicken....Otherwise, I made it with the ingredients listed, minus 1 cup of stock.  I simmered with lid off for an hour to reduce liquid state .  I love it!!!  Thanks for the easy recipe.

I love chili verse. I make it as often as I can. But the one time I used a jar green salsa was a disaster the salsa might have been bad but the recipe came out terrible I suggest only using teal green tomatoes and green chilis. Jared sauces are too salty for this dish

My family loved this recipe! The only thing I did different was cooked it on the slow cooker and an hour before dinner, removed all the veggies, blended them in the food processor, and removed 3/4 of the remaining liquid, then added the pureed veggies back in with the meat. Yum!

This is an excellent tasting recipe. It's a real keeper. After reading all the reviews about how soupy the chili was, I decided to eliminate the chicken stock altogether. Before I even got to that step I noticed that the chili was already rather soupy. So to get the flavor,  I added Knorr chicken stock. It's not a liquid but a concentrated little tub of pure flavor. It's on my stove simmering as I write this and I am so excited to serve it for dinner.

Very good recipe to make on the first official day of the football season. I ended up cutting the broth in half and I tripled the oregano, I also roasted my own chilies for extra flavor. I agree the blending of 2cups of the chili is key for good consistency. Overall a very good recipe!

The flavor of this was good.  It was INCREDIBLY runny though.  I dumped off a lot of the liquid before I did the blending step and I still ended up serving it with a slotted spoon.  I would cut the broth at least in half if I make this again.

I have made this many times now and found that it is much better if a person omits the chicken broth entirely.  It is completely unnecessary as the tomatoes, salsa, and pork "juice" make plenty of "gravy"

I spend a lot of time in Colorado and fell in love with green chilli. This is the best "low effort" recipe I have found. Most great recipes call for hours of cooking and can't be made after work or on a whim, this one works great with minimum effort.

The posted recipe is great. Personally I stir in the juice of two limes towards the end of cooking because I like that twist as a personal preference, and use only 3 cups of broth for a thicker chilli. But what a fantastic, quick & easy base to build your your own personal tastes on - very happy to find a great GC recipe that doesn't require hours of cooking.

FYI, if you want a thicker  chili, sprinkle some flour on the pork  (~1/4 cup) before you add the broth/stock.  Or you can use a slurry after the broth has been added. Just make sure that you stir it well using a slurry, or you'll end up with dumplings. Also, you will need to adjust the seasoning adding flour, as it is bland on its own.  :-)

This recipie was really great! At first with the chicken broth was a little to much. So I had changed a few items in the recipie. I first changed 4 garlic cloves to almost a full one and only did half an onion along with only 2 cups of chicken broth. This recipie had me thrown off with the 5 cups of chicken broth started to become very watery and more of a soup than chili. Other than the few changes I really enjoyed this recipe and would for sure make this again.

Ok, I definitely understand the ratings of deliciousness w/ this recipe! But recipe needs a bit of clarification.  I started this about 4 pm(thinking I was allowing myself plenty of time for dinner preparations) and had to keep cooking, making modifications...remainder is actually still simmering in Dutch Oven as  I type. 
My thoughts: 
Lessen broth by one cup, make sure to remove a a great deal of the peppers/tomatoes when blending for thickness) and give yourself more time for meat to simmer. I added on about 30 minutes and that was just to be able to remove meat and cut it up to make burritos. It wasn't ideally tender but the flavor was fantastic. I do look forward to tasting tomorrow and seeing how the flavors marry together even more.

I'm not a huge pork fan, but I LOVED this!  I used pork loin, and 2 of the 7 oz. cans of Herdez salsa verde was exactly 1.5 cups.  I eat it like a stew because I'm low carbing, but I serve it to my kids with rice, pinto beans on a tortilla.

Used chicken instead of pork.  It was absolutely awesome.  The meat was also great on corn tortillas.  Will definitely make again with pork and chicken.

I love this recipe and have made it twice now. I live in Seattle and used canned chillies (3mild and 1 hot...still spicy) and sour cream on top. This is great! Thanks Rosie for the great recipe!

I love this recipe, its so simple! I did switch to pork chops though, the stew meat is easier, but cubed up pork chops was so much better. Also i used the full amount of tomatillo sauce and it made it pretty spicy, but it had an amazing flavor. Im not sure if my tomatillo sauce was just hotter then most but i do recomend adding a little less. You can always add more later.

I found this recipe to be a nice change from more traditional dishes. My family loved it and I have made it several times in a slow cooker.

This green chili recipe was amazing! The only thing I did differently was cut down on the chicken broth & cooked it in my crock pot.  Let's just say my family ate it all up in one night! I will definitely be making this dish again!

We love this recipe.  I only use 2-3 cups of broths and use cornstarch to thicken.  I try to use fresh Anaheim peppers whenever possible for the green chilies.  I've even used fresh tomatillos and they add to the recipe flavor.  This is a GREAT recipe to tweek to your families tastebuds.

I can't stop eating this. Absolutely wonderful. I did use some of the tips from other commentors and added a few twists of my own. I added some cubed carrots and used a prepared Salsa Verde with jalapenos added. Also, I did make an olive oil/flour roux to thicken it a bit. If you don't like heat, I would recommend using a tomatillo-only salsa or make your own, leaving out the jalapenos. I used 5 poblanos, roasted in the oven and peeled. Next time, I'll use a few more. Make this recipe. You won't be sorry.

made a few modifications and tossed in 2 poblanos and 2 serranos and about a TBSP of fresh cilantro with a doubled recipe.  gotta say the clove makes all the difference, this is wonderful. PSA: use Pueblo chile's instead of hatch, they're meatier and pack more punch.
