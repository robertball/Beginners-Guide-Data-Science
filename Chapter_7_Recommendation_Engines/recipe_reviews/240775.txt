I cut the Worcestershire down by half. When the cooking time was near done and I shredded the beef I adjusted the seasoning to my taste. So good on hoagie rolls with some sauteed mushrooms and green peppers. A little shredded mozzarella and it was the best sandwich I've had in a long time.

I liked this a lot and so did my daughter, but my husband said it had too much worcestershire sauce in it, which I kind of agree.  You really lose the "beef" flavor from it.  I topped my beef dip with sauteed onions and peppers and colby jack cheese and served on a ciabatta roll.  Pretty yummy, but next time, less worcestershire :)

This was very flavorful and a big hit for dinner tonight.  Very easy to make, too!  I think the recipe name is deceiving.   At first glance, I thought this was an appetizer type dip.  Not until I read the recipe,  did I realize what the dish really was.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!
