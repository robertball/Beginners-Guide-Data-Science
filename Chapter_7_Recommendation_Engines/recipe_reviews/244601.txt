The saltiness of the prosciutto and sweetness of the peaches paired well together. The creamy burrata cheese (my firstfirst time having burtata-yum!) worked well with the peaches too and the fresh basil was a much needed and perfect fresh compliment to the dish. I made this as a simple and delicious lunch.

Made this for the fourth of July 2017, and everyone (even the picky eaters) loved it.  Could not find buratta cheese locally in time for dinner, so substituted fresh mozarella instead.  DELICIOUS!

The prosciutto really crisps up nicely on the grill and is a great combination with the peach. The contrast in textures and the sweet-salty combo of the prosciutto and peach is delicious! I crumbled goat cheese beneath each peach (because that's what I had on hand) and it was very tasty with the peaches. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to try with the burrata cheese. Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John!

My favorite Chef! We had perfect peaches on hand,as well as Basil and olive oil ,just needed the cheeze.Smith's grocery ppl. had never heard of it.So we bought Ricotta and prepared the peaches along with some jumbo (we partially precooked) shrimp with the Prosciutto and grilled over a Catclaw wood fire must say-it was wonderful.We had a couple of peaches leftover for breakfast and I had one with a toasted English muffin with honey on it-too good for words.Thank you Chef John.
