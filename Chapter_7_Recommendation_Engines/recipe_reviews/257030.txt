I wasn't sure if this (or any other Manwich) recipe would be worth the trouble involved in hunting & gathering, chopping & cooking since the old reliable canned sauce from Hunts is a classic example of haute cuisine at my house.  My only change to CJ's recipe was replacing one green pepper with some diced cellery.   I didn't taste the final product before packing it up for its trip to a friends house for college football viewing.  The very sad news is that nothing was left in the dish for me to finish at home.  Next time I'll use a smaller dish.

Tasty!  I altered using half Beef broth and half chicken (as that is what I had on hand).  Warm and gooey/cheesy.  We had several options for serving: on baguettes per recipe, on traditional buns, and over crispy tater tots.  All options were a hit.  Will likely make again.

This dip was really good!  Chef John did it again! I would never have thought to turn sloppy joes into a  dip.  Hubby is not a fan of sweet stuff so I knew I needed to cut back a bit on the brown sugar, I also added a splash of cider vinegar and a teaspoon of chili powder and I always add about 1/2 cup of finely diced celery to my sloppy joes.  I don't think I am misleading anyone by rating this 5 stars even though I did tweak it a bit to suit my family's taste preference. I'm sure the original recipe tastes great. Thanks again Chef John.

I felt it was missing some taste (tang).  I am not an avid cook but maybe adding some apple cider vinegar probably would have done the trick.

Update, It’s perfect as written. My daughter is vegan. I made a vegan dip for her. 1 bag vegan crumbles. Vegan shredded cheese. And subbed 1 tsp. Soy sauce and 1/4 tsp. Apple cider vinegar for the Worcestershire sauce. Followed the recipe with the remaining ingredients. I have to say hard to tell the difference between the two! Thanks So much Chef John!

Its ok, way too many sweet peppers in this. It stayed soupy, rather than sloppy. Wasn't a hit at our family gathering. Probably won't make again. Very disappointed, was looking forward to an twist on an old classic.

I used 2 heaping Tablespoons of brown sugar so the green peppers were not too overwhelming.

First off, I'm a big fan of a number of other Chef John recipes. This one, however, was my first big disappointment. I found it terribly sweet and lacking any real depth of flavor. Also, the color of the final product (before adding the cheese) was not appealing. Granted, my taste runs a little sophisticated, so I think others would like this. My 7 year old nephew liked it), but  he's one of those chicken nuggets and mac and cheese only kids.

Made this as written for a party. The dip came out well and was popular with most people but I found the dip just a little boring and a bit too sweet for me. Maybe next time, I'll do something to add a little spice into it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used ground chuck with this, and it was just way too fatty, even with adding two additional tablespoons of flour to soak up the grease from the beef.  I skimmed off as much as I could from the top, but I think this needs to be made with ground sirloin or possibly ground turkey to fix this problem.  I thought the catsup was very sweet without being tomatoey enough, and it needed more tang.  Frankly, I preferred the Manwich.  Of note, however, my husband did enjoy the taste.

This was really tasty, thanks for sharing.  Even though i got impatient and didn't let it simmer long enough (was messy and sloppy), I still enjoyed it.  I tried it with French Baguettes and also Tortilla chips (I know call me weird) and enjoyed both.

This is really good.  I like Chef Johns recipes.  I seem to pick them a lot.  For this one, the only thing I am going to change next time I make this is to decrease the salt.
