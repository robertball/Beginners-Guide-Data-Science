This is a very tasty recipe.  I used a cast iron grill pan to cook this steak.  Lots of flavor, very satisfying for "diet" food.

This recipe was excellent. We cooked it one night for dinner without putting it over arugala. Just served the steak with surprise south beach mashed potatoes and the stewed tomatoes from the south beach diet book. There's just two of us so we had plenty of steak left over and used some the next day on salads for lunch and even had a little left over that we ate with eggs this morning. The South Beach Diet has been so easy for my husband and I as most of the foods are really good!

I was a little skeptic about this recipe because I don't really like the taste of meat, but I love to eat it. I usually put a large dose of many different spices on my steaks but I though I would give this a try and I am glad I did. I was a real light flavor but really good. I will definetly use this again!

Many other guides say one should always marinate flank steak before grilling, and I should have heeded their advice.  I found the steak excessively chewy.  I liked the idea and the simplicity of the recipe, but next time, I will prepare a marinade to tenderize the steak prior to grilling.

Dracula will not be a big fan of this dish, we were though.  I love garlic and it was a bit (gasp!) strong for even me. With that said, we've made this several times already and will continue to do so.  Easy and yummy.

My husband and I love garlic, and this recipe was fantastic!  I used top sirloin and increased the ingredients so that the steak strips would be well-coated.  Didn't serve over argula, just ate with a salad and got rave reviews!

This steak was so flavorful and easy. My husband (who is a picky eater) loved every bite. I combined this steak with the oven roasted vegetables from SBD Phase 1. Yummy!

This is a basic, good starting point for marinating some meat. The flavor was okay but the meat was tender, and that's just as important to us.
