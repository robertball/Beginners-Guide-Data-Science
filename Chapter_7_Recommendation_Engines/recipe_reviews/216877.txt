This was really good.  I prefer my pie crust made with butter so that is what I did.  This was the only change that I made to this recipe.  Will certainly make this again.  Thanks so much for the recipe

pretty good but not as flavourful as I'd like, so i added some worchestershire sauce and some beef flavouring. Also had to add some extra beef broth as didnt find that it had enough gravy.  Much better

This was pretty good, I also used butter instead of lard and added additional salt. The round steak came out nice and tender and it was a "hearty" pie. My favorite thing about this recipes is that it doesn't use a lot of processed foods. The only thing I will change the next time I make it is to use a little less olive oil. I thought 1/3 cup was too much and might reduce to 1/4 cup or 3 tablespoons.

Solid recipe. As others have said, the filling needs a bit more flavour. I think adding mushrooms would be just the thing.

I would definitely make it again.  I used eye of round steaks and the meat was very tender. I also used a regular frozen pie crust, but it makes a lot so next time I will make it with a deep dish frozen pie crust.   Excellent flavour!!

Delicious!  I baked it in my favorite cast iron pan, threw in some mushrooms and other veggies I needed to use up, but stayed true to the recipe otherwise.  That crust was so flakey it's worth it for that!  This ones a keeper

Very good! I made it few times already and everyone in my family loves it. The only change I made is that I substituted lard with a margarine and it came out great! Thank you for sharing.

I liked it but think that it could use more flavor.  I just used premade pie crust and since I only had one pound of beef, I adjusted the other ingredient amounts accordingly.  I then used a 9 in pie plate.   Therefore the premade pie crust worked out.  
I don't know what could be used to add flavor---I prefer some tangy flavor.  Perhaps balsamic?   Or more spices?
