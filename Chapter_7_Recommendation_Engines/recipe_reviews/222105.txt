I used California Chili Pepper in this recipe (it's got the same flavor as regular chili powder but it's half as hot), mexican oregano and I cut the salt back by half. This was seasoning for my Creamy Salsa Verde Crockpot Chicken--it worked out great! Next time, I'd double the oregano.

This easily slid into our nacho night.  It's not as bold as the seasoning packs but it's enough to carry the message.  I will continue this method and let up on the salt next time.  Thanks.

Easy to make seasoning. Little cheaper than store brands, however in a pinch when you need taco seasoning and don't want to run to the store...perfect!

I'm not sure why this is necessarily any healthier than the original version of this recipe simply because it uses fresh garlic.  That said, I liked this recipe expressly because of the fresh garlic.  I backed off on the black pepper, using only half what was called for.  Once again, better safe than sorry.  You can always add more if need be, but you can't take it out.  Used this for Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas, also from this site.  Loved it.

I love the start with fresh garlic and sea salt.  That must have been what I was missing.  I added oregano and cajun seasoning with no msg instead of all the separate spices, since that's what I have on hand today.  Perfect.  Thanks

This recipe was very good. We use turkey instead of beef and it gives great flavor. Just enough spice to suit everybody at table. (Including two kids) not too hot for them. Will use alot.

Used white pepper instead of black, and sweer paprika. Hickory smoked sea salt gave hint of smoke flavor.

Too hot for me!  I would decrease the amount of red pepper flakes.  But if you like your tacos hot this recipe is for you!  The flavor was very good.

I used dehydrated garlic, so the mix is dry and easily stores in a spice jar!
