If its a cake that you are looking out for then this is not it. What this recipe is really a lovely chocolate fudge/pudding. After the 'cake' cooled in the pan, I scooped into a pudding bowl and placed into the fridge. A couple of hours later, voila! It becomes a lovely moist cake. I have made this recipe twice. The second time I used rum instead of brandy. And both times my family and friends love it!

I'm sorry -- I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't turn out.  I wasn't quite sure what bittersweet chocolate was, so I used what I had around the house -- 6 squares of semi-sweet chocolate and 3 squares of unsweetened chocolate.  The flavor of the melted chocolate was really good, so I guess I didn't mess that up.  However, I wasn't sure from the directions whether I was supposed to drain the prunes before adding.  Consequently, I added both prunes and brandy.  The brandy flavor in the baked cake was much too strong, and the outside burned while the inside remained gooey.  Was the texture supposed to be fudgy? Cakey?  I just don't know.  The cake sounded rich and even elegant, and I figured the prunes would make it moist, but they kind of had the effect of adding Ex-Lax to brownies.  Probably not a good dessert to serve to guests.  Hopefully someone else will try this recipe and have better luck than I.

The trick is to soak the prunes for at least a few days, alot of prunes(such as sunsweet are already quite moist so dont soak up the brandy)I soaked mine a week and my cake turned out great, I agree with the other  reveiwer it is more like a pudding than a cake, but good for people who dont eat flour.
