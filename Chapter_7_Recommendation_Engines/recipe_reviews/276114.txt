Had a problem keeping the mushroom in one piece. I did however make it using whole wheat Orzo, not easy to find. Turned out well doesn't raise my blood sugar, seems good for Diabetics, did also use low fat cheese, couldn't get Goat cheese. Will make this again ,like most of your offerings they come out as they shoukd.

I donâ€™t like mushrooms or smoky cheese so I used a bell pepper and  Parmigiana instead  And it was fabulous ! I used a mushroom for my husband and he loved it!! Great addition
