I had to play "shake the kitchen" with this since I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I substituted apple juice for the white wine and Salad Dressing for the Mayo. It still came out fantastic. I lightly seasoned the rice (brown rice) with tumeric and celery seed. Delicious! I even used canned salmon! Will use this again!

I was looking for something different for a salmon recipe.  It was easy to make; and delicious to taste. I would make this again.

I changed it to fit what I like. I used canned salmon and mixed it all together and topped it with crushed Ritz crackers. It was great! I added a photo.

Replacing rice with couscous and not using broccoli, the dish turned out very salty. With the cream of celery soup, the mayonnaise wasn't even necessary. This was a satisfying and easy recipe, as well as very quick. Thank you for uploading, it was worth it :]

This recipe, >, is awesome.  I make something similar with chicken.   However, you need to add the mayo.  Sour cream is an entirely different flavor.  So is Salad Dressing rather than Mayo.  Once you try it you will know what I mean.  

However, this recipe is even great if you cook the rice and put that in the bottom of the casserole dish, and continue with the rest of the instructions, but correcting for extra needed liquid.  

Thanks, Candie, I was wondering if I could make my chicken recipe with salmon, and what to change to make it work.  You answered everything I needed to know.  I really, really like it.  Tasty, creamy, elegant and just spectacular.

Reduced to two-three-person servings and substituted mayo for sour cream. Also added red pepper flakes for a little zing. Cooked for 35 min. Really tasty.

I used what I had, so canned salmon, Miracle Whip and a local mild-tasting beer instead of salmon fillets, mayo, and white wine, respectively.  And the picture showed bread crumbs, so I added some Panko-type bread crumbs after baking, broiling it for a few minutes.  That also heated it up a bit, always an option if someone is late for dinner :)  Plus I used brown rice instead of white.  All good and all was good.  I will make it again (or at least some version of it).
   Good winter food!

I made this dish and agree with others that the base level (6 servings) that loads automatically when you first view this is too large, use the recipe for 3 servings for dinners of 4 persons or less. A pound of salmon has 4 portions in it using the standard of 4 ozs per person. Since you are adding rice, it will fill up a plate.

I switched out white wine for white  grape juice with a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.  I doubled the amount of curry powder required, I like a stronger curry taste.

This recipe needs a little more moisture, like maybe no more than 3/4 cup of water, milk or cream for the 3 person recipe.  This would make it easier for the rice to pick up the flavor.

One last thing.  This takes entirely too long to make and using the oven is not necessary to this kind of recipe, here are my suggestions to speed this up a bit.  

- Par boil the broccoli to desired tenderness.   (you can do this step while the sauce is melding below)
- Add all mixed ingredients (don't forget extra fluid as I spoke about above) to a dutch oven or large sauce pan and simmer, don't let it boil / burn.  
- After the sauce has cooked up a bit, maybe 10-20 minutes, throw in the salmon, turn the stove off and throw the lid on for 5 mins.  
- Check a piece of salmon and if it is cooked through, it is done.
- Throw some rice on a plate, add a layer of broccoli and then sauce to taste.

I made this recipe for my "girlfriend" during our first stay-at-home date about nine years ago.  She is now my wife.  She loves this recipe to this day.  I've never been crazy about it, only because there are better things to do with real salmon.  My suggestions: only use frozen salmon or fish on a great sale.  Also, triple or quadruple the seasoning.  I now use a combination of mild curry powder and garam masala.

I love trying new recipes at least once a week. Sorry, I think we discovered we don't like curry.

This was fine, but a little bland for my tastes.

This was great - everyone loved it! I used spinach instead of broccoli because that's what I had at hand. I also used less mayo than the recipe calls for, and a bit more curry. Served over brown rice.

It actually was great dish, I forgot a can of cream celery so I added cream of mushroom. I used Ranch dressing for a better flavor and added cayenne pepper just to get a little kick. I do think next time that I will add Apple juice instead of the white wine. I will definitely use this dish again. Thank you......

This is the best salmon dish I've ever had!  I made it just as written except I used lite sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  Not sure about the 6 servings--this made 10 HUGE servings.  I browned the salmon in a pan and then boiled the rice and broccoli, mixed them all together, and warmed them up in the oven.
