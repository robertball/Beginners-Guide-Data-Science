Great biscuits - very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and used butter-flavored shortening and upped the sugar to a Tbsp. After mixing the dough together I let it set in the fridge for a few hours before rolling it out and cuttting it. I didn't brush the biscuits with buttermilk, but with melted butter during the last five minutes of baking.  They come out light, moist, and fluffy. Plus they rise nice and high. Overall, very good especially the next day with butter and jelly.

These biscuits had a very good flavor. I didn't have self-rising flour so added 1 1/4 tsp baking powder and pinch of salt for each cup flour.
They didn't darken but were a light golden brown.

Delicious biscuits!! These biscuits taste like the ones my southern grandmother made when I was a child. My daughter loved these and I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

My husband's great grandmother made the best (so I've heard) buttermilk biscuits on Earth. She passed it down to his grandmother, she passed it down to his mother, and she passed it down to me. 
I decided to be prissy and find another recipe for buttermilk biscuits. These aren't as good as Mawmaw's.
My husband says they taste like the biscuits he loves at a small country resturaunt, but I think there's something missing. Strange because Mawmaw's recipe only calls for 3 ingredients: self-rising flour, shortening, and buttermilk.

Very good with great flavor.  A little more crispy on the bottom than I like but next time i will try 350 instead of 400.  This is the first time i have found a recipe that worked for me.  I usually use a mix.  Thanks very much

These biscuits were a nice texture, but I'd recommend to add a little salt because they were kinda tasteless.

The biscuits were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  By themselves they had very little flavor, but with a little sausage gravy or some honey and butter, they were ok.

I did not roll out the biscuits and cut them, but I formed them loosely by hand to avoid overmixing.  Even after doing that, the biscuits did not rise very much.  I also had to cook them a few minutes longer under the broiler to get the tops to brown.

Texture was OK, but not as light or fluffy as I would have liked.  Also, the biscuit was pretty much flavorless!  They may be palatable if soaked in gravy.

I made these as directed.  For the self rising flour, I used the recipe from this site because I could not find it at the store.  The biscuits were pretty easy and quick to make, but the finished product was not as flavorful as I hoped.  They were pretty bland by themselves.  However, I am still rating this 4 stars because if you put some honey on them and serve them warm, they are really quite good.  I can also see them being served with gravy or perhaps some kind of chicken and dumpling mixture and being good that way too.  I just don't recommend eating them by themselves.

So simple and easy to make!  I rolled mine out thick and got thick biscuits.  About 2" thick.  Also, I did not have shortening, so I used vegetable oil.  They were not as fluffy as my grandmother used to make them, but still delicious.

These biscuits were delicious! The only problem was the dough was super sticky and rolling it 1 inch thick was impossible. I just spooned it out on the cookie sheet, like cookie dough. It also made way more than 8 servings, so there was a lot of extra dough.

I love these biscuits, next time I make them I'll probably add some more sugar just to sweeten it a tad to suit my tastes.

These are NOT buttermilk biscuits like a restaurant,  Paula Deen or Grandma! There is WAY too much buttermilk, the mix is SO wet that you have to keep adding flour, so much so that you end up with a tough biscuit because of having to work with it. I've baked for many years, have a Southern Grandma and father. I HAD to make this recipe with my daughter for a Girl Scout project. I would never make it again....

These were incredibly bland - an okay vehicle for strawberries, jam, molasses, or honey, but very disappointing on their own.

I've never made biscuits from scratch and I chose this recipe for my first outing. My only change was that I used some Greek yoghurt in place of the buttermilk because I ran out and added a dash of salt. This recipe is a keeper....light, fluffy and yummy. Also, eAsy to do which took out the intimidation factor. I was very careful not to overwork the dough and I feel this was a key technique.

They were rather bland tasting and didn't rise at all.   They looked like cookies.  I was disappointed with how they turned out.

Great taste, very much like Cracker Barrel in taste.  Just 5 more minutes in prep than easy drop biscuits, why not make them?  Mine were a wee bit flat because I was out of baking powder, but still fluffy inside.  Also, I baked them at 350 instead of 400 to ensure the bottoms didn't get too crispy.  Tip:  Use whole buttermilk, not the fat free kind.  This gives them a more authentic taste that is memorable.  Exactly the same kind of biscuits made in Appalachia for a century.

Our biscuits turned out great!  We served them with a country gravy recipe found on here and everyone loved them.  The first time I made them I used a left-over oil blend from frying vegetables.  The second time around I used regular ol' shortening with a wee bit of salt.  I used whole wheat flour instead the second time and it still turned out great.

This biscuit tasted fine, however I had to add almost a half cup extra flour.  The tops did not get golden and I had to put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  The bottoms were a tad too crunchy.
