I made these just because I had them. Caramel and poptarts just don't go together.

I did not care for this recipe. Poptarts are not a vehicle for making desserts.

This combination was very processed and the flavors do not mix.

I did not like these...they stuck to the foil and were impossible to get off in one piece.  The flavors were not right together...I will never try a recipe that has a one star rating again!
