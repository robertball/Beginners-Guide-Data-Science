These were really good-I used my Irish quick oats that I adore, and instead of golden raisins used regular because i was out.  I also substituted walnuts for the almonds.  They were really good-I made them small, and they went fast!

Awesome! I made them into bars.  I used cranberries instead of raisins, sunflower seeds instead of almonds and honey instead of white sugar. turned out great!

I was looking for a new use for my McCann's Irish oatmeal and tried this recipe.  It turned out really great - so tasty and surprisingly filling!
I had to make some tweaks, which is not something I usually do (I'm a nervous cooker).  I was out of eggs so per the interwebs I used 1 Tbl Cornstarch and 2 Tbls water to equal 1 egg.  I also realized I did not have the quick cooking McCann's, so I did a mixture of partially cooked oats and some instant regular oatmeal that I had on hand.  I also decided to try the cinnamon mentioned in the description by sprinkling it on top before they went in the oven.  It smelled SO GOOD when the cooked.  They were a big crumbly in the end - but that actually gave them a unique charm and the flavor and texture were both just perfect.  Thanks so much!  These were our Christmas morning breakfast!

Used ingredients as directed and the cookies were very dry.  I think it needed a better bonding agent such as another egg; however the dough gave me great hope!

It’s great! I used regular oil instead of coconut (cause I don’t have it rn) and I didn’t use raisins. Next time I make it I would use less oats but other than that it’s great!

Not good at all. While the dough itself shows promise, the overall recipe is a disaster. It's much too dry and nothing will bind, so I end up with a tray full of crumbled cookies. The amount of dough is not nearly enough to absorb 3 cups of oatmeal, so you end up with oats everywhere. They cover the outside of the cookie and it looks like I rolled them in oatmeal after I got done cooking them, I had almost a cup worth of oats just fall off the cookies after they were baked. This was a total disaster and the cookies are mostly inedible. Probably going to throw them out. Definitely will not ever make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, even adding the extra egg as suggested in recipe, and they were very crumbly, barely holding together.  That being said, the crunchiness and sweetness and taste was good.

I love this recipie! I have made this cookie at least a dozen times. I bring it to parties. I have had many people ask for the recipie. It has a wonderful flavor and is just perfectly sweet. the golden raisen ratio is great. I dont use cupcake pans usually. I just form it into a ball and bake it on a cookie sheet. they come out good that way.

The dough is very, very dry. I added another egg to the dough and was much happier with the results.  I used dried peach pieces instead of raisins which added a tartness that I should have balanced out with a bit more sugar.

-I used canola oil and 2 eggs. I made half the dough with raisins and walnuts and half with chocolate chips. Cooked half in a mini muffin pan and half on a cookie sheet. Both turned out great regardless of how I baked them.
-The second time I made it I used whole wheat pastry flour, canola oil, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup unpacked brown sugar and butterscotch chips instead of raisins and almonds. Delicious again.

The cookies tasted good but the batter didn't bind and the baked cookies fell apart easily. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins, worked well.  I won't make this recipe again.
