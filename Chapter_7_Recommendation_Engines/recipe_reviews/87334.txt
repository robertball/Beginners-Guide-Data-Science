This is my "mema's" recipe and we just LOVE it!
She also told us that if tomato puree is not available we can:
OMITT WATER and use three 8 oz cans tomato sauce
		OR 
Use the Original Â½ cup water
plus an additional 6 oz. water,
one 6 oz. can tomato paste
and one 8 oz can tomato sauce.

Outstanding recipe! I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. It was easy to prepare and tastes great. What else would you want? I used a can of diced tomatoes and thought it was just fine instead of using the tomato puree. Served with Pork Chops with Jalapeno Jelly Lemon Pepper Zucchini and Pride Cabernet Franc. Yummy meal. Plan to serve again at a dinner party.

I made this for my father who is a total tomato lover. He absolutely loved it. I even saw him going back for thirds! I tried it myself not being a huge tomato fan and even I liked it. I think I'll be making this quite often!

I heard about a tomato pudding on NPR of all places and searched for a recipe. Glad I found this one. Just served it tonight for Christmas Eve dinner. All 10 adults there scarfed it down. It's easy. It's tasty. It's different. Followed the recipe exactly (well 11 slices of bread instead of 10) and it was lovely.

This is not a good recipe. There is not enough liquid to properly moisten the bread although I only used nine slices not ten. There's just too much bread. Also the oven temperature is too high and the baking time is too long. What I ended up with was dried out and burned bread cubes and a truly inedible casserole. Just for the record my stove is relatively new and is properly calibrated. I urge you to find another tomato pudding to try and when you do let me know. AK

My fiance who is Japanese had never heard of a savory pudding and was very skeptical to try this. His ultimate response? "Can you make this again tomorrow?" So yummy! I made topped it with pieces of parmesan chicken and served with a salad for a complete meal.
