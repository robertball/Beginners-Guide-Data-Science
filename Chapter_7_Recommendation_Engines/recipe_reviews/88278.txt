With some small modifications, this turned out to be the best double crust pie I have ever had! First of all, I used the "Basic Flaky Crust" recipe on this site for the crust, but I used 1 1/2 of the recipe for the bottom crust. I used 6 oz. of fresh blackberries instead of raspberries, and I mashed about 1/3 of the blackberries in a separate bowl. Then I added the sugar, cinnamon, and 1 TB of cornstarch (instead of flour) to the mash, and whisked the mixture until incorporated. After filling the pie crust with the rest of the peaches and blackberries, I drizzled the blackberry mash/cornstarch/sugar/cinnamon mixture over the top, put 4 1-TB pats of butter on top before covering with the top crust. Finally, I used an egg wash over the top of the crust, and sprinkled some sugar on top as well, baking as directed. The result was a decadent, delicious pie that was half eaten almost before it cooled! Great recipe that I will use again and again...

Wow! Unbelievably good. I substituted Splenda for baking for the sugar and did not add the butter. I used unbleached white flour. It was delicious and my guests raved and raved and all wanted this recipe. Substitutions make this a lower calorie   dessert good for diabetics and those who are watching their weight.

This is a favorite pie for my husband & I. If you don't have flavorful, in-season peaches then go with frozen peaches - they are better than tasteless, grainy, fresh ones. We always use frozen raspberries and it's delicious.

I had so many farmer's market peaches I ended up having to make 2 pies.  INCREDIBLE PIES!!! Everyone at the party absolutely adored them and I got tons of requests for the recipe.  I mixed the filling ingredients together and let them soak while rolling out the pie crusts.  Then I scooped the filling into the crusts leaving a lot of the juices behind, which I saved for topping ice cream.  The pie wasn't soggy at all.   It was gone before anyone could get seconds, and I can't wait to hit the farmer's market again so I can make another pie!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

This was a tasty fruit pie.  I used frozen peaches, blackberries instead of rasberries, and omitted the butter. I sauteed the fruit at low temp for a few minutes to extract the juices first so it wouldn't be runny.

I chose this recipe for my 1st homemade pie.  I used dried cranberries that I added a little water to reconstitute, simmered them on the stove for about 10 minutes until they plumped up nicely, and added an extra tablespoon of sugar to sweeten them up a bit.  I added the plumped cranberries to the peaches, drained it since my peaches were VERY ripe, and I didn't want a soggy pie.  I added 2 tsp cornstarch to avoid any mushy filling.  The pie was superb!  The cranberries' tartness was a nice compliment to my super sweet peaches.  My husband (who doesn't like peaches) LOVED this pie, and so did I.  This recipe is really worth a try!

I just made this pie for a second time, this time cutting my peaches into smaller pieces and my raspberries in half.  It was WONDERFUL!  It's definitely working it's way up toward the top of my favorite pie list.  I may add some more raspberry next time, but the recipe is wonderful as is!

My oldest son and I made this pie together. We used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust, which is also from this site. Instead of sprinkling the top crust with sugar, we used an egg wash. We didn't have plain frozen raspberries, we used a strawberry/raspberry/blackberry frozen berry blend. Instead of cutting a vent in the top, we cut a medium sized heart in the top crust before placing it over the pie. The baking time was a little off for us (we needed an extra 20 minutes) and I also tented our pie with foil so it wouldn't burn on the top. We haven't tried it yet, it's cooling but I do have one thing to say about the pie--it's REALLY juicy. Like REALLY juicy. I don't know if it's because we used frozen berries/peaches but wow, I was really surprized. I don't know that we'll use frozen fruit again. I did sneak a little of the juice from the pie and it seemed perfectly sweetened to me. I'll update my review once we've had a chance to cut into it. UPDATE: We really liked this pie but it was very wet. If I make this again I'll make sure to thaw the fruit out better before using it or add more flour OR I'll use fresh fruit. I want to try this again. Even with it's extra "juice", this was a hit with my family and my oldest boy called this one a win for the third pie he's made.

Absolutly delicious! I took it to a dinner party and it got great reviews.  I cheated and bought a premade crust, but it still was delicious.  I waited a couple hours after baking to serve it, so it did get a little runny.  Next time I'll try to serve it immediatly.

Made as written - wouldn't change a thing! Delicious! Used store bought pie crust. Brought it to my office for my boss' birthday and he and my co-workers all raved over it.

Really good! I peeled and cut the peaches into cube-ish shapes, and tried to collect as much juice from them as I could, including by pressing the peels against a wire collander. Then I mashed about 1/3 of the raspberries, added the peach juice to the mash, then added about 1.5 tbsp cornstarch to the juice/mash mix and whisked it all together. Tossed that with the peach pieces and the remaining raspberries, then tossed it all with the white sugar, and poured it into the crust. I used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust from this site, and coated the top crust with an egg wash before sprinkling with sugar. This was really tasty, thickened up very well and was quite sweet - if you're not a huge sweet tooth and have very ripe fruit, you could definitely cut back on the white sugar.

This  had a wonderful flavor! I did a crumb topping instead of double crust. 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tbs butter cut in til crumbly. Baked about 45 min at 375 til crumbs were toasted on top. Yummy!

This is my new favorite pie recipe! I used frozen peaches and fresh raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. I let the frozen peaches thaw and then I sliced them once more down the middle, because I prefer thinner slices of fruit in my pie. After reading all of the reviews about runniness, I was determined not to have a runny pie. First I strained all of the fruit, then I blotted every piece of fruit with a paper towel to cut down on the juices. Then after I added the sugar, flour and cinnamon I strained the fruit again before putting it in my pie crust. I would suggest doing a lattice crust if you can, because since the pie is so juicy it burst out of the top crust in a few places and it wasn't so pretty, and I like to show of the appearance of my pies as well as the taste. =) This pie was phenomenal.

Such a delicious pie! I replaced the raspberries with blueberries, and cut the ¾ cup of sugar down to ? since I found the filling to be quite sweet. Otherwise a fantastic recipe!

as written this pie is wondeful very very similar to a recipee I used to use as a pastry chef.  I usually use cornstarch and tapioca instead of flour but it is fine with flour when the tapioca dissappears from the panty.  my favoite variation is to add splash of Grand marnier and 1 Tble frsh orange zest to the peaches when I don't have frsh raspberries on hand.  yummy

This was a great pie.  
I made if for my neighbors and they loved it.  Making it with frech peaches is the way to go. The berries add another favor that is great.  I will make this again this summer.

Oh yeah, this was good. My husband and father in law actually went picking to get more raspberries so I could make another one. They still talk about it. This is so good that I doubt I can wait for fresh fruit and will probably try it with frozen. Soon.

I followed someones recommendation to use part cornstarch (I did a little under 1tbs) mashed up with 1/3 of the blackberries (in season right now) and then used flour mixed in with the peaches and other blackberries for the remaining 2tbs. *Helpful Hint* To remove the skin from peaches try blanching them; 30-45 seconds in boiling hot water taken off the heat followed by 15 seconds in an ice bath (to keep the peach from continuing to cook). The skin slipped right off into my fingers :).  I made this with "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" and the shortbready like flavor was a perfect complement to this recipe. I'm submitting the two pies I made into a contest tomorrow, wish me luck :)

This pie has a good flavor, next time I may lessen the sugar but my husband liked it alot. I think next time I will double the cornstarch (I like it better than flour) to make it less runny. If it were less runny it would have gotten more stars.

Excellent!  I substituted blueberries, strawberries and blackberries (a mix of all 3, totaling 5 cups), added 4 T. of butter (cut up in 1 T. cubes and putting them under the top crust), substituted 1 T. of cornstarch in lieu of the flour, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We LOVED it!!!  Will definitely make again and again!

I would have given this pie 5 stars for flavor but it was VERY runny. It still tasted great but next time I will make sure to drain the fruit and use 1 Tbl of cornstarch along with the flour. I will also add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I did not make a double crust pie. I made a struesel topping using 1/3 cup flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a 1/2 stick of butter mixed together and sprinkled on top.

This is hard to rate...I have no doubts that the recipe is wonderful when using super ripe, middle-of-season fresh WHITE peaches. Unfortunately, it's coming to the end of the season here, and I could not find white peaches anywhere. Maybe the peaches weren't ripe enough...anyway, despite all the sugar, my pie turned out so very tart it was hard to eat. This is definitely a June-July-or August pie...not a fall/winter treat.

I've made this pie 3 times and each time it has been met with enthusiastic response. I have some peach trees that are giving me so much fruit and I've been trying to find a way to use it all up. Twice I've made it with blackberries (frozen and fresh) and once with raspberries. If you use frozen fruit, you'll need to let it drain a bit longer to accommodate the defrosting of the fruit. I made the recipe exactly as written, except added a bit more cinnamon and cut my butter pats into about 6 pieces to more evenly distribute it around the pie. I finished the top crust with an egg was, sprinkled generously with sugar, and baked for exactly the 45 minutes. Each time it has come out perfect. I will make this a staple recipe in my kitchen!

Scrumptious pie!  I noticed that prior reviews mentioned there was a bit too much liquid for their tastes, so I heated the peaches up on the stove with 2 tablespoons of corn starch and a tiny bit of water.  I brought it to a boil, let the corn starch "work its magic", then drained it (saving the juice for peach/ice cream sundaes).  Then I added the sugar, cinammon, butter, and 1/4 tsp vanilla (not in recipe).  I folded the raspberries in right before putting it in the crust, so that they didn't get too mushy. I also did a quick brush of milk on top of the crust prior to adding the sugar.  I baked it at 375 instead of 400, as 400 in my oven would have resulted in a blackened mess! The end result was fabulous!  Not too soupy at all.  Next time, I would put the raspberries on top of the peaches after I spread them into the pie crust, just to ensure each piece has an even amount.  Some pieces of mine were very berry and others more peachy.

This pie was amazing.  I used blackberries instead of raspberries but otherwise followed ingredients exactly.  My only warning is that 45 minutes in a 400 degree oven was about 12 minutes too long...just keep an eye on it.  Great pie...will make again!

Everyone loved this pie. I made it for Thanksgiving with frozen fruit, since peaches and raspberries are out of season here. Instead of making vents, I used a cookie cutter to cut out a shape (I used a star) in the center of the top crust before placing it on the pie. I thawed the raspberries in a colander for 1/2 hour as the package recommended. The peaches did not need to per thawed per package instructions. I had no problems with a runny pie at all. I baked it on the lowest rack, on a preheated cookie sheet, as America's Test Kitchens recommends.

this is my favorite pie recipe * I use a different berry every time and it always turns out right - I've even used a giant pie plate doubled the recipe using blueberries, served it to guests and was told it was the best pie ever and i agreed.

This pie was GREAT! I've never made homemade pie and this was a wonderful first time. The only problem I had was pitting and slicing the peaches because I wasn't sure how to go about that. The pie came out perfectly and tasted so great. I used frozen raspberries that I defrosted and those worked well. The only complaint I had was that every so often while eating the pie I would bite into a hard raspberry but that's just how the fruit is. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I made a crust from AR web site and brushed the crust with an egg wash before baking.  Flavor is delicious, but fruit consistency is a little runny.  Delicious in spite of that!

This pie turned out pretty well.  Just use a good pastry recipe and fresh fruit.  The only modification I'd make is reduce or skip the cinnamon altogether as both me and my husband found it a bit overpowering, but that just personal preference.   Overall, a delicious recipe!

Fabulous Pie!!  My husband said it was the best pie he Ever ate! I made it using the pie crust recipe on Allrecipes called "Pie Crust 1" by Brenda.  It was delicious!!!  I followed the comment of using some brown sugar -1/2 cup white w/1/4 c. brown sugar.  I added about 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract to the fruit mix and I put an egg wash on the crust before sprinkling the sugar.  It not only tasted awesome, but looked like an award winner.

This pie is fantastic, not too sweet, full fruit flavor. I followed this recipe as written, using Best Ever Pie Crust form this site. I also used a deep-dish pie pan, so I increased the fruit by 2 cups and adjusted the flour & sugar accordingly (left the cinnamon at 1t). Simpy delicious! I've been trying to get a picture as the guys eat through it. We'll see . Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this pie for the first time and I am happy to report, this pie is AMAZING!

Few things:

Most of the time needed to prepare this pie went into getting the peaches ready.  Here's the easiest way to peal peaches:

- Place whole peach in boiling water for 30 seconds.

- Remove from boiling water with slotted spoon and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.

- Pull skin off using blade edge of paring knife to grab peel. Also use this method to peel other fruits such as apricots and tomatoes.

I used frozen raspberries, a store bought pie crust, and instead of coarse sugar on top, I used regular sugar mixed cinnamon.  

Other than those subtle substitutes, I followed the recipe and I got a delicious pie that was a tiny bit runny at first slice but after a few minutes, it was a good consistency.  I think I just cut into it too soon, so next time I make this, I will either add a little cornstarch OR be patient.  ;)

SHEER DELIGHT! an absolutely amazing pie. I made two at the same time - and of course I had to make adjustments to what I had on hand - for two pies I used one can of drained peaches (reserved the syrup and used with some confectioners sugar for icing on a cake I made) and one bag of frozen peach slices defrosted and drained. I did have frozen raspberry's (again defrosted drained) I used a tad more sugar than called for maybe a quarter cup (I really dislike measuring), because these weren't fresh and nearing over-ripe peaches after all. I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the peaches. Here is where I erred: I should have kept the berries and the peaches separate I mixed everything together and the peach slices turned a lovely red. The pies were perfect, they were delicious, but I think I should have kept the fruit separate, put the peach slices in and then added the raspberry's over top.. I think presentationally, it would have looked a bit nicer. That said - This is a wonderful, delicious pie, it was raved over, I gave one to my neighbor and he and his wife have yet to stop talking about it. I think if one were to try different fruits... mango would work in place of peaches!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great basic recipe...here are my 2 suggestions.

1. Add a tablespoon of cornstarch along with the flour. It will really help if you have extra juicy fruit.

2. Bake, then chill overnight. Don't even try to eat this warm out of the oven. You will have a mess on your hands!

This was the best pie I've ever made!  I used fresh peaches and raspberries that I picked at the orchard.  I blanched the peaches in water and then placed then in a water bath to remove the skin.  I made my own pie crust. I read reviews about the pie being runny, so I added 1 T. tapioca, which seemed to do the trick.  I also forgot to add the butter, but I don't know how much of a difference this is supposed to make.  The result was amazing when served with vanilla bean ice cream!

I admit that I didn't make sure the water was drained off the fruit well before I put the fruit and other filling ingredients together.  I'm do wonder if this pie would have been better if I had done that.  It wasn't sweet enough and we didn't like the peach and raspberry flavors together very much.  If you make this pie be sure to drain or even spin the water off the fruit.

Great taste.  We used a store bought Pillsbury rollout crust to save time.  It was a little runny at first but that is only because we could not wait to eat it and we ate it almost right out of the oven.  It does take longer to cook, in fact it took me 10 minutes at 400 and then 55 minutes at 350.  I also used frozen peaches and frozen raspberries.

This is my first review, but I felt compelled based on our experience to contribute.  I've gotten many good recipes from the site, but this by far was the overall tastiest / easiest of all! I followed the recipe exactly, even using ready made crusts for further ease... it is DELISH!!! and takes just about 10-15 min for prep

Super delicious and easy, I have never made a fruit pie without canned filling before and this recipe allowed me to nail it my first go. The first pie (made two in two days, it was that good) was a little runny even with the draining step: the second pie I added 3tsp minute tapioca as some other recipes call for and while the pie was a great texture I thought the addition just slightly diminished the super fresh flavor of the peaches the first one had. Looks or taste: I'll be making this pie both ways in the future depending who/what for, either way it's an amazing pie. Thank you so much for sibmitting.

Mmmm delicious!  I didn't have raspberries, and just so happened to have some fresh-picked blueberries that I used instead.  I put the blueberries and peaches in a large bowl together and put a few tablespoons of sugar on them. I'm a huge fan of vanilla, so I put (it was eyeballed) but probably about 3 tsp of vanilla on the fruit.  I let that sit and marinade with the sugar and fruit for about 10 minutes.  I put the flour, sugar and cinnamon in as the recipe suggested, but found it to be a little runny. I put a little bit (no more than 1 tsp) of cornstarch in, in an attempt to thicken it.  I think it helped but the moral of this story is to make sure you have properly strained your fruits after you have washed them and before they go into the mix.  But messiness aside, it was delicious!  Definitely will make again!  :D

I used Strawberries instead of Raspberries in this pie and we loved it!  The only thing I would change is that I would use at least another 1/2 to 1 c. of berries in the recipe. Other than that, Fantastic!  Not too sweet, just enough tartness. Just Perfect!

This makes a beautiful pie.  I make my own oil pastry crust but whatever crust recipe you choose this will be a sumpiously delicious offering.  Freezes well.  If you do freeze, bake frozen and add an extra 30 minutes to the cook time.

I made this pie as directed, (except that I forgot to add the butter to the fruit) with the exception of substituting blueberries for raspberries and both my husband and I thought it was my best pie ever (and I have been known to make some wonderful pies).  The first time I made it I used peaches which were not ripe enough to ooze juice and the pie slices came out intact and perfect.  I made it again five days later with peaches left over from the first pie and I should have followed the instruction for allowing the juice to run out because the second pie was quite runny.  In the future I'll try to use not-quite-ripe peaches.  I also brushed the bottom of my pie shell (a basic pate brisee) with egg white to prevent it from getting soggy, and brushed the top of the pie with the eggwhite as well (just to make it pretty).  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

OMG!This pie is fantastic. These changes made it perfect!  I used 2 T. flour to toss with the fruit instead of 3. I used 2 t. cornstarch and mixed in with the drained fruit juices - why waste all that flavor ? Omitted the butter.  Used the Never Never Fail Pie crust from this site. Also, gauge the sugar by the sweetness of the fruit.  Mine was very sweet, so I added 2 T. less than called for.  You have to make it.  It's heaven.  I just now had it warm and it was to die for. Also I did the top crust with strips in a basket weave.  This allowed it to vent better and not run. Also it was gorgeous that way.

I haven't made a pie in a long time, so I loved that this one was pretty easy to make. It was also pretty tasty.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and boiled the peaches for about 20-30 seconds, then plunged into cold water (it doesn't have to be ice cold--water from the tap worked fine).The skins peeled off very easily. However, they were pretty slippery after that and much harder to pit than a dry peach. Maybe pitting them first is better? I also thought the filling was just a little too tart for my taste. I might try blueberries (or leave out the berries all together) next time. It definitely was not as juicy as some people complained about.  Maybe because I let the fruit drain for about 30 minutes after simmering for 5, or maybe because I added a tsp of cornstarch.

The juice didn't thicken up quite enough for me, though I imagine it varies depending on the ripeness of the fruit. I tried this combining peaches and sweet cherries and it was delicous!

This is an outstanding recipe. The raspberries add just the right tartness for the peaches. Mine were mostly nectarines that I had frozen, along with some mangoes I mistakenly thought were peaches :) so there wasn't as much juice as I prefer. I can't wait to try this pie with fresh peaches, but even with nectarines and mangoes, it was delicious!

So delicious! I used 6 cups peaches, NOT 4 cups. Also, mix peaches/berries with 1/2 cup sugar, let drain 30 mins. Reserve fluid for ice cream sauce. Mix remaining 1/4c sugar with cinnamon and 1.5Tbsp cornstarch (?more with increased peaches) and stir into peaches just prior to adding to pie crust. Don't forget to do egg wash on bottom of crust and dot top of pie with butter!

I'm not one of those "I take pictures of my food" people, but I *did* take a picture of this pie. It was so pretty, and SO tasty. I was very proud of myself with this one! :)

Thought this recipe was great.  We bought a bushel of peaches at the market.  I used my homemade pie crust.  The only change was I brushed the crust with beaten egg before sprinkling with coarse sugar.  I baked on a metal baking sheet lined with foil.  Some liquid did run out, so I was glad I did!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I'm giving this four stars because it came out very watery. I did drain all of the fruit, but it still resulted in a lot of liquid in the pie. To prevent this, using cornstarch or minute tapioca should help. I'll try that next time. Otherwise, the pie turned out great. Flavors were really nice!

I tried the recommended changes mashing 1/3 of the berries ( I used blueberries with good results) with the sugar (I used Splenda), cinnamon and cornstarch rather than flour.  I used frozen peaches (allowed to drain/thaw for about 2 hrs - still a little icy but worked fine) and fresh blueberries.  Also used the egg wash with raw sugar top.  Turned out great...not at all soupy, fresh but not too sweet; crust was gorgeous brown.  I let it bake for 10 min; put a crust shield on it for 30 min and took it off for 5-10 min. Terrific recipe.

Amazing. I used a very easy pie crust with it instead of the store bought kind. I mixed 2 1/2 cups flour and 1 tsp salt together. then i cut in 1 stick cold butter and 1/2 cup cold shortening with a blender and kichen aid mixer. it should look like pebbles. Next i put in 6-9 tbsps cold water while still beating. Kneed just enough to form two balls. Falten the balls into thick discs and wrap them up and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or longer. And that's it. Easy. Its very important to have fresh peaches and slice them thinly. To pick great peaches smell them at the store. If you can smell a strong peach smell they are fresh. I also skipped the butter and it turned out great. This recipe is a keeper.

I am not a pie person, but this recipe has turned me completely around!  I substituted the raspberries with blackberries.  I made it with the butter flaky crust recipe on this site and the end-result was excellent!  My husband, our neighbor and I all loved it!  I will be making this again and again!

Just made this recipe last night for my husband and all I can say is AMAZING. It turned out great and he has not stopped raving about it! This will definitely be a recipe I make several times over! I made it exactly according to the recipe posted and it turned out great. I did drain a little of the fluid off as I was transferring into the pie crust though. Wonderful find!

Made this from fresh peaches from our yard and fresh berries. As some suggested I used corn starch instead of flour and used 1/4 c of it.  It was still a little watery but not as bad as some recipes.  Not very sweet.  I would add more sugar to the filling and crust next time.  Tasted better the second day.

Delicious! I used the butter flaky pie crust recipe from this site, frozen raspberries, and 4 heaping cups of peaches. I thought it needed a little more fruit so I added about 1 cup more of frozen peaches since I didn't have any more fresh ones. It turned out great!

Mine came out soupy :(. However, it was pretty tasty. I plan to do some research on how to make an awesome pie and then re-attempt this.

Delicious flavor!  One recommendation: Mix dry ingredients together first to prevent flour from clumping. Also, the filling didn't hold together very well, so once sliced, we had to spoon it out of the dish.  But--none was leftover; everyone loved it! I would like to make this with the same filling, except as a crisp.

I use frozen peaches so I can make this year round.  I use 3 1 pound bags of peaches and half a bag of frozen raspberries.  I also use 1/2 c white sugar & 1/4 c brown sugar.  It's sucha pretty color too. Thanks for a lovely recipe.

Delicious. I too used the Basic Flaky Crust recipe from this site. The flavour combo and the crust were perfect. Now I need to give some of these pies away before I gain 1000lbs.

This pie was so good! Changes: I substituted 1/4 c. of the 3/4 c. sugar with brown sugar, added 1/2 c. rasins, and used my own crumb topping (1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. flour, cinnamon, and 1/4 c. butter) This also was a very simple recipes, no tedious tasks!

Very good. i used blueberries because that was all i had.  I left out the butter and it was still great.  Spread a little cream over the top crust and sprinkled sugar over it (before baking). Yum!  will definetly make again.

I made this with 4 c. very good Jersey sliced peaches, no berries.  (Put in boiling water for a minute or so and the skins slipped right off - slippery suckers, though!)  I added some cinnamon, a little nutmeg and a little ginger.  I also added 1 t. cornstarch and did not drain the peaches.  I used about 1/4 c. Demerara sugar (like coarse dry light brown sugar) instead of all white (brown would probably work well too).  I put a sheet of foil on the shelf under the pie just in case it leaked, but it didn't!  Sprinkled Demerara on top of crust.  Very good flavor.  Will use this recipe again!  Everyone that tried it, loved it.

Just yum! My hubby said it was the best pie he'd ever had. I did it with homemade crust and a lattice top to let some of the water evaporate. Even better (I think) after sitting overnight in the fridge. Then again I am partial to cold pie. Glad I made this one!

Pretty tasty pie. I used frozen fruit mix and let them drain for a good while after I ran water over them to thaw. Got to try and get as much fluid as possible out of the fruit before baking. I used a much smaller amount of sugar...it's really not necessary to use so much when you're baking with sweet fruits. I completely forgot the butter and didn't miss it at all. Will definitely make again when I've got peaches to use up.

I used the Pillsbury ready-made pie crust which made preparation a little easier.  In addition, I followed the directions given by maiyamac.  I mashed most of the raspberries, a few peach slices, the cinnamon, sugar, and cornstarch together.  That mixture was then poured on the peach slices that I put in the pie pan.  It came out great -  a nice combination of tart and sweet.

Fantastic dessert to end an evening with a cup of coffee.  Aesthetically pleasing and beautiful blend of sweet peaches and tart raspberries.  Serve with ice cream and you'll be quite pleased.  Very easy to make as well.

I drained the peaches very well, they were fresh peaches from my garden. I followed the instructions exactly but the pie was very wet, had to serve it with a spoon and when a piece was removed all the filling poured into the space.

Yeah, this was awesome. I had fresh raspberries, and used frozen peaches, and Pillsbury pie crust.  I topped it off before serving with a chilled vanilla sauce and it was really really good.

Excellent! The tartness of the raspberries goes very well with the peaches. I never thought of putting the two together. Although I doubled the amount of flour.

So yummy! Made it exactly as written. Worked great because I had super sweet white peaches that were hard like apples, so it held together nicely without getting squishy.

I used good quality frozen peaches and fresh raspberries, made exactly as recipe stated. We ate this with homeade vanilla ice cream and this was VERY tasty! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because my filling was a little runny, which is not the recipes fault, I don't think I let all the liquid drain off well enough. Also, my crust on bottom was a little doughy. But that is probably becuase of the liquid in my fruit. :-( Even with those little flaws, this pie was VERY good and EASY!! I will make again, but I'll be sure that my fruit is dry!

Using the "most useful" reviews as a guide, this pie is awesome! I have never made a pie before this, and it was soooo good. Used sugar substitute "for baking" with no problem. The recipe as is does not garner 5 stars.

This is a very easy recipe for such a delicious pie!  I used frozen peaches and raspberries and also followed others suggestions of 3/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. granulated sugar, and a tsp. of cinnamon.  I don't like to make crust, so instead, I used the Pillsbury deep dish frozen crusts which worked great.  The package had 2 crusts, so I doubled the dry ingredients and used the entire bag of peaches and about 3/4 of the raspberries.  For the top crust, I used the crumble crust recipe from this site.  It does make a lot of topping, but for 2 pies, it was the perfect amount.  I baked them for 35 minutes at 400, but then turned my oven down to 350 for the last 10 minutes because the edges of the crust were starting to brown too much for my liking.  They took about 2 hours to cool &settle completely but it was worth the wait.

I made this last night for the family and it was a success.  I followed the recipe as is but added an egg wash on the top pie shell before baking.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy. Friends and family loved this pie and told me I had to rate it a 5. I added blueberries instead of raspberries and half white/half brown sugar. I also added an egg wash to the top crust before sprinkling with sugar. I will absolutely make this again.

Mmm! Delicious! I love apple pie but I was in the mood for something different and this definitely did the trick! I used canned peaches because peaches are not in season right now and it turned out wonderful! A lattice top gives it a nice touch. Thank you, everybody loved this!

Delicious! I loved the flavor the raspberries added. (However, my husband does not like the seeds that berries add to pie and this mix of flavors was not enough to get him past this. So if you have someone like this in your life, use this as a very good peach pie recipe and replace the raspberries with extra peaches.)

This pie was a little tart for my tastes, but I did forget to put sugar on the crust, so that was part of the problem.  Next time, I'll use 1 cup of sugar and sprinkle some on the crust.  Also, I did not drain any of the fruit.  I used 3 fresh peaches and 2 cups of fresh huckleberries.  I only used 1 tbsp flour and 2 tbsp corn starch, no butter.

The BEST pie filling ever! (I made it as a cobbler because it's easier than making it as a pie!) I doubled the raspberries, used only 2/3 cup sugar (we don't like it too sweet) and only 2 tablespoons flour. The flour is tricky because it does thicken the juice, but it also dampens the flavor. If your fruit is super juicy, you may need more flour, and less if it's not so juicy. We prefer less flour and a runnier, tastier juice. You can then put the juice on vanilla ice cream or just eat it with a spoon -- yum! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I made this pie for a 4th of July picnic. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect. Even though no one raved over it I thought it was great and super easy to make.  Like someone else stated, I will add more raspberries next time and use yellow peaches.  I used white peaches and even though they were sweet, the peach flavor wasn't as strong as in yellow peaches.

Tasty pie that wasn't cloyingly sweet, and easy to make to boot. It would probably be a five-star review if I had used riper peaches. Guess I'll have to make it again to see. Oh well.

Just wonderful, and very easy to make. I used fresh peaches and blackberries, and did include the butter. I drained the fruit for approximately 20 minutes and added 1 tsp of corn starch based on other reviews. The pie came out perfect- a little juicy, but received rave reviews.

This pie was simply delicious. I even used a Pillsbury crust! It was quite soupy even after cooling on the counter for 3-4 hours. I refrigerated it and about 4 hours later, it was perfect! Sweet with a little tartness...I wish I had some vanilla Ice cream but I am afraid it will all be gone before I can get to the store! Thanks so much!

Made this pie over the summer when one of my friends brought us some fresh peaches  (I had the raspberries). Was it yummy! The pie was full of flavor and not too sweet; it held together well, was nice and juicy, and went great with a scoopful of vanilla bean ice cream. By the end of the evening, there was one piece left! I would make this pie again.

outstanding. thank you. my husband and neighbors loved it. i followed the recipe exactly but used a glass pie pan. didn't have enough filling to make a nice, well packed pie. would add another cup or two of peaches as well as use two cups of raspberries instead of one. adjust the sugar, etc. to taste. i didn't change anything and it had a delightful sweet tart taste.

Awesome recipe! I ended up using 3 cups fresh peaches, and a bag of frozen blackberries (about 2 cups) and it was really good. The first day or so it was really runny, but I think that was due to the blackberries (or the peaches). I might try a tablespoon of cornstarch and see if that helps but after a day or so the juice got absorbed. Whatever combo you put in this pie, I don't think you can go wrong!

I made this as a gift for a friend's family, and they absolutely loved it. I omitted the top crust, and just made a lattice with some pastry strips. I am by no means a good baker, but this turned out wonderfully, and looked picture-perfect too. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks so much!

Very good, not too sweet.  I used the Never Never Fail Pastry recipe with this instead of store bought crust.

I made this pie last night and it was excellent.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and you couldn't tell the difference.  A different twist on peach pie that my husband loved.  Thank you for this great recipe

I've made this pie twice now.  It is wonderful!  I added blueberries to the mix and used Never Fail Pie Crust II.  It did need additional time to bake.  I added about 25 minutes to the bake time and covered to avoid the edges from overcooking.  Awesome pie!

Yum!  I used cranberries in place of raspberries.  So good!  I also used frozen fruits.  I made the mistake of using a deep dish pie pan so it ended up a little light on the fruit.  Next time I’ll use more fruit for sure....but this is my mistake....not the recipe.  Try this recipes out if you want something a little different than apple pie.  You won’t be disappointed!

I made this but I made changes, I just needed a base recipe for a peach raspberry pie...  I don't like fruit pies made with flour so I put in quick tapioca in its place.  I also prefer pies topped with crumbles so I mixed 1/2 cup flour & 1/2 cup brown sugar, and cut in 3 tablespoons butter.  Covered the top of the pie with the crumbles before popping it in the oven and cooked it till the crumbles were golden.  Came out great, would make it again.  I posted a pic of the outcome.

What did you do with the peach juice that drained from the cut peaches and raspberries?  You didn't toss it did you?!  Add some of the Cinnamon and sugar to the juice and pour it in a batch of sun tea for a really tasty peach summer tea!  I couldn't bring myself to dump it down the drain and had a pitcher of sun tea in the windowsill.  It was amazing!

I used "maiyamac"s modifications (see that other review in this recipe), though I stuck with raspberries and didn't use blackberries.  Nevertheless "maiyamac"s changes made it GREAT !!  Even though I'm an amateur, I found that doing a simple weave of he top crust really made it look especially beautiful.  See the photo of my result if you don't believe me...   :-)

I followed the directions exactly as written.  Based on another review, I not only drained the fruit, but also patted it with paper towels to remove just a little more juice.  I used my own pie crust recipe to make a lattice top crust.  Served with vanilla ice cream at a small dinner party with friends.  HUGE HIT!  This is my new go-to recipe for peach pie.  Thanks, Barnbabe13 for a great dessert!

This was good, nothing different about it but a good solid pie. I did find for my taste there was too much cinnamon - with in season peaches and raspberries it seemed we could have skipped the cinnamon, or reduced it to 1/4 tsp. I also found there was not enough flour, next time I'd maybe use 2 tbsp cornstarch instead.

This pie turned out great.  I did 2T flour and 1T cornstarch and it wasn't runny.  Used fresh peaches and frozen raspberries as well a premade crust which I made into a lattice.  Looked good and tasted good!

I've made this pie over and over again, and it's become a favorite of my family. I suggest adding a bit of cornstarch when mixing the filling, but I have skipped this step and still had good results. Also, this recipe is best with a homemade butter crust. Delicious!

This pie was easy to make.  I used 1 T cornstarch and  2 T flour, so pie was not runny.  Instead of sugar I used Truvia, which made it very tart.  Next time I think I will use half Truvia and half sugar to keep down the calories but make it sweeter.

Great pie!  I didn't have raspberries but had blackberries instead.  I don't have good luck with fruit pies.  They always fall apart and bubble out the top, so next time I think I'll make a cobbler with this recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I made several changes: used nectarines instead of peaches, half a cup of brown sugar plus 1/4 cup white sugar, added 1 tbsp tapioca, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and did a lattice top.  I also baked the pie on a preheated cookie sheet because I always end up with a soggy bottom crust.  I used the other reviewer's suggestion of leaving the pie in the oven to cool.    My only problem was that the nectarines towards the middle of the pie were not cooked enough, even though I left the pie in for almost an hour.  This could be because they were not ripe enough but next time I will cook it longer.

Wow. Absolutely fabulous.  And I've only ever made about 4 pies in my life. I used the recipe for Basic Flaky Pie Crust on this site (also excellent), and followed maiyamac's review modifications (currently most popular review), only I used 1/2 cup fresh raspberries and 1/2 cup fresh blackberries. I also used frozen sliced peaches as it is January in Indiana. Word of warning: It takes a long time to thaw out frozen peaches, so put them in your colander and let them sit for an hour or so more. Definitely don't want all that frozen moisture leaking excess moisture into your pie. I suppose I could have nuked them a little, but I hated to mess with them too much. I've had 2 slices so far today, and may have another before bed. Thank you!!

I am just learning to bake and thought I would try this pie because it looked simple enough and I had just went to Costco and had more than enough peaches and raspberries than I knew what to do with.  The pie turned out perfectly (I only used a 1/2 cup sugar).  It is very refreshing and tasty.

This was ok. I'd probably give it 3 stars if I didn't hear from others that it was good. I followed the recipe with the addition of a tbsp of corn starch to combat some of the liquid. It needed something to me, and it was still really runny, even after sitting for an entire night. Next time I'll do 1/2 brown sugar, reduce the raspberries because they dominated the flavor, and add in a few more peaches. Also, I picked my own peaches, but they weren't super sweet. Next time I'll user really ripe peaches or canned.

I made this last night and it's delicious.  I accidentally bought blackberries though, which I believe have bigger seeds, so next time I will definitely remember raspberries.  Did not have any coarse sugar for the top, but regular sugar worked fine too.

Very good pie! I used "Simple Pie Crust IV" for the crust. The second time I made it used strawberries instead of raspberries and it was just as good.

Excellent-a hit with everyone and easy to make too.  I used a cup of frozen blackberries because I had them in the freezer.  I used a mix of white and yellow peaches.  In the summer this is a cheap and easy pie to make.

We love this pie!  I use two cans carb-friendly peaches and one little container (about a cup) of fresh raspberries.  Now I just need to perfect pie crust and it will be perfect!

*Excellent recipe, but reading the comments made a huge difference. *Used two c. frozen rasperries and 3 c. frozen peach *put completed fruit mixture through a strainer spoon, then into the pie crust. Worked GREAT!  *Wonderful with crumble crust- I prefer a white sugar recipe.

The flavor was good.  The consistency was very soupy (I even used fresh peaches, drained them, and added 2 teaspoons of corn starch).  The pie crust on top just didn't work out very well for me.  It crumbled all over the place as soon as I placed it on top.

I made this with blackberries (and my first homemade piecrusts) instead of raspberries, and served it over vanilla ice cream right after it came out of the oven. Nobody could stop raving about it!

Very good! I used a from scratch recipe that I have for the pie crust. It's a little watery but with so much juicy fresh fruit in it, it can't be avoided I guess.

This pie was delicious! I underestimated the amount of peaches needed for 4 cups, but used some kiwi and it was still superb. I will definitely make it again.

This was a very easy and very yummy pie! I didn't have raspberries, so I used blueberries and it turned out super tasty! I accidentally used too much cinnamon, but it actually tasted awesome!! The pie came out a little runnier than I hoped for, but that was my fault for not draining enough juice from my very over ripe fresh peaches. I ended up using 6 1/2 cups of fruit vs. the 4 cups and I made my own crusts using a family recipe. I would make this again!!!!

I used frozen peach slices for this pie because fresh ones in Wisconsin in the middle of February are a little hard to come by!  I made this pie to bring to a church luncheon and the only *delicious* taste I got of it was when I licked the bowl that I mixed the filling together in because by the time I got to my dessert at the luncheon, my pie was gone.  That has to be a good sign, right?

It was good. people said they liked it but they weren't overly impressed. It was good but not as fantastic as I thought it was going to be. pretty average for a pie and didn't taste as peachy as I would have liked. good, but not fantastic.

Mmmm, it was so fun to make.
My only problem was that even thought I put them in the colander for a long time it was still really gooey.
but that's cool, I liked it that way :)

It was a major hit! I did a bit of guess work with the sugar, (I was short cinnamon so I added the cinn/sugar mix that I have ready for morning toast). I also added a bit of brown sugar to the mix, and used frozen cherries. For stability, I added a bit of corn starch. Delish!

This pie is a great idea! I used (some overly ripe) blueberries, 1/2 peach, apple, figs (from neighbor's tree - spooned out the centers) - I also heated some frozen fruit with sugar in a pot (cranberries + other berries) gave it some yummy tartness. I warmed up the crusts in oven first to speed up cooking  since 50% of my fruit had already been cooked on stove.  Anyway,  mixed everything with some flour and sugar and put it in the oven for 30 mins and presto!  note- I used less sugar than called for and I didn't use any butter.

I made this both with fresh peaches and with frozen peaches - fully defrosted and drained. I also made it with both homemade and store bought crusts.  Baked the day before, this pie didn't last long at either our family picnic or our family boat trip. This is a great pie recipe.  My new summer favorite.

I also made it with blackberries - not as pretty but tasted great.  Everyone who's tried it when I made it loved it.

It was good (my 14 months old niece loved it the most. I used frozen peaches but didn't let them defrost all the way. I think this was where I made a mistake. The peaches were a little tough. Next time I will use fresh or make sure they are 100% defrosted. Also, there was more extra juice then I wanted. I even added extra corn starch and sprinkled it on the bottom of the crust before adding the fruit mixture.

I used store bought crusts as I didn't have time to make them from scratch. Despite issues with the store bought crusts, this pie was perfect! I followed other reviewers suggestions and set the fruit in a colander to drain. I also used a slotted spoon to scoop the filling into the pie crust. It worked - the filling wasn't runny.

This was the first peach pie that I have ever made, and it turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used frozen raspberries because I didn't have any fresh ones available.  It was a bit runny when I first served it warm, but when serving leftovers the next day (after storing it in the fridge) it wasn't runny at all.  It had great flavor, and I will DEFINETLY be making it again!

Good pie.  I added a teaspoon of corn starch because I know peach pies tend to be runny and I did not have time to drain the fresh peaches.  Turned out good. Forgot the butter, will try again with.

This is such a wonderful recipe because it was so easy to make. We added some blueberries in to add to the tartness as well. Be careful when flipping over the top pie crust over the bottom one - I did mine too fast and it crumbled on me. So we had a cracked pie crust, the outcome was delicious nonetheless (especially with Cool Whip, vanilla or butter pecan ice cream)

I made a couple of minor changes. I was out of cinnamon so I used some ground cloves and nutmeg instead - quite good. I also subsituted Splenda for the sugar which I regretted because I could taste the Splenda. The filling consistency was perfect. Great Pie!

This pie is so good! And easy! I made it exactly as written, and had no problems. Not too runny, and tastes great!

This was really good. I used strawberries and it was wonderful.
