Made this meatloaf last night after having made the same recipe for years (20+ actually) and I think we have found our new favorite meatloaf recipe! I substituted store-bought bbq sauce for some home made that I whipped together!

This will go in my favorites file!  I didn't use the bacon as that counters some of the major health benefits of eating venison and it was still very moist and flavorful without the noticeable difference in texture that we often find with ground venison.  I would have never guessed that it was anything other than beef and it was more tender and moist than my usual beef meatloaf recipe!  I used a spicy steak seasoning and a spicy BBQ sauce.  It was delicious but I will experiment with a homemade or purchased BBQ sauce that is lower in sodium.

This is such an amazing recipe for a venison meatloaf. My husband has asked me to make it multiple times...the flavor is just so good!

I am an avid deer hunter and the recipe by itself is amazing. But like all recipes there is absolutely nothing wrong with tweaking a bit. I follow the recipe with a few adjustments and additions. Again this is just my take but everyone raves aboit it. 1 tsp of sage instead of 1/2, 1 medium to large white onion instead of 1/2 a yellow onion,  2 garlic cloves finely chopped, 1 cup of shredded cheese (I use Mexican four blend), and HEB Speciality Series Texas BBQ sauce (gotta have that Texas kick). I then top it with 4 thick slices of maple bacon. Try it out. You will not be disappointed.

This recipe has great flavor and the sauce is magnificent! We cooked it with the sauce on it, adding only one 4 oz. packet of whole wheat crackers, and used a small bit of onion salt instead of the whole onion. FIVE STARS!!!

My family loved this.  My 9-year old son said it was the best meatloaf ever.  I did add a little bit of garlic seasoning, but that was the only thing I changed.  I couldn't taste the venison AT ALL!!  
Very delicious!

Great Venison Meatloaf! My husband is a deer hunter and we Loved this recipe. I followed all the ingredients and baked it about 10 min longer as I was concerned about the short 35 min suggested. It looked beautiful on a platter with the delicious poured over sauce.  Served with wild rice, corn, salad, and french wheat bread.  5 STARS. ArLene

This was a really great and simple recipe for venison. I switched out the white onions for red onions and coated the top with the sauce 2/3 the way through. This really solidified the taste. Thanks for the recipe.

Such a great low-carb meal!  I followed one suggestion to cut back on the stuffing and added a few dashes of Worcestershire to the top with smoky BBQ sauce.  The crust on the outside was so good. My hubby said this meatloaf is better than his mother's!

This was not good at all. It is way too sweet. The texture from all the cracker crumbs made the meatloaf have a bad texture and was very unappetizing. None of the 5 adults who tried this liked it at all.

Thank you for this awesome recipe.   I made this last night and my husband, who loves but is a very picky meatloaf  eater, said this was the best he's ever had.  He wants me to make it again tonight.  I didn't change anything about this recipe except that I used bread crumbs instead of crackers because I didn't have crackers on hand.   Thank you again!

Best recipe for venison.  Very flavorful, even my picky eater (husband) liked it.  I used dry onion soup mix for the onion flavor instead of chopped onions(husband won't eat onions).  I was also out of bacon and used saved bacon drippings drizzled over the top while it cooked.  We both hunt and this is a great use for the ground deer meat.

This was an AMAZING recipe!! I have never cooked venison before and this was delicious and easy!! I replaced the crackers with half a cup of dried bread crumbs only because I didn't have saltines. Would highly recommend!!

I used this recipe to make meatloaf with moose meat. It was great! Changes I made: Instead of the saltine crackers, I used about a 1/2 cup of store brand bread crumbs. And instead of laying bacon over the top of the meatloaf, I half-cooked two strips of bacon, chopped them up, and mixed them in with the meatloaf. I think I ended up baking it about 50 minutes total... Not sure why...

Amazingly delicious.  Better than beef meatloaf.  Used triscuits, cause that's what I had on hand.  Pretty much made it as described and the boys went back for seconds and thirds.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except there was no way I could fit it into such a small dish. I used a 5x9 glass dish. Also, I think it would be for more like 6 servings. It was very filling. This is how I will make meatloaf from now on. Thank you!

I am not a big fan of venison, but since hubby hunts I'm always looking for good recipes to help mask the game taste. This recipe hits it out of the park. He's been eating it his whole life and LOVED this recipe. I followed exactly as written and it was really REALLY good. Even my super-picky son said, "Wow - this is pretty good" and went back for seconds. Seriously, try this one!

This is the best venison meatloaf I have made. It had so much flavor. All I cook is venison so I have made multiple meatloaf using venison. This is by far the best. My family agrees! This will be the only meat loaf I make from now on. I didn't change a thing. Except I didn't use the bacon (I don't eat bacon). It was so moist and full

Oh my goodness. This is the venison meatloaf I have been searching for. It is so delicious as is, but tonight I decided to kick it up a notch with some chopped fresh jalapeno pepper. Next time, I think I'll put in a few drops of Tabasco sauce but again it is delicious as is.

This recipe is just great. I have made this meatloaf about 4 times now using this recipe. The good thing is that I have found you can't really mess it up. Sometimes I throw in some different spices/sauces, sometimes I make it as is. Last time I doubled the recipe and instead of using crackers/spices I just threw in a box of cornbread stuffing mix. My family said it was the best they ever had!!!

I had never cooked with venison before and was a little nervous, but this recipe turned out great! My husband said it was the best he had ever tasted. I did add 1/2 lb of 90% ground beef to the venison as well, and did 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 ketchup wherever it called for BBQ sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Mine seemed to take longer to cook- about 45 min or an hour, then 5 min on broil to crisp up the bacon, but that could be because I'm at high altitude. Give this one a try!

Made this last night, just amazing. I did tweak a couple minor details.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, added a chopped jalapeño, added a 1/2 lb of cooked breakfast sausage to mix in the meat for fat content (did not take away any of the deer taste, couldn't hardly tell sausage was present)... next time I plan on adding shredded cheddar cheese just because.

I think I might have finally found a good recipe for venison meatloaf.  I'd been trying to use ground beef recipes, but they just never worked for the low fat venison.  Did recipe as directed, but added chopped green peppers bc I had to get rid of them.  The flavor was fantastic, but I'll skip the peppers next time.  The sauce on top was way too thick and the bacon I used didn't get crispy, so I'd skip that, too.  I used spicy baby rays BBQ sauce, which may have added to the thickness.

My husband enjoyed this. I didn't really like it too much, but I did alter the recipe by adding about a handful of breakfast sausage because I didn't have any bacon to put over the top. Will try again with bacon next time.

This was an excellent way to cook venison. When a family member shoots a deer there is a lot of meat to use and this will be a keeper. I doubled the main recipe but not the sauce and then served the sauce on the side rather than slathered on top.

Yummy, Moist and Tasty

Made this tonight with 2 pounds of venison sausage, 1 hot and 1 sweet. Wasn't sure what to expect as we usually put ketchup in our meat loaf. I added a 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar too. Delicious! The BBQ sauce and brown sugar gave just a hint of sweetness. I didn't make the sauce because we are not sauce people but the recipe is divine and a keeper. Thanks...we have lots of ground venison and will be making this recipe a lot.

This was exceptional meatloaf! I doubled the meat and ingredients for family size. (1 lb venison & 1 lb. pork sausage).  Used applewood bacon and omitted the sage. I figured the sausage probably had it in it. Really good venison recipe!!

I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this meatloaf.  My finicky eaters enjoyed it.  They ate large helpings.  My less finicky eater went back for seconds and thirds "because its just that good."  I made it pretty much as printed except for crushed Triscuit (cause that's what was on hand) and I had bacon grease from the morning, so added that for moisture, although I don't think I would have needed it.  The sauce was alittle spicy for some but a great way to use the ground venison we usually struggle to find a use for.

Best meatloaf I have ever had hands down! I hated meatloaf when I was growing up and always doused it in ketchup but this was GREAT!! I couldn't believe that the recipe made the venison so moist and delicious! I am happy I have found a new way to use venison now rather than just Hamburger Helper and Spaghetti!

Absolutely delicious! I didn’t have steak seasoning so I used 3/8th tsp of adobo and 1/8 tsp of onion powder instead because the ingredients were similar to steak seasoning I googled. So tender and juicy. My husband loved it!

The reason I gave this dish 5 stars is because it was wow!  Yummy!  My hubby kept going to the kitchen and getting more......by the end of the evening, there was none left!  Okay, there should have been some restraint exercised, but he loves venison anyhow and this recipe will definitely be going in the collection :)
No changes to recipe other than I didn't have steak sauce so left it out and it was still great!

I made a bacon basket weave instead of only 3 pieces of bacon. I also used half the crackers and half the barbecue sauce. Was a huge success with the family. My wife didn't even know that she was eating venison.

Delicious. Such a good recipe that is easy to make and if you get tired of the taste or want to vary the taste, you dont have to be a chef or know anything about seasonings. Just switch the flavor of barbecue sauce you use.

Made some minor modifications on the spices due to what I had on hand.  
Cool time took 1hr to get internal temp of 165*F @350*F oven temp.  
My kids loved it and I'll make it again!

I added in chopped bacon to the mix and still added the bacon on top. This came out perfect. Everyone who ate it loved it even the person who was hesitant about meatloaf.

By far better than any meatloaf I have ever tried. Truly great recipe if you don't like then you probably made it wrong absolutely amazing . Going to have to take more deer next year I'm going to run out of meat cooking this.

We loved this! Changes I made:  Used ground beef instead of venison. Used about half the amount of crackers (Multigrain Pita Bite from Trader Joe's) Omitted sage and steak seasoning. Omitted bacon and put red and green pepper slices on top. Also added some chopped red peppers to meatloaf mixture. Used just half of the recipe for the sauce on top of the loaf--made plenty. Will make again.

I have never made anything with venison and I decided to make this meatloaf because a friend gave me a pound of fresh venison along with a pound of fresh ground beef, I used half a pound of venison and half a pound of ground beef and instead of the BBQ sauce called for I used Sweet Baby Rays Vidalia Onion along with 1 tablespoon of Honey (when it came to topping it with 3/4 cup of BBQ sauce I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey with the BBQ sauce no substitute on brown sugar) and it is absolutely fabulous!  Thank you so much for this recipe! My reason for the substitution was because I already had this BBQ sauce.

Great meal, 2nds for everyone.  I've made this several times, cook time is 60 minutes @350 degrees.  I also like Heinz canned gravy (Hearty Beef or Mushroom) better than the recipe sauce.  A fantastic meal with mashed potatoes.

Great flavor and moistness.  No gamey flavor thst my family doesn't like.  Key though is high quality bbq sauce or homemade.  Don't skimp using poor quality sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Fantastic! I have made this 5 times now and every time I get positive feedback from anyone that tries it. The only changes I made were oatmeal instead of crackers, didn't add bacon and doubled the recipe. I also have never made the extra sauce for on top. It is so incredibly moist even without it.

Best tasting meatloaf I have ever had. Period! Instead of being bland it has a little zip to it. Plus, it does not fall apart like so many recipes that I have tried. Definitely will make this again.

I made this with elk burger that was cut with bacon fat so I left the bacon out. I got rave reviews. I made it again tonight with cow burger and added the bacon. Again rave reviews. This is an all time family favorite now. My poor Mother in Law has to retire her meat loaf recipe :)
