This pie has a mediocre flavour, very bland, and it needs to be baked longer than the recipe calls for.  
To add a little body to the pie, fold the pecans into the filling.

I loved this pie.   I've made it several times now and am complimented on it every time.
The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it didn't set as well as it should have.  A little runny so I baked it 20 minutes longer.

This pecan pie has become a new family tradition at our house for Christmas. What makes this recipe different is the buttery flavor. Many pecan pies are overly sweet. This is the perfect balance of sweet, caramelized goodness.

Tastes so good and its just a few more ingredients than the original pecan pie.
