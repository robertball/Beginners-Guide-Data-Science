If you don't like spicy don't make this! Very easy to follow and my pork turned out great! I used a 3 to 4 pound pork roast. I had all the ingredients and mixed them all together. I then made sure I rubbed the pork really really well with the seasoning.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of water. I seared the pork in the pan just like the recipe says. That gave the outside a really good "crust" of seasonings. After six hours on high in my slow cooker it just fell apart. We are going to use it for carnitas and for pulled pork sandwiches for the week of work lunches. I highly recommend this! Very,very tasty!!!

There is a lot going on with this recipe but it works okay, The rub smelled really good but does get a little lost in the end. I'm not a big fan of meat cooked in the crockpot but it is too cold to bust out the smoker right now. I really want to try this rub on some ribs once the weather gets warmer.  Overall easy and good recipe and one I'd make again.
