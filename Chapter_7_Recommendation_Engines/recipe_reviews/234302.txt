I enjoyed this, the carrot was the star. But I think the recipe might be improved with an addition of a stalk of celery and a bite of either ginger or a dash of cayenne pepper. Overall, its a recipe I would repeat.

This was way too sweet for our family. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. Otherwise, I liked the combination of carrot, orange and cucumber.

I was looking for  a juicer recipe to fit produce Inhave in the house, and happened upon this one. I used the ingredients listed, including the lemon, but without the sugar or water since I sent them through the juicer instead. A mild a very refreshing combination! I will use it again, and if I want more of a bite I am sure a little fresh ginger will work in it also. Thank you for sharing this!

Delicious refreshing breakfast drink, or anytime drink! I followed the recipe including the lemon juice, but omitted all sugar and added a few pieces of fresh ginger. Gave it a needed tang!
