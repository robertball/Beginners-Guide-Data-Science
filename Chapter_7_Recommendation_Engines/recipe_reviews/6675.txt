Real cornbread isn't supposed to be sweet!  This is how my mother has made cornbread for years, except I don't recall hers having milk in it.  I think it has another egg and maybe more sour cream.  As with traditional southern-style cornbread - before she found this recipe with sour cream and corn, we heat the oven to 450, not 425, and first heat the empty skillet up really hot on the stove top, add a couple of tablespoons of oil, swish it around to coat the pan, toss in a big pinch of cornmeal, swish it around and let brown a little - won't take but a moment, pour the batter in the pan THEN put it in the hot oven and bake until real good and brown.  Nothing better!

This cornbread was good, though rather dense. I would definately take the previous advice and add some sugar.  I will make this again.

Boy, did Debbie ever give this recipe an appropiate name! From the ease of the mixing of the batter to the smell it generates in the oven...this IS the best cornbread you'll ever put in your mouth. What else is great about this recipe is you will more than likely have everything on hand to make it. No running to the store to get an ingredient. One thing...follow the direction of some of the other posters, either add more cornmeal or less milk.

So moist and yummy.  I don't have an iron skillet, so I just baked in cake pan.  Turned out wonderful.  Doubled and cooked an additional 15 minutes.

This recipe didn't have as much flavor as the recipe I usually use.  I thought the creamed corn and sour cream would really jazz it up, but for some reason, it was just so-so.

I tried this recipe and contrary to the name it was not the best cornbread I've ever
eaten.  The people at my party did not like it.  It lacked flavor and I will not use it 
this recipe again.

This cornbread was moist but not really what I was looking for.  I was looking for a sweeter cornbread.  I may try this again and add sugar.

I want to thank you for this recipe.  My cornbread I use to make was flavorful but was always dry and no one would hardly eat it.  But when I made this one it was all gone.  The next time I make it though I will add a little sugar for sweetness.

This is really good cornbread. It IS really moist. I usually prefer a sweeter cornbread, so I added some sugar. It was even better!

I made several of these for a party.  They really did need sugar added (1/2 cup) and they need to cook longer than stated (about 40 minutes total).  While they were good, I liked another recipe on this site better.

I made this as written, except I didn't have "corn meal mix". I substituted 2 cups of corn meal, 1Tbsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt.  Next time, I will do the same thing, but will use all-purpose flour in place of some of the cornmeal.  It was delicious!!

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and each time, i get raving reviews.  The best thing about this recipe is that it truly gives you a moist cornbread.  Countless times I've been told that no one needs to use butter with the cornbread. I've made this recipe as provided and also with several modifications.  I've made it with a mixture of mexican and pepperjack cheese; i've made it with onions, jalapenos, and cayenne pepper.  It's a super-easy batter to make and it is the best corn bread you'll ever eat. For those that commented on how sweet the cornbread is, it's relative.  I didnt think the original recipe was sweet and none of the folks that ate did either.  This is definitely worth trying if you're looking for a cornbread recipe. I doubt you'll look any further once you try it.  thanks debbie!

I used Krusteaz corn muffin mix (a little more than 2 cups), omitted the oil and cooked at 400 degrees in a 9x13 glass baking dish.  The best cornbread I have made so far!

I liked this recipe.  It uses creamed corn which adds something different.  The result is rich and moist.  If you want flavorful cornbread, add hot peppers, onions, and/or cheese.  I did add the 1/4 c. sugar as recommended by others and used a preheated oiled cast iron pan.  I added our own dried habanero chili powder to the batter.  We had it with black eyed peas and chopped onions.

O.K., I'm only giving it three stars, but I plan on making this again because I messed up. It's an obsessive thing, but I never grab the first product on the shelf. It's always the one behind it. What I grabbed was not creamed corn, but just regular corn. I'm sure this was a big part of the problem. Not that we didn't like it, but it just wasn't sweet enough, even though I added two tablespoons of sugar. It was obviously a little too chunky too. The only reason I'm reviewing this is because I don't want anyone else making the same stupid mistake that I did. Sorry I messed up your recipe Debbie but I promise that I'll be making this again, as I really love corn bread.

I did not like this at all! It was dark on the outside and mushy on the inside, plus it had no flavor, I will not be using this one again.

Concept and ingredients look great...didn't turn out though.  We followed the recipe but we ended up with the cornbread being mushy / undercooked.  Continued cooking it much longer than the recipe and although it browned on the outside, the inside was still mush.

This is my favorite cornbread recipe, and I never used to eat cornbread!  My husband and I are the only ones that eat it, so I freeze the leftovers.  When ever I make chili or pinto beans, I just heat a piece of frozen cornbread in the microwave and put the chili/beans over it.  Delicious!

I wish I could say that this was great but it was terrible....there was no flavor what-so-ever. I'm just glad that I had a couple of boxes of cornbread mix otherwise my family would have been very disappointed having a thanksgiving without cornbread....

Pretty good, My husband did not like it at all, but he is a very very picky eater. The sour cream did not mix in as well as it should, there were spots of sour cream in it. I did add 3 TB of sugar, the consistency of the bread was very different. overall 3 stars.

Just tried this recipe and I have to say my friend and I didn't really care for it. It left an odd flavor in my mouth. After I tried it I went back to make sure all of my ingredients were fresh and to make sure I hadn't ommited anything. I will not be making this recipe again.

I wanted to try this recipe because of the sour cream. I personaly think that the corn makes this too sweet. I have to agree with Auntnett's review. Maybe it's a southern thing, but corn bread isn't supposed to be sweet. No offense to anyones personal taste, but I can't believe that anyone would want to add sugar to this. Like Auntnett, I also heat the oven to 450 and heat some oil in the empty skillet before adding the batter. I'll make again but I'll leave out the corn.

This does make a very moist cornbread with a wonderful, crispy crust.  It turned out delicious, but I did do a little doctoring b/c the batter was very bland--I added 1/4 cup sugar, some Tony's Cacheres, cayenne pepper, some melted butter, and another egg for good measure.  I had to cook it about 45-50 minutes.  It was pretty good, and we had it with chili.

This recipe was okay but I wouldn't consider this the best corn bread.  Too much liquid and not enough flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of, was the bake time. It took almost 20 minutes longer to bake than the instructions called for. But it was worth it, moist and yummy, with a crunchy crust. Yummy.

Well, considering I do not like sweet corn bread I have to say flavor wise, this was pretty tasty with chili. HOWEVER, it doesn't cook well. I had it in a stoneware pan and had to cook it over an hour to get it done. I had to switch from 425 to 450 and then again to 475. I don't know what the deal is.

NOT "the best cornbread I ever ate".  It tasted decent at first, but after it cooled down it had an odd taste to it.  I doubt I will make "this" recipe again, when I've had better.  It definitely needs some doctoring.

I also used a  14 oz can of cream corn.

I tried this recipe because I wanted a cornbread that was moist.  I loved the consistancy of it, very moist but it lacked flavor.  I did add a 1/4 cup of sugar but still thought it needed something.  I will definately try it again, just spice it up a bit.

Followed advice from other postings and added sugar (1/4 cup) and used sweet creamed corn.  Had to bake for 40 minutes.  The cornbread was very good...moist.  However, it lacked something.  I think I may add some salt next time.

I can see from the comments and cornbread recipes on this site there ain't no country folks using Allrecipes.  If you use corn, sugar, milk, oil, eggs or anything but the following you have city cornbread.  Poor-man's country cornbread consist of self rising cornmeal, buttermilk, lard/veggie shortening, pinch of salt, and as hot of a cast iron skillet you can get, like smoldering hot. It should be nice and very brown before taking it out of the stove. That's it nothing else or you might as well go eat cake.

This was easy and incredible! I only added creamed corn and a cup of shredded cheese and substituted half and half for milk. I loved it and so did everyone else that tried it.  You can't go wrong with this one! Oh I also cooked in a cast iron skillet.

What Cornbread is supposed to be! Those that didn't like it were probably expecting that syrupy sweet commercial stuff. I do agree with another reviewer that suggests preheating the skillet. I like sweet corn bread on occasion, for dessert or similar, but this one with a big bowl of pintos was perfect.

This recipe was exactly the kind of cornbread I was searching for.  It is a true Southern style of cornbread (not a semi-sweet cake mix like the Northern style).  The cream corn adds a great texture, and the sour cream is a nice addition as well, especially since I will use leftover sour cream, but buttermilk tends to go to waste.  I have made this several times, and would not change a thing (maybe add some chopped jalapenos for mexican style...but I digress).  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Corn CAKE is sweet.  "Yankee" cornbread is sweet. Real SOUTHERN cornbread is NOT sweet.   This is a good recipe for Mexican cornbread, made the Southern way.  I am using this recipe for Mexican cornbread to go with my black eyed peas and greens which is a traditional Southern New Year's Day menu.  Yum, Yum!  Happy New Year!

I liked the addition of sour cream to the corn bread recipe.  It was more moist than a traditional recipe not containing it.  I definitely will make this one again!

I grew up on Jiffy mix, so I am used too velvety cornbread not gritty. This was so good. Melts in your mouth.  Never going back to jiffy. Wondering if it freezes well?

Needs salt. This recipe is bland but salt and melted butter make this better.

Turned out wonderful!!  Couldn't find my regular recipe so I used this one.  Went well with out chili; although I did not put in the corn.  Will definitely make again.

It may be that I goofed, but the "batter" was more like a dough, very, VERY dense.
