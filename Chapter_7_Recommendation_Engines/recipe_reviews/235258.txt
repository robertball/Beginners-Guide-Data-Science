I want to give this 10 stars but I changed it up just a bit. I chopped n dropped in the meat, 2 cans of Rotel, small can of tomato sauce, a couple tbls of flour & 2 pkgs of Lipton onion soup mix. My crock pot was occupodo so in the oven it went, low n slow 300 degrees for 4-5 hrs. I served this over the crock pot baked potatoes,http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-baked-potatoes/detail.aspx. Superb! ! Thank you Lucille, this is comfort food to the neth degree!
