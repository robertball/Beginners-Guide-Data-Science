This was possibly the worst pot roast I've ever eaten. In Italy we call this "bollito", which means "boiled" and we make it with a cheaper cut of meat, potatoes, carrots, and then use the broth for soup. This dish tasted funny, because of the peppers, and the expensive cut of meat I used was wasted here :-(

I think they said no more because this was horrible, too salty and way to much peppers. Will try other recipes.

Very poor recipe.  It was not edible.  We wasted money on the meat and didn't understand why this type was selected.  Don't even consider this one.

Used bottom round steak and decided to use the slow cooker, diced to a large food bite. I did everything as the recipe calls for....but, add extra slices of raw pepper at the end, otherwise it will turn to mush....added some corn starch to make a great gravy too!
Added about a 1/2 cup of salsa and that made all the difference!
