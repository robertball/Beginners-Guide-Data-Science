This is certainly a quick and easy granola recipe. I do not tend to have barley syrup in my cupboard, so I used all honey, with good results. I also substituted coconut extract for the vanilla as I was looking for as strong a coconut flavor as possible. That was a good call, as I still found it subtle, but that is personal preference. It is definitely there, not lacking. I added dried blueberries when finished, which was a nice flavor match. Thanks for the recipe.

I had to keep the granola in the oven longer to toast it properly, but beyond that followed the recipe. This is great granola, not too sweet, but wonderful flavor. I'll be making more of this - maybe using more coconut oil and less olive/vegetable oil.

I totally love this granola!  It has a good texture and a great taste.  I substitute 1/4 cup almond butter for the coconut oil since I can't find coconut oil.  I call it Coconut Almond Granola.

This recipe worked very well for me.  I did replace the 1/2 cup barley malt syrup with mix of more honey and pure maple syrup.  I also went with all coconut oil.  Dried cherries instead of cranberries and added some cinnamon and nutmeg for a little additonal flavor.  I did cook it longer, more than twice as long as needed and did stir it halfway so that it all browned well. My daughter loves it!

This granola is pretty good, though the recipe needs some tweaking.  It is very sticky and sweet, not my preference, so I would cut back on the sweetener.  The coconut flavor is good.  The method for baking seems to be the biggest trouble for the recipe.  My usual granola is baked at 250 F for 30 minutes, stirred, then baked another 15-30 minutes according to personal taste.  It never burns in this slow oven and cooks evenly through.  This recipe was very dark on bottom and not cooked enough on top.  My oven may be a factor, but I just thought I would put out the suggestion to cook longer and slower.

This is my first granola recipe I have ever made, and it was a good one. Nice crunchy clumps of  granola, great flavour. I used sunflower seeds due to a nut allergy and used agave and brown rice syrup instead of sugar.

I had to tweak this a bit, mostly by doubling the batch of wet ingredients. I substituted the maltose syrup with honey as it was not an easy ingredient to find!

Wonderful! I used all coconut oil and all honey and used wheat germ instead of oat bran. This recipe is a wonderful way to incorporate coconut oil into your diet for medical reasons (thyroid, etc.)

This is a really good granola!  I didn't have coconut milk, so I substituted with SILK PureAlmond milk.  I also did as other reviewers said to do with substitutions, Maple Syrup for the barley malt syrup and all coconut oil-no veggie oil (coconut oil is better for you).  I also did as one reviewer said to do- set oven temp to 250 and bake longer.  This worked really well, besides I had bread dough rising so it help keep the kitchen warm this COLD winter day!!!   Will make again! :)

Love this! I didn't have coconut oil, so just used extra veg oil, and I used dark chocolate chips instead of the dried fruit. It is delicious!

I was looking for a granola recipe to use up some extra shredded coconut and coconut milk.  This turned out great with substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients in my pantry.  Omit oat bran add extra oats. Omit malt syrup add extra honey.  Omit almonds add broken pecan pieces.  Omit vegetable oil and used all coconut oil.  It took a long time to crisp up.  I increased the temperature to 400 degrees and baked for 5 - 10 minutes longer.  Next time I would start with 400 degrees.

I substituted agave nectar for the maltose syrup and used all coconut oil, otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I needed to roast mine for about 30 minutes to get it nice and toasty and stirred frequently to prevent it from getting dark.  For those who want a stronger coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil.  Very tasty and a nice change from my normal granola.

Easy recipe.  Used all coconut oil and maple syrup instead of malt.  Used combo of almonds and walnuts.  I also stirred the granola during the second time in the oven and baked a couple minutes longer.  I also cut recipe in half.  Results: tastes pretty darn good but next time I will add more nuts and about 1/2 tsp. salt.

I used a mix of quick oats, slow oats and steel cut (because that's what I had).  I left out the coconut milk, and cooked at 300 F until nicely toasted (about 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so).  Would certainly make again.

I've made this twice now, and couldn't be happier with it.  The only change I've made to the original is swapping out barley syrup for grade B maple syrup (same measured amount).  Everything else is the same.  Tried it the first time with chopped dried mango, and the second time with raisins.  This is definitely a winner, and so much better than any pre-packaged granola in ANY store.

Omitted Veg oil and barley syrup, added less honey and slightly more coconut oil and milk and it still turned out fantastic.  I used raisins and dates instead of cranberries to get rid of any/all processed sugar.  I'll definitely make it again, thanks!
