I thought this was just OK. The pork chops were typical & other than my grandson picking the raspberries out, noone ate much of the salsa.

This a fabulous summer entree. It's so easy with the grilling, but the fruit salsa give it a little something special. I loved it, husband loved it and it's pretty healthy, too!
