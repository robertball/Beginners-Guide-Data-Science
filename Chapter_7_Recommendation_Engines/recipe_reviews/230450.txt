I made this for my sister's wedding shower. The group loved it and it was so simple to make. The best part about it is the recipe isn't heavy feeling. I would definitely recommend getting fresh deli slices of roast beef and cutting them in half width-wise so the wrapping around the asparagus doesn't become too thick.

What a delicious appetizer.  Adjust the horseradish to suit your taste.  These are easily made in advance which is always nice for entertaining.

These were a hit at our party.  They look so elegant and are very tasty.  The only thing I did differently was to keep the asparagus stalk whole. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent as is recipe.  After making it as recipe directs, I decided to dice a fresh jalapeno pepper and add to cream cheese.  Excellent if you like to spice it up!

Very delicious. I bought roast beef from the deli. I was able to get 2 rolls out of one slice of meat. Don't go to thin with the roast beef or it will be too hard to roll.. great recipe I will be making it again but I think I might add just a little bit more horseradish.
