Great recipe.  Delicious, quick and easy to prepare.  I never used puff pastry to make a crust like this before.  I didn't know what to expect and felt a little wary.  It turned out great.  Next time, I think I'll chop the spinach a little coarser, about the size of a quarter, so there are bigger pieces in the finished dish.

Loved the flavors.  I did add leftover ham for my meat loving HB  but everything else was exactly as the recipe called for.  Very good.
