I've been making Aloo Phujhi for years and everyone loves it.  I always add some cut up sweet peppers, carrots and little broccoli.  It gives it nice color.  That's how they serve it at my favorite Indian restaurant.  My family likes spicy so I kick the spice up quite a bit.  I made this once for a party and the owner of a Indian restaurant was there and asked who made it and complimented me on how good it was.  This recipe is a keeper!

I really like this recipe.  I make it fairly regularly and my husband loves it.  The trick is to cook it over medium heat so the potatoes and onions don't burn.  You have to cut the potatoes into fairly small pieces so that they cook quickly and evenly.  It's so important to saute them uncovered first and then when you cover them for the last ten minutes, that is when they really soften up and steam.  Don't lift the lid!  If you have your burner at the right temp, they won't burn and they will come out perfectly.  Sometimes I add frozen peas during the last few minutes of cooking time and I always serve this with basmati rice.  My only complaint is that it makes my house smell like curry the next day!  Otherwise it is great!

Overall, it tasted good.   However I suggest that you should boil the potatoes and remove the peel and then cut them into cubes.  This way it takes 3-4 mins for it to be done and the potatoes soak up the spices much readily.

Excellent indian food, delicious, and spicy, the way i like it! I cooked the diced potatoes in the microwave while sauteing the onion, and added them cooked to the onions and spices, and they soaked up the spices perfectly. It saves time!

I tripled the amount of spice and added some green bell pepper.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and added some coriander seed and this recipe tasted almost exactly like the aloo subji that my mother inlaw makes.  I found this recipe to be a very good base for an authentic Indian dish, it just needs a very changes for a more authentic Indian flavor.

Excellent and easy!  I didn't find it too spicy at all.  Instead of two whole, fresh tomatoes I used a small can of whole tomatoes; I just dumped it all in, tomato juices and all.  It seemed to give the potatoes more of a sauce.  I just ate some of the leftovers for a late breakfast, and this seems to be even better the next day.  

I don't know if kids will like this; I don't have any (which is probably why I'm waking up late enough to want the leftovers for breakfast).  :)

I was surprised at how well the potatoes cooked; about 12 minutes over medium heat made them perfectly soft enough.  Make sure to cut the potatoes into small cubes as the recipe says, though; I can see how they might take longer to cook otherwise.

Mother of God, this is HOT! So, why then do I keep going back and sampling it?  Because it's awesome!  I used light margarine (ICBINB) to saute' the onions on low heat, then added the rest. I did parboil my potatoes ahead of time based on what other reviewers said.  I keep wanting to add "something" to it, but don't know what that something is.  There's definitely heat to it and I imagine tomorrow, it'll be even better.  Thanks for letting me try!

This was pretty good, but I had to doctor it up a lot.  I doubled all the spices but the salt, but when it was done cooking I had to add salt to it anyway.  I also added some butter to this to make it richer.  It was good, but not wonderful....Okay, here it is two days after I wrote this review...I had some of this stuff left over and had it for lunch, and it tasted great.  I guess the potatos had more time to soak up the spices or something.  So I think this is a good "make ahead" dish that tastes better a day or two later.

I love spicy foods, but the cayenne in this dominated everything else.  The cumin and turmeric flavors were lost!  If I make this again, I'll definitely cut way back on the cayenne.  Besides that, I thought this was a pleasant, simple dish.  I followed the directions exactly and had no problem with the potatoes being either under- or over-cooked.  Added some green pepper.  Peas would be a good addition too.

This is a wonderful recipe Christy, thank you for sharing! I made it last week following the recipe to a T and really liked it.  However I am Indian and like my food to be on the spicy side and found the aloo phujia to be good, but it was a tad mild for my taste. I made it again today and added one green chili, 1/4 teaspoon of coriander powder, 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder and about one teaspoon of minced ginger, and it had the heat I was looking for.  If you're not into fiery food, I suggest making this per the recipe, but if you want a bit more heat, the few extra ingredients will give it that extra kick.  Really terrific dish!

Followup to original review: I redid this recipe using cauliflower to reduce carbs, and oh my gosh, it was so good.  Seriously the best cauliflower I've ever had.  That's probably an entirely different dish with a different name, but whatever it's called, it's the best way to cauliflower that I'm aware of.

I thought this recipe was GREAT!  I do agree, adding peas would look pretty and would make sense in this dish.  I doubled the cumin in the recipe called for, and halved the cayenne.  I cut the potatoes in 3/4 to 1.5 inch cubes and boiled for about 10 minutes before draining and adding to the fry pan.  Worked out great.  The turmeric gives this dish such a lovely color, much nicer to look at than your usual brown and white potato dish!!!  Thank you, I'm really grateful for the recipe!

This was a delicious dish. I think that you might be able to cut the oil a bit if you use canned tomatoes  instead of fresh and cook the potatoes in some of the juice.

I love this recipe. This is the first time I've had it. I read the reviews and cooked it 4 hours before dinner because I wanted to let the spices soak in. It is delicious.  I highly recommend this for someone who is craving Indian food. I am serving it with naan and guferati. I added some coriander for some extra spice. It is amazingly delicious.

Exceptionally good!  I doubled all of the spices except for cayenne and it was still pretty spicy.  I also added some cauliflower with the potatoes and it just came out delicious!  My husband was so very impressed!

Wow, this was really great! I didn't have cayenne pepper on hand so I substituted with chili pepper. I also added some Gram Masala spice and a bit of fresh garlic. I sprinkled in some crushed red pepper for extra kick. I went with what other users said and added a bit of carrot too. This was delicious and I'm definitely making again!

Thoroughly enjoyed these potatoes with the "Unbelievable Chicken" recipe from this site. I, too, did not have fresh tomatoes and used canned diced tomatoes (drained) guessing the amount of what "looked like" the equivalent of 2 small tomatoes. Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely make again.

This recipe is so great!  Once I found it, I was making it like every other day, often times just for myself!  I usually dont know exactly how much potato I'm putting into the recipe, so I just spice it to taste, and it's perfect.  I must say... I do LOVE this recipe!!  The only problem is... I dont know how to pronounce the name!  I always refer to it as "that yummy potato stuff" rather than mauling the name.

I love this recipe and use it all the time.  If I am making it as a main dish, I add some diced chicken breast and serve it with basmati rice.  I also throw in some frozen green peas.  Very good!

This was OK, but ended up cooking much longer than 20 minutes and adding some garlic powder.  This just wasn't for us, but obviously many people liked this dish so if it sounds interesting to you, try it, as we all have such different taste.

Very good, but make sure you pre-cook the potatoes.  You might also want to increase the spice.

I thought it was great!  My husband thought the potatoes were underdone.  That probably would be remedied by pre-boiling the potatoes as others suggested.  They were just fine for my tastes.  I used canned tomatoes, which really worked well.

Tasty, but I wish I had listened to earlier suggestions to make it the day before, because maybe the potatoes would have taken on more of the flavour. I did double the spices as suggested, and still didn't find it overly spicy. Nice and filling, I'll make it again!

This dish is quite tasty as written but I did cook my potatoes a little longer than called for.  I also added some water to soften the potatoes.  Not sure if the potatoes are supposed to be soft as I have never had this before, but softer suits my family’s taste much better.  This was filling enough to eat alone for my meatless Monday meal and it paired well with baked chicken for the rest of the family.

Spicy!! I even cut down the cayenne and it was still super spicy. Great flavor though. Used half can diced tomatoes, served with red lentil curry from this site and some naan.

Very good but the only reason I am giving 4 is that I doubled the spices, added garlic, ginger and chili powder as well as cooked it with diced tomatoes - it just seems off this recipe, that there is no liquid to cook the potatoes in. I also microwaved the potatoes to ensure they would be fully cooked before putting them in the skillet. Thanks for the great concept though - loved it!

This was a great potato dish to serve with the Coriander and Cumin Rubbed Pork Chops from this site. The tomato gave it some colour and the blend of spices was perfect.

I loved it. For my taste, it was just spicy enough. I added chopped fresh parsley and I think other veggies might be good too, as I think it is served that way sometimes. This would be a delicious side dish for any grilled meat.

I did personalize this recipe quite a bit.  Based on other reviews, I pre-boiled the potatoes so they would cook faster, and I doubled the spices.  My daughter found it to be too spicy, but I thought it perfect.  I used purple onion for some variance of flavor, and I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes because I like them better and they go well with spice, not to mention being better for you!  Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a can of Ro-tel, drained.  Next time I won't drain it, it could use more liquid.  The chiles added a great layer of extra flavor and spice!  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and cut the amount in half, and I splashed in some white wine while cooking.    I served this with Indian Naan II and Roasted Balsamic Cauliflower, both recipes I found on this site, as well as some saffron and garam masala spiced basmati rice.  Absolutely delish, and I will definitely make again with my modifications!

I increased the spices as well and it was pretty good. Be very sure not to overcook/blacken the onions or else you'll have a very bitter dish. Thanks for posting.

Like many of the other reviewers, I really enjoyed this recipe although I would have liked it to have been spicier.  I even added more of the turmeric, cumin, plus some curry spice.  Next time I make it I'll add MORE and maybe also use canned tomatoes to make a sauce. Yogurt is a very tasty garnish for this.

Yum, I love this recipe. I wouldn't call it super-spicy, but it depends on your tolerance level. I added fresh ginger to the spices (a must!) and added fresh chopped cilantro at the end. The sweet tang of tomatoes combined with the spicy potatoes is awesome. I didn't have enough tomato so I added some peas, which worked well.

Simple, cheap...and pretty easy to make, especially if you're familiar with Indian spices already. I would suggest playing with different spices and amounts, according to your personal preference. Cloves, nutmeg, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon and great to play with in this recipe. 

Overall, my boyfriend and I loved this...just don't forget to be creative!

I boiled the potatoes for 10min accidentaly but was glad I did as it doesn't seem that they would have been thoroughly cooked otherwise.  I like mine slightly mushy.  I also added 1 cup of sour cream in the end to make the final result more creamy. Otherwise this was very good and so simple and I will make again.

As written, this recipe loses a star for lack of flavor, and a star for a way off cooking timing. I made it as stated, but then made the following changes: I added about a tbsp of cumin seed (the flavor is so much more intense than ground cumin), a shake of garlic powder, 4 more seeded and chopped tomatoes, and about 3/4 cup of spicy V8 veggie juice. Even though I diced my potatoes pretty small, they were nowhere near done after 20 mins. Even after 33mins, some were a little hard, but I had to serve them as my rice and cauliflower were done. Husband didn't care for them (but he isn't much of a 'tater fan) but I thought they were pretty good.

Very flavorful and spicy. I like the other tripled the amount of spices and used canned tomatoes. I used stewed because that's all I had on hand but will try canned diced tomatoes and adding coriander seeds to it next time. I will definitely use this many times.

Tasty and easy.  I pre-boiled the potatoes (after cubing them) for ten
minutes to soften them.  I also only used a tablespoon of oil, making this
a very healthy recipe.  Finally, I used 50% more of the spices.  This gave
the recipe a great kick; I served it over a little bit of rice because the
the rice was needed to slightly temper the spiciness of this dish.  The
fact that the end result was a little stewy also helped this serve-on-rice
idea.  By the way, the potatoes don't end up with a browned/fried flavor
with this recipe.  But the recipe is great!(Some reviewers said it was
better made ahead of time and served as leftovers, the flavors coalescing
overnight.  I didn't experience this and it was great even initially,
probably because I left it on the stove uncovered on low for an extra
twenty minutes at the end because I was distracted entertaining my
guests.)

These potatoes were pretty good, but even though they had a nice spice they didn't have a whole lot of other flavor.  However, I did eat them and enjoy them well enough and even my husband ate them and he claims to HATE Indian food.  (I hid the recipe so he didn't see the word "Indian" in it. :)

I whipped this up really fast and even added some spinach. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used canned and it turned out great. I served it over basmati rice and my 3 year old gobbled it up and asked for more.  BTW we didn't find this spicy at all...but very tasty!

Delicious! I grabbed about 5 medium potatoes (guessed it was close to 1lb), and doubled the spices (except salt), because I always want more spice. Only used half the amount of turmeric because I ran out, so I finished the measurement with garam masala. I also used drained chopped tomatoes instead of fresh. I will definitely make again!

This is fantastic, even if you don't have tomatoes. I often end up eating the leftovers for breakfast. This version doesn't seem spicy to me, but it is full of flavor.

After making this the 4th or 5th time I'm actually downgrading it to 3 stars. The bottom line is that, as written, this recipe is bland and too heavy on the tomatoes.

This dish stores really well. One night we had it as a side with baked chicken, then with spinach and peas over rice, and finally, we used it as filling for pita sandwiches adding chickpeas and spinach. One batch, just defrosted and spiced up as needed.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, but felt it was missing a little something.  I doubled up on the spices like some people had suggested...still wasn't doing it for me.  I threw in some muchi curry and garam marsala...WOW!  I make this dish all the time now.  I use a whole can of diced tomatoes (juice and all)  I also throw in some diced carrots and substitute one sweet potato for a regular yukon potato.  If you cut the potatoes quite small (about 1 inch cubes) no need to par boil them, just sauté with the lid on for about 10 minutes.  It won't be winning any awards for authenticity, but it's delicious and even better the next day!

I loved this recipe! I used a little less oil, and added peas as suggested by another reviewer. I also substituted roasted red peppers for the tomatoes. Delicious with naan!

Good as is. I made it as the instructions dictated the first time, it turned out great & no changes are necessary.
However, the second time I made this I made some modifications.  I cut back a little on the oil (maybe 1/6 cup). Added a little more onion (2-3 small onions). I also like it spicy & flavorful so I added more cayenne & turmeric. Just as delicious the second time.

I used small red potatoes and kept the skin on, I also used half the cayenne and twice the cumin, plus 1/2 + tsp curry sauce. Served it over Batsmati rice-- Yum!!
Next morning beat an egg, added some aloo, excellent omelet.

Amazing! I took the advice of another and boiled the potatoes and added some water to the pan once the potatoes where mixed in with the seasoning. I also added in cauliflower for added nutrients. I let it cook on low for about 10 min. I ate this with black beans for the protein and store bought naan. The husband really like it. I will make again

I loved this!! I made it exactly as written, except I had to add a bit of water to the pan (like 1/8 cup) because it looked too dry. I sprinkled some chopped cilantro on top and served with basmati rice and channa masala.

Followed recipe exactly except that I added a minced jalapeno pepper and a cup of green peas. Used cumin seeds instead of ground. Was very good. Served with Indian Dahl with Spinach (recipe from this site that I made with asparagus instead of spinach), Moong Dal (also from this site), naan, basmati rice, and plain yogourt.

I am always looking for vegetable recipies that aren't full of calories and what I liked best about this recipe is that it doesn't call for cheese or soup that would add a lot of calories--it's just vegetables.  This is super easy to prepare and I think it would be fun to experiment with the seasonings.  I didn't use as much oil as called for; just enough to saute the onions and I did add quite a bit more cumin.  I thought it was very good.  I served it with a chicken breast cooked on my indoor grill and a salad--low cal and yummy!

Made this according to direction except I did boil the potatoes in a little water. My husband was born and raised in East Asia, and we both loved it. Served with rice, quick Indian lentils, vegies and naan. Made a quick, filling meal.

Yum.  It's tempting to par-boil potatos but the longer it cooks the spicier it gets - so I threw all spices in with the onion.

Yummy yummy yummy! I made this, as well as a few other dishes for ab going away party, attended by a large number of people who had tasted very little Indian food in their culinary careers.  They loved it! I made this the night before, to let the flavors comingle.

Good and spicy.  Next time I will add more tomatos and/or tomato juice.  I wanted it to be more "saucy," since I served it over rice.

This was good.  I pre-cooked the potatoes a bit too much. The end result was a very tasty dish that was rather mushy.  I also doubled the spices to ensure we got the full flavor.  Delicious.

Delicious. Very simple dish. I served with rice for a filling main dish. I followed previous reviews and doubled the spice (but not the salt), if I had peas on hand I would have added them. I give it a five because I will definately make this again.

I love this recipe. I love indian food but was always intimidated because i'm not the best cook! This is simple and delicious. I  cut up and boil the potatoes for 10-20 minutes before adding to the mix. other than that, follow to the letter and it comes out perfectly!

This is good and we will definitely make it again. The potatoes do need to be pre-cooked, and we will have to reduce the spices very slightly so that those with more sensitive taste-buds can also enjoy it! I would imagine using canned tomatoes and their juice will dilute the spices, but we prefer to use fresh tomatoes if possible.

The overall taste was good, but I ended up having to cook it much longer because my potatoes were still a little hard.  I also used can tomatoes to give it a little extra juice.

My husband who eats just about anything without complaint, asked me not to make it again. My 11 year old didn't care for it too much either. Thanks anyway.

It's a little bit dry but the spices add a lot of flavor, very tasty.

Too spicy for me, but my husband who loves spicy food, ate everything I made, including what I couldn't eat!  I'll make it again for him, and make myself something less spicy.

This recipe was GREAT!!!I made it alittle bit more spicey for us by doubling the spices. I also added 2 cloves of fresh crushed garlic. It was just fantastic.

This was good, but I would have liked it more with double the spices. I served mine with basmati rice, plain yogurt, and roti, and I added half of a bag of frozen peas at the very end of cooking. Overall, a very good, simple, budget-friendly vegetarian meal.

Very good but i tweaked it to my own preference, if you aren't a fan of greasy brown potatoes then try this: use only  a little olive oil for the onion then as you're cooking and stirring add a smidge of vegetable broth whenever the potatoes start to stick a little, it'll cook away easily so it won't be soupy but will have a fresh clean taste.

Easy recipe, explained well so you cannot go wrong. I found I had to add some water every once in a while to keep the dish from burning, but I used a cast iron pan, so it might be different in different pans. Great yellow colour! One note: It tastes well if you follow the recipe exactly, but to our taste it was a bit bland. So second time I added some mustard seeds and more cumin seeds, and the third time nigella seeds as well. This made it altogether spicier, which my family liked. Though I must say they finished the entire pan quickly every time I've cooked this! Will add cauliflower next time as well to make it more as Aloo Gobi.

Just enough spice. I made mine with Organic Ghee and it had a yummy richness. The tomatoes compliment the dish very well.

This "Aloo Phujia" was excellent! We love spicy food at our home, and so this was perfect for us. It was also very easy and fast to make. Thank you CHRISTYJ for sharing your recipe.

39 3 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/14035/aloo-phujia/ ... Yup, I liked these potatoes.  'Even followed he directions except didn't add tomatoes.  Spicy enough to last through a bite, but not lingering too long.  Potatoes were half inch cubes & they were done according to directions.  :)  Oh, I added a cup, & then some, green peas to pretty it up.... Later: This is the same recipe as Food.com, but theirs reads 20 & 20.  Similar offerings look good, too:  http://www.food.com/recipe/aloo-phujia-61114 .... After cooking, I tossed in a quarter cup freshly chopped cilantro.  'Faked creme fraiche by combining sour cream & plain yogurt.  Nice!  :D

An amazingly simple recipe which contains a nice blend of spices. Make sure you dice your potato into smaller pieces to ensure thorough doneness. Would have paired nicely with cilantro but all I had was basil which worked out fine.

I made this for tonight's dinner, along with Chicken Makhani, and it was great. I used about half as much Reshampatti Chilli Powder (Nirav brand)and it still turned out very spicy hot.  I also added about 1/4 cup of non fat yogurt to finish the sauce and reduce the heat a bit. I made dinner for my sister and brother in law and they do not care for dishes that are too hot.  This sauce is addicting, I kept going back for more and dipping my Naan. I always like to order Aloo dishes when I eat Indian food at a restaurant and this is as good as any I've eaten.

This was a delicious dish and just in time. I harvested one hill of potatoes today and the tomatoes are at their peak. The only suggestion I have is to peel and seed the tomatoes, and I used less oil-just my habit. I served this on a bed of steamed shredded kale and added some ground black pepper at the table. I'll make this again!!

This was SO delicious. I used about 1/4 cup of Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil and added a bit more salt and doubled all of the spices except cayenne. To keep it moist and make it a bit more "saucy", I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chicken broth, which helped to infuse the potatoes with the spices. Served over Quinoa. Healthy, delicious, satisfying, authentic flavor! Thanks!

This is to die for!  I use can tomatoes and cook the potatoes before adding them to the skillet.  (I like them on the softer side....)  I only use half the cayenne and still find it delightfully spicy.  Nom nom... Thanks for sharing!

These were really good. we ran out of fresh so I used canned crushed tomatoes (8 oz) and added some frozen lima beans for extra protein at the same stage. These were not too spicy but delicious, I served them with naan also from this site. Next time maybe i'll add some heat.

I love this recipe.  I have been making Aloo Phujia with a friend's recipe for a long time, it's quite similar to this one.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used 1/2  teaspoon of white pepper powder and 1/4 of a teaspoon of red chili powder for that spicy kick.  Thanks for sharing!

I was making the Cumin and Coriander Rubbed Pork Chops also found on this site and several users recommended this recipe to accompany it. The flavors of both recipes are very strong but do not compete with one another. They really complement each other perfectly.  

I definitely will make this again (and again). I used garden fresh beefsteak tomatoes and tiny gold potatoes. They have very thin skins (plus I hate to peel!) so didn't peel them. I used my dicer for the vegetables to speed up the cooking time. It was spicy but I wouldn't change a thing.

These were really quite good.  I cooked the onions in butter, to add some flavor, and increased the spices, including salt, just a little.  Also sprinkled red pepper flakes on top and pre-boiled the potatoes.  I would suggest using a non-stick pan.

I used leftover baked potatos. Just peeled the brown skin and cut up the rest into 3/4 " pieces
Browned the onions using 1 tbsp of oil and about a half cup of chicken stock. Added a teaspoon of chili paste to oil and used 16 oz can of diced tomatoes and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Fantastic!

Reading the previous reviews I was surprised to see a mixture of raves and then some "bland" comments but i'm afraid I thought this was pretty bland (never thought I'd say that for a curry!) I did add some left over chicken and some mushrooms to the dish and boiled the potatoes before adding to the skillet and used canned tomatoes rather than fresh. The food had a hot kick to it, but no flavour.

this was great! I read the reviews saying it would taste better after it sat a while, so I made it early and let it sit the rest of the day. it was a great side dish and it wasn't too spicy at all.

The one star off is really my fault. I"m just not good at getting potatoes in  a pan to brown! Flavor very good though. I used a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies and addded a couple of handfuls of frozen green peas towards the end. Nice with eggs and a little yougut for brunch.

So far the only dish i've made that my indian relatives gobbled up. Made a few changes 1) double the recipe except tomatos (for double I use 1 whole can of chopped tomatoes)- throw in some frozen peas for colour 2) cooking time - I leave it on low heat for almost an hour after adding tomatoes until it is a reddy brown colour and much drier. It is then very easy to eat with rotis by hand!

Good recipe, loved the flavour. I did not find that the dish is particularily good with rice as there was not enough liquid.  Also, I added garlic, which was great. Overall I will most likely be making this again.

I thought this was pretty good and my husband loved it! I added some curry powder and doubled all the spices except the cayenne pepper.  I cut the oil to about 1/8 cut which left it a little dry so I just added about 1/2 cup of water.  Turned out great! I will make this again.

Wow, delicious, and so satisfying!! I am lebanese and was really craving something different I could eat with pita bread. I tried this recipe, but didn't mesure anything and added some mushrooms and garam masala seasoning. It was sooo good, exactly what I was craving! I had also made some home made mac'n cheese and had it on my plate beside this dish. Whether having this as a side dish with bread or mixed into the mac'n cheese or alone, It was amazing anyway I had it! thanks for the recipe the kids and I love it!

This recipe had little ingredients, very easy to prepare and an absolutely tasty indian side dish. A great way to use up potatoes. Followed as directed but used red potatoes and kosher salt.

The spice combo rocked. We didn't use the same veggies at all. In fact we used chicken and leftover green beans and potatoes, and threw in canned diced tomatoes, but it was still amazing.

When I made this recipe, my family and I had never eaten anything like it. The only thing I did different was  crumbled and browned a pound of spicy sausage in a cast iron skillet. Then I took the sausage out and cooked the potatoes (following the rest of the recipe) and added the sausage back in when I added the tomatoes. This made the dish a whole meal that my family (even my two young daughters) loved. I will deffinately be adding this to our usual recipe rotation.

By itself, I found this bland and am therefore giving it three stars. On the other hand, if you up the spices just a tad and eat it coupled with a second, spicier dish, it's very good. We ate this with chicken hariyali tikka (on this website) and the two complement each other beautifully.

Delicious and easy to make. It is spicy, so if you are like me and don't like burning your tongue, it might be in your best interest to cut the cayenne pepper in half.

I recently had a guest from England and he said he enjoyed Indian food.  I had never made any and thought I would try to make this and it was a really big hit.  It gave him a taste of back home he said.  Thanks!

Wow. I've never had anything like this, but it was amazing! I double the recipe because one lb was only 3 baby reds. I didn't peel the potoatoes, and I ran out of tomatoes. I think I only put in four roma tomatoes. Be careful though, because the sauce really stains!

I have been wanting to make this for some time now, but hubby is not a huge potato fan, nor does he look as forward to trying the indian inspired flavours as much as I do!!  So, since he was out of town, I made this for me...cut back the recipe by half but left spices as they were based on other comments about doubling.  I did opt to reduce the cayenne as I normally find it quite overpowering and I am glad I did as it was pretty hot!  Regardless, I really enjoyed this - used canned diced tomatoes as I had some open in the fridge!  SO GLAD I got to try this, definitely very yummy and I look forward to my leftovers!

These turned out pretty awesome!  It cured my search for 'something different' to do with a potato.  I've never used tumeric before and was pleasantly surprised with the taste it gave the potatoes.  (Beware though, it turns a bright yellow color and stained my fingernail.)  There's definitely heat to these too!

Very good - better if you double the spices (I doubled all but the pepper, didn't want it to be too hot) and add a little bell pepper.  I served this over rice for a tasty dinner last week and have been craving it for days now!!

I love this recipe.  I made it for a co-worker who is from Pakistan and she said she couldn't believe how good it was.  I do add about 1/4 C fresh cilantro leaves at the end of cooking.  It gives it a wonderful taste.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was just okay to me.  I think it could be better by increasing (doubling?) the spices except the cayenne (unless you really like spicy).  I love potatoes so this still was fine but not very flavorful.

Had no trouble with the potatoes being undercooked at the end.  Came out great.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did add peas and carrots to up the nutritional content.  To cut down on the amount of fat, I used a combo of olive oil and water so the potatoes wouldn't stick to the pan.  Also, I used a spicy madras curry powder which can be overwhelming sometimes, so I offset this with the addition of some tomato sauce.  Wonderful!

This is very good, but it seems to be somewhat bland given the amount of spice that the recipe calls for.  I have made it twice now and I tweaked the spicing a little to suit my own tastes adding a pinch of cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp. of curry powder along with tripling the cumin and tumeric. I don't know if the leftovers are good or not . . . I never have any!

This recipe is very good, but I had to make some enhancements (based on the reviews here).  I doubled all the spices except the salt and cayenne. I also added an 1/8 tsp of ground coriander seed (which probably could be bumped up to 1/4 tsp).  To add some variety, I also included cauliflower, peas and carrots.  I loved this variation and got rave reviews from the hungry (and picky!) crowd.  This has been saved to my recipe box and I wouldn't be surprised if I'm asked to make this a couple of times a month.

The whole family loved it, even the little one. SPICY, but worth the exotic food experience. A good addition would be Naan and some Yogurt sauce.

This is a good recipe, but it there's something missing from authentic Indian food (the stuff in India, not Americanized). It was a little dry, even with all that oil. Cube the potatoes small and the same size so they cook in equal amount of time, definitely add more spices (too bland otherwise). I've made it twice and have made it once with fresh tomatoes per the recipe and once with a can of diced tomatoes with the juice to give it more sauce (per a reviewer's suggestion). It's pretty good both ways. This is a tasty recipe, even if it's not authentic. I'll make it in the future. Thanks for posting it!

A decent recipe; could use more spices. I made this in addition to 4 other Indian dishes from this site for a get together and this dish was the least well received. I covered the potatoes and they were cooked perfectly in less time than the recipe stated.

I've made this recipe twice now and I love it!  I've used fresh and canned tomatoes but fresh was much better.  I also added frozen peas and doubled the amount of cumin.  Took me twice a long to cook even though I cut the potatoes small so I had to keep adding water, cover and cook on high heat for an extra 30 minutes.  Tasted great and is now in the regular rotation.  I might try to boil the potatoes first as someone suggested next time.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Yum. I made it with white rice flavoured with whole cumin. I took the advice of others. I doubled the spices, but did not double the cayenne. I also doubled the salt. I added some frozen veg. And I also boiled the potatoes until almost done. Plus I added a veg bouillon. Oh, and I added some dried thyme from South America. It was delish! But be careful not to leave it to simmer too long. It's awesome with a little gravy. A definte keeper.

This recipe is a delightful Godsend.  After a bad day at work, I came home and had to cook a quick dinner and didn't have any meat in the fridge.  Added eggplant and bell pepper to the recipe, cut back the oil a little, and added more cumin.  Wife and I LOVED it!  I'll have it for lunch tomorrow, when the spices have had time to marinate.

This was really delicious.  I almost doubled the potatoes, so doubled the spices.  Leftovers were even better. I like the potatoes cubed to around 1/2" size. nice and small so they cook well and have alot of surface area for spices.  I used canned tomatoes and added the juice for the potatoes to soak up as well.

This is WONDERFUL!  I LOVE Indian foods and flavors and this ranked right up there!  It's a great vegetarian dish too.  I didn't change a thing and the spiciness level was just right for me.  My husband and daughter loved it too.  I've brought it for lunch at work a couple of days and somebody always remarks on the lovely fragrance coming from the microwave saying "It smells like a good restaurant in here."  Love this stuff, it's a keeper!

Loved this recipe! I made it as part of an Indian meal and the potatos added a great spicy kick! Good as leftovers too. I think I'd cut down on the oil just a bit.

A nice simple recipe!  Another "comfort food" dish for snowy nights like tonight.  I tripled the cumin and turmeric, and added some tomato puree and it turned out lovely, as I'm a big fan of Indian flavours.  Also added a green capsicum.  I made my in the slow cooker, on high for a few hours which gave the spices plenty of time to heat up and infuse.

After reading the reviews, I added peas and increased the spices, even though I was only making two servings.  Pretty good, but could probably benefit from the use of a wider variety of vegetables.

We both enjoyed this - next time I will cut back on the tomatoes.  In fact it would be great without them.  I also parboiled my potatoes so I only had to cook them for 5 mins. max.

Except for a bit of a problem with the potatoes cooking properly, I truly loved this dish.  My roommate, who is leery of trying anything "new and different," had almost three helpings!  I can't wait to try it again, pre-cooking the potatoes next time.

This was pretty good.  The tomato adds a nice flavor.  I also added peas and served over rice, like a curry.  Easy and filling!  I will probably make this again...

I have made this several times.  I love it,but my
family won't eat it.  I did cut back a little on  
cayenne & cumin because I buy my spices from Penzeys
Spices and they are fresher and stronger than regular
supermarket spices.  I have had this in an Indian
restaurant and didn't like it.  All of Christines 
recipes that I have tried have been very good.

Seemed simple but was very disappointing...Spicy as all get out but that's about the best thing I can say for it.  Whoever things that 20 minutes is enough is ridiculous.  Even simmering for longer didn't help.  Not worth the time and certainly a waste on the taste buds.

I thought it was delicious. I did listen to the other reviewers and I added a full teaspoon of eace spice and that was perfect. Instead of real tomatoes I used canned crushed ones. Very good. My husband loved it.

Very good. I added 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tbsp. diced ginger, some cauliflower and peas, and served it with yogurt on the side. I took it to a get-together, by the time I got to the bowl, there was a bout 2 tbsp. left. Compliments by all.

My husband and I made this dish on Sunday week and we abso loved it!  It's not too spicy; just very tasty.  Our 6 year old doesn't usually like potato dishes, but he loved this.  This is going to be one of our usual sides.

This was so tasty and different.  Be sure to lightly toast the onions and then the spices in the oil to bring out the full flavor.  Stunk up my kitchen, but I want to make it again!  By the way, I tried adding some slightly blanched cauliflower to the mix because I remember having cauliflower at a restaurant before like this and it was eaten all up by my picky hubby.  Maybe next time I will add garbanzos too.  I don't really have little kids, but I didn't want to give this one a bad rating in any way.

This dish is very simple to make an has a surprisingly authenic flavor.  I doubled the spices to suit my taste. I will be making this frequently. I loved it!

This is delicious and easy East Indian cuisine. With some naan and cabbage salad, it makes a quick healthy vegetarian meal.

This was very good & very easy.  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand which was great!  The recipe calls for 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, but I put a full teaspoon & even after that it was only mildly spicy, but I felt it was just right for me.  This would go really well with a side of saffron rice and naan ( indian bread).

Well I wouldn't say these potatoes are spicey.  But they're good.  I added a little more salt to bring out the flavor.  I served them with Moraccan Chicken, which was a great combination.

This is really good to make in a meal plan. All you really need is potatoes tomatoes and onions. I pretty much always have potatoes, spices, and onions on hand for other recipes. So making this just requires for me to buys some tomatoes and naan bread.

Used one pkg of grape tomatoes as a substitute, and added a carrot.  Next time I will reduce the oil to just enough to coat the pan and add 2 more carrots.

We used some canned tomatoes, but next time I’ll leave them out. We felt like they really didn’t add much. All that aside it was really good. The recipe isn’t lying when it says it’s super spicy! But if you can handle it, this recipe is really good.

Delicious!  I made a mistake and didn't realize I didn't have tomatoes on hand until I was in the middle of making this and like 4 other dishes.  I made a quick last minute substitute of tomato sauce and- while I'm sure there was some difference- it sufficed and this was one tasty dish!

Delicious!  Tripled the spices (turmeric and cumin), doubled the salt and cayenne pepper.  Garnish with cilantro for a little extra something.

I cooked the potatoes for about 15 minutes before adding tomatoes, and it turned out perfectly.  If they're not quite soft enough for you still, turn the stove on simmer, and leave the pan covered for another 5 minutes.

I loved it. I choped the tomatoes, spices, half of the onion and some ginger in a food processor beforehand. 
Also boiled the potatoes for a few minutes already cubed. 

Than added the oil, onion and after 2-3min the potatoes. Adding the sauce from the processor and let it all boil for a while. So the spices come all out

I served it with some joghurt dip, for thise who don't eat to spicy. 

Will make it again :)

I made this for my parents and brother and it was a success!! Everyone enjoyed it. I have to admit i made some changes, I used sweet potatoes, and for my Nan I added some coconut milk to take away some of the spiciness.  It is a must if you enjoy Indian style food. Hope everyone gets as much pleasure out off this recipe as I did!

I used rose potatoes so I didn't peel. I par baked in microwave while spices cooked. I halved the salt and cayenne, too spicy for my dad. After cooking I added a little of seasoned salt and pepper. And crushed reds to my portion to add the heat back.

Like some other reviewers, I found the original recipe to be too bland, so I tripled the spices (except the salt) and added some coriander. I also softened the potatoes ahead of time in the microwave and included some green peppers for good measure.

Didn't really come out as i had hoped.  Not enough chilli or spices.  I also added 1/2 cup water to make sure it didn't stick to the pan because it did at first.  But all in all its a good basic recipe to have at tea time or even as an appetizer.

This is a great recipe!  It's definitely way too spicy for me as written, so I put in at most 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  Additionally, I use 1/2 teaspoon cumin.

Tried this for dinner last night. Excellent mix of flavors! I would probably cut back on the salt next time. Mine turned out a bit too salty for my taste. I increased the amounts of turmeric and cumin though. I took other reviewers' advice to boil the potatoes first. I also added some chopped parsley just before serving.^_^

This was relatively easy and quick to prepare and yielded decent enough results.  I doubled the turmeric and cumin, and used canned tomatoes instead. Next time I will use olive oil instead since that seems healthier and will probably give a better flavor, and use half the recommended salt.  Although I'm a salt lover, the recommended amount was too much even for me, so I will use less in the cooking and people can later salt at the table.  I would have appreciated some idea as to how high to keep the temperature throughout the various steps.  This wasn't knock your socks off good, but it was good.  I served it over basmati rice, and was an interesting and satisfying vegetarian dish.  My husband liked it very much, so I will probably make this again.

This was amazing!  The recipe is perfectly seasoned, very spicy but not hot for hot's sake--the spices truly enhanced the flavor.  Serving this over white rice transformed this from a side into a main.  This recipe is going into my regular rotation.  It's quick to make and perfect for anyone's Meatless Monday.

This is VERY good, and very cheap to make! I don't bother peeling my potatoes because I'm lazy. I also sometimes use crushed tomatoes in place of chopped tomatoes. If it gets too dry while cooking, I add water. I also use about a tsp of curry paste. Great in whole wheat tortillas or over brown rice! Best in homemade fresh whole wheat pitas.

This was good, I've never had it before, so didn't know much about how it was supposed to taste, but it was good. I had to add a little bit of water to the pan to keep everything from burning. It is delicious on a pita with some greens and your favorite sauce.

We add cream before we add the tomatoes and let is cook about 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. This gives you a great sauce to pour over rice.

Loved this!  I cut the potatoes into smallish cubes to be sure they cook through and use half the cayenne to cut down on the spiciness.  Sometimes if I'm out of fresh tomatoes I use a can of diced tomatoes (with some of the juice poured off). Yum!

I didn't have any potatoes on hand so I substitute yellow squash and carrots. I also added about a half cup of plain yogurt. Very tasty and the right amount of heat.

This is pretty good.  Not spicy enough for me, but I can fix that next time around.    I should have taken the advice of a another reviewer who said to boil the potatoes first.  Smart idea as cooking the potatoes as stated in the recipe takes much longer than 20 minutes.

Very good, hit with everyone. Slight modifications, I added sliced carrots, a little curry, cinnamon, & cloves. I used olive oil instead of vegetable and par boiled the potatoes to save some time. I also cut back on the cayenne to just a few dashes. Would be great with chicken also. Definitely will make again. Whole family thought it was delicious.

I blended the tomatoes with a little green pepper to get more of a paste and I doubled the amount of turmeric and cumin, but the dish was a huge hit. Even the guests that "don't like Indian food" were going for seconds and thirds.

Excellent recipe. I tweaked just a little, doubled the spices (except chili powder) added 1 tsp mustard seeds (this makes it much more authentic) and 1 tsp sugar. All my Indian friends were very impressed!! Could also be used as a filling for samosas, almost the same flavor, you would just have to add peas.

A decent basic recipe as is, but this just needs more flair to get 4 stars for me. After chopping enough vegetables as called for, I decided to add in a couple chopped carrots (which added great color) and cilantro for freshness (be sure to add it at the very end). I found it actually quite light on the spices; if you like spicy I'd recommend adding more cayenne to taste. It tasted okay but nothing fancy, and definitely not very authentically Indian - but hey - it's quick, easy, and can satisfy a curry craving.

I added smoked sausage and peas to this dish.  It was good but not great.  I like a lot more flavor and I expected that with the kinds of spices it calls for.  I didn't use the cayenne because I can't handle spicy hot.  Maybe next time I will try a different type of potato and use more spices.

This was fantastic! I halved the cayenne so my three year old would eat it and it still had a bit of a bite. I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have fresh ones, I threw in some peas and a pound of cooked chopped chicken thighs to make it a meal. I'll definitely double the recipe next time to have more left over! Sooo good!

I didn't think that 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne would make it very spicy, but it really was quite spicy. I boiled the potatoes first, and this cut down the frying time by at least half. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. They tasted yummy plain, but I also tried adding ketchup on top and that tasted really good too (and cut down the spiciness).

I think I may have had closer to two pounds of potatoes, so I doubled the spices.  It's pretty spicy, but I love it!

This was pretty easy to make, although cooking the potatoes took a while. I love spicy food, so I didn't think it was too hot.

This was very good and easy! I also doubled the cumin and tumeric. I added green peppers to mine and a little water. It seems like it is missing depth. I may try adding a little chicken stock in the future.

Tasty and easy recipe!  I added carrots and peas, and tripled the spices.  I also make ahead at least 1 day.  I double the recipe and freeze half for later.  Yummy!

This tasted delicious but the potatoes definitely need more cooking time. I cooked mine for a very long time and it was still undercooked. People have suggested boiling them first which I will be trying next. 20 minutes of cooking time in total isn't enough for raw potatoes in the pan.

Simply amazing recipe! It's quick and easy to make. We like our food spicy so next time i will add a little more spice, but it is quite spicy to begin with. I can't wait to make this again when tomatoes are in season.

This dish was easy to make and flavorful.  My man thought it could use some more flavor.  I added the exact amount of spices it called for but apparently I needed more.  I thought it had kind of a curry flavor to it and it was good.  I give it a 4 star but my man gives it a 3.

Delish, only changes I made were to use 2 extra tomatoes and reduce the cayenne to 1/8 tsp, my family does not like things too spicy.  At the end I threw in some frozen peas, fresh cilantro and added 1/2 tsp of garam masala which really seemed to give some extra taste.  Served as is with raita (yoghurt with cucumber and mint).

This was an excellent side dish recipe.  Served it with a fish dish and the mildness of the fish was set off nicely by the potato.    One small point...I did use a 15oz can of diced tomatoes (with the juice) instead of the chopped fresh tomatoes.  It was excellent and will go into my "side dish" rotation.  Thank you!

Fantastic recipe--only changes I make are 1) that I can't bear to dump that much oil in, so I use a little less b) I don't like spicy so I don't use the cayenne. Simple and scrumptious.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a little broccoli and carrot.  I also like mine with a little sour cream on the side, but I have no idea if actual Indian people would approve of this idea or not.

This recipe was all right.  I should have added more spices as many recommended because it came out extremely bland.  Edible, and inspired me to investigate similar recipes, but I would not make again.

Flavorful and satisfying!  Hubby & I loved it.  I tossed the potatoes in the hot oil first, allowed them to cook for about 10 minutes before adding the onions and following the rest of the recipe.  I just wanted to ensure that the potatoes would be well cooked.  I also added some frozen green peas.  Can't wait to make it again!

Yum! Very tasty & pleasantly spicy veggie recipe.  We used canned tomatoes, as I did not have any fresh, & it was still quite good.  Makes for a nice veggie meal over rice.

This was very tasty. I made a few changes, but only because I didn't have the ingredients  the recipe calls for. I used 1 large sweet potato, and a handful of grape tomatoes. It was yummy.

I should have read the reviews before starting out, because my potatoes weren't fully cooked.  Next time, I'll give a quick boil to get them going.  Otherwise I really enjoyed this recipe!  I added some pepper, and cut back the salt.

I am not finding the spices weak, but mine are  all newer.  If your spices are old (2 yrs) or kept in the open light perhaps doubling is necessary?

It's OK but I wasn't that impressed. I've tasted too many other indian recipes that I like alot better!

This was tasty. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and halved the amount of cayenne pepper. My only complaint is the potatoes took a lot longer than 20 mins. Mine took about 40 mins.

I love this recipe although it does tend to be a little mushy. My only problem is that it tends to stick/burn to the sauce pan. I still highly recommend it.

Although i liked the way it looked, I found this to be very bland even after doubling the spices, I guess i was expecting more of a kick. Very easy to make.

I followed this recipe word for word, and it was delicious!!! I was expecting it to be spicier, but it wasn't at all, for my tastes, so I may even add more cayenne next time. I noticed someone suggested peas - I may try that next time.

I have made this several times using slightly less cayenne, canned sliced potatoes, and canned tomatoes.  I don't know if this is truly how it should look & taste - but I think it is tasty!

Excellent! I used split yellow mung beans, which I find have less of a "dirt" taste to them than regular yellow split peas. It really allowed the flavor of the spices to shine through!

I thought it would've been helpful to know how high the heat should have been. I ended up cooking the potatoes for much longer than 10 minutes, but with the tomatoes, this gave it a "stewier" texture.  Also added more spices (believe it or not it wasn't hot enough for us) and added a little plain yogurt for creaminess.  It all worked out, because my wife thought it superb and was willing to eat the entire thing for dinner.

I made the recipe and really liked it, although I didn't add the tomatos (don't like them), used onion powder, and used peper flakes instead of pepper called for. Family liked them as well. I boiled them first, before frying.

This was pretty yummy.  I upped the spices as it wasn't as spicy as I'm used to Indian food being.  Top off this dish with freshly carmelized onions.
