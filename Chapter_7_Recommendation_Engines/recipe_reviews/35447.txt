These baked up pretty, delicious and crackly. I followed the recipe exactly.  I had no problem rolling the dough into balls or the sugar.  I tend to like thicker cookies, so on the last cookie sheet I tried not flattening the cookie dough balls at all and, interestingly, it made no difference whatsoever.  They're light, just barely crispy and chewy all at once, and almost literally melt in your mouth.  One thing they're NOT, however, and what made me somewhat disappointed with them, is cinnamon-y!  I'm not so much disappointed in the recipe, I guess, as I am with my own expectations.  The title does begin with "Cinnamon," and I based my expectations on that and the cinnamon chips - I should have had foresight, I suppose, and noticed there was no cinnamon in the dough.  In keeping with the "Cinnamon Cookie" idea, were I to make these again I'd try backing off on both the nutmeg and ginger, and add a good amount of cinnamon instead.  This made a LOT of dough, way more than I needed.  But it worked out well because I gave half the dough to a busy friend to bake with her daughter and she was thrilled!  Just another thought...with vanilla extract as pricey as it is, I have my doubts as to whether 2 T. is necessary.  I'd bet that with all the spice in the cookie that you'd notice no difference if that was reduced to 2 teaspoons.  Additionally, the lesser amount of liquid may be all that's needed to help those who found the dough difficult to work with.

These cookies are so chewy, spicy, and good.  I used 3 sticks of butter (eeek, good thing it makes a lot of cookies!) in place of the 1.5 cups of shortening and reduced the salt to three-quarters of a tsp. and they came out great.

These are very good cookies with a taste all their own.  I only made two minor changes, and that was to use margarine instead of shortening(I personally don't like using shortening for cookies) and I also only used 1 tsp of nutmeg and ginger. My dough was not "stiff" as was indicated it would be.  The dough was too gooey to roll so I just scooped it out using my Tablespoon cookie scoop like any other cookie and sprinkled them with sugar before I put them in the oven. Oh, and one other thing, I could not find light molasses, so I used regular. The cookies turned out excellent!  This recipe is a keeper! I will definately make them again. Thank you!

Amazing little cookie. I did end up cutting this recipe in half, I almost wish I hadn't. Only change I made was using all butter. I found that nine minutes at 350* was perfect for these cookies. I used my small #40 cookie scoop for this and it made perfect sized cookies. And the taste? Wow. These might be my new favorites!

These cookies are soooo yummy, especially when right out of the oven!  The cinnamon chips really add a lot of flavor.  This is definitely a "do again" recipe!

Pretty good cookies.  I like the cinnamon chips, but they are sweet, so I'd scale back on the sugar next time by about 1/2  a cup.  With all of the sugar in the dough and rolling in sugar, it was just a tad too much for me.  Otherwise, these are easy and good.  The dough is more soft than stiff but it's easy to work, so it's all good to me.  Rather than searching 20 stores for cinnamon chips (not my idea of a good time!) I learned on the Recipe Exchange that Hershey has a product locator.  Incidently, so does Nestle but they don't make cinnamon chips.  You can figure out if anywhere near you sells cinnamon chips by going to this website  Thanks for the recipe!

A refreshing change from the traditional "gingersnap" cookie.  Wow!  Still have that yummy spiciness, but with the cinnamon chips... Brilliant!  Used my trademark Butter Flavor Crisco.  And, tossed in a bit more of recommended spices.  Presented beautifully!!  Can't wait to serve these at Xmas.

These had a nice flavor.  Don't be afraid to put the 2 T of vanilla in,  like I was; it's balanced by the spices.  However, this was not the molasses spice cookie I thought it would be, but a light batter.  The dough was not at all stiff as mentioned.  It was too soft to roll.  I added an extra 1 c of flour and chilled it.  I also did not need to flatten them as they spread when cooked.  Cinnamon chips were impossible to find in my area.  I substituted butterscotch.  I'm sure the cinnamon would be great, but I spent 2 hours and didn't find them.

Fantastic cookie!  I did sub butter for the shortening, only because of personal preference.  I didn't expect the dough to be stiff because of the butter substitution, so I just dropped them onto cookie sheets.  None of my local stores carried cinnamon chips, so I just added the cinnamon into the cookie batter, used butterscotch chips, and then sprinkled the cookies with cinammon sugar before baking.  I did cut the reicpe in half and am glad I did because it makes a LOT of cookies.   These cookies will now be part of my holiday cookie tradition.

Did anyone find the 4 tsp of baking soda unusual? I made a batch and all I could taste was the baking soda in the cookies. I found a similar recipe that only uses 1 1/2 tsp.  Maybe I'm overly sensitive since I don't see other reviews with a similar experience, but next time I'm going to cut it down to 2 tsp and see how they taste.  It completely overpowered all the spices for me.

Very tasty and the smell when it's done baking is AMAZING, but this is way too much salt for the recipe. Everyone complained that it was too salty.. next time I'll only put half as much salt if not less.

These are 5 star in flavor. After reading through all of the reviews I went ahead and used ALL butter instead of shortening. The flavor was great, the only problem was that my cookies turned out extremely flat. Next time, I think I'll try half butter, half butter flavored shortening and hope for better looking cookies.

Thanks for the recipe! It took me a whole year to make them because in my area there were NO cinnamon chips to be had. This year we hit the jackpot and my hoarding kicked in, so we're set for awhile now with 12 bags. LOL

As other reviewers have stated, the cinnamon chips are difficult to find. Luckily, I had found a bag in my travels and I think the next time I find some I will do what a baker friend of mine does, which is freeze a couple bags. I made as recipe as written, next time I may add a teaspoon or so of cinnamon, possibly cut the sugar by a 1/2 cup and I might try converting them to an oatmeal cookie, as I love the texture that oats add to a cookie. Thank you Linda for sharing this recipe! My husband is extremely grateful.

I only use half of the ginger and nutmeg, otherwise, I think they are overpowering.  I also refrigerate the dough before I scoop it and roll it in the sugar.  They turn out great!  Everyone at work loves them!

Very nice cookies.  I found the Hershey's Cinnamon Chips at an Albertson's store in north Seattle.  My question is what is 'light molasses'?  I've never heard of it and can't find it in the stores.

For me you can never get enough spice in a cookie so these are perfect.  I did use butter in place of the shortening and added some crystalized root ginger.  Thank you for sharing.

These cookies were nice and chewy. I added about 1/2 teaspoon more ginger and an overflowing teaspoon of cloves to the batter. I was surprised at how soft the dough was - not stiff at all. I was able to scoop it in my cookie scoop and then roll the dough in cinnamon sugar. I'm not really crazy about using all shortening in a cookie recipe, so if I make them again I'll try using half butter and half shortening. I'll also add some cinnamon into the dough and increase the flour a bit to make it a bit stiffer.

These are good cookies, but I feel as though the title was somehow misleading.  I was expecting a cinnamon cookie with some other spices, but it really was just a spice cookie with cinnamon chips.  Again, a good cookie, just not what I expected.  I even subbed cinnamon for some of the other spices and I could barely tell it was in there.  For those of you looking for Cinnamon Chips, I had to order them on Amazon.com.  None of the other grocery stores (Wal-mart, Kroger or Whole Foods) around me carried them.

Beautiful cookies(mine took longer to bake, 12 min), easy dough to work with, I just didn't care for the flavor at all. I think it's purely a personal thing-I didn't like the taste of the dough, the smell of them baking, or the finished product. My oldest son liked them so now he has A TON of cookies all to himself.

These cookies are fabulous.  I only had blackstrap molasses so the taste may have been a bit stronger, but we all agreed that they taste fantastic.  This one will be added to my holiday baking, but is good any time of year.  It is hard finding the cinnamon chips.  My grocer told me they only carry them at Christmas so if you find them, stock up on a few bags!

I love this recipe.  I'm not much of a chocolate person and this is the perfect non-chocolate cookie.  Will use this recipe often.  Thanks Linda for submitting.

Made 8 kinds of Christmas cookies this December, by far these were my favorite.  I could eat them all day long!  Only change I made was using cinnamon instead of the ginger and nutmeg.  Everyone said these were addictive!  I love Hershey's Cinnamon Chips!

Good, easy and most importantly, a great way to use up my cinnamon chips I had purchased with no idea what to do with them. I followed the recipe exactly, although I didn't flatten the cookies. Mine didn't turn out quite as crackled looking and stayed pretty high so they are quite chewy (which we like). I made these for a school bake sale and I think they will be a nice change from the typical choc chip and brownies. :)

I bought a bag of cinnamon chips awhile back, because I had never seen them before- and I finally found a recipe to use them!  First off, I didn't have shortening, and it turned out I was a little short on butter- so I used margarine. Next time I will use butter, because everytime I use margarine for cookies- the consistency is a little too "cake-like" for my taste.  I followed the rest of the recipe, except I didn't have ginger- so I added a little allspice.  The recipe said to use an ungreased cookie sheet, and I normally use Pam- this time I didn't, and the cookies were a little difficult to get off the sheet.  Also, like all the other people said, the dough was definitely not stiff. I tried putting it in the freezer for 15 minutes since I was short on time- but it still was not stiff enough to be able to roll into balls. So, I dropped the scoops onto the sheet and then sprinkled with sugar...they didn't come out as 'pretty' as other people have said, only cuz I couldn't roll them in sugar.   BUT, overall...they taste pretty yummy! The house smelled like Christmas time while they were baking. I will be making them again, but will try to fix the problems I had the first time.

These are amazing!!! I adjusted the spices a bit, only about a scant teaspoon nutmeg and I added cinnamon. Also, I used white whole wheat flour.  I used mostly earth balance buttery spread and some coconut oil instead of shortening. This is one of the best cookie recipes I've ever made. I'm sure if I'd had the cinnamon chips it would have been even better. Seriously amazing cookies.

Made recipe exactly as written, using butter flavored shortening.  They cookies are very good!  Perfect texture - a little crunchy on the edges yet soft in the middle.  Originally, I was worried that the cinnamon chips wouldn't be enough flavoring.  But they are little tiny chips, and pretty potent.  Good Stuff!   But beware - as written, this recipe makes a TON of cookies.  Probably 100  two-inch cookies.

These are really good. I wasn't sure at first, because I used 'blackstrap molasses' [it's what I had on hand] And you can diffently taste the molasses. A very nice x-mas cookie to put with your collection.

I have never cooked with molasses, and as soon as I opened the jar I thought, "OMG, these cookies are going to be gross." But I kept on trucking... I followed the recipe as written except I didnt have ginger so I added 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice in place of the ginger and nutmeg. Also, my grocery store was out of cinnamon chips so I used coarsely chopped pumpkin spice hershey kisses in its place. After baking for 10 mins they were ready to come out of the oven. I took a bite, and.... wait for it.... YUMMY! These cookies are thick and chewy and just so pretty. These are going on my Christmas cookie platter:)

Marvelous Cookies! My husband loves ginger and cinnamon and he loved these cookies! I did of course add a little bit to the recipe. I used 1 cup white 1 cup brown sugar. (B sugar helps keep baked goods soft after they are cooked plus more molasses taste is always good) I also used bread flour instead of AP (all purpose). The high protein content in the bread flour makes them chewier. I also almost added more spices some Ground Cloves, Cinnamon and extra ginger. :) Also watch the bake time mine barely took 8 mins. Enjoy!

These actually came out more like tiny gingersnaps with cinnamon chips in them, but I've had dozens of requests for the recipe.  I made them with splenda, and they came out amazing with only 30 calories in each little cookie.  Definitely the best choice on the cookie plate.  Of course, not if you eat 5 cookies at a time...

Don't know where I went wrong but these were not that great.  I bake every week, dozens every week and I was looking forward to this one but they weren't stiff so I just dropped them on a sheet...flat, flat, flat.  Only thing I did different was not use the amount of salt indicated.

I used 1 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup butter. I just didn't have enough shortening. These cookies are very good. They remind me of the gigersnaps I ate as a kid only not as spicy or crunchy hard. I love how soft they are. These are my new favorite "gingersnap" cookies. P.S. Took the to work then extra day since there were so many of them. Everyone loved them.

These weren't "to die for" cookies as I'd hoped, however, they were still good. I added about 3 tablespoons of cinnamon before I got the cinnamon-y taste I was looking for, and eliminated the nutmeg in lieu of a couple shakes of cloves and pumpkin pie spice I wanted to use up. I used butter instead of shortening and used half baking soda/half baking powder as I didn't want a flat, greasy cookie. Dough was easy to work with and roll out. My 5 year-old DD helped me roll them in cinnamon sugar. They baked up into cute little cookies.

Using the scoop-and-level method for measuring flour (and not sifting), I found the dough to be a perfect density for the method as written.  Suggestions:  try smaller balls than the walnut-size suggested; roll lightly in your palms after dipping into sugar; use parchment paper; bake ONLY until edges are firm and cookies are still puffy (6 minutes in my oven); and follow the author's advice to remove at once and cool on racks (where cookies will deflate and produce the crinkled effect).  When I halved the recipe, doubled the cinnamon,  omitted ginger, and substituted some butter for some of the shortening, it yielded 3 dozen cookies, with a nice combination of crisp and chewy, and strong  cinnamon flavor.   A keeper!

I didn't care for these. It's not my type of cookie to begin with, but I figured it's the pefect time to try these. Thanksgiving! they were good, but just not for me. Too spicy, too much going on. I prefer delicious, more simpler tasting cookies. But if you like spice in cookies, definitely try these!

Just made these and they are a good cookie, but I'm not as excited about them as I had hoped.  I think it's the after taste of molasses that I'm not enjoying so much; I've never cooked with molasses before and I'm guessing it's just a personal preference thing.  Having said that, the cookies turned out beautiful and were super easy to make.  I did use 3 sticks of unsalted butter because I couldn't bring myself to eat shortening in a cookie, used half white and half brown sugar, added 2 tsp. of my prized Vietnamese cinnamon to the dough, and cut the baking soda and salt in half.  I also rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar, rather than just sugar.  The cookies are gorgeous, not flat and thin, the dough was nice and stiff (yes, even using all butter), and they baked up perfectly in 12 minutes.  I would try this recipe again leaving the molasses out and I imagine that would make this a five-star recipe for me.  Thanks!  It was great to try something new.  :)

These may be my new favorite cookies! I just ate 2 of them still warm from the oven with a glass of cold milk. Only made 1/2 a recipe. Probably won't last long.I mixed about a tablespoon of cinnamon with the sugar and rolled the dough ball in it like a snickerdoodle. Yummy!

I just bit into the best spice cookie EVER. I followed the recipe exactly except that my molasses wasn't light, and I lessened the ginger and nutmeg in order to add 2 t of cinnamon. The dough was just right for rolling into balls and then into cinnamon/sugar. Baked them on a silicon sheet. My husband took one bite and said "Wow!" They are so, so, good.

these are addictive! I used 2 tsps cinnamon and 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and ginger, rolled them in cinnamon sugar (1 tsp cinnamon and 3/8 cup sugar) 1 tbsp scoop made 102 cookies, 10 minutes was perfect on silpat liners.

These cookies were excellent!  I made half a batch and took them into work, they were gone in less than a hour and people were wondering where they could get more.  So simple to make and a big bonus with the twist on the usual molasses cookie.

These are so good! I used butter-flavored shortening just because I felt like it (ha!). Not only do these taste fantastic, but they are really pretty too! Thanks :)

My family (and friends) LOVE this recipe!  They turn out beautiful every time and taste oooh so yummy!  I have made two minor changes:  2 tsp. baking soda (instead of 4) and 1 tsp. salt   (instead of 2) Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!

These really are delicious!  I used butter flavored shortening and used regular molasses, but kept everything else the same.  These are like a soft chewy gingersnap.  They were better the next day also.  Will make again!

Great recipe!  My first try came out very soft (as they are supposed to, but a bit too soft for me) so the second time I added a little less molasses (about a third of a cup), both times they came out fantastic.  :)

I noticed another person tried butterscotch chips as a substitute.  I really do not recommend the butterscotch at all.  It's a strong flavor that ends up competing with the strong molasses and ginger flavors and overall I didn't think it worked very well.

I tried another batch with white chocolate chips as a substitute chip and the slightly reduced molasses and those were amazingly good.  Rave reviews over the holidays from family members including my 3-yr.-old niece who always tells it like it is.  ;)

I greased the cookie sheet with margarine, I like to grease the sheet even though this recipe says not to.  They came out great with nice goldeny flat bottoms.  I decorated at the end with confectioner's sugar instead of white sugar which I also recommend.

That's it for my changes, other than that I made them as per the recipe.  Fantastic cookies, I'm sure I'll be making these again!

I cut the recipe in half and it ended up making over 30 cookies. I didnt have the hershey's cinnamon chips so I used a teaspoon of cinnamon instead. Also I forgot to roll the first batch of cookies in sugar and they turned out great. With the second batch I added leftover bag of butterscotch chips and rolled cookies in sugar.  For future cookies do not need to be rolled in sugar. I felt like it was too sugary that way.


2nd time I made the recipe left out sugar and butter. Substituted with 1c of honey instead. Turned out cakey, looking like a pancake, but not bad.  Needed to spray cookie sheets really good since cookie sticks. Also refer to tips substituting  with honey.

The batter was not stiff. After baking, the cookies fell apart. The big pieces/crumbs were ok. To me, something seemed to be missing.

Think "crisp gingersnap cookies with a burst of cinnamon!"  I made the recipe pretty much as directed, except instead of nutmeg (I'm not a fan), I used cinnamon, which could have been omitted due to the cinnamon chips.  For the shortening, I used butter-flavored Crisco.  Using my cookie scoop, I dropped dough balls onto the cookie sheet and flattened slightly with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar (you'd only need 1/4 cup).   I made 1/2 batch and got 44 cookies.

the flavor is pretty good but I changed it a bit from reading other reviews. I decreased the nutmeg and ginger by half and added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I can not imagine what this would have been with more nutmeg... They were flat as pancakes.  If you like a crispy cookie this is the one for you, I prefer soft that's why I am giving it a three.

I was looking for a cookie recipe that would use the cinnamon chips I picked up on a whim.  I'm not really a molasses cookie fan but picked this one because all the other spices sounded like they would make a good cookie (and it has a lot of good reviews).
I used regular molasses as I didn't have any light molasses, and used butter instead of shortening.  I also ended up adding just a touch more flour as the dough did not seem 'stiff' as the recipe says it should be.
I did have a little trouble with the tops not cracking on the first couple batches.  Next time I'll use a little more flour and and a touch more soda and maybe let the dough sit just for a little while before baking them.
Regardless these got rave reviews at the office Christmas cookie exchange.

I made these for my coworkers and they got rave reviews. These cookies are absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe to the letter. I'm already planning on making more and freezing them (after the baked cookies are completely cooled) for the occasional snack. Yum!

Wonderful! These will replace plain old gingersnaps in my cookie repertoire. I did not find the dough to be very stiff, but it was easy to use a medium-sized scoop to make balls and roll them quickly in sugar. My cookies were a bit larger - 8 per sheet pan. I doubt I'll wait until Christmas to make them again - thanks!!

I used margarine instead of shortening and found the dough to be much too sticky to handle. This was also probably why the cookies turned out very flat and the tops didn't crackle. The cookies certainly had a good taste even if they weren't the prettiest things to look at.

Loved these. Found the cinnamon chips as a seasonal item and stocked up. Changes made were, to use 1 cup of shortening and 1/2 C of butter. Cut the vanilla back to 1 TBSP, 1 tsp of nutmeg and per other reviews, added in a tsp of cinnamon. Otherwise everything else was perfect. Baked for 9 minutes and with my small cookie scoop, got 76 cookies out of this batch. All were uniform and about 2 1/2 inches across. Tastes better the next day, the spices really come out.

I love these cookies!  I made a couple of changes though.  I cannot buy cinnamon chips in my area so I added 2 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  I'm not a fan of shortening so I subbed butter (not margarine!) The taste is to die for!  Also - because I am a cinnamon freak - I rolled the dough balls in cinnamon sugar before baking.  Love!

Made these tonight -- only change I made was to use 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp Cinnamon Plus (kind of like Apple Pie Spice).  I also was short on Molasses, so only used 3 oz. instead of 4 oz. with no impact on flavor.  Consistency of dough was perfect -- used a teaspoon cookie scoop and got more than 6 dozen cookies.  I also sprayed my cookie sheet very lightly with Pam since I wasn't using a non-stick sheet.  Will definitely make these again!

I cut the recipe in half (I need 5 dozen cookies like I need a whole in my head) and they turned out terrific.  The dough was stiff which made it very easy to work with.  I did use dark molasses but turned out great. I even made a larger cookie for a cookie sundae.  Baked in a 6in cake pan for 13 minutes.  Dusted the bottom of the pan with sugar, pressed in the dough and then sprinkled sugar on top.

I liked this one, others loved them at my family event.  I did make a few changes-only used 1 cup butter, added flaxmeal to replace other amount.  I used 1 cup each white and brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, and added cyrstalized giner bits to the last few batches.  There was no way this works to roll into balls using butter.  I chilled it after 2 trays had cooked into flat slightly lumpy things.  After chilling and changing to my smaller cookie scoop, they were better, best after adding the ginger bits.  I will make again doing aditional modifications though.  I thought they were too greasy/oily from the butter and the chips.  I plan on cutting the butter to 1/2-3/4 cup and adding more flaxmeal &/or applesauce to get some rise and not flat cookies.  These require the ginger bits for my house to really enjoy them.  They are all gone so they only lasted 2 days!  I am passing the recipe on to my aunt who loved them.

I had a little trouble with the first two batches that went into the oven, but by the third batch they were turning out good.  I think I made too many substitutions which caused a runny cookie to start with.  Mine were still very flat and the appearance wasn't great but the flavor was AWESOME!  My husband really liked them.  Next time I will try to follow the recipe closer because this was a really great flavored cookie. :>)

Outstanding.  Makes a ton.  I didn't change a thing.  I found that if you refrigerate the dough, it was actually harder to roll because the chips didn't sink it.  I have rolled these in sugar and popped them in the freezer.  They will be wonderful when a friend pops over and I need a quick dessert with tea.

VERY buttery.  I used white morsels b/c it was all I had.  These were good, but they was nothing extra-special about them to me.

I have been making these cookies for a few years. I make them most often at Christmas, but my father-in-law asks for them all the time. I frequently get asked for this recipe.

Nice cookie.  I used mostly butter and 1/4 of the shortening, otherwise followed exactly.  My non-spice hubby says that they are pretty good, that's a compliment.  I think they are a bit too sweet, otherwise very good.  My kids loved them.

WOW!!!  These are my new favorite cookies with molasses!  I halved the recipe but I still added almost a whole bag of cinnamon chips.  They are fantastic.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended with 5 dozen cookies exactly using a medium scoop.  I liked the actual flavor of the cookies, but the taste of cinnamon chips left much to be desired.  They sort of taste like white chocolate chips with mild cinnamon flavor.  Although I'm not a fan of cinnamon chips, I can see myself making these cookies again without them.

I'm surprised at the reviews on these cookies.  They just are not that great.  I cut back the nutmeg and ginger to 1 1/2 tsps each and they are still pretty overpowered with spice.  Plus the flavors just do not blend well.  I'm not sure what it is.  My husband described it as something really good in with something bad that just ruins the cookie.  The rest of the family said they were OK and some really liked them but I still won't be making them again.

It was difficult tracking down a grocery store that carried cinnamon chips, but I finally found them at Lucky's. It was worth the search! These cookies are so good. Spicy, but still sweet enough that my kids loved them! I will definitely make these again!
