Made as written and these were excellent! The only thing missing is a little bit of Sriracha. I was worried about how loose the batter was but they turned out beautiful. If you like Kimchi you should really give this a try!

I will make this again.  My husband lived in Korea for a year and misses the food.  He told me about 'Kimchi Pancakes' and I was pretty sure that they would be gross.  Quite the opposite, these were delicious.  The hubby loved them.  The only change I made was that I didn't want yellow onion and instead used a bunch of chopped green onion (it's just a flavour preference on my part).  Thanks!
