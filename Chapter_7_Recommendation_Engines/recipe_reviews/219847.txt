This was a great meal. It was simple, quick and easy. the only difference that I made was I added some onion and some garlic with the chicken. I would make this again for my family!

Delicious dish.  Good flavour.  I had red, green, and yellow peppers so used 1/4 of each.  Also used coloured rotini pasta.  Easy to make, very tasty.  4 stars.

Tasty, simple & easy! Few changes: added garlic & onion to chicken; added leftover homemade salsa, fresh cilantro, fresh squeezed lime, black beans and sour cream to the sauce. Super filling and not too bad for ya either! Served over jasmine rice (pic added) because we're really not a pasta family) but next time will definitely make with the pasta! Great find! Even the teens wolfed it down!

Just made this for dinner - it's a big hit! Because of the reports of "blandness", I sprinkled the chicken with cumin and chili powder before sautéing. I did not have green pepper, but I did have diced jalapeños, so I added just a little for heat and flavor. This was so very easy! I will definitely make it again and again. Thank you for an easy, delicious and pretty healthy recipe.

I was totally skeptical of this dish when I started making it. I had no idea how pasta and salsa were meant to go together, BUT THEY ARE. This was surprisingly delicious! I used two peppers, one red and one green, and I think I used a little more salsa than called for, but those were the only changes I made to the recipe. I did find that I needed to simmer it just a little longer than called for (I let it go for about 15 minutes), but this could just be due to the size of the chunks of pepper and chicken I was cooking. And do not forget the cheese, it really makes the dish!! Can't wait to make this again!

So easy and yummy! I used more vegetables instead of just using corn alone. I also seasoned the chicken before I started to cook it.  Besides just using a green pepper I also added a red pepper. As a side dish I had a salad prepared and delicious vegetables such as more corn, green beans, kidney beans, peas and carrots. My family loved it!

This was great, I used precooked chicken & mexicorn. It was easier for me to throw everything in a casserole dish and put in the oven for 20 minutes or so. It was a great way to "hide" chicken. Husband loved it!

I used two red peppers instead of one green and a homemade salsa. I did not try this myself but I heard that my family liked it--NO leftovers. This rewarms well.

It was delicious. I added a can of tomato sauce to give it more sauce, and I used chicken I had pre-cooked, so I just had to heat it up. It was delicious!

I made it.  I made a few changes. I used our home canned corn and homemade salsa. then I added onions, mushrooms, and spinach from our garden.  I also added a few extra spices...garlic, oregano, and basil.  Can't wait to see what the family thinks of it tonight.

So disappointed. Almost everything I’ve made from All Recipes is great- this was blah. Even with extra spices, it was not good. I have a family of not very picky eaters, and nobody would eat this.

Didn't quite have the same things so here are my changes:  I soaked my chicken in Italian dressing for about an hour before cubing (no particular reason, just did). I chopped up a large green pepper and half a white onion (no corn).  Used 1 1/2c medium chunky Tostitos salsa and three string cheese sticks chopped up.  It was delicious!

I thought it was good but felt something was missing. The second time I made it I added 2 tablespoons of mustard and 2-3 tablespoon of brown sugar to the salsa and served over rice. That time it was delicious! I only gave four stars because I'm reviewing based on the original recipe.

Simple  & easy and lots of flavor!  Be careful to use mild or pour in some water to dilute the salsa  a bit cuz it very easily becomes very spicy!  It has become a normal week day meal for us!

I added in fresh cilantro, garlic powder and cumin to give it more of a "Mexican" feel and LOVED it! My husband did too and we will definitely make it again

Simple and easy one-dish meal. I added more green pepper, onion, and chipotle chili pepper for seasoning (next time, I'll put some garlic in, too). Used butter instead of cooking spray and it worked fine. Also kept pasta separate (for some gluten-free eaters) and just served the mix on top. Be forewarned: a very messy cleanup job! The cheese made plates and the skillet quite the chore to clean. Other than that, it's definitely a keeper!

LOVE this recipe!  Very easy, fast and versatile.  I had some cooked shredded chicken that I wanted to use so I generously  sprinkled some chili powder and cooked as suggested. Also used more salsa. Love that it was a stovetop recipe. I used red and orange peppers but that's where the versatility comes in. You can use any veggies, fresh or frozen.  But that salsa gives this dish an awesome taste!

Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I added garlic to the chicken mixture. I also added some creole seasoning to give it a bit of a kick. For veggies, I used a yellow pepper (no green on hand), corn and an onion. It's pretty good once you tweak it a bit to add flavor.

Made this last night and it was very good. My husband gave it 5 stars and I would too. I didn't have TAco Bell salsa so used another brand. Since he doesn't like corn ( weird right, lol) I left it out. Otherwise I made it as stated. For those who found it to bland I'd suggest using a medium or hot salsa.   This recipe is simple to make and we will definitely have it again.

Amazing, Delicious, Easy to Add to, QUICK -- I added Cayenne Pepper for my husband and I, kept some noodles and chicken plain for my 1 year old.  My husband actually cleared his plate for the first time in a while.  We will be having this again!

Made just as the recipe said and my family loved it!  I used frozen corn with peppers and onions, and PACE salsa, instead because that's what I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe thinking we'd need more, but it was way too much.  I guess we have some leftovers for lunch.  Would make again!
