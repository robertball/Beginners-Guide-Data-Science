This recipe is SOOO good. My husband nearly devoured the whole batch. The secret is to add a generous pinch of salt to the batter before frying.
Seriously, try this recipe; it's the best!

These are good!  You can use plain flour in stead of buttermilk mix.  I've made these three times now.

Excellent and easy!
My husband and I love these.  To make them healthier and full of more flavor we use "Hodgson Mills Whole Grain Insta-Bake Buttermilk Mix".  I was out of onion one day and added a handful of freshly grated Parmasan Cheese...yum!

really good. I added 1/2 cup grated marble cheese, and used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1tsp baking power instead of the buttermilk baking mix. lots of pepper and salt and then a small sprinkle of salt on top when done. (I pan fried mine in a little oil instead of deepfrying and they were still nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy inside!) very yummy!

I am giving this four stars because it really is a brilliant start. My problem is the same as others have stated...they are quite bland. Just made them and I am really pleased with how they puffed, the texture, color...however even with onion and garlic they really lack something. So, as I have pondered away, I am thinking of trying them again with grated Parmesan, possibly fresh cut corn, something to give it some more flavor...not certain what spices I would want to add to kick it up...don't want them hot as that is not to our liking....tho some might appreciate that. Some kind of dipping sauce, an Aoli of some kind might be nice.  For now I would definitely say try these, but keep in mind they are really bland as written, so use your imagination....

Big hit at potluck. I made them and immediately went to the party. Extremely easy to fry in a sauce pan. They stayed crispy for 2 hours. Tasted great at room temp too. Served with Chipotle Cream sauce:  Combine in a food processor:   3 cloves roasted garlic (wrap unpeeled cloves in foil, bake 20 minutes at 350)  1/2 cup sour cream,   2 T mayo,   1 T chopped canned chipotle peppers (add up to 2 T if you like heat)

I am totally impressed with these. They were tremendously fluffy and light, with a mild flavor.  I had to use up some rather too-large yellow squash, so I seeded and peeled them before grating. The baking mix I had wasn't 'buttermilk', it was the regular kind (a heart-healthy version, though).  I ended up just frying them in my regular deep fryer rather than using a pan, and they turned into fritters sort of like a hush puppy but without the cornmeal.  Of course they made far too many for my family, so we will end up baking them to reheat them and recrisp them tomorrow.  I used an ice cream disher to portion the batter. These did like hush puppies should, they turned themselves over when they were ready to flip. I would caution against overcooking, as they will get greasy if you leave them in the oil too long. I did mine for about 3 minutes at 350F, and that might have been a touch long, though they were still moist inside.  Hubby really loved these. My 5 year old daughter ate one and liked it.  Definitely going to use this one again, perhaps with some herbs next time to go with the garlic and onion. Cheese might be good too, but might make them greasier. I expect you could use egg whites instead of whole eggs to lighten them a little more.  Really a great, simple recipe. Thank you!

These are so easy and quick. They are also fairly flexible. I only had one egg the second time I made these, and they came out just fine. I have also used both plain flour and baking mix and it turns out great either way. Everyone enjoys these, too - my husband hovering as I cook them, waiting for them to be ready, to the 2 yr old, who refused everything else at dinner and ate only zucchini puffs. I can't wait until the zucchini in the garden is ready - I have been buying a lot of zucchini in order to make these. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was great for using yellow zucchini from our garden.  My fiance does not like zucchini, but he loved these.  While I was making them I opened my fridge for something and saw mushrooms, and had an idea, to coat the mushrooms in the batter then fry them.  They were YUMMY!  Then I did the same with broccoli and green beans, sort of like tempura.  Delicious!  So this recipe can work by itself for the puff or as a tempura type batter.  Thanks for posting it!  :)

Delicious.  I prepared these using a regular biscuit/pancake baking mix (not buttermilk).  I added about a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of pepper and a teaspoon of a no-salt all-purpose herb blend.  Still, they were a bit bland.  Perhaps the next time I prepare them I will add hot pepper sauce to the batter.  Still, these were really good.

I substituted onions with parmesean/romano cheese and used gluten free all purpose flour instead of the buttermilk baking mix and they came out great!

Very good! An excellent way to use up zucchini from your garden.  I squeezed the extra liquid out of the zucchini and added seasoned salt to the batter.  Everyone loved them!

I loved these, the texture was superb.  Based on other reviews I added 1/2 tsp. each of garlic and onion powders.  The recipe halved nicely, since I'm the only one here to eat them now, and they still turned out beautifully.  Puffy is the perfect description-you nailed it with their name, Anna B.  Thanks for sharing, I'll make these again and again!

Just made these and they are fabulous!  I've read some complaints of too bland, everyone's tastes are different and I don't think any recipe should get less stars for seasonings alone.  I put salt, pepper, dried onion flakes (cause I can't stand raw onion crunch and I was afraid they wouldn't get cooked enough), minced garlic, salt and pepper, just like the recipe calls for but to my own taste and they are delicious!!  My only complaint is that I only used one zucchini and one yellow squash and I still have a kitchen FULL of the stuff!!  LOL

These were awesome.  What a great way to use up all that shredded zucchini I freeze and then rarely use.  The kids loved them dipped in ranch dressing.

Wow, what a great recipe.  They were so delicious and light and fluffy. My 2 boys even liked them and they had no idea there was Zucchini in them.  I will definitely make them again.  I did however cook them a little longer being that I like them a little more crispy.  Excellent way to cook Zucchini and have my children and husband eat it:)

So I made four puffs as the recipe stated - frying them in hot oil - and they were yummy. They remind me of a hush puppy because they are more doughy more than zucchini-ish. Anyway,  I do not own a deep fryer, and in a hurry, I just threw some oil in my cast iron skillet and tried to "deep" fry them that way. I ended up with a LOT of hot oil splatter, so I gave up on the frying and then dumped the remaining batter, along with a little shredded asiago cheese, into a greased pie plate and threw it in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes. This made an interesting dish - not eggy enough to be a quiche, and not dense enough to be a scone or biscuit, but something in between. It, too, was pretty good. Four stars because the batter does lack a bit of seasoning - the salt at the end saves it - the cheese is definitely a nice addition. 
My preferred recipe for zucchini cakes or fritters is "Zucchini Patties" from this site. Little more zucchini, less flour...Also good made with corn and red pepper...

Excellent!  Our new favorite recipe for the oodles of zucchini we grow in the summer! These have great taste, and are even easier than potato pancakes to make.  I made them twice in one week they are so good!  I tried something similar with flour instead of the baking mix but they didn't taste nearly as good.  The baking mix complements the zucchini well, and browns the puffs just like a pancake.  I much prefer the baking mix over the flour.

These were ok, they could have used a bit more flavour as they were a little bland, but they fried up nicely (used a deep frier), next time I might throw in some italian seasoning and a few other spices which I think would make them very good.  I also didn't use a buttermilk baking mix, I just used a regular one which might be why there wasn't as much flavour as was supposed to be.

These were just ok.  Really really greasy.  I added a hot pepper and still found them to be a little bland.  I don't think I will be making them again.

Anna, thanks for such an excellent recipe.   Mom made these for us when we were little and she never really had a recipe to follow.   I tried yours and it is perfect.  We also add fresh grated parmesan cheese to the tops.  

I recommend this recipe.

I didn't love these. I had my hopes way up for a good idea to use up my over-abundant zucchini. It's something different, but these puffs have the potential to soak up a ton of oil (mine did). I cut one open when I thought it was well done and it was still gooey inside. You need to fry them until they are really dark so the inside gets cooked (see the pictures of how dark they look). They definitely need that extra sprinkle of salt when they come out of the fryer!!
I don't know if I'll be making them again. My husband liked them, but I think only because they were something different.

These were good. I used self rising flour instead of baking mix. They were a little bland the first time I made them, but my kids liked them dipped in ketchup. I added a little shredded sharp cheddar to the next batch I made, and that helped the flavor.

I tried this recipe at a family gathering and it was a major success! I added in a yellow squash and a lot more eggs because the mixture was really dry but they went great! In fact I've been dreaming of them and so will make them tomorrow!

WOW - these zucchini puffs were so DELICIOUS and very easy to make!!! I just purchased a new fondue set, so this was the perfect opportunity to try something new. I was actually surprised how many my husband ate because he doesn't like zucchini.

Some people mentioned the taste was too bland and it may be because they didn't use enough seasoning or perhaps the buttermilk baking mix took that flavor away. Instead of using buttermilk baking mix I used breadcrumbs.

These are scrumptious!  Reminded us of our favorite seafood restaurant at the beach.  A great way to use all of the abundant zucchini in the summer.  Did add a little more salt and pepper to the batter for a little more zip.  Doubled the recipe and ate them for two day!  My daughter even requested them for breakfast!

This is such a versatile recipe, I used summer squash, left out the onion and just used onion powder, and also added a cup of finely shredded cheddar cheese like a previous reviewer.  They turned out perfectly!  My husband didn't care for them, he said they had no flavor, but my mom and my 15 month old daughter both really liked them.  I would probably use this recipe again, just try to spice it up a bit.

these were good, but definitely needed 'something' which I am not sure what that is YET.  Also, if you are deep frying and the food is greasy
1.  Oil is not hot enough or 2.  you are putting in too many pieces and the the temp of the oil drops down to low.

Really enjoyed this. Had 2 large-ish zucchini squashed and thus probably closer to 3 cups or more. Added additional egg and followed previous advice to use same quantity flour and 1 tsp baking powder. Tossed in some basil for seasoning and touch of flaky sea salt on top before serving. Pan-fried and would definitely make again!

Yum! Found this looking for recipes to use up the garden zucchini. It's only me eating them, so I halved the batch. The only thing I did different was added a pinch of cayenne and used a big fresh garlic clove. Fried them in a little oil in my cast iron skillet. Yum! They didn't need any sauce, I thought they were good on their own!

GREAT Starter Recipe! But I knew it would be too bland for my bunch. Kept to the basic recipe but first of all, drained the shredded zucchini multiple times on paper towles 'til almost dry(which meant I had to start off with approx. 1/4 c. more 'pre-drained' to get the full amount AFTER draining). Then, doubled the onion, tripled the fresh garlic, added 1/2 c. of sharp cheddar,  1/2 c. grated parmesan, 3/4 t. yellow mustard, 1/8 t. liquid smoke. Mixed this all together. Then, separately, added approx. 1/4 t. dill weed,  1/2 t. freshly ground black pepper corns, 1/2 t. celery salt and 2 T. dry cultured buttermilk mix to the 1 1/2 c. baking mix. Blended this all well & added it to the zucchini mixture, then finally added the 2 beaten eggs to the whole thing to form the batter(believe it or not, was still a bit 'soupy', next time will add a bit more baking mix). Fried them all up a lg. melon ball scoop at a time in a sauce pan(to minimize splatter) with canola oil & voila! My son wants me to make the again for his 'x-mass pot-luck' at work, but we ALL liked them SO MUCH, I'll make 'em again just because their SO GOOD! 
This is a VERY forgiving recipe - have FUN, let your imagination go wild!

Amazing.  Followed recipe exactly except I added a big handful of finely grated Colby Jack.  Make these really, really small - like a level tablespoon.  If you make them big, they're still good but I really like the bitesize.  They puff up and are delicious.  I served with Ranch and Remoulade.

I added bacon, sharp cheddar, cotija, garlic powder and a whole diced  onion (we're onion people.) I had to add more baking mix and an extra egg to tighten up the consistency. I used fresh cracked pepper (made a huge difference) and sea salt. Next time I will add spinach and bell pepper to round the taste out a little better. We loved these and will be making these regularly! Thank you for this excellent recipe. It was a great base to start off with and got my creative juices flowing. Well done!

These are amazing! I steamed zucchini and squash with sliced onions and minced garlic, then mashed with a hand mixer and salt and pepper, then pretty much followed the recipe after that. Huge hit for the whole family!

These are very good! I was going to make another recipe and so I squeezed the excess water...but I made the mixture for THIS recipe and it seemed dry and so I added a little water. I did add Pecorino Romano cheese, but they were a little bland. Adding salt to the oil while frying made these better. My Husband really liked these! I will make these again, but maybe add more spices next time.

As others have said, this is a great starter recipe.  This was the first time I've made this recipe and dang it, I did what I hate the most…. made a  new recipe without having  all the ingredients.  Thankfully, this one is forgiving.  I used plain flour, but added about 1/2 tsp of salt to it.  I didn't have onion…. but I used fresh garlic. It's sounding like a completely different recipe… EXCEPT I did use zucchini.  So I've got that going for me.  I read comments about these little guys being a bit bland, so I added more salt to the batter, and added about a tablespoon of cojita cheese.  My fridge was bare, it was all I had.  I had my 13 year old whip up some zesty dipping sauce, and wow, these turned out pretty dang good.  Well, I thought they were delish.  My kids weren't all that impressed, but they ate a couple.  They love other veggies, just not crazy for zukes.  I'll make this again but I'll change it up and play with it for different results.

These sounded good, but after reading reviews, I made some modifications.  I did not have baking mix, so used 1-1/2 C flour with 1tsp baking powder.  Added 1/4 C of grated Parmesan and 2 tsp of Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning, in addition to the onion and garlic.  They turned out flavorful, but not spicy.  Next time I will add more Tony Chachere's and sprinkle Parmesan on top when they come out of the fryer.  Also, it did take me longer than 3 minutes to cook them.  More like 5-6 minutes at 375 degrees.  But they're a tasty twist for using zucchini, so will make them again.

I have to find a great dipping sauce too next time but just used marinara this time. I will be making this again! It was really good. :)

Tried this recipe and it was AWESOME! I used flour instead of buttermilk flour and 1 egg. They were less puffy but very yummy. I'm going to serve th m to my Mom to see what she thinks ;-)

I tried this recipe and we loved it. I used regular flour instead of buttermilk mix and it turned out fine. I tasted them after the first batch and thought they needed a bit more flavor, so I added a package of Hidden Valley Ranch, dry buttermilk ranch dressing mix. They were delicious.

Excellent starter recipe for any combo of vegetables. I used summer squash (yellow) and diced it fine along with 1/3 cup minced onion, and a very large garlic clove. I substituted salt and pepper with Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper. You can use any buttermilk pancake batter with this. It is a generous 6 servings. Everyone loved it.

I love garlic and onions, so I doubled the onions and actually used 6 gloves of garlic. Used WW flour (didn't have the buttermilk mix). Hubby and 14month old LOVED them. Great use of over-abundant zucchini. Thanks for sharing!

I shredded the zucchini and kept pressing it between paper towels, changing the towels as they became wet for about an hour. I used 1 tsp. garlic and onion powder instead of the real thing (cuz that's what I had on hand). The batter was thick so I added just enough milk to loosen it up - maybe 1/4 cup at most. Fried them in my deep fryer and they were FANTASTIC! I served them with pork ribs that I had barbequed. The puffs were nice and fluffy and had a savory flavor. What really surprised me was how good they were cold! I had 4 left over and wasn't sure what I was going to do with them so I left them in a covered basket. About an hour later, I wanted a little something to munch on - these were great! My husband and I ended up finishing them off. This is wonderful alternative to the usual recipes for zucchini - will be making again soon!

I wanted a new zucchini recipe and decided on this one. Sorry, just not as good as I had hoped. I added the cheese and extra salt. Still tasted too much like the baking mix, which is bland. 
I have a much better recipe using a shredded medium zucchini, potato, carrot and onion with only 3/4c flour. So much tastier.

Super tasty (used bisquick) and added salt to the finished product after fried. i like it and will make this simple 'zucchini pancake' again. however i gave it only 4 because it is unhealthy. i was able to make them but the last batch burned b/c they cook very very fast (faster on outside than in). definitely recommend u give this 1 a try. can be served with a variey of dpping sauces too.
