This was great - just made it tonight with leftover turkey.  My husband ate half of it all by himself!  I made some changes; I baked the tortillas by spraying them with Pam and putting them on a cookie sheet at 400 degrees for a couple minutes, just to crisp them a bit. I added more spice - it was way too bland, even with hot salsa.  I added 1 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand so I drained a can of chopped tomatoes and added that. YUM!

Not bad. Definitely needs more spice though. I added chili powder, cumin, jalapenos and garlic powder and it was still a little bland. A few squirts of Cholula helped tremendously.

Delicious and super-easy. In addition to the cheese on top, I put some over the first layer of ingredients before starting the second layer.

this really didn't work out the way i thought.  it came out really salty, with not enough of the other flavors.  i won't make this again.

Yumminess! I made my salsa fresh instead of using the jar salsa and it was great!

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.  I made it exactly as the directions said.  It was okay at best.  However, a friend tried it and really liked it.  I don't plan on making this again though.

If you like fresher tasting foods, sub out the Pace with fresh pico de gallo (I used store bought to save time). I also doubled the chicken and added strained, rinsed black beans. You could use any beans, but the Bush Grilling Black Fiesta beans are already flavored and have a nice spice.
