My Italian relatives didn't realize I'd taken a shortcut in making these.  I made 8 batches at Christmas and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

I got mixed reviews when I took this to work.  I enjoyed it and it went great with mocha.  Although the recipe called for 6 tbsp, I only put in about 3 tsp of anise extract.  Also, I didn't have anise so I used cumin seed instead.  It still came out great and had a very distinctive flavor.  I will make it again.

I made this last night it smelled the whole house of anise, it was wonderful. It is nothing like the biscotti I made before, it's too cake like, the flavor is good, I only used 2 tablespoons of the extract and only half the anise seeds. I would cook it again only if I could figure out how to make it more consitency of a true biscotti.

I experimented with these and my husband took them to work and he said they were gone in less than an hour! I used anisette liquor and half the almonds. I also made the initial cut in thirds and made more pieces. They were great!!

VERY VERY tasty but =delicate to cut to reposition on the baking sheet for the second bake.  Worth the trouble though.

We like this one but I did have to tweak. To accomodate my hubby's diet, I used a Pillsbury Sugar Free Yellow Cake mix I did not have anise extract so I used one tiny (.125 oz.) bottle LorAnne Licorice oil. I also added about a cup of almond meal to thicken & flavor the batter a bit. I used the amount rec. for anise seed and I am so glad I did. The flavor is perfect. The only problem I had was the second baking/toasting. The cut slices did not want to toast/dry in the time listed so I baked them for about 15 minutes....turned them over and baked about twenty minutes more. My hubby just loves them and they do have the consistency of a biscotti with the longer toasting time. I will definitely make these again and look forward to trying them with the sugar free chocolate cake mix. Thanks for sharing!

I agree with the other reviews that state this is too cakey. I think some additional flour would help. It has good flavor though. I  substituted vanilla extract for anise extract and omitted almonds.
I also toasted it much longer.
