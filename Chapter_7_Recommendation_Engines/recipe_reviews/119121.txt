Great little recipe to end our light weeknight meal.  This is so easy to throw together and worked out great tonight. It was so hot here today (100 degrees), so I didn't want to heat up the house. I just threw the crust in the oven this morning for 9 min and that was it for the oven for the day. After the crust cooled, topped it with the cherries and whipped cream/marshmallows and put it in the fridge until dinner. I did add a 1/2 teasp of vanilla to the cream before whipping.  Nice dessert that I would be happy to make again, maybe using different fruit flavor next time. Thanks for sharing!

Have made this recipe many times (doubled). Needs to sit overnight.  I do not put the pie filling on the bottom but rather a layer of marshmallow, all the pie filling and then another layer of marshmallow.   Always very popular and keep well.   Will also freeze.

I am going to make this with gluten-free graham crackers so my husband can enjoy it. My mom used to make this for him every year for his birthday. Great dessert!
