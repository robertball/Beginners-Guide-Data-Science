My favorite way to prepare garlic bread! So simple, so easy and so good. It's the only way for me. Raw garlic can be pungent and sharp so you can rub lightly or rub a lot depending on your taste. Bread needs to be toasted well in order for the garlic to 'rub off' onto the bread. I then like to drizzle the slices lightly with a quality  Olive Oil.
