Made only the crust (with pecans rather than walnuts) and, after baking the crust as directed,  topped with a traditional brownie mix.  My  Sunday school kids loved these "Butter Crust Brownies!"  Used real butter for the crust and the aroma while the crust was baking was heavenly.  I made a triple batch of the crust and pressed it into a pan that is larger than the usual 9 x 13.  It's what I call a lasagne pan.  The resulting crust was a nice foundation for a classic brownie.  A little crunchy and a lot buttery!  The perfect counterpoint to the Duncan Hines Chewy Fudge brownie mix.  Needed something totally different to jazz up a brownie mix and just knew this addition would be a hit!    A huge merci beaucoups to the person who developed/submitted the walnut bar recipe.  He/she inspired me!  God's blessings to all of you,  Frenchie in the Beautiful Bluegrass

Don't make these if you would rather not eat the whole pan at once, because you won't be able to stop yourself!  They are SO GOOD!!!!!  Don't worry if the batter doesn't mix perfectly (I had a lot of little bits of butter that wouldn't mix in).  They will turn out very tasty anyways!

I was skeptical while I was making these. The chocolate batter was runny and I didn't think it had set up well. Once they cooled a bit I stuck them in the fridge and I pressed a slivered almond on the top of each bar. They are quite small but so rich and delicious you wouldn't want them any bigger. Great flavor and so easy to make. This one a keeper!

IMO, just an average bar.  The chocolate part was very, very thin and runny before baking. Also watch the crust while baking, at 20 minutes mine was slightly overcooked. I didn't cut until the next morning (and it was difficult to cut) because the crust was hard, even after sitting for 15 minutes. I don't think I will make this one again.

This was a really tasty and easy recipe. The walnut crust was delicious and not too sweet.  The chocolate was soft and rich.  The combination worked out really well.

This was incredibly easy to make although I needed about 25-30 minutes in the oven for the chocolate to set fully.  They are delicious straight from the fridge and VERY chocolatey!!!.  I will definitely make them again.

Hmmm, the topping is brownie-esque, the crust is great. i was hoping for more of a smooth, less cakey topping but nonetheless it is good. Instead of the powdered sugar I topped it with more chopped walnuts. Only gets 4 stars because it is not quite what I was hoping for.

These are fabulous - like an English Toffee bar.  I used Pecans instead of walnuts and substituted 1/4 cup wheat flour for the white. Yummy right from the oven.

The crust was really good, but I expected much more chocolate. I would double the chocolate part in the same sized pan. The chocolate part was a little too moist (maybe because the last egg I cracked, two yolks fell out!), but I suggest maybe a little flour in there to make it more of a brownie consistency.

I did not care for this recipe.
these were not brownies at all.
i should have known better: cocoa powder & water does not make fudgy chocolaty brownies.
i followed the recipe to a T & i ended up w/ 1/8 inch thick butter nut thingamajigs

These were way too good.  We ate them way too fast.  When warm, the top tastes like lava cake filling.  The crust is awesome.  Both my husband and I loved these, and they were fast and easy to make and I already had all the ingredients on hand.  I only dare make this again if I need to bring a dessert to something as it was just too tempting to have around.

Easy to make, but too bland. I was expecting a more chocolatey flavor. Would not make again.

My rating and review is based purely on the merits of the recipe. Nothing extraordinary with the crust, its a simple butter crust with walnuts. The filling resembles a badly proportioned brownie recipe. It lacks a chocolatey flavor and is generally bland and lifeless. I did not want to waste what I baked so we had it with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, but even then, my friends just ate the ice cream and just a bite of the bar. This is definitely an over-rated recipe!

Not what I expected, but not a disappointment.  Not too much chocolate.  Very easy bar recipe to follow.  I would try another "bar" recipe, if it was as easy to follow as this one.

This is a great dessert for people who like really rich chocolate. I for one do so I loved it. Instead of putting the sugar on top I wonder what crushed walnuts would do for it. Also walnuts mixed in the chocolate? Something to think about...... I did not rate this 5 out of 5 because the first time I made it, the bars were hard to get out of the pan in one piece. Trying again today....

This is a really good recipe! The chocolate batter is VERY runny before baked, and I was concerned that it would end up an unsatisfactory or runny topping, but it turned out fine. The topping is more of a soft, almost frosting like topping than a hard or firm brownie like topping and works very well with the crunchy crust. I'd recommend dusting with flour instead of powdered sugar as you don't want it to be too sweet, and the soft chocolate top makes it easy to stick in a whole walnut or two as a fun and tasty garnish.

Simple, rich and delicious! I have made this twice now and everyone who has tried it loves it. You cannot expect it to be something it is not; but it sure is EVERYTHING it's supposed to be.

Oh my, so good!  I followed the recipe as written with one exception; I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top right out of the oven.  The crust was very tender (20 minutes provided a slightly browned crust) and the chocolate on top was just gooey enough.  I had no trouble cutting them at room temp with a buttered knife.  Excellent!

I really liked the crust - the chocolate part was a little odd, but I will probably make again.  I used 1/4 c sugar in the crust and 1/4 c in the topping.
