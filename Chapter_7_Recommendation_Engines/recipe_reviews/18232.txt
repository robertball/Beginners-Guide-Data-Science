I'm a cajun gal myself with my roots in Louisiana and the gulf coast of Texas, and this recipe is nothing close to my family's recipe for etouffe, which requires making a roux and cooking it dark, to start  I have also never seen tomato of any kind go into etoufee.

Very disappointing.  I knew it would be when I saw there was no roux and no seasoning...how can this be considered a "true cajun recipe"??????  I will quit looking for a cajun shortcut and stick with what I know to be good.

I have used this recipe a zillion times and it's always a hit.  A few changes I made are:I throw in a generous dash of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and another dash of cayenne pepper (to taste-I like it spicy)AND about ten minutes before it's done I use about a 1/4 to 1/2 of Heavy Whipping Cream stirred in to make it VERY rich!! I also usually double the recipe with success.

Having lived in Louisiana my whole life I can tell you that this IS an authentic cajun crawfish etoufee recipe!  The other reviewers I see that talk about using a roux MUST be talking about crawfish stew because I have made etouffee hundreds of times and have NEVER used a roux.  BUT when I make crawfish stew I always use a good medium to med.-dark roux.  If you find the recipe bland then just add some powdered crawfish boil seasoning or Tony Chachere's seasoning to the gravy.

This recipe is exceptional!  Local Cajun Restaurant's ettouffe was thought to be the best but this is equal to or better than.  If you want it spicier add a little cayenne or cajun seasoning.  We loved it!!!

So darn good! I have to admit that I used shrimp instead, as I can't get crawfish in Salem at present. It's still EXCELLENT. My son loved it, too.

Being from the New Orleans area, I find the basic part of this recipe to be good.  I don't use as much oil and a little more butter, and I add lots of cajun seasoning and a good bit of fresh garlic when I am sauting the vegs.  I also double the recipe, and sometimes add much more of everything than suggested and it all cooks down fine.  Many people say that tomatoes or the paste don't belong in the etouffe (it is more of a creole dish with the red sauce), but I always get phenomenal reviews when I make it.  Then again, that's what cajun dishes are all about--just cooking all your stuff down with spice, and ya get what ya get!

I only cook about twice a year, but I made this for my fiance for Valentine's Day and she was thoroughly impressed.  How much of this was due to the sole fact that I cooked, I'm not sure, but I did enjoy this dish very very much.  

Added smoked sausage, mushrooms, jalapenos, cayenne, and used a garlic alfredo sauce instead of tomato paste.  Gave it a little spice kick and served over rice.  Thanks for the recipe!  I may just start cooking every week now ;)

Not all, but most of the crawfish etouffee I've seen and tasted whether in a cajun restaurant or made by my relatives born and raised in Southern Louisiana is an orangy color, which is based on tomato paste. The dark roux we use is typically for gumbo or rice and gravy. To those reading reviews...try the recipe for yourself. It is still authentic though the recipe varies in flavor/ingredients depending on region and personal preference.

This was great!  I spent like 5 hours catching, cooking, and cleaning the crawfish, but it was so worth it!  A great summer day event, next time I'll make people help me catch them if they wanna eat!

Bland, I agree with the comments about there not being a roux.  I tried it because of gluten issues.  But just not the same.  :-(  I also added a ton of tobasco and cajun seasoning

This was my first time making etouffee and it turned out delicious! It was easy to prepare and quick. I used shrimps instead of crawfish because it was hard to find any crawfish and my two years old daughter loves it.

This is as good as it gets. I made this for my father who loves etoufee, and there were no left-overs. Even my husband who hates frozen crawfish liked it. Easy to make too.

This was definetly good, but I may wait awhile before I make it again. The eazy factor, does make it a good choice..but I am going to scout around a bit more for the perfect recipe.

Excellent recipe!  The only reason I gave 4 stars was due to the time to steam and then peel  the crawfish.  Next time I'll try them frozen or perhaps use a few lobster tails instead.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and I plan to prepare it again tonight.  I too am from Louisiana, and unfortunately there is not a good etouffee recipe in my family.  Well, now there is!

Don't be alarmed at the amount of onion.  When preparing this dish, I was sure that there was a typo.  Onions were practically overflowing from my pan, but it all cooks down nicely, and the flavor is NOT overwhelming.  In fact, it is perfect!  I don't have any plans to try other etouffee recipes!  I did however add some minced garlic and red pepper flakes.

Bland, but has potential. I will try again and add cayenne and more cajun seasoning.   This is worth a re-do because of my gluten allergy, I really miss Etouffee.

This was rather "bland".  I had to add some seasoning to it before I could serve it.  It was also missing the true roux flavor because that step was missing.  It was more like fast food than true Cajun food but good for those cooks in a hurry!

good recipe... 2 fresh tomatoes instead of canned paste is more authentic... I subsituted canned chicken broth for shrimp broth (made from shrimp bouillon or boiled shrimp shells).  There should also be a roux base in true etouffee made with flour and oil in lieu of cornstarch dissolved in water.  Good fast shortcut to the real thing!

I wouldn't know about the authenticity of this recipe, but I do know it would have been remarkably bland if I had not added dried red chili pepper and Tabasco to it.

I tried this recipe because I did not feel like making the Roux I normally make for my Étouffée. If you want to taste the true Cajun taste of it you have to make it with the roux. I was pretty disappointed, but if u are not familiar with the taste of real Étouffée this recipe will work just fine for you.

This was a really easy and really good recipe, but it definitely needed some kind of spice. Next time, I'll have to add some pepper or something to make it a little less bland. The family liked it, though!

I added quite a bit of Old Bay & Cayenne Seasoning and served it on a bed of white rice.  I will definately make this again soon.

I made this the other night and both my husband and I thought it was very good!  My 2-yr-old even liked it and asked me what it was.  I used both crawfish and shrimp, added 3 cloves of garlic, and added about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (could have used more though).   I seasoned the crawfish and shrimp with some Old Bay seasoning beforehand as well.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was not complicated at all. I added smoked sausage and chicken with a little extra broth. Everyone loved it, and they all asked for seconds. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have lived in Louisiana for most of my life and have made several variations of crawfish etouffee. This is absolutely the best recipe of this traditional cajun favorite!!  I use ONLY Louisiana crawfish tail meat with the fat and season them to taste with Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning prior to adding to the sautee'd "trinity." I usually need to add a little more salt, but ONLY after tasting the simmering gravy.  I like my gravy thicker than this, so I double the cornstarch this calls for, mixing it in gradually until the desired consistency is reached. This recipe is my new "go to" basis for crawfish etouffee. Go for it and make it your own!

This was fantastic!  I used shrimp as well, added extra tomato paste and quite a bit of Old Bay and cayenne.  It was pretty rich so I couldn't eat as much as I would have liked to.  I'll probably cut the butter in half next time and add some more spice.

Excellent, this is what étouffée is supposed to be.  No mushroom or celery soups, just basic trinity and a thickened broth.  I added a little spice at the table.

This is a pretty good recipe, except for the spiciness. We like a little kick to our etouffee, so I added 2 tblsp of Louisiana Crawfish Boil spice (heaping) to the recipe. I doubled the crawfish and skipped the chicken broth and cornstarch in lieu of just some water to thin out the sauce to the consistency I wanted. It was an absolute hit at the crawfish boil - it was gone before all the mud bugs!

This recipe has mixed reviews for two reasons-1 lacks seasoning and 2 the roux/tomato controversy. Since I come from Louisiana and a long line of cooks,  I have eaten etoufee with a roux, with tomato paste, with a roux and tomato paste; however, the best way to may etoufee is without either. If you do not have your own crawfish to peel, though, you will not have any color. It is the fat from the crawfish that makes it have color and gives it a wonderful, and I mean wonderful, flavor. So add the crawfish fat, a pinch of chili pepper (or cayenne) then re-evaluate. This is a fabulous recipe, but the crawfish fat is a must. Suzemae from Louisiana know best!

I'm cajun, Italian,  Irish and German. and was born in New Orleans. In the 80's I went to a fried chicken place in Biloxi. Think is was Cajun's fried chicken but may be wrong. They did a chicken  etouffee that had a translucent sauce. So no roux. It was great. Don't be afraid to learn something  because you think you know better. OH,  my favorite etouffee. Crawfish Etouffee over a ribeye.

I made this dish for me and my wife. I am from Louisiana as well...I think it's delicious! I did add Tony's, salt, and garlic to it. I'm also a beginner cook. If you could add where to say when to turn the heat up or down would be helpful.

Used shrimp instead of crawfish.  Didn't have celery so I used celery seed.   Doubled the recipe and family loved it!

Very good.  Even better with a little cayenne pepper.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.
