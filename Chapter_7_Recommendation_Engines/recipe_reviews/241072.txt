Excellent lite salad! I had some left over quinoa and wanted to use it up. This salad was perfect!! Except for the addition of the sunflower seeds because I did not have them I assembled this recipe as written from step 2.  The fresh parsley is key! The dressing is very lite, the lemon adds a nice flavor. Next time I am going to add some lemon zest to bump up the flavor a bit more. Definitely will make again!

No changes...made it as instructed except with tri-color grains Quinoa.  My 15 year old daughter, who likes olives and veggies,  dug into it and said  " UMMMMM can I take some to school tomorrow?" I made it in the dead of Winter and will be making this all year long!

Followed the recipe exactly, except I used Greek olives instead of canned black olives.  Served the salad stuffed in tomatoes.  Delicious!
