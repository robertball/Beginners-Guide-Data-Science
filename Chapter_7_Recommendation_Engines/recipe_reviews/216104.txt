This is a very flavorful soup but rather than six cups of beef broth try six cups water with two tablespoons of ham base. There are several delicious varieties sold in jars.

We no longer eat pork and my wife loves pea soup being a French Canadian. So, I smoked turkey hind quarters in our baraque smoker. I also used my own turkey broth I made from our last roast turkey. She just loved it and so did I, and I don't care for pea soup, but this one was too good not to eat. I didn't put in all the chilli flakes as my little French girl dosn't like things to hot, but the soup was sooooo, good.I served it with a Johnny Cake I made, and now I have a happy wife. I would not change anything except less chilli peppers. Thank you for the great recipe WileyP

Sooo good!!! I gave some away to three different people, and my phone wouldn't stop ringing. They wanted to know when I would make it again. This will be the recipe for split pea soup that I will make over and over again. Thank you!!

Delicious! I cooked everything in the crockpot on low for 8 hours and I turned out great.

This is a really good and easy recipe. In my opinion, there is no need to add salt since there's plenty in the beef broth and soy sauce.  I left it out. Also, I didn't have sage and I don't miss it.

Way too spicy for what I was expecting, which was a traditional pea soup recipe. Without the sour cream it was almost inedible. Also, the author failed to mention that the split peas should soak, or be slow cooked overnight. I started soaking them at 6:30 AM and then slow cooking at 12:30 PM and they were still not soft enough by dinner at 6:30 PM!!! Disappointing to say the least.

Just made this recipe as I had left over smoked turkey and some ham in the freezer.  The spiciness will be perfect for today's Superbowl - similar to a chili in it's spiciness.  I didn't add the potatoes as I wanted it to be lighter.  And, I don't like my split peas pureed so I didn't do that part. I am very happy with the results and so is my hubby!  Can't wait for half-time for my next bowl!  :-)

One delicious! One thing I would add to the directions, make sure to watch this as it simmers. I accidentally let the water level drop too much by not ckecking for 30 minutes. But, it didn't burn, I caught it in time.
