Very easy to make and a nice taste.  The southern comfort was only slightly detected and despite other comments I don't see why a child couldn't have a small portion.

All I can say is, "YUM!" The second time I made it, I cut down the butter by 1 Tblsp and cut the Southern Comfort in 1/2 and it was better for my taste.  If you love sweet potatoes, you have to try this!

These were simple to prepare and true to the submitters word was more like a dessert!  The southern comfort blended in nicely.  Thanks for sharing

These were delicious and simple!  I did not use the Southern Comfort or pecans.  I will definitely make this again and again.

A little late with this review, but better then never.  Made these potatoes for Thanksgiving.  Really didn't like them very much.  I may have liked them more with a little less southern comfort.  It just tasted like soupy alcohol to me..

My family loooooves this recipe and I made it for a office party.  Co-workers were expecting to be lit afterwards but that's okay!!  It was a hit.  This year I will be cutting back on the liquor.  I'll half it.

This turned out well; although, mashed consistency was a bit "weird" for me... I added about1/2 cup sugar, and it was REALLY sweet! Overall, pretty good.

I love sweet potatoes and it's hard to find recipes out there that are not super sweet and still delicious! This is now a favourite at my in-laws! (Whom I found sneaking shots of the leftover Southern Comfort last Thanksgiving!) By the end of the day, I'm delighted because I never have left overs of the dish or the Southernn Comfort and everyone is super happy!

I have made other sweet potato casseroles before and this one is not all that great.  The Southern Comfort did not make as much of an impact as I thought. Contrary to other reviews, they are not too sweet. I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the filling and my husband still thought they could have been sweeter.  I won't make these again.  By the way, alcohol evaporates during cooking, leaving only the flavor behind.  So it's okay to feed this dish to kids.

I really liked this dish. It was very easy to prepare. I used it for an office Thanksgiving Potluck, and the typical response was that it had an "interesting" flavor. The 1/2 cup of Southern Comfort might be too much for some people, but it still tastes great.

GREAT I'm giving it 5 stars cause if you don't use quite as much liqour, it's not so thin and it's a great tasting dish that everyone will love, and most won't know have alcohol in it...course I say all this when I use 101 proff!

I was asked to bring something to our Thanksgiving dinner.  I had never made yams before so I decided I'd take a shot at it.  It turned out to be a hit.  My mother in law loved them.  She said that in the past, she's tried other's yams and they were too sweet.  She said mine were PERFECT.

I have been making this recipe for more than 20 years. It is outstanding, but I use the original recipe. DO NOT USE three eggs! I am not sure why the person who added the recipe to this site tripled the eggs. The orginal recipe calls for one egg and that is all you need!!! Plus, I attribute my excellet results to the fact that I always use fresh sweet potatoes. I guess canned sweet potatoes might be okay, but using canned potatoes would probably make the consistency way too mushy. Another thing to keep in mind is that Southern Comfort comes in 100 proof (black label) and 70 proof (red label). I prefer the 100 proof to impart the best flavor. The alcohol, of course, evaporates during baking so all you are left with is the flavor of the liquor

I used canned yams and cooked them in the crock pot.  Got very mushy.  I used a pecan flavored whiskey.  I think it would be better baked in the oven.

Whatever you do, do not alter the ingredients other than using fresh sweet potatoes (4 lbs) instead of canned. The recipe is perfect! I have been making it for at least 30 years and always use fresh sweet potatoes (peel, cut up the sweet potatoes, cook and mash when they are done.) Remember Southern Comfort comes in 100 proof and 70 proof. I recommend using 100 proof for the best taste. The alcohol evaporates in the baking process and you are left with a lovely taste. Absolutely scrumptious!
