This recipe is really good - I don't normally use shortening, so I substituted butter and it came out great.

Unusual mix!  Added a tsp of banana extract for an extra boost of flavor and coated the chocolate chips with flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the pan.  Have made it for numerous camping and 4 wheeling trips for a group of hungry men.  All gave me the thumbs up!!!

I hate when my family goes out and buys storebought mixes for banana bread. It's disgusting. However, with this recipe, I think I have stopped them for good. I substitute butter for shortening, use half white sugar and half brown, halve the chocolate chips, nix the walnuts, and add one teaspoon of vanilla extract. I was skeptical at first, but the mayonnaise makes all of the difference! Next time I'll try cutting back on the fat and use apple sauce to replace some of the butter. Can it get any better?

Amazing banana bread! I have been making banana bread for 12 years and have never had a bread turn out as moist as this one.  I work for an extremely established restaurant and brought it in for staff meal, people were blown away.  I did use butter instead of shortening though...I don't trust shortening.

Thank you Betty for sharing this recipe.  My husband asks for it repeatedly.  Although it is great as is I have found that it is a very forgiving recipe. You can substitute butter for shortening, you don't have to have enough bananas and you can vary the amount of walnuts and chocolate chips to suit your taste.  I bake it in a bundt pan because I think it presents well that way.  You can dust the pan with cinamon sugar or cocoa if you wish to keep the bread from sticking.

Oh my gosh!  YUM YUM YUM!!  This reminds me so much of the banana bread my grandma used to make.  So moist!  I followed a few other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening.  I also made this recipe in mini loaf pans and wrapped each one individually.  My kids loved grabbing a mini loaf for a treat.  Also, with making them as a mini loaves, I didn't have to slice it - which help me avoid the problem of some reviewers: that it was so moist it was hard to slice.  With a mini loaf, you just eat it like a muffin! :)  No slicing required!  Just do what my kids did, stuff the whole thing in your mouth! :)

All I have to say is WOW. 

I halved the recipe because I only had three bananas. Two of them were really on their last leg and I was hesitant to use them but maybe thats why these have such an amazing banana flavor! 

Upon suggestion of others, I used butter instead of shortening. I also dusted my chocolate chips with a tiny dash of flour and the trick worked cuz they didn't sink! Otherwise I made exactly as shown. 

I made exactly 12 muffins and filled the muffin tins almost to the top. They did not overflow. I baked 350 F for 20 minutes. Good thing I checked on them. They looked really done on the top but the toothpick came up dry. They were nice and crunchy on the top but so delicious and moist in the middle. 

This is definitely one of my favorites. I will make this again and again.

Great recipe.  I made a couple healthy modifications:  Instead of shortening, I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c unsweetiened applesauce; used 1/2 white and 1/2 golden brown sugar; substituted lite mayo; used white whole wheat flour; added 2 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Took it to work and it was gone within an hour!  Very moist and still tastes decadent.

I put too many chocolate chips in, so it was SUPER chocolatey. Other than that was really moist and really good. Definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. Moist and flavorful bread. I used butter instead of shortening, but only half the amount. I doubled the bananas (I had a bunch to use up anyway) to add moistness since I cut the fat, used all brown sugar and added vanilla. I remembered the mayo in one batch and forgot it in the other. The one without came out pleny moist. The batch with the mayo was good but almost too moist. I think I'll stick with the extra bananas and skip the mayo. I made muffins instead of loaves so my kids could grab and go. I love this recipe and will be making it often.

This is good, but I'm not sure it is better than the others I've made that didn't have the mayonnaise or shortening in it.  But definitely good.

I'm a huge fan of my KitchenAid so I tried it out with this recipe. I just threw in all the ingredients in the order the were listed and let it mix as I went. Also, I keep bananas in the freezer once they get too brown to eat so I tossed 6 of them in the bowl to thaw along with a stick of butter to soften. I had to dump out a little liquid, which comes off the frozen bananas, but I went from there. The bread turned out FABULOUS! We ate it almost every night for dessert (the chocolate makes is seems so much like cake). I definitely think the mayonaise is the "secret" ingredient. I also used another cooks suggestion and added 1/2 C of sour cream in place of 1/2 of the butter. TERRIFIC!

FABULOUS, delicious, wonderful, VERY very moist, LOVE IT !!!
You absolutely must try this, but here are just a couple changes I made.
Instead of shortening, I used 2 sticks of Blue Bonnet light.
I used 2 Tablespoons of Mir.Whip & it was fine.
Right before adding the flour mixture,
I mixed in 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons of banana extract !
I added just a little extra walnuts and it was perfect.
The banana extract just really helped to top it all off I think.
I also used some of the batter to make muffins.
My kids both love this, and we can't stop eating it !!!

This is one awesome recipe.. My family raves about it.. My mum has started buying more bananas than we could eat up before it gets overripe coz she knows if it goes beyond ripe it's gonna be used for Banana bread that she loves instead of going waste. My aunts have requested this several times over... Try it.. U won't regret!! & I don't change anything about it except subbing butter for the shortening just because I don't use shortening..

This seriously is a really delicious recipe! I used butter instead of shortening just like the majority of the other reviewers and actually only had four really ripened bananas. It was actually perfect. I always use Ghirardelli semisweet chips for baking and wasn't overpowering at all. It was all a perfect balance and seriously the best banana chocolate bread ever, and trust me, I've had my share of banana chocolate walnut breads in my life. I wouldn't even know how to make this recipe any better

AMAZING!! at first my family and I thought it was a little too chocolaty but after we let it sit out overnight the chocolate chips weren't so gooey and the bread was incredible! I also subbed some Greek yogurt in instead of the mayo and it tasted great! I also baked some of the batter in a cupcake pan for 25 minutes and they were good but not as moist and delicious as the bread. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made only 1/2 the recipe, and used 6 king muffins instead of a loaf pan. Substituted the shortening with butter. Followed the recipe but I added the walnut on top on the muffins just before baking them for 45 minutes. It was amazing! The muffins were very moist and the walnuts were slightly crunchy. This is a must-keep recipe.

Delicious!!!  The absolute best banana bread I have ever made.  My 18 yo son agrees.  I always freeze my ripe bananas.  When thawed they mash so easily.  Also, I instead of loaf pan I baked mine in muffin tins (makes 2 dozen plus) at 350 for 25-30 minutes.   Yum Yum.

Amazing! Took the advice of others and changed the shortening to butter. Added a little vanilla and cinnamon. Not a lot. My new favorite banana bread recipe. I never would have thought to put chocolate chips or mayo. My husband even wrinkled his nose at both but LOVED it! YUMMMMMY!

The only change I made was making this into muffins instead of bread.  I just filled muffin cups 3/4 full and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  They were delicious and my kids love them.

I really only used this as a base because I really wanted to try the prune for fat substitution. So instead of shortenting I used prune puree and it turned out AMAZING. Best chocolate banana bread I have ever had.

This chocolate chip banana bread is downright delicious.
I made it exactly as the recipe said--although I hesitated on using the shortening...
It was a great success! The bread was very, very moist (...probably from all the shortening, haha). Everyone loved it.

Wow....this was so good....my family and I loved it. Halved the recipe, used butter instead of shortening,  low fat mayo and mini chocolate chips. Wonderful and very moist on the inside with a nice crust on the outside.  A perfect bread. Never used mayo in baked goods before and you would never know except it adds to the moistness. Thanks!

I've made a lot of banana bread, but nothing ever tasted this good. This bread is so good it's sick. I made the mistake of halving the ingredients and just making one loaf. That was not even 24 hours ago and the loaf is almost completely gone. Next time I'll definitely make the two loaves. Other than being an idiot and making only one loaf, I followed the recipe as is, except substituted butter for the shortening, as others suggested. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!

Delish...used half brown sugar half white just a personal preference thing but I'm sure it's just as yum no matter what sugar you used.

This is the same way I make my banana bread except I add vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg (weird to not have them in there) and butter instead of shortning and I'm really wondering if the mayo is nessisary. I would have to say I love the addition of the cocolate chips and nice hint on dusting them with flour so they don't sink to the bottom. Thanks!

I halved the recipe and substituted butter for the shortening.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  This banana bread has GREAT flavor!  My husband loves it.  At 50 minutes, a toothpick inserted into the bread came out clean.  However, next time I make this, I will keep the bread in the oven much longer.... at least 60 minutes!  The bread kind of caved in after sitting for 20 minutes in the pan... and we had difficulty getting the bread out of the pan without the bread crumbling.  It was a bit of a mess... but a tasty mess, and we will definitely make again with slight modifications.

Love this!  I substitute butter for shortening, leave out the mayo, and add an extra banana.  I cut the recipe in half making just one loaf each time.  I also omit the nuts only  b/c my company doesn't like them, but I'm sure it'd be great with. Sometimes I omit the chocolate chips- just depends if I want chocolate that day. Both ways are great! This bread turns out so moist and flavorful! My qualm was figuring out how to get it done in the middle without overdoing the outside... I've decided 70min at 325 works for me!

Great taste but 350 degrees cooked the outside of the bread too fast and after 50 minutes the inside was still raw. Next time I will cook at 300 degrees for a longer period to prevent the outside from burning.

Wonderful banana chocolate chip bread recipe! I used all butter and added one extra banana just because I didn't want to be left with just one straggler.  I baked mine in 3 x 5 pans so I ended up with 7 pans.  I only had one that didn't want to come out of the pan.  Overall it's a great recipe! Thank you!

Very good.  Next time I will use 3/4c chips and toss them in flour so they do not sink to the bottom.  I omitted the nuts and baked the loaf for 55 minutes.

This was seriously the best banana bread I've ever made. So easy, but so tasty. I, like other reviewers, subbed in butter instead of shortening, but otherwise stuck true to the original recipe. My other downside, and this was my fault, was I overfilled the loaf pans. This bread rose a lot in the oven so be careful how much batter you put it in the pans. But the underbaked middle is still super tasty to eat ;)

This comes out really good for those that like chocolate chips added to Banana Bread. It is moist and keeps for weeks in the fridge too. I grease and then dust the pan with cocoa instead of flour and it comes out with an added zing to the loaf. Yummy

I made this bread so many times, and always received great reviews.  I had to cook it a bit longer a few times, but only because the oven I was using was not consistent.  Amazing bread!

This was some delicious bread. I only had 4 bananas and wish I had two more, but it worked. I used a bundt pan for about 70 minutes - part of it crumbled when I flipped it over to cool, so I probably should have waited a little more before I turned it over. I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the mix and left out he walnuts. After spraying the pan, I mixed about a tsp of sugar with some vanilla and shook it around in the pan to create a light, sugary outing. I took a reviewers' advice to lightly coat the chocolate chips with flour to make them from sinking to the bottom. Overall, very yummy bread.

My family loves this banana bread.  I make a few substitutions: 1 c. brown for white sugar, 1 c. ground oatmeal for 1 c. flour, 1/2 c. butter for shortening, no nuts so increase chocolate chips and usually use part chocolate chunks and part mini chips, add 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

Very good recipe! I made one loaf and only had two bananas, so I substituted with a bit of applesauce (unsweetened). Turned out really well!

This really is the moistest banana bread ever! I'm not giving the recipe 5 stars for two reasons: 1) The shortening. I did what almost every other reviewer did and sub'd butter. 2) There's no "seasoning" per se. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. The result was wonderful. I will be using this recipe from now on. Next time I might take another reviewer's suggestion and make mini loaves or muffins because it is a little difficult to cut.

It must just be me based on all the reviews but I didn't like the chocolate chips in this one. The bread itself was wonderful and moist and I will make it again, however without the chip this time. Thanks for posting!

YUMMY!  Made it exactly as printed except for using white chocolate chips instead of reg and pecans instead of walnuts.  Not a conscious decision to change the recipe, just wwhat I had on hand in the cupboard.  Loved by everyone in the family from the picky 2 year-olds to the teenagers who eat anything not tied down to the hubby who is usually not a sweet bread person.

I'm seriously considering breaking into my neighbor's house.  The reason--I gave them the second loaf of this bread.  Forget what you learned on Sesame Street. This is too yummy to share. Except for the addition of 1 t. of vanilla, I followed the recipe exactly.  Two thumbs up!

I made this as a thank you gift for someone, so I didn't taste it myself.  However, he reported that it was very good, so I feel confident giving it a 5-star rating.  The loaf seemed to be very moist, I tasted a crumb chunk that was left in the pan after I inverted it and it did taste good.  Now I will have to make a loaf for us.

My family LOVED this! It is so moist and the banana flavor is perfect. Like others, I substituted butter for shortening. The only other thing I changed was to use pecans instead of walnuts and to sprinkle bottom of the pan and top of the batter with cinnamon and sugar before baking. Tip-always toss chocolate chips and nuts with a little flour to prevent them for falling to the bottom. This is a knock-out recipe!

Sooooo good!!! Laminating this recipe! I added a little extra flour to thicken it up as someone else suggested.  I also sprayed the inside of the pan then coated with sugar as someone else suggested and it added a great crunchy little crust to the outside. Yum!

Oh my! I have made about a billion different banana bread recipes, and I can say that this is definitely my new favorite. I used half brown and half white sugar, half margarine and half applesauce, fat free mayo, and only five bananas.  Sooo good!

This bread is amazing! I also used butter instead of shortening without a problem - was low on white sugar as well so swapped in some dark brown. It's delicious!

I made these into mini-muffins. The amount of batter was just right for 48 large mini-muffins. I used the other reviewers' advice: creamed 2 sticks of room-temp butter with 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar; added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Left out the nuts, since I worry about allergies. I baked them for 17 minutes at 350 and they came out perfectly. You can't taste the mayonnaise; they're amazingly moist and rich and banana-y. My co-workers were raving about them! One of them called me "Betty Crocker" and another said I could have a whole other career as a baker. Thanks for the recipe!

My hubby absolutly LOVED this bread!  I'm jelous!  Not really, after 25 years of marraige I'm pretty secure in our love. Did make some healthier changes.  I used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of the shortening. One cup of brown sugar and one of white.  Two cups of whole wheat flour,one of unbleached white flour.  One and a half t. cinn. (could have used more, I'll know for next time. Didn't have chocolate chips or walnuts, so I used one cup of raisens. This is a wonderful recipe TI2GR.  I just needed to alter some of the ingredients for our life style and lack of some of the ingredients, so no hurt feelings please.  I think I'll be making another batch to share this evening.  By the way I liked the addition of the mayonaise, the bread is very moist.

I used butter instead of shortening. Half white sugar half brown sugar, applesauce instead of the 3rd banana, sour cream instead of the mayonnaise and pecan chips instead of walnuts. It was tasty and easy! 4.5 stars!

Excellent!  Per suggestions, the only thing I changed was to use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  It could not have tasted any more perfect.  Incredible recipe, easy to make, simply delicious.

Pretty good recipe. I added an extra half-cup of chocolate chips (because I LOVE chocolate) and substituted the mayo for applesauce.

I used shortening as directed as I am none to bothered with it, I actually like what it does for recipes.  I don't use it often but it seems that it's in some of the best dessert recipes from this site.  I think there's something to be said for shortening.  "Here, here", lol.    Good bread, better the next day. I'm sure I'll make it again.

Great recipe. Made it into muffins and added some cream cheese frosting, and halloween candies. They are really really moist. I added 1/2 cup of each the sugars, and used butter instead of shortening. I also forgot the nuts. Great recipe, thanks.

THIS IS AWESOME! The best banana bread i have ever made/tried. ever!! I've made this over and over again, and will continue to. I added milk chocolate chips and it was heavenly. If you are reading reviews to decide if you should make this or not, just make it! Your life will be better if you do.

AWESOME!! This was my first baking experience ever and this turned out unbelievably lovely. Is very moist and subtly sweet. Really really yummmm.. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. Everyone absolutely loved it.  Would advise against reducing the sugar amount. I used light butter instead of shortening. I considered using extra banana but thought I'd stick to the original recipe this time. Feel that an extra banana could have made it better. Will defi make again and again.

Fabulous!  For years of making boxed banana bread I decided to go from scratch and chose this recipe. I used suggestions of other reviewers and used 2 sticks of butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, a dash cinnamon and no chocolate chips. Everything else i kept the same. It was moist and delicious.  Great recipe! Thank you for sharing.  I will be making more of this for sure. I give it 5 stars! Update: I have made this recipe time and again for family gatherings and people say it's the best banana bread they have ever had. This recipe is a keeper.

I have tried many banana bread recipes and this one is the best!  Since I only had 3 bananas, I halved the recipe and omitted the nuts because my husband does not like them. I also substituted Splenda for the sugar. This is definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe. I used 1 stick butter and 1/2 cup appleasuce instead of the shortening; half Splenda and half brown sugar; half whole wheat flour and half white. Instead of chocolate chips I used 1 1/2 cups of mini peanut butter cups. I baked it in a 9x13 baking dish instead of two loaf pans. It was baked perfectly in 40 minutes. Moist and so delicious!! This would be great as muffins and use chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.

My breads sunk in the middle so they weren't pretty to look at.  The bottoms stuck to the bottom of the pan despite greasing the pans.  Very dark colored bread and the chocolate chips went to the bottom of the pan.  Kind of disappointed:(  Oh well....

Soooo good - moist and chocolatey!  I halved the recipe to make one loaf, and used Egg Beaters instead of eggs.  Anyone know of a good substitute for the shortening?  I used it but cringed when I thought of the added fat.  But - so worth it.  Totally delicious, especially when still warm from the oven!

I really hesitated on rating this one because we LOVED the bread without the chocolate chips.  We thought the chocolate overpowered the bread.  However, I'm considering using vanilla chips next time like one reviewer mentioned.  Again, the banana flavor & texture is excellent - we just didn't care much for the combination of chocolate with it.

I don't usually use shortening so I chose this recipe to try something different. I baked this bread exactly as the recipe called out and it was great! I found a keeper with this recipe that my family enjoyed until the last crumb. Very moist in a loaf pan and not bad as muffins ether. Loved the chocolate and nuts mixed with my very ripe bananas:)

I substituted shortening for butter and made one loaf without nuts and the other with chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone loved both! The cakes were nice and moist and had tons of banana flavor, unlike so many recipes which I feel lack the flavor of banana. Next time I will also try doing a loaf with more nuts and no chocolate chips for a more traditional bread. Overall great recipe!

Made this yesterday, one loaf is gone already, its really good. Im not usually a fan of banana bread but the chocolate chips changed my mind. I added an extra 1/2 cup of chips and accidently added an extra tsp of baking powder but it  was fine. I will definately make this again, thanks....

This is the best banana bread! Lots of times the flavor just isn't there, but that's not the case with this recipe.  I did as some reviewers and used butter rather than shortening and added the cinnamon....wow!

Amazing! Everyone who tried it, raved.  Instead of shortening, I used half C. butter, half C. apple sauce.  Other than that minor change, I followed the recipe to a tee.  Not too long before trying this recipe, I tried a different one and this is just so much better.  Hint: Most banana bread recipes call for very ripe bananas...my bananas were just ripe (yellow and reg softness) and I needed to bake the bread for a party the following day so I went for it.  Bread comes out just fine even if you don't use overly rip bananas, just make sure the bananas are completely mashed to give it a good consistency. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I made the bread with butter instead of shortening and omitted the walnuts.  The bread was so moist but it seemed like the chocolate overpowered the taste of the banana.  I would definitely use this recipe again to make regular banana bread and I know it would taste great!

Great Great Great. People who don't typically like banana bread said they loved this bread. People who claimed they don't usually like chocolate loved this bread. I couldn't find anyone who doesn't usually like bread so I just imagine everyone will like this stuff. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so moist and yummy.  The only thing I changed was to add extra walnuts because I love them in banana bread.  The addition of the chocolate chips was different but I bet it would be just as good without them, and not as sweet either.  Definitely will make again!
UPDATE:  We're on day 4 of eating this and it just keeps getting better and better.  I keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh and from drying out.  Try it, you'll LOVE it!  The best banana bread I've ever made.

I've never rated anything on this before, but this banana bread is so good, I have to. Moist, rich, delicious, mmm mmm... Using a 10" round cake pan works well with the quantity as well, in case you don't have 2 9x5 pans (like me). Thanks for this recipe!

I used 3/4 the amount of butter and sugar, because I wanted this to be a breakfast food not a dessert.  I thought it was still very tasty.  If anything you notice the natural sweetness of the bananas even more.

The mayonnaise is a great addition.  It adds a nice little bit of moistness.

I do think this should have vanilla in it.  I'm adding some next time.

I cut this recipe in half and made muffins out of it. I did lighten up the recipe a little by using whole wheat white flour, half the sugar and instead of a half cup of shortening, I used half nonfat plain yogurt and half butter. 350* for 20 minutes and they were perfectly done. I'm glad I halved the sugar otherwise, they would have been too sweet.

SOOO DELISH! I've made some pretty amazing banana breads, but I've never had one that was so light and fluffy. They tend to be on the denser side but I'm really likin this fluffness. I used butter instead of shortening, used half reg flour and half whole wheat flour, and used only 2 bananas for a half recipe (called for 3). Also used half brown sugar and half reg sugar. Forgot to add vanilla like many people recommended, but came out fabulous. Sprinkled cinnamon on top. YUUUMMMYYY

I have tried many recipes and they were good but not a keeper.I have been making this for over a year and it is by far the best w/or w/out chocolate chips.I recently tried another recipe that is in the top 20 recipes on this site didn't come close to being as good as this one.I don't change a thing and that is rare.I do like it best the next day.

I had a few ripe bananas and i tried this recipe, it turned out great! I used butter instead of shortening, also before mixing in the bananas i mashed them with some cinnamon and then added them to the mix. Deliscious recipe,easy to make!

I made a couple changes. One being I didn't use the full amount of chocolate chips(chunks) because I didn't have enough, but I did add 1 tsp cocoa powder and 1/2 the amout of chips. Also I sprinkled walnuts on 1/2 of the loaf once it was ready to bake. I personally liked the side with nuts better, but the other side was very very delicious! Next time I may try butter just because it isn't AS bad for the health. Thank you so much for this! It is one I will use every time for a classic bread

Yummy! This bread was fantastic. I also followed others' suggestions and used butter instead of shortening. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1-2 tsp cinnamon because those are my two favorite flavors.  I used 1 C milk chocolate chips, but left out the nuts. It turned out perfect - just sweet enough to tempt you to eat the whole loaf in one sitting!

I followed recipe except I didn't have any walnuts and I baked it in a muffin pan. I will not do that again because it was too moist and airy that it lacked the heartiness of a bread. Next time I will add a couple more bananas, add the walnuts, and bake in loaves hoping this will produce a heartier, denser banana bread. Other than that, it was delicious, moist, and easy.

I can honestly say this is the best banana bread I've ever had and I've been trying banana bread recipes for years. I used butter, and didn't realize I was out of eggs, so substituted mayo. Even with the extra mayo it was very good. I didn't have walnuts on hand but I love them so will be using them next time make. Excellent!

We loved this recipe. Your going to need the biggest bowl in your cupboard because this makes a lot! I used a standard bread loaf pan and also 3 mini loaf pans which took 10 minutes less to bake. I only had 4 large bananas on hand and that was plenty for flavor. I also used dark chocolate chips since I was out of milk chocolate. Still excellent...there's something about the combination of bananas and chocolate that will make everyone want seconds. I imagine this would freeze well as well. Nice way to use those overripe bananas rather than toss them!

This was a good bread.  Nothing amazing, but very tasty for how easy it was to make.  I didn't have shortening so I used butter.  The bread fell at the end of baking and I think it's b/c of the butter.

Wonderful recipe!  I'm so glad I tried this on as there are numerous banana bread recipes on here.  I will definitely make this one again.  I used butter instead of shortening and also substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour.  Followed the rest of the directions and it turned out great!  Wasn't quite sure of the mayonnaise, but the bread was wonderful.  My whole family loved it - including four kids aged 3 to 9.

Being a banana bread snob I was hesitant to try another recipe that promised the moon. The mayo intrigued me. The only sub I made was butter for the shortening. Fab flavor! very moist. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips. I didn't want it too sweet. My whole fam gobbled it up. I'm about to make this recipe into muffins. Yumm!

There is a reason this recipe is rated so highly it's delicious! I only made half the recipe and used all the low fat low cal options and it was still the best I've ever made. I made it into 12 muffins and they came out to 131 calories, wonderful! I can't believe they're so great, definitely worth a try and worth keeping around!

Very good.  I too used butter.  And I also was VERY skeptical about the mayo I did it as instructed.  I can taste it a little bit but it is ok.  Also I am hoping that it stays together better once it cools.  But it is still very tasty.  Oh and I also used M & M's because my husband ate all the chocolate chips! Turned out great!

This bread is soooo moist!  I used butter in place of the shortening.  My husband and kids freaked out when they tasted it!  They loved it the next morning for breakfast, too.

Delicious & very moist banana bread!  I subbed butterscotch chips for chocolate and added nutmeg & vanilla and coated the pan in butter, sugar & cinnamon.  I also had to lower the oven temp halfway through cooking to 325 or the top would have burned.  Would make again.

Wow...this is awesome!  I work at a produce market, so we frequently make banana loafs, and this one was great:  moist, sweet, a huge hit with kids and adults both.  I added a little extra banana and it had a nice, rich banana flavor.  This makes two BIG loaves that are slightly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  A keeper for sure!!

This banana bread was really good!  I had a bunch of very ripe bananas and was looking for a good banana bread that used a lot of bananas. I substituted brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar and I cooked this in a fancy bundt pan.  It turned out great!

Truly awesome!  It is a very moist bread and can take a little longer than the 50-70 minutes to bake.  Made it a second time and made into muffins, bake for only 25 minutes.  Super delicious!  Big hit with my family.

It must have either been me or my baking powder because mine sank in the middle and browned too much on the outside.  I will probably try again and reduce the temp and buy some new baking powder.

This recipe is AMAZING- it's the best banana bread recipe I have found.
Don't let the mayo throw you for a loop, you can't even taste it and it makes the bread SOOOO moist!!!

Love Love Love!!! Ahhhh sweet love! I followed many of the user suggestions, as well, such as throwing in some vanilla and cinnamon, using butter instead of shortening, coating choco chips in light flour. I also tossed in some nutmeg and it gave it that special fall treat flavour. Some variations, but still - wonderful recipe! My co-workers beg me for it, my family blackmails me for it...and my tummy hates me for it because I can't stop eating it. Thanks for sharing! Happy Baking :)

Had to make a few changes, to make healthier. Omitted walnuts. Used unsweetened applesauce in place of shortening, 1/2 splenda & 1/2 sugar instead of all sugar, added one extra banana and used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour. It was very moist and good! Everyone at the cook-out ate it up!

After my second attempt at this recipe I now know it is definitely the one! Overcooked it last time, so this time I was more careful, and aswell I added an extra banana (although mine are fairly small, but I use bananas that I have peeled and frozen in a ziploc bag), used all shortening instead of half butter, half white and half brown sugar and added some vanilla and cinnamon. I also added extra brown sugar and walnuts for a topping. My mother-in-law tried it today and she said it is better than hers!

Really good!  Some of the reviews suggested smaller chocolate chips, but I did the opposite and andded the "chunk" semi-sweet chips.  It's a great suprise to get a huge piece of chocolate in this bread!  Bake for the whole time, I didn't have two loaf pans so I cooked each one seperate, and the second one needed a lot longer to bake all the way thru.  I followed all the other suggestions by the reviewers, adding cinnamon and vanilla, and butter instead of shortening.  Gone within a couple days!  Hard to stop after just one piece.

I must add my kudos for this recipe!  I absolutely loved it.  Even my boyfriend, who insists he has the *best* banana bread recipe, agreed that this was the best he had tasted.

I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers - I used butter instead of shortening, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and substituted fat free sour cream for the mayonnaise.  I also doubled the chocolate chips, and added them to the dry ingredients so they wouldn't sink to the bottom of the loaf.  I also cut the recipe in half to make one loaf, and it worked out just fine.

The result was fantastic - I will definitely be making this one again.

This is very good and a nice addition to (plain) banana bread. As if there is such a thing! The only thing I do different is I use mini chocolate chips. I like it much better that way.

This recipe is so easy and the taste is incredible! I brought it to a pot luck lunch, and everyone loved it! My kids and husband love it too. I can't wait until I have some more over-ripe bananas so that I can make this again. 

I halved the recipe because I only had three bananas, and it fit perfectly into three mini loaf pans - perfect. I also used half white/half brown sugar - other than that, I followed this reciped to a "t" - thanks for sharing!

I have tried many different banana bread recipes and I dare say that this one is the best!!  I made one loaf and 6 large muffins and left out the walnuts because I don't like them.  I also did half shorting and half butter.

I've made this twice now.  Once with the nuts and chips and once with raisins and chips.  I found it too moist with three bananas (I halved the recipe).  I will try with two next time as the ends were getting too brown to keep baking.  Also added nuts/raisins and chips to the dry ingredients before combining with the wet and nuts, chips and raisins were evenly dispersed throughout

I read the reviews from many people - and I decided to follow some advice from them, such as decreasing the temperature, decreasing the amount of sugar, and adding vanilla.  The finished product resulted in something I had not expected:  the bread wasn't even bread-like; it had more of a cake texture to it, plus despite the change in temperature, and baking it for less time, it still turned out very dark, and very crusty on the edges.  As well,when I attempted to remove the loaves from the pan, the bottoms stuck, though I had greased the pans generously.  It was very sweet -  definitely more of a dessert bread.  On the whole, I have used other banana bread recipes that produced better results.  I will not be using this recipe again....

This was absolutely wonderful! I used mini chips and baked this recipe in mini loaves and mini cupcake pans, and ended up with several dozen. They make wonderful snacks that my children can then grab on their own. Thanks for the recipe, my husband and kids are already asking for more.

Excellent flavor - like others, it's hard to get a clean slice because it's so moist but it tastes so good it doesn't matter!

Next time I make this (and I will) I have to turn down my oven by about 25 degs.  The bread got too dark and even started blackening around the edges before the inside was done.  I always lower my oven for cakes, and it slipped my mind today.  I want it golden brown like the picture.  I also may make smaller loaves.

I have always been disappointed in banana bread recipes being too dry, but this one was moist and excellent. After reading  reviews about it being too sweet, I cut the chocolate chips to 1/3 cup. I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup Splenda. 
Perfect for my teenagers and friends. The next time I made it for my diabetic husband - 1/2 recipe -one loaf, no chips and all Splenda.  Definately will do again - both ways!

Fantastic bread, very moist - which is what I was looking for.  It didn't need the chocolate chips (even my kids agreed!), next time I'll leave them out.

Loved this bread.  Omited the walnuts because the kids will not eat and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Followed the rest of the directions to a "T" and would not change a thing. This disappeared so fast that I am making another loaf for tonight.  Thanks Betty

This bread was fabulous.  It is moist and delicious.  I halved the recipe because I didn't have six bananas and I omitted the nuts.  My kids gobbled it up.  A nice variation of the traditional banana bread recipe!

Wow!! This is seriously so so yummy!! All I did was add half a cup more of chocolate chips cuz I'm a chocolate addict, but everything else was the same! Everyone should make this at least once! Delish!!!!

Very moist and delicious.  Have made this twice.  Like other reviewers, I subbed butter for shortening.  I like to back off a little on the sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), double the nuts and go a little over with the chocolate chips (dusted with flour).  Adding a few shakes of cinnamon adds a nice touch, too. Hubby said this banana bread changed his life. ;-)

This was delicious. Like others I substituted butter for shortening, added cinnamon and vanilla, and put them into mini muffin tins so only baked them for about 20 minutes. I will definitely make these again.

Since I am living in Grenada, the Isle of Spice, I added fresh grated nutmeg and cinnamon. Nuts here are insanely expensive, so skipped the nuts, but when we move back home they will most definitely be added into the mix. They were super yummy.

Used butter instead of shortening & special dark chocolate chips, and took the suggestions of others and added vanilla & cinnamon, made muffins so grabbing on the go was much quicker...this is hands down the best banana bread (muffin) recipe! Thanks for sharing & I really do think the mayo is key!

This was absolutely delicious.  As others suggested, I used butter in place of shortening, and a dash of vanilla and cinnamon.  I made 8 small loaves and baked them at 325 for about 30 minutes.  Very moist and tasty!!

I subbed butter for the shortening, and added a heaping spoonful of peanut butter to one loaf and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the other. So moist and rich! My family and boyfriend ask for it all the time! Greek yogurt or sour cream can also be used in place of the mayo.

This bread is absolutely delicious.  I've never made banana bread before, but the chocolate chips drew my attention.  I made it exactly as is with no substitutions.  There is no reason to change a thing. I have never had a more delicious bread in my life!  It was extremely moist, but was cooked completely within the given time frame.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I halved the recipe and made muffins. I used half sugar and half brown sugar and ghiradelli white chocolate chips. I also added a little pumpkin pie spice to the bananas. They were delicious! My two year gobbled them up.

Very easy and tastes amazing. Have made this many times. Like everyone else I use butter instead of shortening. I was adding a teaspoon of vanilla, though I used maple extract by mistake once and now use it every time.  Have tried it using someone's tip of dusting the chocolate chips with flour, but that's a bit of a time waster and didnt really make a differenence. People kind of freak out when they try this, it's that good.

My family loves this banana bread recipe.  The only thing I change is the sugar.  I use dark brown sugar instead and I use butter instead of shortening.  It turns out amazing every time. Also cook it for the max time otherwise the middle is gooey. And not in the good way.

So delicious ! I used butter instead and it was amazing. Also I used cake & pastry flour because that's all I had and it was fine. My husband does not like bananas and he devoured this banana bread. I used extra chocolate chips and walnuts too, yummmmmmy

I've made this a few times and it is WONDERFUL and MOIST. Never used shortening and used butter instead like most others. I few times I changed it up using more nuts, making half recipes, making muffins, the works. I even added peanut butter (1/3 cup) and it never disappointed . Also coated chocolate chips in flour.  Love it!

My family, boyfriend, and I just absolutely loved them. Best banana bread recipe for someone who has never made banana bread before. I had made a bunch of mini muffins and 8 small mini loaves. Changed the temperature and the time. Keep an eye on the muffins because they are small.  All in all sooooooooooo Good.

Absolutely delicious! I replaced the shortening with butter, omitted the walnuts and 1/2 the salt (used salted butter), and replaced 1/2 of the mayo with peanut butter just because I like the taste. So moist and tasty! Will make again!

Loved this recipe.  I cut it in half and made muffins.  The recipe cut in half made 12 full muffin cups, ready in 25 minutes, light and fluffy and terrific.  Next time I'll try margarine and applesauce instead of shortening.  I also added a splash of vanilla, and I tossed the chocolate chips in a little flour.  A great recipe.  UPDATE:  I tried the margarine/applesauce substitution for shortening to try and cut down on fat.  They still taste great, better than the recipe I used to use.  I also tried a combination of white sugar/brown sugar.  I do love the basic original recipe, and making substitutions doesn't seem to change it that much, always a plus.

As everyone has been saying, this is an awesome recipe.  My husband says it is the best banana recipe that I have made (bread, muffins, etc.).  I made it into mini-muffins - baked for 20-25 minutes at 350.  My alterations were:  1 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar, 1 t vanilla, 1.5 C white flour, 1.5 C whole wheat flour (and some oat bran), and a combo of butter and marg instead of shortening.  Great banana flavour - spouse and kids (all the neighbourhood kids) loved them.

I Substituted shortening for butter like the reviewers, and omit the chocolate chips, only because my son's not a fan of chocolate chips. I didn't have walnuts in hand so I used pecans instead. 
I have to say, this is one of the most delicious banana bread I have had! I am making this again for sure.;0)

Make this now!!! Absolutely moist and delicious.  I don't usually review recipes but felt compelled to do so with this one.  I only had 5 bananas, used butter instead of shortening and baked it all in a bundt pan.

This was my first time making banana bread and I will need to look no further.  This was fabulous.  I used dark chocolate chips and made one with nuts and one without.  My family loved it.  My mother who is a wonderful baker, asked for the recipe which is the ultimate compliment.

This is a wonderful starter recipe. You can make changes for your taste and it still comes out yummo!

Instead of shortening, I followed the advice of other reviewers and used butter, unsalted. But I only used half a cup and substituted the other half cup with unsweetened applesauce. 

I used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup brown splenda in replace of sugar. 

I added a teaspoon of vanilla.

I must say, I did add a cup of chips, but I think it was too much. Making more today and I'm going to bump the amount of chips down to 3/4 cup. 

I baked mine in mini loaves and a muffin pan until they were golden brown, roughly 20 minutes. Came out perfect! They didnt fall apart or crumble. 

Its only been 2 days and 18 servings of it are gone!

Wow - so good!
I am not sure how 2 tbsp of mayo made such a difference, but it did...
I substituted butter for the shortening, and added 2 tsp of cinnamon, but other than that made just as is.

Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic, I did add a little twist to it though, I topped it with a little bit of vanilla frosting, which gave it the perfect amount of sweetness!!

So good!  I found this as a result of looking for the Banana Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake sold at Starbucks.  This is even better.
If you add an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and bake for an extra 5 minutes it's phenomenal!

I used the shortening, even though I am a butter person, and it turned out terrific!  Choc. chips did seem to sink to the bottom though.  Might try the flour trick next time.  And only make 1 loaf instead of 2 ~ it's a LOT of banana bread!

Really easy.  I didn't have shortening either, so I substituted 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also did 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown as someone else suggested.  My husband loved it.  I used pecans in just one of the loaves as I'm allergic to walnuts and not a huge fan of nuts in bread.  Both loaves were great!

Very delicious very tasty very moist will make again, I used butter instead of shortening. Next time I will divide the batter between 3 pans; my 2 loaves raised way above the top of the pan. I will use 2 9x5 and 1 smaller pan!

Love this bread! I make a few changes, but otherwise it's fantastic as written:  I used butter instead of shortening, half brown sugar and half white, added 1 tsp vanilla, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I've also used half milk chocolate chips one time because it was what I had in the pantry - delicious!

This is a very tasty recipe. A quick and easy batter to assemble, my 4 year old granddaughter helped to prepare the batter.  I did change a few ingredients. I substituted butter for the shortening and I used 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I love nuts, but left them out this time. I may play with the sugar combo some more, but otherwise, I will leave it as is. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicous!  I was looking for something different than my usual favorite banana bread with chocolate chips, and came across this one.  I will need to adjust for high altitude in the future, since the bread fell when I took it out of the oven.  I used unsalted butter, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and added a dash of cinnamon.  Heavenly!

I liked the concept but I found it too dense and not enough sweetness. Granted, I did not add the chocolate chips but I am comaring this to another recipe by Kraft that uses Splenda. It was worth the effort to try something new

It was really good!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamon, like others suggested and used butter instead of shortening- and it was yummy!  very moist and light.  I had only half of the semi-sweet chocolate chips called for so I substituted with white chocolate chips.  Was concerned it would be too sweet but it was great!  One tip, sift the dry ingredients because I didn't and bit into a chunk of baking soda (bleh!).

Wow..  not sure what the mayo does to make it so moist, but it't terrific!  I followed the suggestion to go with butter and 1/2 brown sugar/1/2 white... it did take a full 60 minutes to cook.  I also tossed the choc chips in flour and they were well spread out through the bread.  Will put this in favorites for SURE!

The BEST banana bread I've ever had. I substituted butter instead of shortening and I made these into muffins instead of a loaf. They are extremely moist and everyone I make them for loves them!

Excellent recipe. I halved the recipe and made one loaf. I used a glass pan, so I lowered the temperature by 25 degrees. It took over 80 minutes to bake (I'm not exactly sure because I just kept checking on it every few minutes after the first timer went off). The edges came out a little bit dark because of the glass pan, but it still turned out delicious. Next time I will use a light aluminum pan. From what I've read on various websites and blogs, the cheapy pans work best for quick breads.

I also added some extra chocolate chips and used butter-flavored shortening as that's what I had on hand. I don't think it influenced the outcome of the recipe.

This is an amazing recipe.  I have made the bread several times now and other reviewers suggested butter and my family all voted that the butter batches were the best.  Also just made this recipe into muffins for my daughter's girl guide fair and they turned out amazing.  Made about 20 muffins and they baked for about 24 minutes.  Now I just have to keep them from getting eaten before the fair. =)

THE best banana bread EVER!!! yummm.  Only changes were butter instead of shortening and I did half white sugar and half brown sugar, mini chocolate chips and pecans for the nuts.  Absolutely perfect! Will make extra large batch next time to give leftover loaves as gifts!

I made this tonight after reading all of the reviews.   And after reading several reviews I also changed a few things - I used butter instead of shortening, did 1 cup white, 1 cup brown sugar and added some cinnamon.  I also set the timer for 50 min, and then checked it every 5 to make sure I wasn't over cooking it.    This banana bread is absolutely delicious.  It's moist...and overall absolutely wonderful - and very easy!! I am bringing it to a party tomorrow and can guarantee it will not make it more than a few minutes! Will for sure make this again as soon as I have very ripe bananas!

I doubled the recipe and used 12 bananas.  I used equal parts butter and apple sauce instead of shortening.  I also used equal parts white and brown sugar.  And I used 1.5 cups of choc chips (as opposed to 2 cups because I doubled the recipe).  I left out the walnuts.  Shared with family and friends.  Everyone enjoyed it!

This Banana Bread was amazing! I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I swirled in some chocolate ice cream topping which worked out really well. I can't wait to make this again.

This is a great recipe. The mayo makes all the difference. I took some of the suggestions from other people. That is the ONLY reason I gave it a 4 star. I used Country Crock 39% veg. oil instead of shortening (because it was all I had) don't use a higher concentrate of veg. oil because it has more water in it doesn't have the same consistency. I mixed some cinnamon and sugar together and after greasing the pan sprinkled it on the bottom and sides. I also sprinkled some of the cinnamon and sugar on top to give it a crispy delicious flavor. I baked mine in a bunt cake pan the first time and it was such a great hit the ENTIRE cake was gone the same day. I have already had two requests for this recipe and I am making a half batch today for some friends. Awesome! Thank you TI2GR :-)

I saw all the rave reviews and just had to try this...let me tell you, I made a lot of subsitutions and still-EVERYONE raved about this bread and said it was the most delicious, moistest banana bread they have ever eaten! So let me tell you the substitutions:  - Used "Land O'Lakes spreadable butter with canola oil" in place of shortening - Used egg whites , no yolks - Used 2 tablespoons sour cream instead of mayonnaise (this is the secret moistening ingredient!) - This recipe didn't call for it, but most banana bread calls for vanilla extract, but I didn't have it and it was 11pm, so I used 100% maple syrup    (2 teaspoons) instead - Didn't put nuts in  TRUST the people who have reviewed this recipe....this recipe is a keeper! I will not use any other recipe for banana bread again!

I have made this recipe three times since discovering it a few months ago, and it has always turned out delicious. Besides using butter instead of shortening, I follow this recipe exactly. I have always just coated the pan with butter, which has kept sticking problems to a minimum (there's sometimes a little trouble here and there- Next time I'll try flouring the pan as well). My friends at college love this stuff. Whenever I walk into class with a loaf, I suddenly become everyone's best friend (with a few marriage proposals thrown in here and there). It's super moist and has chocolate... and we all know that chocolate makes EVERYTHING better.... ;) Great recipe. Will always be a personal favorite of mine.

I did not care for this. All I substituted was butter for shortening. Pan was preped as instructed in the recipe. Cooled loaves in pan for 20 minutes as on recipe. Could not get the loaves out of the pans. Total disaster. Waste of money and time. Very disappointed. Obviously will not try again.

This is the absolute best Choco Chip Banana bread I have ever had!!! This is my 2nd time making it at the request of my family. It is so moist and so full of flavor! The only things that I did differently (and you really don't need to do anything different for this recipe to be perfection) were I added another cup of chocolate chips (at the request of my hubby)I followed everyone's suggestion about using butter instead of shortening(shortening can be so messy and I don't cook with it so it wasn't on hand anyway), no walnuts cause we don't like em' and I added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract. YUM!!! I baked it for the full 75 min last time and it was pretty dark so I set it for 50 and will just check it every 5 min or so after that. You have to try this! It's very rare that a recipe has a full 5 stars on this website. That definitely says something!!

Delicious! I had some bananas that were on the verge of going bad, which is great when you are craving banana bread! I did use 3 smaller loaf pans instead of the two larger ones, and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Also decreased the cooking temp just a smidge. Other than that, followed recipe to a T. Be sure to use really ripe bananas (spotty, icky looking peels), as this is when bananas are at their sweetest. This is decadent served with butter on top. Even better the next day!

This turned out fine.  Nothing special about it but nothing wrong with it either.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This was such a great recipe!! I made them into muffins and they were very good! I like doing it that way because it makes it easy to grab one and go! I did make some changes like some other reviews said, I did half the amount butter and the other half apple sauce, I also did 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Very moist and delicious! Next time I will do half whole wheat flour and half white, just didn't have it on hand this time. If you are trying to stay away from sugar I think it would be fine using less, because the bananas really sweeten it up. Give them a try!

This has become our favorite banana bread recipe.  Easy enough that my daughters usually make it.  Best to use aluminum pans (not dark) for this recipe, 2 large loafs or 3 smaller (the larger size disposible aluminum loaf pans).  Usually do 1 loaf with extra chocolate chips (no nuts), and the 2nd loaf chopped walnuts (no chocolate chips) to please everyone in the family.  Everyone who eats this bread raves about it.  Be sure to let it cool a while before taking it out of the pan, or it will stick to the bottom.

I will never buy a box mix for banana bread again! This recipe is awesome! I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for using Gharadelli milk chocolate chips (chopped a little finer) instead of semi-sweet and pecan instead of walnuts. I used light mayo as someone else suggested. Only had 5 bananas, but there is plenty of banana taste. May try using butter the next time.  Very good recipe!

I only had 1 tblspn mayo, so added 1 tblspn sour cream. I used the full amount of sugar, but ran out of white sugar so used 1/2 c brown sugar. I didn't have any baking powder, so skipped that altogether. I didn't have any shortening so used butter. I used a tiny bit of salt. I had 5 1/2 bananas- which equaled just over 2 cups once mashed. I made one loaf (which I cooked for 67 minutes) and 12 muffins (which I cooked for 22 minutes). I think both could have cooked less time. I also think more bananas would have been fine. The results are yummy! I would like it to be a wee bit more moist (hence the suggested shortened cooking time). I didn't realize my oven was on the convection setting. Great recipe! My favorite banana bread recipe so far. Thank you!
Update: Made it again. Two loaves. Cooked 50 minutes. Used butter instead of shortening, vegan sour cream substitute instead of mayo (it's all I had). 2 1/2 cups mashed banana. 2 cups milk chocolate chips. Very good. Moist. Yummy. My bananas weren't quite ripe enough, so not enough banana flavor for me, but still the 1st loaf was devoured within a couple hours. Delicious! Make sure you have a really big bowl when you start. Really big.

Oh so very moist!  Only changes I made was use 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and it was still sweet enough but not overpoweringly sweet.  And added 1 tea of vanilla extract.  Best banana bread ever!

I've tried numerous banana bread recipes.  Made this during the blizzard.  Really, the best recipe I've found.  It's rich and the banana flavor is perfectly balanced.  I used butter instead of shortening and omitted the chocolate chips.  You can't even buy banana bread that tastes as good.  You need not search further for banana bread! Thanks TI2GR!  You ROCK!

LOVED IT!!!!!!!! My mother who swore off banana bread long ago, tried this one, and she is in love! She even collected all her bananas from her house and brought it over to our house, hinting we should make more. Awesome recipe!! Tweaked the recipe a bit: we used butter instead of shortening, we used brown instead of white sugar and put only half the measurement. A cup of chocolate chips gave it the right amount of sweetness.

This were delicious! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I honestly good! If any one gave them under a 5 star rating they have no clue what they were talking about! I used smaller loaf pans - 5.75"x3" so mine were smaller and I needed more things to put this mix in since it was a lot which is where muffins came in play. If you do it in the form of a muffin or a smaller loaf pan 20-25 minutes is all you'll need. This will make some yummy breakfasts and snacks. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is fabulous!  Reading through the reviews, I took a little advice from others and added a splash of vanilla, cooked it in a bundt bad and sprinkled the bottom of the pan with cinnamon.  Also, I used light butter and light mayo...is was still sinfully delishous!

I halved the recipe...not enough bananas!  This browned very quickly on top and I was worried I'd have mush inside and a burned top.   I remembered a suggestion from another recipe to cover the top with foil half-way through baking.  I think this saved my "bread"....but who are we kidding--isn't it cake? :-)

Everyone loves this recipe.  People beg me to make it...often.  Only changes I made were to use butter in place of the shortening and I add 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  I also use a cinnamon and sugar mix around the pan after I spray it with Pam.  This is truly the BEST!

This is delicious! We were out of semisweet chips, so I used 1/4 c. peanut butter chips and 1/4 c. milk chocolate chips.  They came out AMAZING!  We had better luck with muffins than bread - the bread got pretty dark on the outside before it was done on the inside.

Hands down one of the best recipes for banana bread. I made 6 mini loaves which took 50 mins to cook. Husband loved them more than my other recipe for banana bread. I used 1 cup unsaled butter in place of shortening and used a whole bag of semi sweet chocolate chips. I was a little worried about the mayo but didn't taste it at all. Highly recommend...you won't be disappointed!

Really liked the recipe - easy and delicious. I also substituted apple sauce for the shortening and it came out great. 50 minutes in the oven was perfect. I left out the walnuts, but added some chocolate chips, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla as was suggested. Not bad, next time I'll make one with blueberries and one just with chocolate chips!

Great recipe!  I did add a pinch of nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon.  I made mine into muffins -- half with chocolate chips and half without to make everyone happy.  They were very moist and flavorful.  Much better than any other recipe I've tried.

I have tried this with shortening and with butter.  (omitted the walnuts both times).  I preferred the butter option and so did my family.  Perhaps butter-flavored Crisco would be good, but I used regular Crisco, and I really missed the taste of butter in it.  Also, the Crisco gave the top a bit of a crisp to it, which I didn't care for as much.  Absolutely LOVED the recipe when substituting butter, though!!!!

this banana bread tasted great. used butter instead of shortening though. only thing is, be careful not to overfill your loaf pan. i found that at the temperature it was baked, the middle ended up undercooked. the other loaf (made in a shallow silicon pan) was amazing start to finish.

Shortening and mayo?!?  A bit much?  No way!  This bread is moist and delicious and oh so chocolately.  Skip the low cal suggestions and make it as is... mmmmm!

This recipe is wonderful!  However, after I made it the first time, I wanted to cut down on the fat and calories - and it turned out just as wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of shortening and I used lite mayo.  I also used 1 cup Splenda, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used 1 1/2 cups each of white and whole wheat flour, which gives it a great texture and cut the chocolate chips in half.  I made muffins instead (bake 25 min.)and the kids loved them!!

I used butter since I could not find shortening, but followed the recipe to a tee.  This is so good and moist.  I find though that baking time should be about 45 to 50 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

OMG OMG OMG! I kid you not, this is the bestest chocolate chip banana bread recipe you will ever try. It is super moist and perfectly chocolatey. I did make this recipe once exactly as written and it was perfect. The next time around I made a few changes: I substituted butter, used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and lastly I added 1/4 cocoa powder. Next time I might even add another 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.

To make this recipe a little healthier I used whole wheat flour and raw cane sugar in for white flour and white sugar.  I also used butter instead of shortning.  Delicious and crispy on top.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have shortening or mayonnaise so I substituted margarine and light Miracle Whip. Tasted just as good as the other reviewers have noted. The top and sides did brown more than I would have liked before the middle was done cooking, but I think I may have had too much mix in the pan (I used very large bananas and slightly more chocolate chips, and when I poured it into the 9x5 loaf pan, the mix came up to about 1 inch from the top). It was still fabulous!

I have made this recipe over and over. I get rave reviews. "This is the best banana bread I have ever had." It is so  moist and sweet. I have made it with and with out chocolate chips. Adding the chocolate chips after putting the mix in the loaf pan seems to work better keeping the chips off the sides of the pan. I also add raw sugar on top. I do not add walnuts. If you dont have enough bananas try adding apple sauce.

WOW! I must concur!! I followed 4my2boys advice on 7 bananas and Danielle Beattys advice on the muffins for the kids.  I didn't make any other changes except I made a few mini loaves and added coconut and pecans for me. YUM! THIS IS THE BEST BANANA BREAD!

the moistest (is that word) banana bread I have ever tasted.  Most of the time I don't like banana bread because it is so dry.  This is soooo very moist, must be the mayo.  Give it a try... delicious...

this is the moistest banana bread i've ever made. the flavors were amazing and it's so filling! also- the recipe is pretty forgiving- for some dumb reason i thought it was supposed to bake at 375 instead of 350 and it still turned out just fine. will definitely make this my standard recipe thank you so much!

Fantastic recipe.  I've made it incorrectly twice--the first time only using two bananas and substituting applesauce, the second time forgetting to cream the shortening and sugar, adding the sugar to the flour, and adding melted shortening to the wet stuff instead, and it still came out moist and delicious.  Thanks, my standing recipe for banana bread.  (I do recommend butter for this.)

Great recipe! I worry about my bread coming out dry, but this was very moist and tasty!  I halved the recipe and also used 1/2 dark brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  It may be a little on the sweet side.  I'll try and add some Kahlua liquor next time.

This is the first time I have attempted to make banana bread in a few years, due to complete failure to produce anything close to being edible (even though I followed my cookbook's recipe to the T).  I crossed my fingers with this one, choosing it because of all the wonderful reviews I read.  I used half brown sugar and half granulated, only had half the nuts, and it turned out to be the best banana bread I have ever tasted (dare I say, better than my wonderfully talented aunt)!  I froze the second loaf, because I thought we wouldn't need it, but ended up putting it in the oven the next day because the first loaf was gone the same day!  I think I put it in @ 200 degrees, don't remember how long, and it turned out crunchy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside.  Needless to say, we finished the second loaf that very day!  
Thank you for this recipe!!!

I left out the walnuts and tripled the chocolate chips.  I poured into a greased 9X13 pan and baked at 350.  It almost overflowed during baking, so maybe next time I'll take a little out and make some cupcakes.  I'm not sure how long I baked for, but just used the toothpick test.  Made a fantastic banana chocolate chip cake.  Will definitely make again.

I only had half the bananas, and someone turned the oven up by 100 degrees, so the bottom & sides were overdone and the top was completely black, but this is still probably THE BEST banana bread I've ever had!  I can hardly wait to see how it turns out with all the bananas and not burnt!

Delicious recipe!!  This was my 3rd attempt at making banana bread and the first time it worked out!   

I used butter and margarine instead of shortening (½ cup butter ½ cup becel), I only had about 1 tbls of mayo, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups regular flour, and by accident I used 2 tsp of baking powder. I also left out the nuts.  Slighly healthier and still very moist and delicious! even better then the bakery loaf I normally buy!  Will be a favorite of mine!

I make this all the time and every time I make it I get a request for the recipe!!  I make mine exactly as the recipe calls for only I use a bundt pan.  In addition to chocolate chips, I sometimes cut up pieces of candy bars and add those in.  Very delicious and it looks nice as a bundt cake.

This is probably the best banana bread I have made in years.  It is SO moist and the chocolate just adds that dessert-y kick to take it to a higher level!  Instead of two large loaves, I made one loaf and 3 mini loaves to give away. Per the comments, I used slightly less sugar and also subbed a little bit of the white sugar with brown. Every thing else is as written. Yummy!!!

I loved this recipe, so did my picky 4 year old who won't eat any sweet breads without chocolate chips.  I opted for butter instead of shortening, to make it trans fat free, used half brown and half white sugar and omited the walnuts.  It was the best banana bread I've ever eaten!  Definitely a keeper!

As janice from "friends" would say: OH(pause) MY (pause) GOD!!!
I changed it a little but think its a 5 star anyway because i had to make the changes.. since I had milk chocolate chips I used onle 1 1/2 cups sugar.. 
this was "delicioso" as we say in my country.. this recipe MUST have dropped down from heavan :D
UPDATE: when i took my second loaf out of the pan the whole top sticked on to the pan. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THESE TO BE MADE IN MUFFIN PANS WITH MUFFIN PAPERS OR WHATEVER THEY ARE CALLED!! but its still very yummy

OMG! This was so good. I added 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. I used my pampered chef stoneware pans and the crust was fantastic!

I am always on the search for a good banana bread - moist, full of banana flavor, and not too dense. This is a wonderful recipe, and the chocolate adds something extra-special to it. I omitted the walnuts (allergy) and used 1/2 c shortening 1/2 cup applesauce for lower fat. It turned out terrific. This is definitely going to be my standby recipe from now on.

Excellent, easily adjustable recipe. I use 1/2 brown sugar (tonight, it was turbinado sugar) and use an applesauce/ground flax seed/oil combination for the cup of shortening. And my standard replacement of 1/3 white flour and 2/3 whole wheat flour/soy flour/wheat germ. This bread is still sweet enough and moist.

loved it, but when I made it I added probably 1/2 cup more of choc chips and it may have been a bit more than I should have, but still very good

I've tried a few different recipes for banana bread, but this is the best yet - with or without the chocolate chips. Seems like it might also be good with dried fruit.

I don't like bananas, so this is my family's review.  "Great Stuff."  The kids gobbled it right up.  Very moist, not too sweet, just the right amount of chocolate.     I must say that it made my house smell pretty good too.

Yummy! I used butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 bittersweet choc chips, put a little cinnamon and a little vanilla, and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Very moist...good idea with the mayo!

This recipe was great! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 yogurt to cut the fat a bit, and pecans instead of walnuts because that's all I had. The loaf was beautiful and the middle did not fall.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Great Bananna Bread recipe.  I added 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips and no walnuts, and It was the perfect amount of chocolate.  I also added the chocolate chips to my dry mixture to prevent the chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom.

This has become a regular recipe in the household...whenever banana's get too "brown" for my kids, I make up this recipe.  It hasn't failed me yet in the dozen or so times I've made it.

This recipe has a lot going for it.  The loaf is very moist, and the bread has a great slightly chewy but tender texture... but, I thought it was too sweet.  I used the amount called for in the recipe, but subbed in brown sugar for part of the whitep; I didn't pack it tight and still it was just too sweet for me.  And beware, if you are looking for a pretty presentation you may be disappointed as the middle sinks in.  It doesn't look awful, but it doesn't form that perfectly rounded loaf top that people expect either.  However, I am giving it 4 stars because I am the only one who tried it and thought this.  All my other guinea pigs gave it rave reviews.  So I may try it again and cut the sugar in half and just use brown sugar. Because the presentation doesn't matter to me, and the texture and moistness were superb.

I halved this recipe and made 12 large muffins. They turned out fantastic! I substituted plain yogurt for the mayo and added a bit of cinnamon. They turned out light, fluffy and moist, Yum!!

Great flavor combinations! The middle sunk in so presentation wasn't so great. I used 2tbl of vanilla, and scaled it down to one loaf. Thanks!

This was delicious!  It was a huge hit at the playgroup I hosted.  I only had 5 bananas on hand, but it worked just fine with the five.  I also didn't add the nuts because I personally don't care for them.  It was fantastic and everyone raved about it.  I didn't have any problems with it being wet in the center as some other reviewers mentioned.  Perhaps that is because I only used 5 bananas?

awesome! banana bread has the propensity to be dried out and clumpy, but this recipe's secret is the tablespoon of mayonnaise that locks in the moisture. a great idea. i usually add a teaspoon of vanilla and i always make sure that the bananas i use are extremely ripe, almost rotten. (that's when the bread turns out best.) my mom was most impressed. she usually doesn't like banana bread, but she loved this recipe.

I make this bread every time the banana tree yields a hand of bananas. The taste can't be beat when you use bananas from the backyard. My husband and friends say this bread is sinful, and everyone asks for the recipe.

I have made this bread several times and gotten rave reviews.  I've even had to pass on the recipe.  A few changes I made was using butter instead of shortening and using mini chocolate chips.  I also don't put nuts in--but that's just a personal preference.  The recipe makes two loaves but I've used mini loaf pans and then sliced it up and its the perfect snacking size.
This bread is the best!!

I must say, this was a fantastic recipe, with one minor setback: it's actually a little TOO moist... and when I say that, I mean that the outside browned nicely, but the very middle of the loaf turned out almost wet. Next time I'll cut out a banana or 2, or maybe consider turning the temp down to 325 and adding some of the baking time. Otherwise, very very tasty and rich. I added 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t cinnamon, and 1/2 t nutmeg to suit my tastes.

This banana bread was very, very yummy!  I made one loaf and it was done cooking in the minimum time called in the recipe.  I trimmed it down a bit by using 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar, and using some whole wheat white flour and it didn't matter, it was incredibly good.

This is the best banana bread I have ever made!!  It is moist and delicous.  I only added a few chocolate chips because I was afraid what my hubby would say.  The chips make it very tasty and more like a dessert.  The next batch I will make will have one loaf with chips for  me and the other plain for my husband!!  Great recipe

This recipe is fabulous. I did as others and combined brown sugar and white sugar in addition to adding vanilla. A tip for easier cutting, I briefly refigerated the bread and it cut beautifully.

WOW!!! What a winner!!! I used butter instead of shortening. The smell is heavenly when slicing.  This is a keeper!!! I love bananas and chocolate so this was pperfect for me. I did do as others said and cut the chocolate chips in half...that was more than enough. GREAT recipe!!!

Yum! I halved the recipe to make muffins... though I think they taste more like cupcakes. So moist and delicious! Per some other reviewers I used butter instead of shortening, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, added 1 t vanilla, and used mini-chocolate chips. Such a delicious flavor... I’ve never used mayonnaise while baking, but it works! Thanks Betty for a great recipe!

Wonderful banana bread!  I made 12 muffins (baked in 30 mins.) and 24 mini muffins (baked in 20 mins.) I followed recipe exactly, execpt I omited the chocolate chips and the nuts.  The muffins browned beautifully and formed a crisp crust with a tender, moist center.  Thanks!

We were a little hesitant to try this because of the mayonnaise.  We weren't sure if Vegannaise would work, but it did and this was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is truly excellent!  I have made a number of different recipes (several from this site), and this is (so far) my favorite.  Usually banana bread is great right out of the oven but dense and sticky the next day and unpalatable by the third day... this just kept getting better. I'm a fan! Thank you SO much! Btw, I used butter instead of shortening and mini chocolate chips instead of the big ones (helped with the texture, too).

My kids wolfed this down... my husband has declared no other banana bread will be made in this house unless it's this one. Yeah, they liked it :) The only thing I changed is I used baking soda instead of powder, because I was out :)

This bread is delicious, but it is sweet.  In my opinion it's much more like a dessert than a breakfast bread.  I left out the nuts, and it was fine.

This bread was sooooo good!  I skipped the chocolate chips and walnuts (didn't have them) and cut the recipe in half to make one loaf and it was a beautiful bread!  Definitely my new favorit banana bread and can't wait to try it with the chocolate chips!

This is an awesome recipe as is. Moist and deliciious. It is forgiving if you have a few less bananas, and I have even sub'd oil for the butter/shortening if I am low on butter . Chocolate in banana bread is a staple here now!

This is delicious and highly addictive!  The recipe is also very forgiving.  I did as others suggested and used unsalted butter instead of the shortening.  I also used dark chocolate chips, and increased the amount.  I accidentally started putting the bananas/mayo mixture in before the eggs, but it still worked out fine.  I did a half recipe, and put them into a jumbo muffin pan (made 6 jumbo muffins).  Took about 27 minutes for them to get to the perfect done-ness.  Will definitely make these again!!!

This has been my go to recipe for years. My only change to has been to use unsalted butter in place of the shortening, and I only use whole wheat flour.  This is amazing stuff! Thanks for the recipe RETROJUNKIEHEART!

I have made this several times and usually in muffin form so we can have some at home and I can also share at work.  Change bake time to about 20-25 mins as muffins.  I do omit the nuts because I am the only one in the house that likes them.  Always gets rave reviews for sure! Thank you!

Not enough bananas in your kitchen: use coconut milk. This is a fantastic recipe for banana bread. It was moist, not to dense not too fluffy, and the perfect banana:chocolate:nuts ratio. I did make a few changes like everyone else: butter instead of shortening, pecans instead of walnuts because that’s what I had, and only 3 bananas (also because that’s what I had) , but added half a cup of coconut milk (which is not straight liquid), to substitute the lack of bananas.

Delicious! I used coconut oil instead of shortening, added a few spoonfuls of ground flax seed, and only put in about 2/3 of the sugar it called for. With the chocolate chips, it was plenty sweet. I left out the salt and mayo and it still tasted fine.

Used butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Cooked for 50 min- PERFECT!

This is my 'go to' recipe for this bread. I started making this recipe a few years ago and my family LOVES it. October of each year is when I start baking and this is one of the first things I am asked to bake. Recipe is awesome and I didn't change a thing. I do however bake my bread in stone-wear, makes it so much better.

2 PANS!!!!  I am somewhat new to baking and wife told me i need to split it up.  It did not say that in the recipe or even what size pan to use and not only do i have to admit the wife was right, but now i have a huge mess to clean up.  I am sure the banana bread is delicious but i am soo mad right now about no where it saying put into two pans.  "Cut loaf in the pan" implies singular pan.

YUM!  I also did a couple of substitutions - butter for the shortening & Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise.   Also, I used 1 c. of brown sugar and 1 c. of white instead of 2 c. of white sugar.  Turned out terrific and getting rave reviews.   I think next time I might try some applesauce for the butter and reduce the sugar amounts.  Give it a try!

Already posted that this was delicious, however after reading other comments I tweaked it a bit. I used butter instead of shortening (didn't have any), 1 cup white and 1 cup of dark brown and I dusted the chocolate chips on flour so they wouldn't sink. Makes three regular size loafs of yummyness!

I have made this recipe over a dozen times in the last few years, and for some reason I keep hoping I am going to make it work. The batter is unbelievably delicious, and I love the addition of mayonnaise to keep it moist. What never seems to work for me is the cooking temp/time. Just now I baked it for only 40 minutes and the outside is a burnt mess and the inside is runny and uncooked. And . . . this is the 4th oven I've tried to make it in, so I'm assuming it's not an oven error. Arrgh!

I made this today, as my kids have been begging for banana bread and I wanted to try a new recipe. The flavor was good, but it was dry. My oven typically cooks SLOW... But this puppy was boarderline overcooked at 50 minutes. It also fell... I bake a lot, so it wasn't over mixing. Not sure I'd make it again.

This is the BEST recipe for Banana Chocolate Chip Bread. The only changes that I made was what the other reviewers suggested. I used butter in place of shortening and I added a tsp of vanilla extract. I also used a square shaped muffin pan and baked for 20min. It was super moist and so good. Both my kids loved it.

First time I made it...fell in love with it.  Second time I added my ideas of dried cranberries, raisins and used 2 c flour, and 1 c Teff flour.  I only had 3 bananas so I added 1/2 c of fresh ground peanut butter.  For sugar I used 1 c turbinado, 1/3 c molasses, 1/8  honey.  Great recipe T12GR!

Love this recipe. I found that I can halve it and still make two loaves. When I made one, it overflowed.  I use butter instead of shortening and I may use a few more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for! Delicious. :)

Moist and delicious. To make it healthier, I used 70% whole wheat flour for two of the cups (next time, I'll probably use it for all the flour), cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and the oil to 2/3 cup, while using an extra banana to replace it. My kids don't love nuts in their bread, so I omitted the walnuts and used a little more chocolate chips. This is satisfying and kid-friendly.

I did follow some changes suggested in the reviews and did  half butter, half sour cream and half white and half brown sugar.  Even making those changes, it turned out very moist and everybody loved it.   I will be making it again.  Also the suggestion of tossing the choc. chips in a little flour to keep them from sinking worked as well!  With my oven it baked at the lower time limit.  Thanks for a good recipe!!

Everyone loves this chocolate chip banana muffins! I like to do mini muffins (approx 8-9mins) or regular muffins (14mins) and they turn out perfect.
I like to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg like someone else said. and I cut the sugar down to 2/3 of what the recipe calls for and it's still sweet due to the chocolate chips.
Oh, and freeze those ripe bananas! When you are ready to bake, defrost it and use all the juice and the bananas in the recipe and they turn out so moist and delicious!!

So moist and yummy. TUrned out great.  I only had 1 loaf pan, so I put the rest of the batter into muffin tins.  They took about 18 minutes in the oven.

I love doubling the batch and freezing the muffins. I make a couple mini loaves to eat right away. I also add an extra banana or two if I have them. I also use dark chocolate chips. These are great!

I only had 4 bananas so I added a huge tablespoon of sourcream.  Turned out excellent.  The bread gets its sweetness from the chocolate chips! I loved it! And my house smelled amazing while it was cooking and afterwards! Will be a new banana bread favorute

This was really good. I made the mistake of trying to make the batter all fit in one bread loaf pan. Definitely will use 2 next time. It came out soggy in the middle, but other than that it was great. I used 3 bananas.

Oh for the love of my waistline!!!  So delicious and like everyone else I used butter in place of the shortening and also added half brown sugar!  Mini chips because that's what I had on hand.  Very moist and flavorful!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Really good recipe. I don't like shortening except in very limited circumstances, so I used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 butter. Other than that, it is great on its on. I do recommend the mini chocolate chips, they distribute more evenly in baked goods.

Easy and delicious! I didn't have any mayo so I skipped that but it was still very moist. I also subbed butter for the shortening. Other than that everything I followed exactly. I will be making this again and again! LOVED it

My go-to banana bread. Made 1/2 batch (1 loaf); used butter instead of shortening,  added pecans since we prefer this. Used 1/2 dark choc and 1/2 regular choc chips. Baked on 350 for about 65-70 min and was perfectly done. I also like it with a few shakes of cinnamon in it. 
I have found that a whole recipe (comfortably) makes 2 1/2 loaves, bakes better this way (about 55-60 min on 350), so I make 2 to give away and a smaller one for myself :)

Absolutely delicious and moist.  I have been using a sour cream  banana bread recipe for years.  I wasn't sure about trying out something new especially this recipe because I thought Mayonaise was an odd ingredient but I am glad I did.  I also subbed unsalted butter for the shortening and sprinkled a little sugar/cinnamon dust in the pan before pouring in the mixture.  MMM so good

I use this recipe to make banana bread muffin. I use 1.5 cups sugar, and instead of walnuts, I use Reese's peanut butter chips. It is always a huge success when I bring some to share at work. :)

I love this recipe! I substituted butter instead of shortening as I don't keep shortening in the house. It's deliciously moist, and it freezes well! I'll be making these into muffins as well!

This bread is absolutely delicious!  I was unsure if I would like the chocolate chips in the banana bread, but it is very good and very addictive.  I cut the recipe in half to use up three bananas and mine was perfectly done at the 60 minute mark.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Ridiculously good.  I  cut the recipe in half to make a single loaf, but  kept the 1/2 cup of walnuts.  I think the nuts are important - this recipe is SO moist that the nuts add some important texture.  I baked mine for about 60 minutes, and it could have used another 10 to 15.  Hard to imagine this getting dry from baking too long.  Make this.

After reading all of the reviews, I to use one cup of butter, skipped the mayonnaise, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and since I don't like very sweet breads, I only added one half cup of brown sugar, but next time I'll probably do 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also used the mini chocolate chips and dusted them in flour so that they wouldn't sink to the bottom worked perfectly thank you. I made muffins and only needed to bake them for about 20 minutes. They were a hit!
Thanks for sharing.

I used butter instead of shortening. I used spray canola oil to 'grease' the loaf pan. I halved the recipe for just one loaf, and I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any. It  came out very moist and tasty, def a keeper. It seemed to get hard, almost overcooked so to speak on the sides and corners, not sure whats causing that. cooked for 65minutes or so.,

This recipe is AMAZING. Though I make this recipe as muffins, rather than loaves. The recipe makes such a dense, moist batter, so my loaves never fulled cooked! Try muffins - makes a double batch. Just cook them at the same temp for 30 mins :)

Easy to follow, great fluffy texture for banana bread.  I subbed the shortening for butter and used Japanese mayo.  It really helps to blend it til it's fluffy.  Added nutmeg, vanilla & cinnamon.  Family & guests loved it.

I make this bread ALL. THE. TIME. It's so good! The only things I change are to substitute half or all of the shortening for Greek yogurt, and cut the sugar in half. It always turns out super rich and plenty sweet enough. Great way to use up all those frozen bananas I have! Everyone always loves it - gifts for neighbors, treats for friends who just had babies, snack for small group meeting with friends from church, or a little something to bring stopping by at my husbands grandparents. No one ever says no to this bread! It's great with Melt coconut spread and a glass of cold milk! Make it today!

This bread is very moist and easy to make if you have a stand mixer. I did add some cinnamon and vanilla extract ( 2 tsp each). I took the advice of one reviewer and cooked on 325 for 70 minutes to make sure that center was done and the outside didn't burn.  I also dusted the pan with powdered cocoa and the chocolate chips with flour to prevent sticking.  It was very good. UPDATE!!!!!  Wait a day or so to eat the bread if possible. The banana flavor with come out stronger and it will taste even better.

Similar to some of the other reviewers, I also swapped the shortening for butter! I also left out the walnuts as I'm not a huge fan and added a dash of vanilla, for safe measure. This bread is absolutely delicious. I wish it didn't make as much, but I'm always nervous to cut any baking recipe in half, as I've had that backfire! I use this recipe to make 1 loaf and make muffins with the rest.

This is the best banana bread ever. I use butter for the shortening and omit the nuts due to allergies in our family. I have made the recipe many times. My grandson who is 7 requests that I make this for dessert as it is his favorite.

This is the best banana bread recipe i have ever used! It is so soft and fluffy! Thank you for sharing this! I want to add that after reading some of the comments, i as well used butter instead of shortening , and i also added about a table spoon or so of vanilla , and left out the walnuts. But absolutely fantastic banana bread! Love it!

Delicious! I sub butter for the shortening every time I make it and it turns out awesome! When I make it in cupcake tins I use mini chocolate chips. My husband and co-workers beg for seconds and thirds!

Super moist banana bread! I have made it twice now and both times it came out utterly delicious. Don't omit the mayo, it makes it so moist and you can't even tell it's there. The only change I made was to sub half the shortening for butter, and add a tsp of vanilla extract. It's now my go-to banana bread recipe!

Excellent.  I made it as directed except used white whole wheat flour, and instead of the one cup shortening I used 1/2 cup butter and added one extra banana (so 7 bananas total--I had a lot of them!).  It was fantastic.  Very rich and moist and did not taste "low-fat" at all, but also didn't have that greasiness that some banana breads have. I took it to work and people raved about it.

This is amazing! I omitted the nuts and added 1 cup frozen blackberries.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins and ALL were gone by the next day.  Very moist on the inside and crispy tops. Will defiantly be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recepie.

OMG... Best banana bread I have ever made.  Like many others I used butter instead of shortening.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, otherwise I followed the recipe..  Made a dozen muffins and 50 mini muffins.  Due to the mini muffins I did use the mini chocolate chips.  Omg... yummmmm.  I gave some to friends and they all asked for the recipe.  Cant wait for my next bunch of bananas to expire.  LOL

Banana Bread was fabulous.  Very moist and flavorful.  The only thing I did different was I put 1 tablespoon of mayo and 1 tablespoon of sour cream.  So good.  Definitely will make this again.

I will admit my sins upfront: I halved the recipe, used 4 way way overripe bananas, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, used half white and half brown sugar, and used salted butter because that's all I had. I also used white chips because I was out of chocolate  chips.  This made 24 mini muffins and I filled the cups full. They puffed up nicely, plus I still had a bit of batter leftover (which I tossed, didn't want to mess with it).
Anyway, these are really tasty! Not overly sweet, moist, not too banana-y.
I want to try these again and add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg, because for some reason it seems to be lacking .... I don't know...something.
I want to add, I've never made banana bread before. When I added my mashed bananas, the mixture looked almost curdled. If anyone else sees that, don't worry, everything turns out fine. It just looks gross for a minute.
This is a really easy recipe, too!

This is my go to banana bread recipe and it never disappoints! I have been making it for about 1 year and it is amazing every time! So moist and flavourful! The changes I made: 2 teaspoons of milk, instead of mayo (too scared to try it with mayo), butter instead of shortening, no nuts (so  add about another 1/4 cup of chocolate chips) and some 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the wet mix and cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry mix. I've deleted my other banana bread recipes because this one's just perfect!

Not the very best banana bread recipe I've tried, but awfully good. I used 1/2 cup veg oil and 1 stick butter because I didn't have shortening. Used 2 cups of choc chips which is great if you are chocolate dependent.  Would use again and probably try adding sour cream too as another reviewer suggested. Would very much recommend.

epic fail.  took longer to bake than expected. outside ugly, overcooked.  inside still wet.  covered it so prevent it from getting too dark (fail).   not sure if I can slice it and save it snacks.  surely cannot present it as a whole loaf.  will not make this again.

I only made 1/2 the recipe and it made 5 mini loaves. I cooked them for 33 minutes. I used butter, not shortening. I added a teaspoon of Nutella and used 1/3 c semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/3c white chocolate chips. I didn't have any nuts. It was delicious & moist. I will make again!

I make cookies out of this recipe and the only thing I changed was the use of butter instead of shortening and I added oatmeal to firm up the batter.  Can't keep them in the house.  I am forever buying bananas.

This is a great recipe!!! I used butter instead of shortening, miracle whip instead of mayonaise (didn't have mayo at home), pecans instead of walnuts, and doubled the amount of chocolate chips. It turned out perfect. I will make this again in the future.

This recipe is terrific! I'm not an avid baker, but I have tried to make banana bread a few times. Each time I was disappointed...until now. I used 1cup of butter, 1/2 cup coconut oil, and 1/2 cup apple sauce as a substitute for the shortening. I also added cinnamon and vanilla and baked it in muffin tins. Wonderful recipe!

This was the most fabulous Banana Bread I have ever made. My kids loved it, and couldn't get enough, and I shared at a neighborhood picnic, and now I am getting requests for making this bread. The ONLY addition I made was add a tsp of Vanilla, because everything is better with vanilla :D, and sprinkled Chocolate chips on top per my 5 year olds request, and I used butter rather than shortening (because I never have shortening)! Other than that this recipe is perfectly moist and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing!

I just made 72 mini-muffins from this recipe and they are delicious! They are great for after school snacks and lunchbox treats.  FYI, I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized because of the mini-muffin size.

This is good, moist and tasty, but it's definitely more cake-like. If you're wanting an afternoon "something" with that cuppa, then you won't be disappointed. I sprayed my tins with pam and I had no trouble getting them out of the pans; they literally just slid out. I did substitute butter for shortening and halved the butter quantity by half and used half apple sauce - wondering if that made it cake-like? No other problems, loaves held their shape up nicely when cut. Thanks!

This is the ONLY recipe I use for banana bread. I love it & always get a ton of compliments on it. It's a bit of a sweeter bread, but so delicious. I use butter for any recipes that call for shortening. SO GOOD!

Spectacular, spectacular! I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar, 5 bananas (because I only had 5), about 2/3 c. choc chips (again, because that's all I had), and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Super delicious.

This recipe is great.  I did modify it slightly, though, based on the ingredients I had in the house, and it turned into being the best loaf I've made.  Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I did 1.5 cups of white sugar and 0.5 cups of brown sugar.  Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips I used milk chocolate chips.  Instead of mayo I used miracle whip and did 2 generous tablespoons of it.  I didn't add any walnuts, and I used 5 previously frozen bananas instead of 6.  I'll definitely make this again with these modifications.

I have been making various recipes from this site for the past six months and this is the first time I felt compelled to share my opinion...this is the best chocolate-chip banana bread I have ever had.  It is a moist, flavorful, fluffy and balanced bread.  The only departure I made from the recipe was to use one cup brown sugar and one cup Splenda as opposed to 2 cups of sugar.  My eight year old loved this because it was crunchy on top and moist and soft in the middle.  Perfect.

Used butter instead of shortening but made no other changes.  This bread was awesome.  My oldest nephew said it was amazing but to leave out the nuts next time!  (I rather enjoyed the nuts)

Like everyone else, used butter instead of shortening. Make sure you use all the chocolate chips otherwise increase the amount of sugar! I used less chocolate and it came out tasting like it could use more sugar, but other than that... really moist!

This is a beautiful and very moist banana bread. My daughter, who did not like bananas, could not stop eating this. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

P.S. I substituted the shortening with butter, used half white and half palm sugar, and did not use walnuts. This was a bit too sweet for my taste - but still really good though - so I would cut down the sugar a little bit next time.

This was delicious.  I swapped the shortening for butter as I didn't have shortening, but otherwise followed the ingredients exactly.
I followed the advice of another reviewer and put in in a bundt pan but it was too much batter. Next time, I will pour the extra batter into muffin tins.
Very delicious and moist.

So good!! I also used butter, only because I don't keep shortening on hand. I was worried the chocolate chips would be too much, but the small amount is just right. I only have one loaf pan, so I made a loaf (it's still cooling!) and a dozen muffins (which are nearly all gone). The texture is perfect - hard to find good banana bread recipes that aren't too dense or cakey. I was a banana short, so I threw in some unsweetened applesauce. Don't think that changed it much.

This was wonderful bread. Whether you bake exactly as stated or tweak for your taste it was moist and EXTREMELY scrumptious. My kids thought it was the best banana bread I have ever made...which I have tried a lot of recipes.

This recipe worked out great! I am happy that it makes two loaves because the first one is already gone! I think it is adaptable because I have made this recipe exactly as written and I have also made it with brown sugar and only 4 bananas because that's all I had on hand, and it still worked out beautifully.

I made 3 different recipes of banana bread in 3 days the first one was inedible the second was dry and the third (this recipe) was fantastic! moist and I followed it exactly just added in cinnamon.
I also raised the oven rack to the middle of the oven made a huge difference in how it cooked and didn't burn.

This recipe is amazing!  I substitute the mayo for a 7th banana to give it a pudding like texture and the shortening for butter.

Also I use parchment paper to line the pan vs using butter and flour.  A silicon pan works great too or reusable silicon muffin cups.  For the muffins it was easiest to use a large tipped piping bag and tip.  

Great hit with everyone!

Wonderful flavor. Nice and moist.  Used 1/2 baking shortening, 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. applesauce. Baked it in 5 mini loaves + 6 muffins.  Froze beautifully.  Will give as gifts for the Christmas Season.

This recipe is incredible!  I used butter instead of flour, and half the sugar, and added two teaspoons of vanilla.  I baked the entire recipe in a bundt pan for 60 minutes and it turned out amazingly moist and flavourful.

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because I do not use shortening and used butter instead.  Change this to butter and it is a 5 star.  Very moist and delicious.  I have never really enjoyed banana bread before but this recipe has changed my mind.  This is a great recipe to use when you have overripe bananas to use up.

My 7 and 15 year old daughter just baked this and it was very easy for them to follow.  They were hesitant about the mayo but added it anyways.  It turned out delicious.  Very yummy.  I'm sure they'll be baking this for Grandma and Aunties!!  
Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy!! It was really moist and delicious. When I stirred in the chocolate chips I didn't think that there was enough, so I added in about another 1/8-1/4 of a cup. It was definitely chocolately enough!

This is a delicious recipe!  My 11 year old son ate 3 slices, which is shocking for him!

I halved the recipe and made it in 4 small loaf pans (that way I could do 2 small loaves with nuts and 2 small loaves without - I wanted to try it both ways and the kid doesn't like nuts).

Changes I made:  changed the sugar to 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown, omitted the mayo (I didn't have any), added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I also added just a smidge more chocolate chips, and in the loaves with nuts I used pecans instead of walnuts.

I personally liked the shortening.  It's handy too because you don't have to wait for the butter to soften.  This is a great recipe and I'll definitely be making this many more times!

This bread was so delicious and moist.  I halved the recipe because I only needed 1 loaf.  I also dusted my pan with cinnamon and subbed sour cream for mayo because it was all I had.  Otherwise, I made it as is.  It took about 60 minutes to cook completely.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe became our family's favorite! Both kids (age 9 and 2) love it as well as all the adults. When I need to make a dessert for a gathering - this is the first option, as it never fails! Although, I usualy make it without wallnuts... Thank you for the recipe! LOVE IT!

Great recipe.  I did change a few things.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I also used organic whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.  And I added an extra cup of chocolate chips...Yummy!!!

I had heaps of frozen bananas that I needed to use. I made this recipe as it was listed. It turned out perfectly!!! I baked it in a large cake pan and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes. I can't wait to make it again!

Perfect just the way it is!  Moist and tasty.  I didn't put walnuts in because some people I know don't like nuts so I added a bit more chocolate chips... Perfect!

This is the BEST banana bread although I think it's almost more of a dessert.  I would say you have to cook it closer to the 75 minutes to have it come out as a cuttable bread.  I cooked for 60 minutes and even after setting I ended up eating it with a fork because it would just fall apart.  However, that doesn't make me rate it any less!  It was DELICIOUS like that...so moist!  Next time I have some I'll try warming it up and then topping with a scoop of icecream and some hot fudge.  Definitely a DESSERT banana bread!  YUM

Best banana bread ever.  I did as people suggested and used butter instead of shortening and used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar with a splash of vanilla.  Does make alot, kids LOVE it!  Gave this in mini loaf pans as gifts to the neighbors for Christmas, they all called for the recipe.

Awesome recipe, I make this on a weekly basis.  I don't add the nuts but instead add extra chocolate chips.  I also use one cup of demarara sugar and one cup of golden caster sugar instead of using white sugar.  I do not have loaf tins so I split the mixture between two 8" cake tins and bake for 45 mins.

This recipe is so YUMMY!! I used half of the recipe in a 9x5 loaf pan & used the the half to make muffins [made about 14 muffins].  I used butter instead of shortening, added a dash of vanilla extract & sprinkled a bit of cinnamon in to the mix, & also left out the walnuts. The taste was PERFECT! So moist!  Will definitely make this again & again! *Have added a picture - #10 picture

AMAZING!  TERRIFIC!  Prolly the best banana bread recipe I've ever eaten!  I ended up using a smidge too many chocolate chips but not by much.  I also substituted the walnuts with pecans.  Fabulous recipe with or without the add ins :)

I subbed applesauce for mayo and 1/2 cup shortening.  The other 1/2 cup shortening I subbed butter.     Shortening is awful for you so DO NOT use it! Fabulous recipe! LOVE LOVE LOVE it!

Delicious! I made several changes based on other reviews and it turned out fabulous! I substituted butter for shortening, cut the white sugar in half and added a cup of brown sugar, added a teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon, used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour, omitted the walnuts and added an extra 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. I also baked in a bundt pan greased and dusted with cinnamon and sugar at 350 degrees for an hour and 20 minutes. It was super moist and was quite a treat warmed with melted butter! Mmm!

Wonderful banana bread recipe!  The only change I made was that I followed the previous reviews and used butter instead of shortening.  I will most certainly make this one again!

Just like all of the other reviews, I have to say this is fantastic. Easy, delicious and so moist. I used butter as well in place of shortening and it turned out fine!

I have made a lot of Banana Bread over the last 30+ yrs. and this is by far the Best!!! The only thing I changed was used apple sauce instead of mayo and no walnuts. I made 12 muffins and the rest in a bundt pan. Everyone (family and co-workers) loved it!

This is excellent. I followed the recipe for the most part, using 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. It has a yummy taste and texture, and I like the fact that it uses a lot of bananas.

This recipe taste fantastic! I made some more bread today, instead of shortening I used butter. WOW, it is mouth watering good. I also liquified some sugar in water. Using a pastry brush, coated the top of each loaf. Then sprinkled chocolate chips on it and let it dry before serving.  Thank you Tl2GR for your recipe.  Mr Mom

Wow!  The most moist and flavorful banana bread I've ever had.  The only change I made was substituting butter for shortening.  I baked this in a metal bread pan for 60 minutes and it came out perfectly!  A definite keeper!!!

So rich and moist!!  I made one loaf for my family and it was gone after breakfast, and I brought the other loaf to work and it was gone well before noon.  I made another batch, one loaf for my family and one to freeze for another time, I am curious as to how well it will freeze.

A very moist bread, the more ripe the bananas the moister the bread will be.

This is an outstanding recipe that is not to sweet and very moist.  If you don't have mayo try cream cheese or sour cream same great results.

I was very sceptical of this recipe because of the banana/chocolate combination.  Man, was I wrong!  This is absolutely delicious!  I'm going to make another batch and roll it into 1-inch balls while still warm, chill them and then dip them in melted chocolate like the cake bites/balls are done.  Scrumptious!!!

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of other users and used 1/2 brown sugar (and also reduced the white sugar to about 3/4 cup), used butter instead of shortening and added vanilla. I also had no mayonnaise on hand (my husband hates mayonnaise and won't let me have it in the house!) so used yogurt instead. This turned out so great as mini-loaves! Thanks for the recipe. Gave it 4 stars because of the consistent suggested changes but really with the changes it is truly a 5-star recipe. Much fluffier and lighter than many soggy banana bread recipes.

4.5 stars for me :) It was delicious! Soft on the inside, moist and great texture, with a crisp outside. I did follow someone else's suggestion and used half brown, half white sugar, swapped the shortening for butter and about 1 tsp vanilla extract. My family absolutely LOVED it! The only minor problem I had, was that the outside got a little too browned. Nevertheless it was DELICIOUS. I will most definitely be making this again soon.

Wonderful! I could only scrounge up 5 bananas and I used "butter flavored" shortening. It still turned out extremely moist and my family is raving!

My son recently returned from the military and raved about a chocolate chip banana bread, after the rave reviews I tried it and was so surprised.  This was so easy to prepare, and my military son couldn't believe that I duplicated the recipe he has grown to love! : )

like others just used butter instead of shortening, everything else was kept the same.  Amazing!!!  I have made muffins, mini muffins, and loaves, all have turned out great.  I do use mini chocolate chips. Made for a playgroup, and moms and the kiddos ate every last muffin! Thank for sharing this recipe.

Delicious.  Moist, easy to make - great recipe.  Thanks.
11/12/18 - I needed to come back and re-review.  This has become my go-to banana bread recipe.  It gets rave reviews every time I make it.  It's also great when you have a LOT of bananas to use up from the freezer.  I've tried other recipes, but this is consistently the best.  Thank you!
2/17/20 - STILL the best banana bread recipe out there.  Uses up a ton of bananas, makes two loaves, and is very versatile.  I've added chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, fruit, orange juice, marshmallows, walnuts (not all at the same time) and it's ALWAYS good.

This is the BEST banana bread I have ever had.  I halfed the recipe and only made one loaf.  I too used butter instead of shortening.  This bread would still be great without the chocolate chips.  Very moist.  I sprayed the pan and then used cocoa instead of flour to coat the pan.  This is my new favorite sweet bread!

extremely tasty!!  used mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter.  it was difficult to slice and stay together so maybe muffins would be a better choice.  i halved the recipe and with my oven i cooked it 55 minutes.  will definitely make this alot!  thanks!!!!

Wow! I had a hard time not devouring it on the spot! Both breads (I put it in two bread pans as directed) were completely gone within three days! I omitted the walnuts, but it still tasted amazingly moist and delicious. Thank you so much (:

Sooo Delicious! Made it for a meeting at work and my co-workers devoured it in record time and are asking for more. I substituted the shortening for butter and added 1tsp of vanilla. Thank you!

This was a great recipe. I replaced the shortneing for butter, did not put any mayonnaise as I didn't have any and replaced the walnuts for crushed almonds and it still turned out great! I recommend cutting the recipe in half because it does make alot.  Great recipe:)

The best i"ve ever made! Very light and fluffy, made it exactly as says with the exception of a dash of cinnamon.  Next time i will substitute with butter and use whole wheat flour. I'm sure it will be great!

Very easy and delicious!  I didn't have choc chips so I substituted raisins.  I also don't use shortning and used smart balance baking butter instead and organic whole wheat flour.  I was surprised at how yummy it was even with my healthier changes.

I used butter because shortening is not very easy to find here. Omitted the walnuts as well.  This was the best banana bread I've ever had (sorry, mom!) I will be making this again very soon!

Delicious!!! I used butter, cut out the nuts and added extra chocolate chips. I cooked it in a 9x12 pyrex pan and it was wonderful. A friend suggested using mini chocolate chips so that they stayed suspended better... interesting thought.

Yum! I made two slightly smaller loaves so I had enough left over for a few muffins - they were good too and only took about 20 minutes to cook. I did use the shortening (butter flavored) and it turned out fine!

Best choc chip banana bread ever!! Perfectly moist! I added vanilla, substitued room temp butter, finely chopped the walnuts, used the mayo and sprinkled the pan with sugar and cinnamon, with some addt'l walnuts and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top and it came out amazing! I made one loaf and meant to check on it in an hour, and it was in for just a tad too long, but still amazing! My search for the perfect banana bread/choc chip recipe is over :)

Very good, and  not at all difficult. Watch for burning at the end of the cooking time. I had to reduce my oven temperature to 325 about half way through. Even my daughter who claims not to like banana bread likes this. Thanks!

I "accidently" doubled the amount of chocolate chips, oops. It was great but next time I'll only add 50% more ;)
We love this recipe. Tonight we made it into muffins and used mini chocolate chips. Delicious!

Yum. Upped the chocolate chips and walnuts. Otherwise, made according to recipe. Makes enough to keep one loaf at home and send one to work.

Unbelievably good! This is my first time baking banana bread with chocolate chips, and I'm so glad I tried it! Used some reviewers' tips, such as: used mini semi-sweet chips, replaced 1/4 c. of butter with sour cream, added 1 banana, added cinnamon & vanilla, and replaced 1/2 of white sugar with brown. Cooked in mini-loaf pans for about half the time (30-35 minutes), and voila! Perfect for gift-giving, if they last long enough!

This was delicious!  I used chocolate chunks and added much more than the recipe called for so it had to cook longer, but it turned out great.  Very moist and flavorful!

Delicious!! Tastes just like my grandma's recipe - moist, flavorful, and just the right amount of sweetness! I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar instead of just all white, and butter instead of shortening. 40 mins. was just perfect! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Before I found this recipe, I always tried a different recipe each time I made banana bread.  Now this is the only one I use.  It is great just how it is.  My husband and children just love it!

I am a brand new cook, who usually manages to mess up most things I try!  This recipe was simple and delicious!  A huge hit, everyone loved it.  I did follow the advice of other reviews by substituting butter for shortening, and half brown/half white sugar.  I also only cooked it for 40 minutes, and that was perfect.

I just keep making it and making it.  Always very good!  I use butter, just because I never have shortening.  In the past I have added a pear and plain yogurt, and I tend to go heavier on the chocolate and nuts.  I've made it as muffins, loaves, bundt -- big hit!

This is GREAT recipe. I'm always bored by regular banana bread and the choco chips gave it that extra satisfying sweetness. Some modifications (past suggestions plus my own) that worked out great: didn't use any mayo or mayo sub, mixed all dry ingredients plus choco chips/nuts THEN added to wet mix, used half brown half white sugar, upped walnuts to equal chips, chopped chips so choco would not overpower flavor, subbed butter for shortening, 20 min in muffin tins at 400 degrees made a crispy top and moist inside. The chocolate made it pretty desserty so I might go easy on the chips next time. But overall DELISH!

I bake this bread all the time, it is a hit at my office! Like others, I add cinnamon and a dash of pumpkin spice for a little spice. Instead of chocolate chips I grate 2 bars of dark chocolate (preference.) Its smoother than the chips. If I am feeling lazy I use 1 cup mini semi-sweet chips. But I do love this recipe!

This is a really good quick bread, although I must admit I wasn't that impressed with it hot out of the oven. But the next day it was wonderful! It's the only quick bread I've ever enjoyed more cold than right after baking.

Awesome, there is no other way to make banana bread. I would suggest adding 2 TBSNs of Cocoa powder for a darkened more chocolate coloring. Yummy!

Not my favorite banana bread recipe, at all.  It had a strange consistency and the sweetness was different.  I will find a different recipe next time.

I wanted a moist banana bread recipe and this one worked out well. I was a little iffy about adding mayonnaise to banana bread, but I used it anyways. I also replaced the shortening for butter and instead of using the full amount of butter substituted some for sour cream. My chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the bread but other than that, it turned out well!

When I made it the bananas went to the bottom and the chocolate chips went to the top of the bread.  It was also a little dry but it really wasn't as bad as I'm making it sound.

This is very tasty!  I made a few changes:  whole wheat flour, brown sugar (ran out of white), caramel/chocolate chips (all I had), 5 bananas, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and baked at 325 for about 75 minutes.  It came out perfectly!  In both my silicone pan and my glass pan it had just a little bit of crispy crust, and nice and moist, but not soggy inside.  It's a nice, light bread - not heavy.

Delicious bread that my husband can't get enough of!  My only complaint is that it's so moist that it doesn't come out of the loaf pan very easily.  I usually end up with a chunk of bread stuck to the bottom of the pan!  Despite that, it's so incredibly moist and delicious, I can't really complain!

This bread is very moist and delicious!  I will continue to make this bread for my family as they all enjoyed it.  I only made two slight changes to the recipe; I used mini chocolate chips and pecans instead of walnuts.  It took about 60 minutes for mine to cook completely.  I'll admit that the I thought the mayonaise was a bit odd, in my opinion but, I think that plays a big part in keeping it so moist.

Fantastic.  Moist and tasty, with a good banana flavor.  I used slightly less sugar than recommended, and the result was perfect (not too sweet, but still scrumptious).

was great but I made several changes. used just 5 bananas, added 1 tspn vanilla and also added 1 tspn each: cinnamon, mace, allspice, cloves. Cut sugar by 1/3 cup so it wouldn't be overly sweet! Everyone at thanksgiving dinner raved about it.  Particularly happy that the cake wasn't a dense banana bread.

I followed other reviewers advice and used butter in place of shortening and did half white sugar and half brown,and substituted pecans for walnuts... recipe turned out great, made muffins and loaf and both turned out nice and fluffy. Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmmm.....another yummy banana bread! I used the trans-fat free Crisco & mini choc chips. Like others have said, very moist & perfect! I accidently switched the amounts of BS & BP, but it turned out just how I like it- the top was not severely rounded- kind of flat. I did halve the recipe & put the oven on 325. Took about 65 minutes. YUM YUM!!! (oh- also used the new white whole wheat flour to be healthier- works just fine!)

Yeah - everything that all those other people said.  This really is delicious.  We used butter instead of shortening and went with one cup white/one cup brown for sugar, but I'm not sure it would really matter.  We made muffins, a loaf, and mini-loaves and all were excellent.

I made this recipe yesterday, it was the best banana bread I've ever made or had! I used mini loaf pans (it made 5) and put two of them in the freezer, as soon as I tried the bread I took the loaves out of the freezer since I knew we would eat through the other loaves fast. My little boy couldn't get enough!

After reading other reviews, I chose to use butter instead of shortening.  The bread is delicious and super moist.  The milk chocolate chips I used tasted so good too!

Great recipe!  I halved it and still got 16 muffins out of this.  I used butter instead of shortening, and mini chips instead of regular due to personal preference, but these would have been very good as written also.  I've never been much of a baker, but these made a baker out of me!

This is a great recipe. I left out the nuts.  I used mini-choclate chips and it did not overpower the bread.  The bread came out really moist.  This was a big hit with my family.  Will use this recipe again.

A wonderful dessert! Easy to make even for this guy! I do agree with substituting butter for the shortening. I also bought the 3-1/2" X 8" 3pack of foil loaf pans and had enough mix for all three tins. Thanks a bunch Betty!

This banana bread is fool-proof. I've made it several times, and it always comes out great. I've also tried it without the chocolate chips, which I actually prefer. They can overpower the banana taste, which is the best part. Definitely a "keeper" recipe.

I made this with white chocolate chips.  The folks at work ate the whole thing.  They must have thought it was good or were very hungry.

I made this for my Mom on Mother's Day. She wasn't too fond of putting the chocolate chips in the recipe but soon found out how good it really was! For the most part, it's an easy recipe to make and very delicious!

Taste is excellent!  My only problem is that it's almost too moist, I can never get a good, clean slice.  However, my family doesn't seem to mind, they gobble it down, moist crumbs and all.  Definately more of a dessert, however some people like the sinful feeling of eating dessert for breakfast (or at least my son does).

Delicious...the perfect banana bread recipe!  Worked well for muffins too.  Baked them for ~1/5 hour at same temp.
