Wow, this is FABULOUS!  I've had this recipe sitting around for a while because I had difficulty finding savory (finally located it at Fresh Market). First time ever cooking pearl (Israeli) couscous which is totally different from regular couscous.  Even my DH who's not a couscous lover liked this. I was a little concerned that 1/2 cup almonds was going to be too much, but I was wrong.  The flavors really develop after chilling, so allow time for that. Please do yourself a favor, and don't change anything the first time you make this because IMO this recipe is perfect the way it's written. This is going into my Favorites folder.

Fantastic!  This is such an unexpected, intriguing, and delicious blend of flavors and textures.  I doubled this recipe and served it to 4.5 people (grandmother's a light eater) alongside grilled swordfish steaks and zucchini/summer squash -- so good on a warm evening!

This is a great recipe! I accidently misread it, and added in the celery, onions while the couscous was cooking, but it ended up great! The onions were sauteed with red peppers and the inside of a squash (left over veggies). Turned out great, def recommend!

I served this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  Instead of bouillon granules, I used a bit of chicken broth.  I also served at room temperature.  The spicy kick is a nice surprise and the as long as you dice your veggies well, the texture is exciting.  Enjoy!

The family was split on this one but, since I liked it, I gave it four stars.  I served it with grilled lemon chicken.  It needs to go with something rather bland because of its strong flavor.

This is the first time I used Israeli (Pearl) couscous, and I think I like it better than the regular couscous.  For the savory, I Googled a substitute and used a mixture of thyme, sage and marjoram.  The lemon zest in this dish really sets it off, also the nuts.  I used chicken base instead of bouillon granules and then added no extra salt.  I don't agree with other reviewers stating it tastes like Thanksgiving dressing/stuffing, it has it's own flavor apart from nothing else (IMHO).  I will make this again, it's a nice cold side dish with substance.

I made this for a ladies get together and everyone loved it, went back for seconds, and they all wanted the recipe.  I made it just as the recipe was written and will make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe!  The flavors blend together nicely, and it is quick to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the next time I make it, I will cut the chicken bullion in half.  This is definitely worth a try!

I have made it twice. It smells and tastes like Thanksgiving stuffing, but it's yeast free! I altered the recipe a bit. I looked up the substitute for savory and instead used 1/2 tsp dried thyme and 1/2 tsp dried sage. I added dried onion when I was cooking the couscous and omitted onion and tomato later. I used some lemon juice which I had on hand instead of the lemon zest. And I chopped whole almonds to the size of the cooked couscous and added them per the directions. I doubled the amount of extra virgin olive oil. I eat it both hot or cold. Yum!!! This will be my yeast free Thanksgiving alternative for sure!!!!

I was disappointed the first time I cooked this couscous; it was nothing like the other one that I was use too. Seriously considered throwing it out but this recipe came to rescue! I want to thank other reviewers for cooking suggestions made especially the suggestion to serve it with the lemon bake chicken recipe. Both were a hit eaten warm or cold.

Delicious mix of light and bright flavors! I also enjoyed the various textures. However, I could do without the raw onions.

We had never had couscous before, but the recipe sounded like a wonderful side for a tilapia dish I was serving; it was top-notch! Couscous was mega-expensive in the store, buying it on its own, so we bought a package of FAR EAST Couscous and threw out the sauce packet . . . there was plenty of leftovers, but what was left barely made it through the next day.

I made this for a potluck dinner and wasn't sure how it would turn out. I tripled the recipe and rather than use boulionne cubes, I cooked the couscous in chicken broth which worked out ok. I used a sweet onion that wasn't that sweet and ended up picking out most of it as the onion dominated the flavor. I think this would be good with lots of fresh parsley and either purple or green onion. I used lemon flavored olive oil and added the juice of one lemon. It was ok. It has potential but as written, I didn't like it all that much.
