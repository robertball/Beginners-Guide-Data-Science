This was delicious and so easy! My picky family loved it. I added a TBS of butter to the top before I put the top crust on. I also used half and half instead of whipping cream and low fat milk to save on calories. I'm looking forward to making it again.

I made this recipe last night. I had to add a bit more water to get the dough to ball. The thyme added great flavor. My husband said it was the best turkey pot pie he's ever had and reminded him of the pot pie from Kenny Roger's Roasters. Thanks so much for the recipe! Delicious!!

A very simple recipe that was a hit. I substituted marjoram for the oregano and added some pearl onions left over from Thanksgiving.  My sauce didn't seem to thicken, but it all turned out well.

Easy and delicious. All from scratch except for pie crust. The butter made it flaky. My husband loves it. Was able to use all my leftover turkey.
