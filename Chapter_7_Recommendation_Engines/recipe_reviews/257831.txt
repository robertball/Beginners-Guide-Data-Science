I found these to be 'chalky' tasting. I thought they needed to be sweeter. I could not taste the vanilla. Don't think I will make these again.

A panel of my friends agreed that eaten as a pudding there was an unpleasant aftertaste, yet frozen as a pop, the aftertaste seemed to disappear. Again, a good alternative for those that need to be or choose to go with a stevia product.

These were okay, but not sure I would make them again. The vanilla liquid stevia gave them a strange aftertaste. Otherwise, the recipe itself worked well and was simple to make.
