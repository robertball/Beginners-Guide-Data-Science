This was very good and easy to make but I had to make a couple small changes.  I didn't have any sweet pickles so I used sweet relish instead.  I guestimated the amt. at 1/4 cup, which may have been just a tad too much.  The recipe didn't state what size dill pickle to use (whole, half, spear) so I used two spears, which seemed fine.  This recipe makes A LOT so unless you have a really large family or plan to eat a lot of sauce, I would definitely recommend cutting the recipe in half.  This will last us for months, if the mayo keeps that long!

Great flavor, it's just abit too many ingredients to use this recipe on a regular basis. My kids eat more tarter sauce than fish.

This recipe is a well rounded, flavorful sauce. One thing you should know, this recipe makes a very large helping, so if you're only making 10 to 15 fish sticks, you're going to have A LOT leftover! I didn't have any olives at the time when I made this and the sauce still tasted great. One thing that has me excited about this recipe is it doesn't have that weird aftertaste that store bought, jar tartar sauce has.

This was pretty good and a nice change of pace from our usual sauce
