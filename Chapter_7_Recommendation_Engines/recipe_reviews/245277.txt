I made this for my best friends one who is from England but raised here and the other is a german country girl from central Texas. They loved it. Its a perfect combination of English breakfast meets big Southern breakfast. I skipped the mushrooms basil and mustard added onions fresh bell peppers and garlic! Its great with Jalape√±os.

A nice change up for breakfast. Easy and delicious. Always a good recipe to use up the left over holiday ham.
