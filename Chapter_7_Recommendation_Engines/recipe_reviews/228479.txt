Using fresh basil for this dish is a must.  It really makes the salad taste summery and crisp.  I didn't make any changes other than used black truffle oil instead of white (since that was all I had).  I liked the hint of earthy taste that the truffle oil provided but be careful not to use to much as it can be overpowering.  I served this with thinly cut French Bread.

I used frozen corn instead of canned corn for a more fresh taste.  If I were to make this again I would use white balsamic vinegar for a crisper look.  I would also serve this with toasted french bread instead of the buttered English muffin.  The flavors are good and just a bit different than the standard Caprese Salad.
