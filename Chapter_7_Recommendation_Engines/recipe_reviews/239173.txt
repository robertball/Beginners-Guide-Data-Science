This is what you call Baba Ganoush. The recipe I used calls for raw garlic but you had to mince it and add it as the last ingredient because if you add it with everything it would make the spread very overwhelming and slightly spicy. You have done the right thing to roast the garlic along with the eggplant to make it more mellow but yet have the flavor of garlic.

I modify everything to fit my inventory or budget.. Make this..its easy for a non writer like me.. I made it with 1 eggplant (what I had) and incorporated the pine nuts into the dish instead of a garnish. I thought it was amazing. I ate this with a cucumber... mmm mm
