Half of this recipe was just perfect in an 8x4" loaf pan. I lowered the heat to 325 degrees after some reviewers indicated they had trouble getting the cake to bake through without overbaking the exterior.  It was perfect, then, at 325 for about 60 minutes. I made this exactly as written, in spite of reviewer suggestions to add this or that. I didn't want to take away from the buttery, peachy taste--it was delicious. The sugar crust is a nice touch and I'm glad I included that too. I used frozen peaches, thawed and drained, and drizzled the baked loaf with a glaze of powdered sugar and the drained peach juice. Very pretty, moist cake, with a just right taste and speckle of peaches.

Good recipe!  I added a carmel glaze that made it even more delicious: 1/2 c. butter - 1/2 c. packed brown sugar - 2 tsp. milk - Heat all ingred. in saucepan, stir occasionally.  Boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Spoon over warm cake.  I will use this recipe for a pineapple pound cake next, using drained canned pineapple.  Thanks!

Oh my, I may be a Northern girl but I felt like I was back in the Old South sitting on someone's porch having a slice of this pound cake with a tall glass of Sweet Tea!  Yes, it's that good!  I cut the recipe in half, kept the amount of vanilla the same and used a little over a cup of peaches.  I baked it in an 8x4 glass baking dish and topped it with a generous amount of turbinado sugar. I put in the oven at 325 for exactly one hour. It was so incredibly moist, delicious, and bursting with peaches. I topped the cake slices with fresh cut peaches and homemade whipped cream.  The cake basically disappeared, but this is definitely a recipe I'd love to make again!

A perfect way to use ripe peaches!  The sugar coating on the pan gave a nice crunch to the outside of the cake.  I used a bundt pan and baked it about 1 hr 20 min, and had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan after letting it cool for about 15 minutes.  As with any pound cake, it is important to follow the directions and beat, beat, beat the batter after each addition (except the peaches, of course). Using a stand mixer works well for the beating.  I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter with the vanilla, and I think that helped bring out the flavor of the peaches.  I also dusted it with 10X sugar after it cooled.  The cake is delicious, especially when served with dark chocolate sauce.

This was a really good recipe.  I did alter it a bit.  I added 1.4 tsp. of almond extract and then 1/4 tsp. each of cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. ginger and ground cloves.  After the cake had cooled a bit, I poked holes in it with a toothpick and made a glaze of the syrup from a can of peaches and powdered sugar and then dusted it with powdered sugar just before serving.  This was a very nice change.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. I didn't have fresh peaches but I did have canned, so I chopped them up real fine and it came out great. Everyone loved it.

Perfect cake for Spring or Summer.  I live in GA, so I used fresh, ripe, sweet GA peaches.  Took this cake to a mother's meeting and it was gobbled up.  HELPFUL HINT:  To ripen the peaches more quickly, put them in a brown paper bag.  Close the top of the bag and poke holes in it.  Also, you can put an apple in there to speed the process, as well.

Great pound cake! Very easy to make. I greased and floured the pan instead of using butter and sugar to coat. Came out just fine! Thanks for the recipe!

This cake is excellent!!  I love buttery homemade pound cake.  This cake has a lot of flavor. The peaches added to the taste of the cake.  Fresh peaches are out of season where I live so I had to use can peaches.  This did not make a difference in how good the cake turned out.  I brought it to work and it went fast.

It tastes excellent!  I had to bake for 80 minutes, but it's rainy and humid here today.  Also, before I poured in the cake batter, I lined the prepared pan with 3/4 cup of toasted pecans.

After reading reviews I decided to lower the temperature to 325 degrees. I baked this in a Bundt Pan at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes. The cake rose up nicely while baking. My house smelled like peaches but it was well worth the wait because in the end I had a beautiful light colored peach pound cake. It was incredibly moist, delicious, and bursting with bits of peaches in every bite. I loved the specks of chopped peaches throughout the cake making it so pretty(see ny picture in the photo gallery). The outer crust has a sugary sweet crispy crunch, adds a really nice touch and I'm glad I included that. I drizzled a glaze over the cake with a mixture of the drained peach juice and powdered sugar. I also thought about topping it with fresh sliced peaches and homemade whipped cream with creamy rich vanilla ice cream. Since this cake is going with hubs to work to share with everyone I just used a little glaze. This lovely cake turned out pretty, moist, absolutely delicious...and PEACH-Y! A definite 5 stars plus and worth making again, and, with fresh slices of peaches, homemade whipped cream with a side of vanilla ice cream!

This was DIVINE!! Chocolate desserts seems to always be the fav in our family...but this is one of the first I've brought to a family gathering than went faster than the brownies! PLEASE don't skip the part where you coat the pan in sugar (i skipped the butter and just went for some PAM spray though). The sugar crystallizes onto the cake as it bakes making it unbelievably good! Also...be sure to let your butter (use butter not margarine please!) and your eggs come to room temp before getting started. Top with fresh peach slices and homemade whip cream. It's heaven on your fork.

I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate it, but here I go.  I increased the peaches to 3 cups, added 1/4 cup of sour cream, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 2 tsp Peach Schnapps and a pinch of Vietnamese cinnamon.  Of all the things not to have, I don't have a tube pan so I used two loaf pans.  Buttering and sugaring the pans made this even more special than it already was.  I think the recipe would have been perfect as it was written, I just can't leave anything alone.  It's a good thing I got a small slice right away because it was all devoured by my co-workers within minutes.  Everyone kept saying how rich and moist it was and not overwhelmingly sweet.  Thank you so much for a fabulous recipe that will be a staple. I'm thinking of trying it with cherries next.

followed the directions to a T, and it came out really good.  baked in a bundt pan and it's moist and tasty.  wish that the crust was a little firmer.  i would have given this 4 stars but it needs some sort of creamy topping on it to be absolutely delish!

Mmm Delicious! I split the recipe in 1/2 and baked in a 9"x6" pan for 57 min with no changes other than using white peaches(only kind i had on hand). I topped it with a broiled topping. The little bits if warm peach in the cake was like little pieces of heaven, and the cake itself was soft and light. Only change i'll make is doubling the amount of peaches next time. A new favorite, i will make this again and again! Thank you Dent! ***BROILED TOPPING RECIPE: Combine 4 tbsp butter with 1/3 cup sugar(brown or white). Stir in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, pecans, etc. Spread a thin layer of topping over fully cooked cake. Broil on high in oven for approx. 5 min, until sizzling and slightly golden brown. Enjoy!

Great pound cake recipe.  I used over-ripe necarines and some frozen peaches.  The first day I felt like it was lacking a peachy flavour, but it tasted more peachy the next day.  I added 1 teaspoon of lemon zest and 1 teaspoon of ground cardamon (my pound cake secret ingredient!) and used cinnamon sugar to dust the greased pan for the crispy crust.  I can't wait to try it with other fruits.

Outstanding pound cake!!    I used 3 cups of peaches and a dash of almond extract after reading reviews, but I don't think it needs anything else.   My family loved it, and I will be making it again and again.

Wow, this cake is awesome!  I baked this in two glass loaf pans at 325 for about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  The only thing I did different was to use shortening and sugar on the pans instead of butter and sugar.  I brought this to work for a coworker's birthday and it got rave reviews.

This recipe was awesome! I followed the directions and recipe exactly (except I used canned peaches--it took about one and a half 15 oz cans) and it made two loaves. Following other's directions, I baked them at 325 degrees for 60 minutes and they were perfectly done. The peaches did mostly sink to the bottom despite my coating them with flour, but honestly this did not stop me from devouring four pieces in about 15 minutes. Super moist and delicious!

The western slope of Colorado is also famous for its peaches and it is prime Palisade Peach season right now.  Based on some previous reviews I added about 1 cup additional peaches.  It was wonderful.  I also dusted the pan with a cinnamon and sugar blend instead of just sugar. Fantastic rich taste and it made for a fragrant house too.

This recipe is simply wonderful. Followed the recipe to a T with a few additions from some of the reviews. I added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and almond extract. Instead of  vanilla extract, I used vanilla bean paste. Coating the pan with sugar makes such a wonderful golden crust all over. I barely tapped off the sugar when coating my loaf pan. The key to this delicious recipe are having your eggs and butter at room temp., beating your sugar and butter until fluffy (very pale yellow color) , beating each egg throughly in the sugar and butter, and  gradually adding the sifted dry ingredients. I did mine in thirds. 1-2-3-4 recipe! Will make this again with more fresh peaches.

This cake tasted delicious and remained fresh for days. Be sure to chop the peaches super small. One half recipe is the perfect size for a loaf pan.

Made exactly as written in two loaf pans, and everyone loved it. The cake stays moist and delicious for days. The sugar on the pans really adds a nice touch, I'm sure I'll be applying the technique to other recipes too. The recipe states butter or margarine, I used half a cup of each but would be interested in trying it with all butter and seeing how the flavor changes. A first-rate recipe, thanks very much for sharing!

I was looking for a peach recipe because we had fresh peaches from the orchard. I found this one and decided to give it a go. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the outcome. I was expecting more flavor. I even followed other reviewers tips and added some freshly ground cinnamon and nutmeg. It was still quite bland. I felt as if we wasted good peaches. Two days later, 3/4 of the cake is still sitting on my counter...time for the trash bin. I'll look for other peach recipes in the future.

made this with left over peaches from picking and OMG... we took it to a church function and weight watchers followers went over their points for the week to eat it.  Will make again and again and I am going to experiment with different fruits... also I made it in two bread pans.

I had a lot of overripe fruit so I decided to make this cake. I used a combination of peaches and apricots - the apricots actually were tangier and tastier than the peaches. To make it a little healthier I substituted the butter with 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and no one could tell. Overall, a nice, moist cake, just a little bland. If I'd try it again, I'd use more fruit.

HEALTHY VERSION - reduce sugar to 1 cup in batter, plus 1-2 tablespoons sprinkled on top. Change white flour to 2.5 cups whole wheat plus 1/2 cup ground flaxmeal. Increase peaches to 3 cups. Increase baking powder to 2 teaspoons (because whole wheat flour is heavier than white). Baked in 9x13 for 35 minutes. Turned out wonderfully and will definitely make again!

Simply outstanding recipe. A huge hit. Very important to use fresh ripe peeled peaches. Don't drain any juice and use 2 1/4 cups of peaches. Chop the peaches well.  This will ensure that your cake will in fact be very moist and have a great peach taste.  I would classify this as strictly a summertime desert if you are using real fresh peaches.

I agree with plasticjesus from his 2008 review.  I'm still trying to figure out why this has such high ratings also. It did take an hour to bake, but that wasn't the problem.  There wasn't much flavor, even though I even added cinnamon and nutmeg as some others suggested and the batter tasted good. I used 3 cups peaches and even made the glaze.  Wish I'd had the peach schnapps.  Last night I would have thrown away the cake and drank the peach schnapps. LOL  I put the cake in the refrigerator over night and this morning it tastes a little better.  There's just not enough flavor to the cake and the cake was a little too dry for me.  I might try it again and revise the ingredients now that I know how the original recipe tastes.

This cake was fantastic! I made it with apples and blueberries, and it was delicious! The blueberries were especially pretty once the cake was sliced. 

Like others said, the cake didn't easily come out of the greased pan, but once I buttered and sugared the pan, it came out much better. Also, the sugar makes a sweeter, browner crust.

This cake was delicious.  When you serve it warm it tastes like a peach cobbler cake.  I make a glaze with powdered sugar, half and half and chopped peaches.  It was great hit and I will make this many more times.

Made the cake at 3:00 am for breakfast today.  I had 5 over ripe medium peaches left over from the road stand.  Had made a peach pie last week and really did not want to make anything else with peaches, but I decided to try this recipe.
I made half the recipe and the full tsp of vanilla as suggested and used a standard load pan.
It is wonderful...  My husband said that it is the best pound cake, with or without fruit he has ever had.  We put a little butter on the still warm cake and had it with a cup of really good coffee.
Thank you Dent for a keeper...

I made this wonderful pound cake exactly as it called for except I took someone's advise and after I buttered the pan and also used sugar. It made it nice and crusty.    It was a big hit in our home.  I would definitely make it again.

Delicious! I found myself over-flowing with frozen sliced peaches. In a search for recipes containing peaches, I found this recipe. Very simple and I had everything on hand. I halved the recipe. I defrosted the peaches in the microwave and put them in my food processor to chop them up before coating them in the flour. I also used butter-flavored cooking spray instead of real butter in my pan (with the sugar). Other than those very minor changes. I made the recipe as-is. My family and I were all quite pleased with the results! We will be making this again soon!

This is a wonderful, fast and decadent recipe perfect for a tea party! I try to always make recipes I am going to review exactly as stated, but I did end up putting in a few more peaches than was called for and it still turned out wonderful! I didn't have a tube pan, so I baked it in two loaf pans. The loaves turned out a nice size and now I have an extra one to freeze..... if my family doesn't gobble it down first!

Very nice flavor and texture.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made in an 8x10 glass dish, baked for 45 minutes.  The sugar crust is a very nice addition and the butter flavor is just right.  Thanks for this simple yet delicious recipe.

While I thought the cake was "good", it wasn't out of this world.  I too thought it was lacking in the peach flavour department even though I added more than 2 cups of peach.  Wondering if a little cinnamon would've helped?  I'm sure i'll make it again, but will modify a little.

Delicious and easy!  I made it exactly as written except I halved the recipe, and used about 1-1/2 cups chopped peaches.  I baked it for 1 hour in an 8x4" loaf pan.  Next time I may add a bit of cinnamon but it really doesn't need anything. Yum!

Delicious!  Tastes like grandmas pound cake with peaches added - sublime!  Ripened the peaches for 3 days in a brown bag.  Made 1/2 recipe in a loaf pan and sprinkled top of loaf with sugar also.  SO delicious - a fantastic dessert all on its own, or with some vanilla ice cream!

Made this cake for the first time yesterday, followed the recipe exactly.  The cake did not come out of the tube pan.  It was not entirely done in the middle.  However, we ate around the gooey parts and it was wonderful!  I made it again this morning, used almond extract this time and it is in the oven as I type.  I am going to turn off the oven at the end of the cooking time and let it sit in there to cool down.  That usually does it for cakes that don't cook entirely in the middle.  I definitely will have this on my baking rotation, esp. when peaches are in season.  ***Update - one year later I've made this again, this time in two loaf pans.  Baked at 325 for 1 hour.  Coated the pans in butter and turbinado sugar.  I wish I'd sprinkled the turbinado sugar on top.  I plan on putting these in the freezer for winter consumption.  Yummy!

This was a very easy cake to make. I added a few more peaches, a teaspoon of cinammon and a teaspoon of almond extract. I also had to leave it in the oven for an extra 20 minutes and it was perfect.

I can't believe this recipe worked for everyone but me.  Just because the toothpick comes out clean doesn't mean the center of the cake is done.  I ended up with a raw middle.  I made it edible by slicing the cake up and pressing it into a square pan (there was lots of raw batter to hold it together) then cooking it again.

If I make this recipe again I will increase the cooking time to at least an hour and a half.  I notice that a reviewer mentioned LOWERING the temperature to 325 degrees.  The recipe showed 325 degrees as the cooking temperature when I printed the recipe.

I found the recipe to be slightly dry with fresh peaches and butter. Yes, I will bake again because despite the texture it was delicious. I will just tweak it a bit next time.

I thought the pound cake was pretty plain and the peaches dissolved into the batter. Next time I will try some of the suggestions such as adding yogurt, almond and cinnamon.

This recipe is fantastic just the way it is written. I didn't have a tube pan but(2)8x4 bread pans for 1 hour at 325 came out perfect.

Easy to make and the results are so yum!  Very moist.  I halved the recipe but the loaf came out too short in my 9x5 so will use a smaller pan or maybe make 2 mini loaves next time, and there will definitely be a next time!  This is very good with some cream cheese on it.

This was very good and moist. It had "flour-y" flavor, but it went away after sitting overnight. Overall, though it was quite delightful.

I've made this recipe a couple times by now, and I absolutely love it! Both times I cut up some canned peaches because that's all I had available without a special trip to the store. It turned out wonderful! No need to look further for a better pound cake recipe. This was an instant favorite in my book. Though I do want to try making some kind of peach glaze or something to put on top.. But that's just because I like to experiment. It's delicious without a glaze. =)

At the time that I made this, I couldn't find any fresh peaches, so I made do with frozen peaches. I blended them (I can't remember if I did that to them frozen or defrosted) and I had changed some other things. It was for an ASL demonstration, and everyone loved the cake.

This is a very good recipe but it wasn't as peachy tasting as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, I will make this whenever I have fresh peaches!

Very good. I halved the recipe, used 1/2 c. Splenda with 1/2 c.sugar and 1/2 c. "Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks for our health reasons. I baked for 60 minutes @ 325 & poured into an 8"x4" foil loaf pan.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly but added two teaspoon of Peach Schnapp.  I used fresh ripe peaches and had peeled the skin off by dunking them in boiling water and then putting them in ice water.  The skin came off easily after that.  I had also chopped the peaches into small chunks so that they can be more evenly distributed.  Buttering and sugaring the pan created a really nice caramel-like surface, so don't skip that step!  Also, be sure to beat the sugar and cream really well.  It makes a big difference.  The batter divided nicely into 6 mini bundt cakes.  I kept the temperature the same, and it took about 55 minute for the cakes to be done.  I left the cakes in the pan for about 15 minutes before removing them.  They came right out and kept their shape really well.  I will be making this recipe again for sure.  Thanks!

Still trying to figure out why this has such high ratings....
It took forever to bake, and even though I used fresh, sweet peaches, there wasn't much flavor.  I even added some almond extract as some others suggested.  Big waste of time and ingredients in my opinion.

OK, but needed more "peachy" flavor, maybe some peach brandy instead of vanilla next time.  Added 1/2 t of cardamom.  Dusting the pan with sugar gave it a GREAT sugary crust.  Will try it again.

I have made this twice now - once with peaches and once with nectarines.  It is definitely better with peaches, in case you're considering that substitution.  And I couldn't find any comments about whether to peel the peaches, so I didn't, and my husband couldn't believe I had left the skins on.  They just sort of melt in.  This cake does NOT need any sort of topping, other than maybe a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I did make the caramel syrup some reviewers suggested, but it was totally unnecessary.  This is a definite favorite in my house now, so since peaches are out of season, I'm going to have to try it with canned instead of fresh.  Delicious!!!

This is a very good cake!  I made a few changes, though.  I added about a half teaspoon almond extract with the vanilla.  I also threw in some nutmeg and mace, as I thought it would be pretty bland otherwise.  I can't have peaches without at least some nutmeg!  I also substituted cake flour for half the flour amount, as cake flour makes for a more tender crumb.  I served it to company, and it was a hit.  A definite keeper.  Thanks!

Great recipe! Loved it! I sprayed the pan with a non-stick spray (Pam), and had no trouble getting it out of the pan. I also used the Caramel Glaze as suggested by PAMABEARS review, and that made the cake even better - enhanced the flavor of the cake! Thank you for a great recipe!!

I made this recipe for my moms birthday, it turned out great. I subsituted canned sour cherries for the peaches and I used Almond flavoring in place of the vanilla. I will make this again and try other combinations. It came out of a bundt pan no problems, I just sprayed it good with Pam.

Made this recipe exactly as written and used very ripe peaches.  It turned out beautifully moist, but not with much peach flavor - it tastes like butter.  Next time I will add more peaches and maybe some peach nectar or peach schnapps to the batter.

This was very good.  Baked perfectly, it was a little too sweet for me, so I may try a 1/4 -1/2 cup less sugar next time.  I used about 6 peaches which made about 3 cups, and I used about 2 1/2 cups in the cake. Instead of using regular sugar to grease and coat the pan, I used powdered sugar which made it easy to get out without that floury taste, baked for 65 minutes and let cool in the pan on the counter.

This cake disappeared at a July 4th barbecue!  I found it comes out of the pan easier if allowed to cool completely (an hour or so).  Rave reviews from adults and kids alike! I served it with fresh, whole raspberries from my garden.

Delicious cake which was easier to get out of a Bundt pan. Moister than a regular 
pound cake due to the juiciness of the peaches.

The problem that I had with this recipe is that the cake looked done and brown but was not done inside and fell when I took it out of the pan. Did anybody else have the same problem? My Dad even tried cooking with self rising flour with the same results.

Turned out delicious, absolutely everyone loved it. Is a bit on the mild/not as sweet side, could use a dusting of powdered sugar or a glaze depending on your taste. I liked it as is.

Wonderful and flavorful, halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan, didn't change a thing in the recipe.
Loved it!!! Couldn't wait to eat it it smelled so good out of the oven so dug in while it was still warm. Great recipe!

Good way to use up the extra peaches and eggs I had.   I made 2 cakes, froze 1.  Freezes very well.   Served with ice cream on top.  Followed recipe exactly as written.

Used three huge fresh peaches which were getting a little mealy/mushy at the end of the season here - so was probably closer to three cups than two.  Used a splash of almond extract in addition to the vanilla and threw in about 1/3 cup of greek yogurt just for some extra moistness. - and would probably also add cinnamon next time for a little more flavor.  This made one regular loaf and three mini loaves - good for dessert or breakfast.

This pound cake is awesome!!  I added a handful of chopped white choc pieces just before I stirred in the peaches.  Warning, do not make this cake when you are home alone, you may eat the whole thing.

Perfect.  Made it exactly.  Didn't have the right baking pan so I used two smaller loaf pans and it's perfect.

Really, really good.  I don't think it needs any additions, it was light and tasty just as it is.  Half the recipe bakes up great in a loaf pan.  (8x4 standard size).  I used Baker's Joy, but next time I'm going to try the butter and sugar method.  Like another reviewer, I baked it for 60 minutes at 325.   (I used a glass pan.)  I used frozen peaches, can't wait for fresh to come into season.  I measured AFTER they were chopped.  I wish recipes would be more specific about that.  My hubby wants to try other fruits in in!

I made Sautéed Apples (from All Recipes) and had some left over.  Being as the statement from this recipe indicated that you could use other fruits, I opted to give it a try.  This is fabulous.  Sweet but not to sweet, and moist.  If I could, I would rate this higher than 5 stars.  Kudos to your recipe.

Just made this and LOVED it!    I used canned peaches, put them in my food processor so they were more than just diced, but it really spread the peach flavor through the cake!  Easy, moist, perfect peach taste!  Definitely will make this again.

I read some negative reviews, and started to doubt this recipe. But I had tons of peaches. So, I decided to make this. For me, it came out very nice and delicious. Thank you, I keep this recipe in my recipe box

Great recipe! I have made this twice now, once with Splenda instead of the sugar and the second with a sugar/no calorie blend and it turned out wonderful both ways. If you're looking to decrease the calories, then I would definitely recommend switching the sugar because you won't lose the taste

Great recipie however try it like this if you want a light and fluffy cake. Use 2 cups of flour in stead of 3. Use 1 1/2 cups sugar and use 1 1/2 sticks butter. It came out so spongy and light perfect with coffee!!! I didn't even add the peaches. I did a simple vanilla cake. Soooooo good try it!!

This tasted fantastic and was incredibly easy to make!  

The only change I would advise comes in the baking, not the recipe.  I had a devil of a time getting the loaves out of the pans prepared as suggested.  Next time I will either be skipping the sugar coating or lining the bottom of the pan with parchment paper (the sides were fine, but the bottom was very sticky and stuck to the pan).

Other than that, the recipe itself is definitely 5 stars!

I don't think I would give this such a high review if I made it just as written, but with some of the
adjustments others made and a couple of my own, it really is outstanding.  I added 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and almond extract.  To boost the peach flavor, I tossed the peach chunks with a couple of teaspoons of Peach Snapps and I also added 1 Tbs. Peach Snapps to the cake batter.  I also added a caramel glaze as another review mentioned.  I did add some salt to the caramel.  The cake has a very nice texture and I highly recommend you make it a day ahead as the favors develop as the cake sits.  I will certainly add this cake to my favorites.

I didn't have any fresh peaches, so I used canned and it turned out wonderful.  I loved the sweet crunchiness that the sugar coated pan brought to the cake.  The flavor is even better the second day. I'll definitley make again.

Soooo yummy!  Loved this recipe.  I think next time I won't use the butter/sugar coating on the pan because it makes it seem burnt (not really burnt, but if you have a picky eater like I do, they think it is...)  Maybe I will try other reviewers suggestions of the caramel drizzle.  It would be good without too though....

I used 3 cups of peaches. The first time I forgot to coat the peaches, but found no difference at all. I dusted the cake with confectioners sugar. Sometimes I serve with a little ice cream.

This was good but now a WOWER.  Before I even tasted it, I asked my husband what he thought.  He said "maybe more sugar".  I was like WOW there is 2 cups in there.  It is hard to say but it defintely is lacking something.  Maybe some cinnamon or something.  I was thinking of dusting it with cinnamon sugar instead of just plain sugar and I think that would be delish!

Oh my!  Loved this! I make pound cakes all the time and I am constantly searching for new and delicious recipes.  This recipe is a keeper!  I only had 2 fresh peaches, which was shy of the 2 cups it calls for, and the cake still had a wonderful peachy taste.  This cake tasted like peach cobbler! Yum! I ate it plain, but it would also be wonderful with whipped cream on top.  What a wonderful dessert! I didn't change a thing, such as baking time, as other reviewers suggested.  Follow the recipe as-is.  You might have to bake it a little longer, though. I think the recipe is also a good base to experiment with other fruits, but the peach is sure hard to top!

Very tasty!  I made half a recipe, which was perfect for a 8" x 4" loaf pan.  The cake was moist, not heavy at all, like some pound cakes can be.  Hubby and kids loved it too.  This is one for the recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written (well I did peel my peaches and they were VERY ripe) and it was absolutely delicious! I'm so glad I left it as is. The inside was moist and tender with a nice peach taste, the outside was crisp and sweet, such a nice compliment to the inside! I think it is one of the best pound cake's I've ever tired! Next time I ma or may not add a glaze, it really doesn't need it but it would pretty it up a bit.

Wonderful pound cake.  I made as written with fresh peaches, except I did add a glaze.  My co-worker loved it. ( one said all she wants for xmas is "this pound cake"! I found it to be very moist, and the sugar added on the bottom of the pan did add to this recipe.

This cake was quite tasty! Others had suggested that there was not enough peachy-ness so I added about a cup of mashed peaches (with pumpkin pie spice) to the batter and I think it worked for the best. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was yummy.

Very good pound cake.  The crust on the outside really made this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used three large peaches instead of measuring 2 cups of diced peaches. I would  have liked more peach flavor so would recommend adding 2-3 tbsp. of peach schnapps or other liquor to enhance the flavor.  This recipe completely filled a 10" pan and baked for 90 minutes at 325.  This was the minimum time needed for the cake to be done in the center.  60-70 minutes is not long enough.

Granted, my photo is not going to win a prize but this cake is a real winner.  I baked it last night and took it out of the oven about 10:30. My  DH took 8 slices to work to share with co-workers, DD wanted to share a "couple slices" with her boss over her coffee break and this is  ALL that's left.  Not even 24 hours later.  DH called and asked if I could fax the recipe to his office so he could make copies!  I'm told it's absolutely delicious and they'd love for me to do it again! I think I'll go have a piece before it disappears!  Thank you!!

I halved the recipe as suggested in comments. It turned out so moist, I never put any glaze/frosting on it. It went so fast I might have to make the entire recipe next time.

Excellent cake.  I sugared some chopped peaches over night and and served each slice with a scoop of peaches and whipped cream.  It was a big hit for my mom's 78th birthday party.

I made this cake exactly according to the original recipe and couldn't be happier.  It turned out moist and satisfying, with just the right amount of peachy flavor.  I might try it once with half white sugar, half brown sugar just for fun, but the recipe is great as it stands; I'm especially glad I didn't add any of the spices recommended by other reviewers.  I think the cake has a simple, classic taste that only needs the addition of plump, juicy peaches for flavor.

This pound cake is phoenomenal!  I think I may make it in 2 loaf pans next time, b/c it was overly full, and takes so long to bake, but it's amazing.

This cake is Awesome. I made it exactly as written except after it was done baking and cooling I took the saved juice from peeling and cutting the peaches and added some 10X sugar, a little milk, and a little cinnamon to a small pot and boiled down to a syrup. I then poked holes in the cake and poured the syrup over the cake. I think this is the best cake I have ever had.

This recipe was awesome! I followed it exactly as written. My hubby & I both loved it, and so did our friends! This recipe filled 2 loaf pans, and the cake lasted for days. Next time I may freeze some. I liked it served with chopped fresh peaches and whip cream.

I made this with the fresh peaches and it was GREAT.  It made the house smell so good.  I didn't change a thing.  Took it into work and before you could say peach cake it was gone.  And they were asking for more.  Am making it again and maybe this time I'll save some for me.

Fantastic! I used 1 cup canned peaches, and 1 cup fresh cherries (sliced and pitted) because that is what I had on hand.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  The sugar coated pan made for a sweet slightly cripy outside that paired nicely with a dence moist inside.  Baked for 78 min. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

omg! this was SO GOOD! i used strawberries and cut the recipe in half so I could bake it in one loaf pan. i made it and left it out overnight. when i woke up, i freaked out because it was hard and i thought it came out dry -- but it had developed a GREAT crunchy crust even though I didn't put sugar on the bottom of the pan and it was VERY moist and tasty on the inside. next time i'll put in more strawberries :) my coworkers gobbled it up real quick. definitely a recipe to keep and i encourage everyone to make it! make double!  **UPDATE**: ok, that "more strawberries" thing isn't a good idea -- I put too many slices of strawberry in (I didn't measure) and there wasn't enough space for the cake to hold together between the fruit. in short the cake broke in half horizontally and the bottom is just all strawberries. It's ok, it still tastes good :) just make sure not to put too much fruit.

Very good!  I love the crunchy top.  I had to bake this longer than the recipe suggests...mine baked for 85 minutes.  Well worth the wait, though!

Thought this was great!  I make two loaves out of the recipe and I've already made it three times. (Freezes well too.)  I used the advice of a few members and added a tsp. of almond extract.  It really added a wonderful flavour.  Will definitely be a keeper in my recipe box!

Superb!! Really wonderful texture and flavour. I don't think it matters what kind of peaches as long as they are ripe and juicy. I just bought a huge case here in Canada and don't even know where they came from, but probably not Georgia peaches, anyways very good thank you, will make again and might a few nuts.......

We enjoyed this recipe, but it seemed to be missing a topping.  Our favorite was a peach/raspberry sauce.  I made it using 2 cups fresh peaches, 2 cups frozen raspberries, 1/2 tbsp cornstarch and 1/2 tsp Splenda.  Just cook it until thick and put over the pound cake.

This is a delcious pound cake--moist and buttery and the caramel glaze suggested by another reviewer makes it perfect.  I used almond extract along with the vanilla because the almond flavor really accentuates the flavor of the peaches.

I had never had a peach poundcake much less made one.  So when I saw the recipe I decided to try it.  Great choice!!  Really easy, not too sweet and very moist.  I tink I may try adding peach liquer the next time I make it to bring out the peach flavor more.  Since I have a toddler that hates vegetables, I think I am going to try adding squash or zucchini to the poundcake batter to make semi-healthy muffins.  Will definately keep and use this recipe again.  Thanks!!

This cake is yummy!  I made it easy on myself by baking it in a 9x12 pan (first sprayed with cooking spray) and leaving it in the oven for just 45 minutes.  I served it warm with ice cream.  It got rave reviews from my husband!

I was not impressed with this recipe. I didn't find it very flavorful. I used real butter of the best quality fresh eggs, and followed the directions exactly so I am puzzled. I did make a sauce with butter sugar  and peach schnapps which saved it from being bland. I also had the cake stick to the buttered and sugared bundt pan so it broke in lots of pieces when I was able to shake it out of the pan. I worried a bit about that direction and considered spraying and flouring the pan but the crunchy sugar coating was supposed to be what made it so good. I'm an experienced baker known for my desserts so I am baffled by the  rave reviews. I served it at a dinner party but threw away the leftovers.

This recipe needs quite a bit of work to improve the flavor.  The biggest problem is that it doesn't taste peachy.  I used 2 cups of peaches as shown in recipe, but it probably needs double that amount.       If I make this recipe again, I'm going to have to change it up. A lot.

This was simple and delicious!  I used half the recipe for a loaf pan, at 325F  for 1 hr.  Perfect!  The sugar crust was a nice touch.  I used fresh, ripe, local peaches.  I know some reviewers suggested cutting the peaches into small pieces, however mine were sliced into larger chunks so you can get that full peach flavour and moisture.  Will be making it again before these ripe peaches disappear!

Made this this morning for a family gathering. Preheated the oven and went out to pick the peaches.  I only had a small taste and found it very sweet. (but that's just me.) The family LOVED it.  The consistency of the pound cake was dead on as was the peach flavor. Sprayed the pan with "JOY" sprinkled 2 packets of Raw Sugar. Baked 65 min at 325. NO problem with cake exiting the pan (see my pictures) Will make again.

This is a very nice pound cake, but next time I would add more peaches.  I made half the recipe which fit perfectly in my 6 Cup capacity Bundt cake pan.   I coated the pan with Turbinado sugar which gave it a beautiful crunchy coating  that everyone enjoyed.

This is very good. I cut the recipe in half, using an 8x4 loaf pan. Due to a dairy allergy, I used Earth Balance instead of butter. I used chopped fresh cherries, and I did use almond extract instead of vanilla, as I love those flavors together. It took a total of 1hr. 25 min. to test done.

This receipe was delightful. A breathe of fresh air. It was easy and delicious. 
It calls for 2 cups of sugar but I tasted the batter and added another cup :0). The additonal cup seems extreme but it really wasn't. Taste the batter at 2 cups and make the changes as you see fit. I forgot the vanilla, oops! lol and it still came out with a thumbs up.Mixed my peaches with some cinnamon and a dash or two of nutmeg. I will be makign this again

Loved it so much!! 

My kids are crazy about it.. 

Though a bit too sweet for veteran.. Just lessen the sugar amount if you are making for family occasion.. As not all are a sweet lover hehehe ^_^

It was good, but if I make it again, I will probably add some peach schnapps and a little ginger to give the flavor a little umph.  The texture was excellent.  One of the people eating the cake told me that he didn't know there were peaches in it as he couldn't taste them.  I had to tell him that the peaches were those "yellow things" in the cake :(

I made this cake and used the full recipe but split batter using an 8" heart shaped baking dish for my daughter and family, and an 8" square pan for ourselves.  I added some nutmeg, cinnamon & almond extract, as someone else noted. Recipe turned out very tasty but most of my peaches dissolved into the cake mix.  I had cut them into 1-1 1/2" pieces so don't know why this happened, but the cake was very moist and my daughter and her family loved it. Actually, they couldn't believe I made it. LOL!  I did bake the cakes separately at 325 for 1 hr and it was perfect.  Will definitely make it again!

Delicious!  Made it into 2 loafs and they took 55 minutes.  Just straightforward good home cooking.  Buttery and tender. I knew it would be good when I was making this and could smell the butter, sugar and vamilla when I was blending them.  What a smell....nothing better.  I wonder whether it would be as good with other fruits....blueberries are good right now so I may try those.  I don't believe I have ever made a pound cake before but will certainly make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I had bought a bunch of fresh georgia peaches and made this delicious cake.  I read some of the reviews first and followed naple's idea to make a glaze using peach juice.  I peeled and pureed a small peach and added powdered sugar to make a glaze. great idea! It added some extra yummy peachy flavor.

We have a B&B and I'm always looking for good breakfast cake recipes.  We have a case of beautiful BC peaches and I tried this recipe.  Followed it exactly and it was perfect.  The hubby thought it might use a little more peaches; but our guests gobbled it down.  Thanks for sharing!

This is really delicious.  Followed the recipe except added 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  Baked about 65 minutes and took the cake out when the internal temp was 205.  Will definitely make again.

Enjoyed the basic recipe but also had fun embellishing it.  May substitute apples or pears.  Add 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, clove, allspice, and ginger.  Add about 1/2 cup nuts of choice (hazelnuts were good).  Use cinnamon sugar to coat the pan to give extra tasty crust.

1. Further comments after husband had eaten several slices,"Why is it grainy?" Well, it's the sugar-coating from the pan, which I don't think adds anything. Next time, I'll grease & flour as I do for all the other pound cakes. 2. Depending on sweetness of peaches, you may want to adjust the amount of sugar. My peaches weren't quite sweet enough, so I added maybe 3 T.

I followed the recipe exactly and baked the cake in a tube pan for 60 minutes. It was absolutely wonderful!  Be sure to sugar the pan after buttering per the directions - it makes a difference.  It makes the outside of the cake nice and crusty. I will definitely be making this cake again.

Delicious!  Had 8 small wrinkly peaches in my fridge and used them up in this recipe.  Easy and extremely satisfying dessert.  Not too sweet and when you get a chunk of peach, you really taste it.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I used self raising flour instead of all-purpose flour and baking powder and added a 1/4 cup of grated coconut.  Probably the main reason I attempted to make this cake was to use up ingredients that were in the cupboard.  This cake turned out beautifully and moist.  Gave it to my partner to take to work for lunch and have had requests from his colleagues that they want the recipe to give to their wives.

This was really nice.  I ended up using 4 peaches 3 of which were over ripe so I followed some other reviewers suggestions and pureed the 3 and chopped the other.  Super easy, nice flavor, pleasantly moist and simple.

This  was Phenomenal!  I had bought 4 very large peaches from the farmers market. They weren't as ripe as I thought they should be so I chopped 3 of them (I did peel mine) and pureed the 4th one. I added the puree along with the other wet ingredients. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract along with the vanilla. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Made in a 10 inch bundt pan and cooked for about 80 min. The result was  a to-die-for, out-of-this-world moist cake! The peach flavor was perfect. Can't wait to try it with other seasonal fruits!

I decided to puree the peaches as mine were very ripe, and sometimes my kids don't like 'mushy bits'.  It gave the whole cake a peachy tint and it was delicious!  I also added a glaze of icing sugar and peach schnapps.

I did use fresh peaches because they are in season. Super moist and I loved the "sugar crust" I will be doing that on all my cakes from now on. Everyone raved about it, I was even asked for the recipe.

I split the recipe and used a loaf pan as one suggested, I used fresh ga peaches and about 10 chopped fresh cherries, baked at 325 for 50 min then put it at 350 for the last 10 min. My husband said "please make it any time"!

This is a great recipe!! You don't need to change a thing. I had some peaches I needed to use and came across this recipe. Had the ingredients on the shelf ~ fast and easy to make ~ and absolutely delicious! Shared some with a neighbor and it was a hit at their house also. This is a definite "keeper"!

Flavor was very good.  It stuck to the pan so it came out in two peices.  Not sure how to remedy that.    Great with vanilla ice cream.

As is typical with pound cakes, this was better tasting the next day (and also was a bit more moist). Needs more peaches so next time I'll use 2 1/2 to 3 cups.  Instead of vanilla extract I used almond and added 1/4 tsp. ginger to the batter.  Received a lot of compliments!

This cake was amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  It was easy to make, not too sweet but sweet enough, just overall yum!!  Only thing I'm going to change next time is instead of baking it in one big loaf pan, I'm going to bake it in 2 smaller ones, that's it.  I will definitely be making this cake again.

This is "THE BEST" peach recipe I have yet to try!  My husband bought a bushel of peaches and half of it went to making this cake!  We have several loaves frozen for later and gave several to friends and family....whom all loved it as well.  It did take a little longer to bake in my oven than suggested but this is great!  Thankyou for sharing!

I bought fresh peaches for this recipe but when Iwent to use them they were just not ripe enough so ended up using canned. It just wasn't that peachy! I did, however, think the longer it sat in the fridge the better it got.

I enjoyed the cake but try using peach schnapps instead of the almond or vanilla flavouring for more peach flavour.  I served this with a light custard and it was delicious.

The cake is good and I love peaches but the 2 together were so-so. I wish the peach flvor spread more thru-out the cake. Maybe a little juice added next time to the batter...

This recipe was FANTASTIC! I suggest eating it immediatley, as the sugar absorbs into the sides if left overnight. And that was the best part-the crunchy sugar on the outside!

Very Very Good! Sweet! The sugar on the outside of the pan really set it off. I did add 1/4 tsp of almond extract and a couple sprinkles of cinnamon, also I used a big can of peaches instead of fresh all in two loaf pans. I'll make this one again thanks!!!

This was an excellent cake and the only change I made was instead of just plain sugar sprinkled over the butter I used my sugar cinnamon that i keep for toast. the cinnamon topped the small and taste. I made and took to a resturant for a get together with my sisters. I had just taken it out of the oven a hour or so before and it was srill warm and whenI tool the top off the carrier every one in the resturant could smell it and started going ummmm. I gave out the recipe to alot of people. Of course the waitress and table next to us loved it also. Dana/TX

Simply Heavenly!!!  I made the peach version last weekend and my husband loved it!  This weekend, he asked if I could make it again, only using strawberries instead.  I gave it a shot and it was soooo delicious!!!  And it's super easy to make!  Thanks for passing it on!!!

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out moist and delicious and sugar coating the pan gave the cake some crunch in contrast to the wonderful soft cake underneath. Will definetly make again. Great Summer cake to go along with a cold ice tea.

I made this yesterday for Mothers Day.  It got 5 stars from my 3 sons and my husband.  I enjoyed it, but wanted it a bit heavier.  I'm looking forward to trying it today after its sat for 24 hours.   I followed the recipe exactly.

We had this for dessert last night and hubby and I both went back for seconds.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x4 loaf pan for about 65 min. and drizzled a glaze of powdered sugar and peach juice over the top, as suggested by another reviewer.  Frozen peaches (thawed and drained) worked great!  I'm glad I didn't add any of the other ingredients suggested by others because the cake really is lovely as written.

I was looking for a recipe to use up a bunch of fresh peaches we were given and stumbled across this gem. 
Not only did it turn out perfect, but I learend a new cooking skill. I have often tried to add fruit or nuts to breads or cakes and was always dismayed to find everything at the bottom of my creation when it came out of the oven. In this recipe it has you dredge the fruit in flour from the recipe. Brilliant. I baked this in my pampered chef stoneware fluted pan and it came out perfect. I took the finished masterpiece to a family gathering and it got rave reviews. This recipe will become a family favorite for sure.

Excellent cake!  Made it in a Bundt Cake Pan, worked great - took 70 minutes.  The crust was really delicious with the sugar/butter.  The whole family loved it.

This was really good with my changes. I halved the recipe so I could use a loaf pan, but used the whole amount of fruit, substituting about a third of the peaches with pitted bing cherries. The cake is very, very fruity and dense. I baked it for about an hour at 325. Then I topped a warm slice with vanilla ice cream and a balsamic cherry sauce that I made to use up my cherries. Awesome!

Unfortunately this recipe didn't go over very well with my family, my 3 young daughters included.  It's definitely better warmed up, perhaps if I add a side of ice cream and fudge it will get eaten faster.  

I think if I made this again, I would puree the peaches instead of dice them.  They didn't taste like I had expected.  The cake seemed to lack flavor.  I think if the cake had more of the sweet flavor of peaches rather than chunks of them, it would be what I had hoped this cake would be!

I had a ton of peaches from our garden to use up, so was looking for new ways to use them. I came across this recipe, read some of the reviews and decided to try it. The only change I made was after looking at the two cups of peaches in relation to the amount of batter and realising it would need more peaches than called for. I used four cups of my fresh peaches instead of the two cups the recipe called for. The end result was delicious! It's plenty peachy and moist, not to mention rich and dense as a proper pound cake should be. Kudos to Dent Norton for this great pound cake!

Wow!  This was good, I used canned peaches since I didn't have fresh, but boy was it wonderful.  Made it in a bundt pan and it is already half way gone.  I sprayed the pan with butter cooking spray then sugared the pan.  I had no problems with it coming out great.

I thought this was an excellent cake--yummy! Crunchy outside, moist and tender inside. Although I usually don't alter a recipe the first time, I did change the vanilla extract for almond, because I LOVE almond and peaches together.

This batter was extremely thick - to the point where I kept looking at the recipe to be sure I hadn't missed anything while preparing it.  It took 20-25 minutes more to bake than was printed, and I finally, during those last 25 minutes, turned the oven up to 350 to move it along. Mine also stuck to the pan, even though I sprayed the heck out of it with Pam and didn't put the sugar on the pan.  I used frozen peaches and the taste was good, and I also added a bit of almond flavoring to the batter.

This is one of the best peach pound cake's I've bake (ok, maybe the only one). But my friend who dislikes pound cakes, loves it. Used my own backyard peaches but I added more, about 3-3 1/2 cups.  Just make sure the butter is softened, not melted, and add 1/2 teas. of almond extract as others have suggested. I have found it does cook better in a bundt pan and cook for a little longer then suggested.  Allow to cool in pan about 10 min. upright and then invert on wire rack for about 45 min., maybe tapping on the pan for cake to come out, just don't force it! 
 Yum-Yum

I made this cake for the teachers I work with, and everyone loved it!  Following the suggestions of others I added nutmeg, cinnamon and ground cloves.  I used about 2.5 cups of peaches, and think I will up it to 3 next time.  There will certainly be a next time!

I had an abundance of fresh peaches to use up so I tried this recipe to make something out of the ordinary.  It is wonderful! It is a very moist, dense, cake. I added a few more peaches than the recipe called for to make it extra peachy. The sugar coating all over the cake gave it just the right amount of sweetness although I did powder the cake with powdered sugar for appearances and my family can't have anything too sweet! Thank you for a great recipe!

It didn't have the peach flavor that I would have thought I even put another cup full in. Ok but I wouldn't make it again. Probably better with apples

I was slightly disappointed in this cake.  Maybe it was because I used "South Carolina" peaches instead of GA peaches! lol. =) The cake just wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it would be, although it received raves at a party I took it to last night.  I had tried it right out of the oven yesterday, but it was definately better when cooled.  I'll try this one again this fall with some fresh from the orchard apples! Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy stuff!  I added 1/2 tsp almond extract along with the vanilla.  The cake was moist and buttery, thick without being too heavy.  Great when you're sick of peach cobbler.

Wonderful! I did a practice cake using canned peaches, which another review suggested - thank you! I made this again a couple of days later using fresh apples for a co-worker's birthday. The cake was moist and the apples were tender and it went great with coffee and tea. I can't wait for fresh peaches to come into season here!

I, unfortunately had a big chunk of this cake left in the pan after I had let it cool for 10 minutes and tried to get it out.  I pieced it together like a sand scupture and fixed a glaze with a little peach schnapps in it to try and cover the cosmetic defects!  The cake was good but I didn't think it had a lot of flavor.  I probably wouldn't fix it again because of the pan experience.

Way too sweet!! Oh my... So sugary.

I made it with nectarines instead of preaches. It is very tasty with nectarines but still, so sweet. You can only eat a sliver before it is sugar overload.

Adding sugar too the buttered pan was also unnecessary.

Peaches are my favorite fruit, and this cake tastes like summer and sunshine. Sometimes t throw in some strawberries to give it a bit of a tang. Don’t add too much fruit, or you’ll have a soggy mess. I like to make mini bunds and bake them for about 35 minutes. You will love this cake.

I made the cake for guests who were coming for a multi-days visit. Served it only once. No substitutions or changes made from printed recipe, used fresh ripe peaches. I was not impressed at all with the cake...felt like a waste of ingredients and my time. Oh well...win some lose some...just don’t know unless you try it.

Very good, I stuck to the recipe but used cream as directed ( milk or cream) I did have to add an additional 2 T of cream for the icing.  The first day it was more cake than pound cake but very yummy.  Lots of compliments.  Definitely will make again.
Alert, I had to put some of the batter in another pan to bake because my Bunt pan was full!

Wonderful recipe. Light, fresh taste with tree ripe peaches. Sugar ‘crust’ is tasty and fun. I made the full recipe and baked it in two loaf pans. One to eat rt away and one to freeze!

Seventy four year old farm boy who has started doing some baking.
l made this recipe today. First cake l have ever made.
Did everything correctly, except for coating the fresh peaches with flour.
I realized my mistake immediately after incorporating them in the batter.
  To late to say 
"Uh-Oh" now.
The cake turned out very well, except for being a bit too moist, caused by my old age error.
Regardless, it has a fabulous taste.
Guarantee, I'll make it again and bake it a little hotter and longer trying for a thicker crust.
    Thanks,
        Don G.

This peach pound cake turned out excellent and tasty too!  I did make adjustments , I added a sprinkle of cinnamon after putting in peaches. Also I sprinkled cinnamon sugar to the tube pan after greasing instead of white sugar. I drizzled powdered sugar and milk glaze to finish. Will definitely make again .

We  had some overripe peaches and love pound cake so I decided to try this.   I will make it again.   Like many others I added a teaspoon of almond extract.  I also used heaping cups of diced peaches to make it really peachy.  I skipped the sugar coated pan.  My baking time was an hour with the oven at 350 degrees for the last 15 minutes.

I made this and it was super easy, which made it even better. 
It was moist and it tasted so good I decided to make another but tweaked it a little by adding a little bourbon to the batter (maybe 2 tablespoons) and a little brown sugar to the peaches. 

Love to find a recipe I can tweak and still turns out awesome.

I followed this recipe as written with 2 exceptions: I didn’t have fresh peaches so I used a bag of frozen sliced peaches, thawed & chopped. Figured they’d be better than canned- &they were awesome. AND I measured 3 cups of flour but forgot to reserve 1/4 cup. ???????   Used a bundt pan, 60ish minutes and there it was. One of the best pound cakes I have ever made. I’m making another tomorrow just because I can!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I made this with fresh market peaches and followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. My children LOVED it! I served it with vanilla ice cream and the drizzled the "Peach Sauce" from this site over both the cake and ice cream. So good.

True confession.  I made this twice.  The first time it turned out quite heavy, dense, almost a solid pudding-like interior with a pretty cake-like exterior.  I did a little research and found what probably accounted for the outcome.  I had used my electric mixer on stir speed to cream the butter and sugar (I always substitute Stevia for white sugar, though I used granulated sugar to coat the floured pan, of course).  The stir speed worked fine for the eggs and vanilla.  So far so good; but I had kept it on constant stir speed while adding the flour mixture.  Then I added the peaches.  This was entirely too much stirring for the flour which I found produces a glutenous, gluey cake, precisely what mine was.  Moreover,  I should have taken the "fold in the peaches" direction quite literally.  So this all comes from being a neophyte baker.

Second time I made it, I corrected both mistakes.  I still used the mixer, which was fine.  But I carefully avoided over-stirring the flour, and then folded in the peaches by hand.  The batter was stiff, so the peaches had to be folded in with a large wooden spoon.  The result:  a wonderful pound cake.  

Maybe some other newbie will profit from my mistakes.  Lesson learned.

I made it exactly as written with very ripe, fresh peaches (Chilton County, Alabama, not Georgia). It is delicious. It cooked 1 hour 7 minutes. It was perfect, moist inside and a nice crust on top. The batter is quite thick when you put it in the pan. I thought something might be wrong, but it was not. I will definitely make this again. Served warm with homemade vanilla or peach ice cream and it would be heaven on Earth.

I made it as written and it came out good. I made it in two loaf tins and getting them out of the pan was a bit of a challenge even though I used ample amount of grease.

Made just as written and turned out perfect! I used fresh peaches - 2 large ones was the right amount. Baked for the full 70 minutes. Thank you for sharing.

Pretty average, one thing we noticed was that this cake literally feels like a “pound “ in your gut - not a lite dessert (and I get that it’s not shooosed to be light) but this thing seriously weighs you down...

Delicious use of fresh peaches.  Adding cinnamon and nutmeg was a great addition.  Good for dessert or a sweet breakfast treat.

TWO THUMBS UP!! the batter for me was very thick, which caused it to break a not so big piece off of the cake when taking it off of the pan. other than that, the cake is AMAZING, and i highly suggest. another thing, is in the instructional video they suggested making a glaze, but i found that the cake was very sweet it’s self and didn’t really need more sweetening (which would’ve been provided by the glaze) :)

Spot on old school cake! If your looking for 'a cake like Grandma used to make' , give this a try. It's very sweet, and don't skimp on butter and sugar when prepping the pan. Everyone loved this and will be a new 'old' family favorite.

Great dessert! I made this with frozen peaches in February giving us all a much needed taste of spring in the middle of a very bad winter.  Have made it more than once and added blueberries once for a nice twist.

Since I am partial to almond flavoring, I added a teaspoon along with the vanilla.  I used well-drained, chopped canned peaches because fresh were not in season when I first made this recipe, but can't wait to try this with fresh peaches as well.  Great, festive dessert!

After making this in the binder pan, I’ve decided that I would put 3 cups of diced peaches in next time. It seemed a little dry to me, but after adding extra peaches, I’m confident it will be much better. Will make it again. Also, my peaches were from our crop that we bagged and froze

This was very good. Flavour was a touch little bland  even though I added 1 tsp cinnamon.. I'd add a little more vanilla next time but enjoyed it with ice cream.

Absolutely delicious . I thought I could take a short cut and just spray the bundt pan and unfortunately it did stick a little to the pan, but after putting it back together and freezing and glazing afterwards it  turned out great ?? Great way to use an over abundance of peaches ??

I prepared it exactly like the recipe, but added an amaretto glaze. I used fresh peaches that were very rioe.  Also added cinnamon and nutmeg, and sprinkled the interior of the pan with turbinado sugar before adding the batter. I baked the cake 10-15 mins longer than recipe suggested.  Perfect!  Turbinado sugar added a nice crunch.

I am rating this recipe 5-stars BECAUSE I did follow the recipe. BUT I can't help but tweek any recipe a little itty bitty bit to suit me own fettish of cooking. I did use Vanilla Bean Paste instead of extract; same amount called for. I also added 1 tsp of Almond Extract. I also added 3 cups of chopped peaches (fresh off of my Peach Tree). Finally, I used Turbinado Sugar to coat the Bundt Cake pan as this recipe intended and ended up cooking for 1 hr 20 min @ 325 degrees F.  So the only alterations where Vanilla Bean Paste, 1 more cup of Peaches, Turbinado Sugar (crunchy sugar) and a teaspoon of Almond Extract. That's as close to the original recipe as it goes and it was spectacular!

Just a bit of advice....if you buy your peaches from the store...they are unripe and flavorless...picked too soon for the sweetness to set in. Go to a Farmer's Market or local orchard and get them; you will not be disappointed. IF the only peaches you can get are from the store, then ripen them in a paper bag for a few days...it will help. 

Next, set a pot of boiling water and dip them in the water for about 1-2 minutes then immediately flash cool them in an icy bowl of water for 1-2 minutes. That helps with removing the skins easily. 

People having suggested to cut the peaches into small bits...that's a preference but not necessarily needed; just cut them to about 1/2 inches and you will get bits of joy throughout your cake. They will not sink in the batter if you blend in your butter, eggs a

Follow recipe exactly.  There is no need to peel the peaches.  It's ok to have a bit more than 2 cups of peaches.  Batter will be super thick like cookie dough.  
Glaze with a mixture of greek yogurt and powdered sugar - to make this add powdered sugar in heaping spoonfuls to greek yogurt (or sour cream)  in a medium size bowl - no need to heat - just stir each addition until smooth -add powdered sugar until desired consistency and sweetness is reached - add 1 Tbs of fresh squeezed lemon juice (or 1 tsp of vanilla) and then more sugar if needed.  Glaze creatively.

Fantastic recipe! I didn't have a tube pan so I put it in a couple loaf pans and a mini loaf pan. I made it all in one bowl - I mixed the wet ingredients as instructed, then put in 1 cup of flour, sprinkled the baking powder and salt on top, and mixed until well blended. Then I put in 1 cup of flour, 2 cups of peaches, and 1 more cup of flour on top and mixed with a mixing spoon. It turned out perfect!

I think temp. was too low. Was very dense.  After it was done and oven off, I put it back in the oven and crisped the sugar on the outside.  Served it at card club and it got rave reviews!

Made this recipe last night and brought it to a dinner party - everyone LOVED it.  It was really easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I added sliced peaches to the bottom of the pan and then put the batter on top of that so when you flip it over the peaches are on top.  Looked amazing and tasted scrumcious.

I followed the recipe  , excluding the sugar in the pan.  I also add some Rum flavoring.  The rum with peaches was a great blend.  I would recommend you try it.  The texture of the cake was light and not heavy as some pound cakes can be.  The butter, vanilla , rom and peaches provided a great taste.  I did a normal icing drizzle .  I have placed this recipe in my go to file. Great cake .

I made the original recipe without any changes.  It turned out well in all respects.  I find that it is a very good basic recipe for a sweet pound cake and it could be 'charged-up' in so many ways, adding whatever fruits or other flavorings you would want.  It was done baking at precisely 60 minutes, but I left it in the oven for another 5 minutes to allow the cake to pull away from the sides of the pan for easier removal, once cooled.  As far as the peach part, I would add more peaches, at least an additional 1/2 of a cup the next time that I make it.

It was delicious but a little dry,  maybe my fault.  I think next time I will add more peaches.

This was a delicious cake. I followed the directions to a T. I used fresh, local peaches from SC. I also made a glaze flavored with peach schnapps. My family loved it!

This is my first review, after using All Recipes for many years.....this recipe is awesome!  I doubled the peaches to 4 cups because I had a box of Palisades peaches from Colorado and yum!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was good.  It got better on the second and third days.  The next time I added cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested by some reviewers, and that small change made this cake a WOW.  Here in Wisconsin it is not easy to get good, ripe peaches so I may not make this again for a while but look forward to the next time I do.

OMG....this was absolutely delish!!!  Will definitely make it again...and again!!!  It is a very large cake so I am going to try to make two small loaves or bundt cakes.  

Thanks!!!  ** Just finished reading some of the reviews....I don't get why people change it then complain.  I did EXACTLY as you said...didn't mess with the ingredients.  It baked in an hour at 325.  Let it sit 15 min, came out of the pan perfectly.  

XMAS here we come!!

I made a half-recipe in a loaf pan without any other changes to the recipe. I noticed that the oven temperature had been changed already to 325. It was easy to make and very tasty. This will be a repeater.

I was disappointed in the flavor here.  Very bland even when I added cinnamon, cardamon and almond extract, and it was also dry though I baked it exactly as the recipe said.  There were not enough peaches throughout the cake.which is my biggest issue.  I would add at least another cup if I make it again. What I ended up doing was serving this with whipped cream and more fresh peaches cut up on top like a peach shortcake. Any advice?

I made this cake using a bundt pan.  I cooked it for 70 minutes But next time I will reduce the time to 65 minutes. The cake came out moist and delicious. It was not overly sweet which I liked. I use fresh peaches which gave the cake  a nice peach flavor.  This is a nice summer refreshing cake. I did not use any icing since I was transporting it to a family event hours away. I think I prefer it without the icing since I did not want an overly sweet cake.  I will be making this cake again.

My family really enjoyed it.  I read through the reviews before I made it and took some of the suggestions.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made a loaf using a pint of fresh blueberries.  I sprayed the pan with Butter Flavored Pam and sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar and topped the loaf with crystallized sugar.

***VERY HAPPILY USED 2  AND  1/2 CANS OF DRAINED PEACHES!!!!!  Baked at 350* for maximum rise of the cake, ignored that part of the instructions and am glad I did... I have a fairly new gas stove and this always works for me. Muffins are always at 425* for me, for the same reason, BTW. ( yes, I know pound cakes don't need a lot of "rise" but I was also in a hurry to get these bad boys done!)... { Oh, and I didn't do the sugar on the pan thing before baking. Was in  a hurry and not time for experimenting and/or goofing up---so just did the usual flour and butter flavored crisco method that never fails to prepare my pans}
 Anyway.... I  tripled the vanilla, added lots of cinnamon, and liberal amounts of nutmeg, cardamom, and just a touch of allspice, too. In a huge hurry, so this amount of peaches , etc... was just right for 2 boxes of  pound box mix.... 2 boxes of mix (  at 16 or 18 ounces each) was mixed with 4 eggs  in total , following directions on the box ( from reading ingredients on the box, decided against adding more butter/oil/sugar, etc... and was very glad that I trusted that box----it didn't let me down!!!!) , and incorporating the advice of the original recipe, yielded a  wonderful and flavorful result. . being in a huge hurry, i divided the  batter into 3 ( 8 ") loaf pans. if I had more time, I would have just used 2 pans, but I knew they would bake quicker in shallower quantities. I should have made these into cupcakes, now that I think of it. lol!!!   Needed t

Made this with my home canned peaches- 1 qt drained and reserved the liquid for optional pour over sauce.  Used half of the sugar called for and it was sweet enough for us especially with reserved syrup from peaches.  Very very good.

very moist and not too sweet. I used 2 cans, drained diced peaches (as fresh not in season).  
I forgot to coat the pan w/sugar and made simple fruit glaze instead.  everyone devoured, even good as breakfast next morn.

The cake turned out very moist.  I made the glaze by starting
out w/ about 1/2 cup of sour cream , a tsp of lemon juice and then added confectioner's sugar to taste.  Because the cake's
flavor is dependent on so many peaches make sure you use the
best (most flavorful) peaches you can find, otherwise you will have just a plain delicious pound cake.

Fresh peaches might add too much moisture to the cake. After blanching, peeling and slicing off the pits, I let the peaches sit in a strainer over a bowl in the fridge overnight to draw out some of the juice. The piece chunks also hold their shape a bit better.

Separately, be very generous with shortening and sugar on the pan preparation, if you want a nice crust on the cake, and comes out of the pan fairly easily.

I used exact ingredients the only difference was I added my creamed mixture to dry ingredients. I used a bundt cake pan and it came out with ease, but it was very dense and I baked at 320 instead of 325. Will try again but may add less flour.

I left the thin peach skin on, for additional color, and cut my peaches into smaller pieces just in case they added an unpleasant texture.  I need'nt have worried bc final product was just fine. Next time I'll leave skin on AND use the larger peach cuts for a brighter appearance.  Using bundt pan and convection oven, I lowered temp from instructions by 10 degrees and used toothpick method to test for doneness-perfect. This is a big cake. Great recipe. Very easy. Very tasty.

This was a great recipe. I was afraid that it would not turn out because I had never made a pound cake and the batter was thick. It was a huge hit with my family. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and served it with vanilla ice cream.

Couldn't resist making a few tweaks after reading others... I used 4 large fresh peaches cut into 1" chunks and added about 20 cut up fresh Bing cherries. I coated the fruit with a mixture of  1/4 C flour and 1/4 Cup brown sugar. To the wet ingredients I added a 1/4 C sour cream and 1/4 C whole milk. (Note:  I did not remember to remove the 1/4 C flour as directed, so I think that is why I needed the milk or perhaps the fruit quantity was too large. But regardless, milk was needed for stirring consistency ease.) I thoroughly buttered a large bundt pan and sugared it as directed - no sticking when I turned it onto a plate 15 minutes later. I baked in a convection oven at 325 degrees for 55 minutes.  I then checked for doneness. Had to add another 10 minutes. So 65 minutes total. This cake is perfection... I will definitely make again soon. Peaches and cherries are inexpensive and so nice this time of year in the Pacific NW.

This is a new favorite in our house. I followed the recipe exactly how it was and it was wonderful. The cake is dense and the not overly sweet. The peaches make a wonderful surprise flavor.

This was a huge hit at our house.  I halved the recipe and baked in a loaf pan for about 40 minutes.  I also sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  The buttery, vanilla, peach flavor is just perfect!

As per other reviews, only added 2 cups flour, plus 1/4 cup flour to peaches. Used 4 peaches, which was more than 2 cups. To the peaches added 1/4 cup brown sugar as well. To the batter added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. I like spice.  Baked in 2 loaf pans, one sprinkled with white, brown sugar and pecans. The other just white sugar.
Bake 325 for 1 hour 5 mins, started checking for doneness at 45 mins. Covered with aluminum foil at 45 mins so top wouldn't burn. Both pans came out beautifully.
Served with fresh sliced  peaches and vanilla ice cream, carmel sauce, optional.

I had some strawberries and banana to use up, and was looking for something other than the usual muffins. So I tried this. Turns out my banana was too far gone, so we just did the strawberries. Turned out delicious. Added some cinnamon and clove to the mix.  Made it late last night, and there is only a slice left this morning. Yum! Thanks for a great recipe

Excellent recipe!  I added maybe 2 more tablespoons of chopped peaches, divided the recipe between 2 loaf pans, and baked it at 325.  Started checking after 40 min to make sure it wasn't overcooked, and it came out perfect at about 55 min.  Goes great with coffee!

This pound cake recipe is easy and so delicious. I didn't have butter not margarine so I used yogurt spread and do not have fresh peaches so I used canned. It was still delicious. Next time I will be sue to make exactly as the recipe asked and I'm sure it will be even more delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This was amazing!! I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used almond extract instead. I'm going to do that from now on. The flavor was fantastic.

Great cake.  I put a generous two cups of fresh peaches, but the peach flavor was not very strong.  Added just a touch of almond extract.  Texture of cake is really good.  Dense and soft in the middle and crusty on the outside.  Very good.

Received fresh peaches in my CSA basket, but they needed to be used immediately. Found this recipe and made it - and it turned out pretty good. Unfortunately I only had whole wheat flour, so it was likely more dense than it should have been. Will retry without whole wheat flour in the future.

Found a fabulous sale on peaches at the local grocer, but they weren't ripe yet and I wasn't waiting for this cake. So I now call this MO apple pound cake.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The only thing I did differently was coat the pans with baking release spray.  The first time I used loaf pans and it stuck terribly.  Today I used bundt pans and again, it stuck terribly - and when I tasted the cake it felt gummy to me.  I do realize that the recipe states to coat with butter and then sugar (I did use the sugar ) but it's not always feasible and you would think that baking release spray would work since it does for virtually everything else.  Not wasting any more of my time or peaches here.

I love love love this recipe.  I had about 6 or 7 peaches that needed to be used now, so I found this recipe by doing an ingredient search for peaches.  

It was very simple to make.  All the ingredients are things I keep on hand.  I did NOT change the recipe at all.

The cake came out moist and delicious with a nice sugary top.  

I will be making this over and over and over again!

I had 3 over ripe peaches to use so halved the recipe and made it in a 9 inch metal nonstick round baking pan.  I peeled the peaches although the recipe does not mention peeling them.  Liked it a lot, reminded me of a pound cake in a way.  Would be good with ice cream on top.  We ate it plain and enjoyed it, will make it again.

I made this cake in the tube pan.  I used pitted, halved cherries that I had frozen.  I used 2 cups, but will use 3 next time I bake.  I used 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring, and added 1/2 cup sour cream.  I did sugar the pan, and also sprinkled some coarse sugar on top.  The cake came right out of the pan.  We thought it was delicious, and actually better the next day.  I froze individual portions, so we can enjoy for awhile!  I definitely will make this again, trying other fruits.

I baked this peach pound cake yesterday and it's a winner!  Sweet, not too dense or heavy, and it's great by itself (no glaze or ice cream needed).  I added a few more peaches because the two I cut up were huge!  I baked the cake in loaf pans and sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  I'm keeping this recipe!

I used home canned peaches.  I just drained them really good.  I also put it in a 9x9 pan for 60 minutes.  The recipe was easy.  I took it to a party and got lots of rave reviews.  I would definitely make it again.  I might put a cinnamon/sugar/butter sprinkle on top for a nice crusty finish next time.

I had never made a pound cake before.  I made this for first time in two 8x4 loaf pans as other reviewers had done.  (I don't have a bundt pan.)  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the T.  I used fresh peaches and it turned out great!  This is great with butter melted on top and a good fresh cup of coffee !   I agree with other reviewers that the taste is better the day (or two) after.
I will make this again and try with other fruit and also alone as a plain pound cake.   Thanks for the recipe !!

Didn't have a bunt pan so I used an angel food pan. Worked ok, but hard to get out of the pan (and did leak from the bottom...use foil and a cookie sheet underneath).  Next time I'll make it in 2 loaf pans. Added pluots as well, which was delicious! Gave a nice sweet-tart taste. No need to sugar coat the pans...leave it out for a slightly healthier cake.

This cake was absolutely delish.  While maybe not as dense as I would like in a pound cake, (The Butter Pound Cake on this site is way up my alley) this recipe was nice and light and peachy.  It was devoured very quickly.  It did need longer to cook, about an extra 15 minutes, but the results were amazing.  I used fresh in season peaches, and may make a couple more of these cakes to freeze.

Excellent recipe!  I altered this for high altitude (Colorado).  Decrease sugar by 2 Tbsp, add an extra egg, add extra 1/4 c. flour and bake at 340.  Turned out perfect in both regular loaf pans and mini loaf pans.

I made this today and used the smaller bundt cake, thus used half recipe.  Made it for my Father for Fathers Day. Wow!  I am very pleased.  It looks and tasts much better than the recipe picture by far. highly recommend.  5 stars. i did have a little trouble getting it out of the pan since the recipe called for butter and sugar instead of my usual flour I normally coat my pans with. but all else Great

Made this weekend, following the recipe to the T.  I also sliced up an extra peach put a little sugar over to use as my topping with whip cream.  Was a big hit at our potluck dinner.

Fantastic recipe!  I was able to use 2c white all purpose flour and 1c whole wheat flour without any problems.  I also used home-canned peaches (skins had been removed) without having to flour them (I didn't reserve any flour as per the directions and used all 3c in the dry mix) -- I just folded them into the batter very carefully.  They didn't all sink to the bottom of the cake even without being floured.

I have to only give this 3 stars because I won't make it again.  I added the 3 cups of peaches that the reviews recommended, a few sprinkles of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg but I thought it was very plain and not real tasty.  Sorry, I'll keep searching for a good peach recipe.

Overall the cake was good but it didn't have a very peachy taste. Also the top was hard for some reason. If I make it again I'll purée the peaches and add some cinnamon.

I made this several months ago and it was awesome! Then my grown daughter, who is very picky and tends to redo every recipe she uses, asked me to make it again. It was my pleasure since she criticizes almost everything. She especially likes the sugar coating and so do I.

Nice old fashioned sweet bread with buttery taste and moist consistency. I divided this into 4 medium loaves and forgot to hide all of them from my teenage son- 2 were devoured in 24 hours (and he doesn't eat what he doesn't like.)

This was so very luscious and moist! I used frozen peaches, thawed in the microwave, and threw in a few fresh nectarines. To make it a little less caloric, I substituted 1 cup of sugar with granulated Equal and 1/4th cup of the butter with Greek Yogurt. I took a poster's hint and made a glaze of peach juice and confectioner's sugar. DH loved it and even took some to the office. It was a hit!

Enjoyed the basic recipe but also had fun embellishing it.  May substitute apples or pears.  Add 1/2 tsp almond, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp clove, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 cup nuts.  Smells amazing and tastes pretty darn good, too.

Oh my gosh, this is delicious.  It's like eating peach cobbler or shortcake, you just have to add the whipped cream to make it dessert.  I cut the recipe in half and made in a loaf pan.  I also substituted one egg with flaxseed and water to make it a pinch healthier.  I always cut sugar down as well.  A new favorite.  Thank you.

I hate to give bad ratings, but this one deserves it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was not a good cake. I read the reviews beforehand and thought this cake would be out of this world. It was so bland, and didnt taste like peach at all. The pound cake wasnt great, just a basic pound cake. The peaches inside are cool i guess but it didnt make the cake taste like peach.  I saw a few bad reviews and said they must not know what they are talking about, but they are actually the ones i agree with.

This cake was pretty tasty.  I had to leave it in the oven a bit longer as the cake was still a little soggy afterwards.

Sooo good!  I should've chopped my peaches more thoroughly since the bigger chunks turned to mush within the cake itself.  It's a bit too moist especially after a day or two.  Should've baked for more than 60 minutes...maybe 65 to 70 minutes.  Still tasty though.

Made this for Easter dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I made it with canned peaches in juice and used the juice for a glaze.  Yum.  Will have to try it with other fruits sometime.

Tasty Recipe.  I did add additional peaches and it still wasn't overly peachy, so if you like peaches, be more generous than what it calls for. I used half the batter with peaches and the other half with blackberries.  I layered the blackberries into the batter and baked mine in two loaf pans. Very tasty!

This cake was so delicious!  I had to come home and reprint the recipe, all the copies and my original were taken at work! Moist, flavorful, and my family and friends loved it! I'm also thinking of adding cherries to the recipe. And a nice glaze for the top!  Thanks for sharing!

This cake was really delicious and really moist! I was hesitant about adding the peaches with the skins on, but they were very good - they didn't taste bitter or ruin the texture at all. Peeling the peaches is not worth the effort. I will be making this again, next time with some farm fresh california cherries! I can't wait.

Pure perfection in a pound cake. The only modification I made was the substitution of canned peaches. My husband called it a 'delight' and the kids didn't think it needed any type of icing. I did give it a light dusting of sifted confectioner's sugar, for aesthetic reasons only. The butter and sugar coating of the pan were a welcome surprise. The crust was firm while the center was dense and moist. It had a mild taste of peach, which worked for us as we're not big peach fans (trying to use up a case of canned peaches that were given to us). Excellent recipe, thanks!

My first pound cake. This was one to remember. I love peaches and I love buttery cakey goodness.  They work well together.  I was initially going to make a sugar glaze for it, but after tasting it after it cooled in the over, it stands alone very nicely. GREAT recipe.  I also used the 8X4 pan by halving the recipe.

Followed the recipe for the most part.  The only things I did different is (1)used a 9x13 glass pan and (2)heated up some cream cheese icing just enough to drizzle over the cooled cake. It was sooo good.

I made this, and it was pretty good. Loved the sugar crust. I think it dhould be a tad peachier, so next time I will use fresh and canned peaches just to have the peach juice in the mix. Maybe some peach filling? Either way, I'd like it a tad peachier. Otherwise, pretty good.

Yummy!  I did a half recipe in a loaf pan and it took about an hour at 325.  It's still a little squashy around the peaches so I'd probably give it a few more minutes next time.

Loved this recipe!  I followed it exactly and it came out moist and sweet. I figure that before I go mucking about and changing things in a recipe I should try the actual original form first. I think that the tastiness of the cake is entirely related to what type of peaches you use.  Some peaches are sweeter than others.  Ours were fresh off our own little tree (peach trees do not flourish in Maine) the peaches are small but sooo sweet. I worried that I had nothing to store the remaining bundt shaped pound cake in but found that there was little that I had to worry about.  Everyone went back for seconds so a plastic bag was all I needed.

THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD! I used about 3 cups of peaches because I wanted it really peachy. I took the suggestions of others and added Peach Schnapps, and cinnamon to give it a lil more flavor. It took almost 2 hrs to bake. So, next time I will divide into 2 loaf trays instead of a large tube. Perhaps this will allow it to become a lil more dense like a pound cake should be. Mine was very moist...like a fluffy cake (possibly from the extra peaches I added). I will definitely make again and use different in season fruits. So easy and delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  I made this today with some ripe peaches from the weekend farmer's market, and wowzers it was so good.  I half'd the recipe, used a loaf pan and baked for 62 minutes at 325.  It's almost gone, and now I'm wishing I hadn't only made half!

Really good ... followed exactly ... I like the fact that it is not filled with spices ... lets the peach flavor be the star ... it took a LONG time to bake, however ... I don't know if it was the humidity or what, but it took close to 2 hours to bake thru ... but, it was worth it ... tastes like an "old fashioned" pound cake ... thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly (save baking it at 325* in two bread tins because I don't own a tube pan). It is a delicious cake, but I found it far too fluffy to be considered a "pound cake." It lacked the density I expected of a pound cake.

This is an awesome recipe.  I had a ton of peaches from a local farm and was searching for recipes when I came across this one.  I was going to a party that day and brought this cake with me.  When everyone tasted it they flipped....it was soooooo good!!  I was at a party yesterday with the same group of friends and when I mentioned I had peaches from the farm, everyone wanted to know when I was making this cake.  Definitely a hit!!

I am giving this a '4' only because of the additions that I made.  I used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/4 t. of baking soda.  I had 'California' peaches from Wal-mart and I sliced, chopped and put them in a bowl with 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 cup of orange juice.  Drained well and folded in 3 cups of peaches and wished I had used more.  I baked mine in 2 loaf pans.  Time will vary because of different ovens.  This turned out moist and very tasty.  Sorry, but does not taste anything like my peach cobbler!  But still a very tasty pound cake and will bake again.....

This cake is awesome when made with ripe Georgia peaches!
I have made it about 6 times and the taste reminds me of peach cobbler.

Excellent texture, very moist, and wonderful taste.  I cut the sugar by half a cup b/c I knew I'd be using a glaze and also sugared the pan.  I used frozen peaches and they were fine.  I added a light rum glaze.  It seems a lot of people skipped sugaring the pan, but I advise against skipping this step, esp. if you don't add a glaze.  It created a wonderful sparkle to the cake!  Great foundation recipe to get creative with!!

I made this cake for a church auxillary meeting, and was very pleased with the outcome when I tasted a slice before meeting.  Cake was moist, moist and not reekingly sweet-- it was just right.  Could be used as a breakfast bread-- warmed up with a cup of coffee.  Or could be used as a dinner dessert with peach ice cream on top.  The only changes I made to the recipe were I used PAM to coat big bundt pan.  I used store-bought peaches from a jar and chopped them up.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon.... the ADDED a teaspoon of "Mystery Extract" (the label had come off) to the teaspoon of vanilla.  I 'll be interested to see how my church group likes it, but this recipe is a keeper for me.

I thought this cake was very good.  I used a Teflon bundt cake pan, cooked it 1 hour and 15 minutes and it came out fine.  I like the sugar and butter coating created from the pan. But if I were to serve it for company I would sprinkle it with powdered sugar.  I also added 2 tablespoons of Gourmet Peach Flavoring, as peach can be a weak flavor and it added a bit of moisture.

I will definitely make this again, and the suggestions by other reviewers to add almond extract, cinnamin, nutmeg, and ginger were very helpful.

We love this cake. No problems getting it out of the pan. We Like the sugar crust and it has a really moist texture. I have made this SEVERAL times and it's been perfect every time. I have tried other recipes from this site, but this is the one for us!

This cake came out really good.  It was very tasty and still moist.  I would definitely make again.  I used two 8" round cake pans and there was still enough batter, so I ended up with two cakes!

Delicious, buttery pound cake with little pieces of peach throughout.  Easy to make and very moist.  I waited several hours before removing it from my tube pan.  It was a little tricky getting out (actually, getting the bottom off), but it did come out in one piece.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe.  My husband hates butter (what a wierdo!) and he found it a little rich, but to me that's perfect.  I'll use this again - and maybe try it with other fruit in season.  Thanks for the post!

I used nectarines as I didn't have any peaches. Once I'd pitted the nectarines I brushed the flesh with some lemon juice . I didn't have a tube tin so I made this in 2 loaf pans. Very moist cake with a very smooth texture. Thanks

I really loved this cake fresh out of the oven, served with homemade ice cream.  I'm giving it a 4 because it didn't taste quite as good the next day, with no ice cream!  But it was very moist and I absolutely loved it that first night!  I will probably add another peach to it next time.  Also, it took 90 minutes to bake for me.

I'm not sure if I missed something, but after 70 minutes in the oven, it was raw in the middle.  I covered it with foil because the top was brown, and left it in the oven for an additional 45 minutes and it's still a little moist.  Next time I'll try it in a shallow pan.  It smells and tastes great, though.

it was pretty good, but not "I'm going to consume all of this right now"-good.  I would definetaly reccomend getting very fresh and sweet peaches, that really makes a difference.

WOW!

This recipe turned out excellent.  Filled the house with the smell of ripe peaches and buttery cake smell.  The cake was so easy to put together and I put a little over two cups of fresh white peaches into the cake.  Mom loved it, brother and sister loved it--it was a hit!  

Thank you for this great recipe--I will definitely use it sometime soon.

Good old-fashioned, buttery, fruity pound cake. Peaches add an extra moistness. Will make it again. Sugar coating doesn't make it extra special.

I made the mistake of trying to fit all of this batter into a single loaf pan (OH NO!!) made quite a mess. This tastes fantastic- if your into peach cobbler, however i was expecting it to be more like a pound cake texture-hence-the name. It was quite good though. It was kinda like eating big slabs of cobbler.......hmmm, shoulda had vanilla ice cream on hand!

simple and delicious, easy to make, even for a non-baker like me.
