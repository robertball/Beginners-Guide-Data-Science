Not bad, but not the best! With this method, the sugar doesn't have a chance to caramelize and that's where a lot of flavor and texture come in. Preheat oven to 350. Mix your cinnamon, sugar, butter (and I add a teaspoon of vanilla extract) and combine in a bowl. Spread a tablespoon of the mixture over the bread. Pop in to the oven for 10 minutes. Then turn the broiler on until crispy.

I paired this with my son's "famous" scrambled eggs and a fruit smoothie this morning for a quick breakfast. It reminded me of being a kid and Grandma making it for me for breakfast. The kids fell in love with it--I made an extra two servings after they ate the first.

I remember my grandmother making this for me when I was a kid - I love it to this day especially on a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel.

Husband here, not sure what is more amazing, the fact that there are 16 photos submitted,928 folks saved this recipe, or the fact that it is actually a "recipe" that my 11 month old could make:) regardless, cinnamon toast always makes you and me smile.....

This is comfort food at its most basic.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it's better to do what my Granny and Mom do - Set it up as in the recipe, but then put it under the broiler for a couple minutes until the sugar just starts to bubble and caramelize... it's really good!  Poor Man's Cinnabon!  :)

I never had this recipe as a kid, so I found this to be a nice change from my usual toast with peanut butter or just plain butter. For all the reviewers out there saying "Duh, I've been making this since I was 5 months old - Here's a how to boil water recipe for the rest of you dummies," keep in mind that not everyone grew up with the same recipes, and there is a place for basic recipes on this site along with more complex ones.

I started making this when I was five. Needless to say, I've introduced this breakfast favorite to our kids and they love it as well. Make it easy on yourself and keep your sugar/cinnamon mixture in a shaker.

This is a much easier and different version of the cinnamon toast I grew up with and now serve to my niece.  We always buttered and sprinkled the toast with the cinnamon sugar and THEN toasted it in the oven on an oven-safe cooling rack or broiled it.  This creates kind of a crunchy caramelized cinnamon-sugar crust that I associate with cinnamon toast.  We tried it this way too (you don't have to watch it so carefully!) and my niece loved it.  I think both ways are pretty good and very comforting, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is hilarious. I saw a photo for this in the contest area and thought it must be a joke. I guess I figured that everyone has done this by the age of 2. I suppose we all have to learn "staple" recipes from somewhere.:-)

As kids we grew up on this. I've never gotten tired of it. Mom used to cut it up one slice into 4 strips so it would be easier to eat when we were so young. It would go farther that way, too, for the 4 of us until she could make 2 more slices.

My gramma use to make this for me all the time clear through my childhood and into my adult years LOL. I love it. Sometimes she would make it and then carefully drizzle a little milk over the final product to make it sort of soft and squishy. It is really good. My kids love it now too.

I grew up eating cinnamon toast made like this. it was good, I would have said it was a 5 star recipe... until someone introduced me to another method. A heavenly method. Lightyears more tasty. Combine butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Spread on bread. Bake at 350 for 5 min. Broil for a few min after. Heaven.

This was really good. I like to make it healthier by using whole wheat bread, margarine, and Splenda. It's great served with hot tea.

I make a large portion of cinnamon & sugar, put it in a shaker & keep it on the counter next to the toaster.  It's always ready.  I love no brainers.   This is the same recipe I used when my kids were little.  Oldest son is now 55 so it's been around for  a while.  Never thought  a recipe was necessary.  It's like posting a recipe named how to boil water.  I also have that one if anyone is interested.

It was fine, but not great.  It was a little too sweet and when I ate it I could tell something was off and not right.  Thanks anyway though.

My grandma used to make this for me all the time when I was a kid. I thought she invented it! She would toast the bread, spread with margarine, and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. It really doesn't have to be measured. On occasion I will make this for myself to remind me of her.

This tasted pretty good.  Didn't knock my socks off, but it was a healthier alternative to cinnamon rolls.  I served mine on pocketless pita bread and made the apple banana smoothie from this site to go with it as well.  Good way to start the day.

I am very happy to have had stumbled upon this recipe, and I give it a well deserved 5 stars! 

The fact that somebody took the time to write out this classic "recipe" from my childhood, (I haven't had it in maybe 20 years!) jogged my memory and has allowed me to serve it up as breakfast to my two daughters, 4 and 6.  They LOVE it and ask for it often now. So THANK YOU!

My dad used to make Cinnamon Toast for me when I was a little girl.  He didn't make it often, so when he did I felt it was an extra special treat.  This is a great breakfast for kids, or anyone really, especially if you are a fan of cinnamon sugar stuff like I am.  Easy and delicious!

My mom made this for me, I made it for my kids and now I feel guilty just making it for myself! I have never measured out the ingredients but this is a nice treat. My brother is a juvenile diabetic, so we didn't have desserts around my house growing up, but Mom would fix this for me and it would be our "secret".

Up until a minute ago, I had taken it for granted that EVERYONE knew what cinnamon toast was - and had always eaten it just as I have.  I guess I was wrong!  =)   All three of us kids grew up eating cinnamon toast, mainly as a bedtime snack (with chocolate milk), but also for breakfast.  I was fascinated by the reveiwer who said they never even heard of it until a year ago!  I'm glad you now have the chance to enjoy it!  It's so easy!  We always just have a shaker of cinnamon sugar made up ahead of time.  Very quick, easy, and delicious!

Thank you Melodi for taking the time to submit your recipe for Cinnamon Toast. It brought back happy memories of my children and later on of my grandchildren enjoying my version of cinnamon toast many years ago.

This is a childhood treat for me also and I still like it today!  But it seems that I remember my mom making it by sprinkling sugar on the buttered bread and then topping it with a few shakes of cinnamon.  Then she broiled it until bubbly.

I always used to love cinnamon toast as a kid, but haven't made it in a while. This was a pretty good recipe, although I softened the butter in the microwave before spreading it on the toast.

I never even heard of this until about a year ago when I had overnight guests stay over after a new years eve party I hosted. In the morning, they demanded that I make this...they're so-called hangover cure.  I'm not sure if it helped them but this is very tasty! As a breakfast or snack! Fancy? No...but who cares when it tastes so good! Serve with pancakes or eggs and it's ALMOST like having a cinnamon roll with your meal. Being nostalgic, I served this today with our morning smoothie! MMMMmmmmm....

Simple and delicious.  Went great with "A Very Intense Fruit Smoothie" from this site.  I used wheat bread rather than white.

Just like Mom used to make! ;)  We tend to make this more in the fall, so I mix together some butter or margarine with sugar (sometimes powdered sugar) and cinnamon to keep in the fridge and use that as a spread.  You just need to let it warm up a bit to be spreadable.  Love it on English muffins, too.

Just had this for breakfast with some scrambled eggs. So good. Like others I always have a shaker of cinnamon and sugar on hand. When we make this between my husband and I we use almost a whole loaf of bread.

I grew up with this and it's a very fond memory from my childhood. My ma actually made up a shaker of the cinnamon/sugar and kept it on the shelf, and anytime we wanted we could just butter toast and shake the topping on.

I really love this. I tested it out with one serving. I used 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon but it was a bit too much for one slice. Also, I used wheat bread instead and it was still good (I didn't have any white). I recommend a power level of 7 1/2 out of 10 on a standard toaster.

This is a very good breakfast dish, but I make it a little differently. I mix cinnamon and sugar in an empty cinnamon container and then keep it with my spices. It works on any kind of bread, not just white.

A favorite of mine for years and so much better than toast and jelly!   This toaster method is good for when you do not want to deal with watching the oven while broiling (the old fashioned way).  The oven broiled is my favorite, but I love it this way, too!

EDIT:  Thanks again, Melodi, for reminding me of this....my son has requested it almost daily for since I made it after spotting your recipe!Seeing this recipe reminded me of a treat from childhood, so two of the stars come from that!  Here's how I make it:  Use 3 tbsp sugar to 1 tsp cinnamon, sprinkle this mixture on buttered bread, and broil on a cookie sheet on the middle oven rack, until sugar is melted and edges just start to brown.  Serve with ice cold milk - yum!!!

The perfect ratio of cinnamon to sugar! Like so many other reviewers I've grown up with a variation of this recipe. My mom typically used brown sugar, and mixed everything with the butter before spreading it on bread and toasting it in the oven.

I just like this recipe 'cuz it's easy and for nostalgic reasons. (The last time I had this was in *pre-school*. That was some decades ago. I won't bore you with numbers. ;)) I really didn't follow the instructions exactly so that may be why it wasn't noticebly great for me. Though I didn't veer off too far. The first time I toasted the bread too long, until it was lightly brown. Wrong move. The cinnamon toast turned out too crunchy. The second time I slathered thin slices of butter over it. Not thin enough 'cuz it was way too much butter. Whoops. The third time I just placed a few thin slices of butter on the bread, heated the bread up to soften the butter, then spread the melted butter over the rest of the uncovered parts of the bread. This version was much better. When I sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar over the buttered toasts I just stuck them back into the hot toaster to blend w/ the butter so it didn't have the granular look from the sugar. Next time I'm going to turn the heat back up to glaze the top. Maybe that'll turn out better.

My mama always mixed the butter, cinnamon and sugar, together, into s spread--like quadruple the amount here--and kept it in a butter keeper. That way it was already to just smear on a hot piece of toast, or as someone suggested, pop it under the broiler, briefly.

This reminded me of my Grandmother, who used to make this for me for breakfast before school when I was a kid.  I toasted the bread in the toaster first, put butter, sugar and cinnamon, then stuck it under the broiler for about 20 seconds.  Yum!!

This was a great snack in our house growing up; as others have posted, our mother would run it under the broiler before serving, caramelized the sugar a bit....my job was to keep watch so it didn't burn!  :-) Thanks for the memories!  (I, too, haved passed this treat on to my grandchildren)

i love cinnamon toast! i remember eating it as a little girl at daycare. i could never quite figure out how to make it taste exactly like that but this came close. I was pretty generous when spreading the margarine on the bread because i wanted it to be a little softer in the middle. But instead of putting it in the toaster, i broiled it for a minute or two. It came out great and will definitely make this again.

Turned out fantastic, except I used day old bread, and I broiled it for about five minutes in the oven until the stop side got dark and the sugar was bubbling, about five minutes out of the oven it was cool enough for the kids to eat

Really good snack for late night! (or anytime) I took these and popped them under the broiler though a minute or two until the sugar started to bubble and then served them. (My husband's method of french toast). Fast and easy, satisfies that sugar need too. Plus it's comfort food, I grew up on cinnamon toast.

My mom used to make this for me when i was younger and to this day it is my favorite snack. Instead of white sugar she used powdered sugar, it's great either way.

Growing up, my mother always had the cinnamon/sugar mixture available at the table for  toast. It brings back childhood memories. I tried it today on a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel, and it was SO delicious. Simple can be very good at times!

We never had cinnamon toast in our house when I was a kid. Friends had us over for brunch when I was about 8, and cinnamon toast was one of the things on the menu for the kids. It was so good! Who knew such a thing existed? When this recipe showed up in my inbox one day, I saved it, and made it tonight to satisfy a sweet cinnamon craving. It is still so good 45 years later! I have a shaker-full of the mix on my counter now. Thank you for sharing this special treat.

Yummy! Very quick and easy, and a low calorie dessert/snack. I sprinkled about 1 tsp of the cinnamon/sugar mixture on a slice of bread and it was the perfect amount of sweet. I also toasted my bread a second time for 30-60 sec after buttering/sprinkling it. Thank you for this delicious idea! :)

This was okay, nothing spectacular. I did take the suggestion of putting it under the broiler at the end for a couple minutes. This is a good quick-fix for those emergency sweet-tooth situations.

Wow, simply amazing and delicious!!  I was looking for a quick and simple breakfast just now and this fit the bill.  At first, I thought the cinnamon mixture looked like too much for 2 slices, so i only put a little, but after one bite, I ended up dumping the whole thing on the toast.  The butter and cinnamon combo gives your mouth a real treat.  It's soo good!  Will make many many more times!

This was very good.  I like the white sugar idea because it was not as sweet as brown sugar.  This would be a great breakfast starter, or snack.  There was just the right amount of cinnamon.

Grrreat!!!!! Loved this. It only took me 3 minutes to make, I measured out the sugar and Cinnamon while the bread was toasting, and got a tsp of butter prepared and by that time the bread was done toasting and I quickly put on the butter and sprinkled on the sugar and cinnamon. Saying again, this recipe was AWESOME and SUPER QUICK. Just what I needed to give my child since he was almost late for school. FANTABULOUS-fantastic and fabulous!

This is the best, I've had it many times when I was little, and always thought it was alot better with just plain white (FRESH!) bread.

I would make sure you toast for a while or your bread will get cold. Mine was already room temp by the time I started eating it.

Good flavor, but I found that it is even better when the cinnamon and sugar is mixed into softened butter. It's easier to spread onto the bread before toasting. Pop into the broiler for a minute or two after toasting.

Like some of the other reviewers, I never had this til my grand daughter introduced me to it. We made lots of this when she was young and at 73 I still love it. I have it every morning with my cup of tea. I use a little more cinnamon, but that is personal preference.

Ate this when I was a kid.  We put 5 dabs of butter on the bread, looked like a 5 on a die, then sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on it and broiled.  Another way was substitute cocoa powder for the cinnamon.  Chocolate toast.......YUMMMMMMM

I used coconut oil  and brown sugar to bring out the flavor of cinnamon toast more and I will definitely make the toast again. I use the oven as my toaster and the toast comes out just as delicious as ever!

My mom would  make this for me as a child for a special treat. Now I do the same for my son. We have made it with white sugar,  with honey, but our favourite way is with brown sugar. Like my mom used to do. Ultimate comfort food!  :)

I never had cinnamon toast until I saw this recipe. I lived in Europe until the 1950s   But then we did not have electricity. Had to toast on an open fire. Nobody though of adding cinnamon.    Never too late, I guess.  I'm 78 years old now. Thanks for the recipe

A guilty pleasure reminding me of my childhood when I could eat anything and my metabolism would work it off. I made this today on Sara Lee Artisano Bread. So much better than regular white sandwich bread!

I came across this last night and just had to make it for breakfast this morning--it's been such a long time since I've had it. I used more butter than called for. The sugar/cinnamon ratio is perfect. I only sprinkled on about half as much as called for. I ended up mixing up some more and putting it in a shaker for whenever I feel like cinnamon toast. *Update 2/13/17-I now add about another 1/2 t cinnamon, only because I've heard that there are health benefits associated with cinnamon.

This is a great recipe. I made a little change to it in that I toasted the bread, and then on a saucer I mixed together aboout a tablespoon of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, with about a tablespoon of honey and about a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. I mixed it until it was creamy and then I spread the mixture on the toast. It was perfect! Best of all, I ate the toast off of the same saucer I mixed up the honey, cinnamon and butter, so I could mop up the remaining yummy mixture on my toast as I was eating it. Sweet!

It is much better if you butter and cinnamon and sugar on the bread and then broil it in the over till it bubbles.

This is similar to something my mom made us as when we were little.  She buttered the bread, springkled it with our old brown tupperware cinnamon and sugar shaker, a broiled it in the oven.  Very yummy!  Thanks for the memories mom!

Your forgot to toast it under the broiler in the oven, after you put the butter, sugar, and cinnamon on.  The sugar melts with the cinnamon and it is really great!  Goes from 2 stars to 5 stars when broiled in the oven.

~smiles~ ...I grew up eating this, but my Mom always made it where you had these wonderful 4 'little puddles' of butter in each slice of bread with the cinn-sugar over the entire surface, loved the little butter puddles.

I adore cinnamon toast. I eat it at least twice a week and this recipe is pretty much how I make it! I actually keep a shaker container of cinnamon/sugar mixture just for my toast!! YUM!!

Yummy.  Try using the broiler with buttered bread and sprinkle the sugar & cinnamon mixture on top.  Let it bubble and brown.  Not bad!

If you want to make this a little better,   instead of butter, spread peanut butter on the toast and then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.

This recipe has been a staple in my life since I was a kid.  Now as a mom I find it to be a great treat for kids on days they don't feel there best.  There aren't too many times in memory where I have made this and it didn't pull a smile on a face!  Glad to see it here!!!
