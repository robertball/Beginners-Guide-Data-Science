I made this recipe just as written for Superbowl Sunday!  It was great!!!  I will definitely make it again and again!  The less meat we eat, the more food there is worldwide for those in hunger.  We feed animals 7 times the grain it takes for their meat.  That is a waste of our resources.  That grain could feed millions of people living in poverty and starvation.  I'm thinking of making this with the lentils (doubled) only and no hamburger.  I think it will taste just as good!!!  Sorry no picture!  We ate it all before I got the chance!

This sounds good, but when I first read the description that included 'vegetable protein' I thought it would include some TVP, textured vegetable protein. I think I'll try it without the ground beef and make it a vegetarian meal. There is a Morning Star Farms TVP that has chipotle flavor, which I think would be terrific. Let me know if any of you try that!
