YUM!!  Although I mixed dark and semi-sweet chocolate with this recipe, I do not recommend it. BUT it was still the best peanut butter candy recipe I've ever made.  The peanut butter mix (w/o the chocolate) tastes like "buckeyes" that one makes at Christmas time.  GREAT!! Will make it again and again. To the comment from Lara29: make sure you are using powdered (not regular!)sugar (4 1/2 cups is one box) because the amount is just perfect.  Wouldn't change a thing :)

Great recipe!  I found it better to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet though.  It tastes more like Reese's.

This recipe is delicious. We were searching for a substitute for cracker candy because we were out of Saltine Crackers. The first bite was a real treat. As we continued to devour the cookie sheet worth of candy, we discovered that a little sprinkle of salt helped do the trick to improve what it was lacking. We think that perhaps eliminating the margerine in the chocolate topping would enhance the chocolate flavor and reduce the richness of the dessert - more like cracker candy. Make sure you have plenty of water or other non-sweetened beverage available! Lastly, I would give the texture of the peanut butter bottom 5 stars! It definitely had that Reeses' Peanut Buttercup feel.

I absolutely loved these, as did everyone I shared them with. I chilled the peanutbutter layer before spreading on the chocolate top to be sure the layers didn't mix. It worked like a charm! Caution - these are rich, so get yourself a nice big glass of ice-cold milk before you eat one...or two....or three.

Great recipe for peanut  butter cup lovers. Instead of meliting the chocolate chips in a saucepan, I just put them in a microwaved them on low. I also took a 1/2 cup of the peanut butter and added it to the chocolate chips. Overall it was a great recipe and I would definitely make this again.

Great tasting and easy! I strongly advise using only 1-2 cups of sugar, 4 cups is way too sweet.

So good, rich & flat-out yummy!  I kept them in the frig & they got better over time.  A huge hit with my holiday guests.  I followed the recipe exactly & made a 10x15 pan ... next time, I'll halve the recipe unless I'm feeding a crowd.  I ground my own graham cracker for crumbs ~ next time, I'll be careful to make sure that all bits are superfine as I had a couple small lumps in my peanut butter layer.

These were pretty good.  I didn't have the right size of pan as called for in the recipe so I used a 9x13 inch pan.  I ended up with a whole bunch of the peanut butter mixture left over but didn't have extra chocolate left over.  Other than that, they do taste a lot like a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup.

I also halved the bottom and put it in a 9x9" pan.  If I were to make the full recipe, I'd double the chocolate topping.  I made half with semi-sweet chocolate, and half with a Cadbury Dream bar (my fiance prefers white chocolate).  We both enjoyed them.

2 people have already asked me for the recipe!! This was YUMMY!  A great tip is to make a double batch of the chocolate layer and put it on the bottom and the top...I stuck mine in the fridge to make it cool faster...delish!

wow, so easy to make and the results were divine!! I did cut back on the confectioner's sugar, used 3 cups and I thought that it was sweet enough. Next time I'm going to use milk chocolate chips and see how it turns out.

Delicious.  I halved the recipe for the bottom, but used the full amount for the chocolate top.  It came out just right for a 9 x 13 pan.

Super easy.. fast too. I used a 9x13 pan.. used 1/2c less margerine than called for.. I bet you could use even less. I would have preffered more chocolate on top.. I thought they were extremely sweet.. but everyone in the office gobbled them up! Thanks!

Made this Peanut Butter Candy Bar recipe at Christmas time.  My husband and daughter can't get enough of it.  I used someone's suggestion to line the pan with foil and then after the candy is set, remove the foil and candy all at once from the pan, place on a flat surface and cut into squares using a pizza cutter.  Works great and makes for easy cutting.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, KARILK.

Very easy to make & my son said he like them better than Reese's Cups! Unlike other reviews, if I made it again, I think I might do a little less chocolate. Make sure you push down the peanut butter layer so it sets.

Yum!  The graham cracker crumbs give it the slightly "gritty" texture you get in the commercial peanut butter cups.  Make sure you crush them extra fine though, to powder if you can.  Also make sure you cut these small--big pieces become too overwhelming!

Oh my gosh.. I did about a 1/3 batch (didn't have much peanut butter) and it was glorious after being refrigerated overnight. I omitted the margarine from the topping and just melted chocolate chips. I looooove the peanut butter base! So good, much like a Reese's cup. Thanks for the recipe!

This was to die for...(literally!) - even though the  fat content was outrageous, I will make this recipe over & over.  All my friends love it and keep asking for the recipe....and don't even try the 'low-fat' version (using low fat ingrediants) - it doesn't tast the same in any way and if you're going to eat chocolate & peanut butter, you might as well go all out!!  BRAVO!

This recipe did not set up AT ALL!  The peanut butter layer stayed gooey and was impossible to cut into bars.  I had to use a spoon to scoop it out of the pan.  I followed the recipe exactly, but maybe the order I stirred together the ingredients caused the consistancy issue?

Great candy! But don't use butter instead of margerine. Dosn't work as well.

I made this yummy recipe for work, our office opens at 9:00 am and they were all gone by 10:15 am. Everyone was upset that I didnt make more, but I thought it would be enough for 9 people. I was wrong, too tasty to eat just one.

Good, but very sweet! I think it would be much better if the sweetness was taken down a notch and more of the peanut butter shown through.

I decided to try this one out, and it turned out pretty well. My friends LOVED this little confection-one describing it to me as "Better than Reeses!". However, it took WAY longer to set that expected, and text time I'll be adding a thin layer of chocolated on the bottom so it holds together a little better. :D, I'll absolutelty be doing this again!

We loved this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half, used crunchy peanut butter and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I also halved the chocolate.  It turned out perfect.  No complaints!

Usually I make a new recipe once or twice.  Not this one - I have made it and have been requested to make it over  a dozen times!  I recommend using natural peanut butter - the coarser consistency makes the peanut butter part more like a peanut butter cup - YUM!!!!!!  Also, I only put in about 3 to 3.5 cups of sugar - it is just as sweet!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe, however I would change the proportions a little to make the base more peanut buttery: 3 cups confectioners sugar, 3 cups peanut butter, 3 cups graham cracker crumbs, plus the regular amount of margarine and chocolate.

This was really fast and REALLY easy to make (and so, so, so, SOO delicious!). It's stuff mostly everyone has in the kitchen anyway, and it's great for parties and families. It was a hit in my house and at my friends birthday party. I've come back to make them again and again. HIGHLY recommend it.

Delicious!  Best peanut butter/ chocolate treat I've made.  For the chocolate topping, I used 1 tbsp. shortening and milk chocolate chips (no butter).  It worked great!

I have made this recipe many times for my kiddos.  One time, however, when mother-Hubbard's-cupboard was nearly bare, I had no graham crackers, and we were all craving a treat.  I DID have a big box of Rice Krispies in my pantry.  I substituted crushed rice krispies, and the results were perfect.  As a matter of fact, it left the texture the same, but not quite so rich, which made me feel just a little less guilty as I passed them out to my little munchkins! All right...it made me feel a little less guilty about how many I ate...

Love Love Love these bars.  Made them over Christmas.  I like making all kinds of cookies and candies to give away to neighbors and friends.  I normally make buckeys, but when I ran across this recipe I thought I would give them a try.  OMG!!!  They are so tasty and I don't have the mess with making buckeyes.....  My new go to recipe..no more rolling and dipping  :)  Thanks!!!

I think that this recipe is pretty good for what it is but I realize that maybe I just don't like reese's as much as I thought I did (my tastes grew up!) - even though I much prefer dark to milk chocolate I would recommend making this with milk choc - I used semisweet chips and it just didn't taste quite right.  I used less margarine in both peanut butter and chocolate mixes - it just seemed like a lot.  My only problem was that the bottom portion, even after much refrigerating, is not quite as hard as I would have liked - it kind of crumbles.  Anyway, this is what it is...if you have a serious choc/pb craving this is your recipe. Make a day ahead for best flavor.

These are really very good. Milk chocolate, and 1 tsp. salt are needed to make it really taste like a Reeses though. I used crunchy peanut butter-yum!

These were good, but tasted even better after a few days in the refrigerator.  Next time I think I will put a layer of chocolate on the bottom, too.

Good taste but VERY sweet! In fact, I think the amount of sugar was too much. It overwhelmed the peanut butter taste. I would either reduce the amount of sugar or use peanut butter with less sugar in it the next time I make this.

I didn't really like these - very heavy and fudgy, and just too sweet.  Mine wouldn't hold together at ALL unless they were stored chilled, maybe I did something wrong. The chocolate top would secrete this oily residue, and it made my stomach hurt after only a few bites. It did taste like Reese's cup... only it made me feel a hundred times worse after eating one. Sorry, just not my taste.

I made these for two of my girlfriends that just had babies!  They both called me for the recipe.  It made a ton, so our family got the leftovers!  I did double the chocolate topping, because the first amount was not enough to cover the top. Great treat!

I personally didn't like the tast of them but EVERYONE at my office loved them.  One person said they had a "fudge like" consistancy.  They were very rich tasting.  My husband enjoyed them as well.

Boy I really don't like to give a negative review, but....this recipe had no flavor. I used exactly what was called for. The peanut butter and chocolate just didn't have any taste. I was expecting a strong pb and chocolate flavor and it was just bland. Very dissappointed after all the great reviews. Sorry.

I had the same problem with not having enough choc. mixture for the top.  I used an 11 x 13 glass dish, and the peanut butter part was really thick!  I just doubled the choc. mixture, and it was perfect!  I used one cup marg. instead of one and a half, and real chocolate chips.  (The other half cup went into the extra choc. mix anyway!)  I took it to a family potluck, and everybody loved it!  This is a five star recipe with these modifications!

Yummy! What could be a better combination than peanut butter and chocolate in a bar? The only thing that would improve this recipe is to put some Rice Crispies in with the peanut butter portion of the bar. Scrumptious!

First of all, I never buy margarine.  I used butter (homemade butter when I have time to make some).  I love this recipe but I am not a huge fan of the 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs in this recipe; the crumbs seem to overwhelm the taste and texture where there is less peanut butter taste.  I have made it with 1 cup of crumbs and it still seemed too much.  The next time I make this recipe, I will increase the peanut butter, decrease the butter and crumbs.

I am a huge fan of the peanut butter cups recipe on this same website, which can also be made into bars.

OH MY GOSH these are PERFECTTTTTTTTTT. However, of course, I changed a few tiny things! I halved the PB mixture recipe and spread it in a 13 x 9 pan. Then I used 1.5 cups of melted semi sweet chocolate chips and mixed in about 3 T. of peanut butter for my topping (omit butter). Adding the PB helps keep the chocolate from cracking when you cut them. I also liked the ratio of peanut butter to chocolate topping. I like mine about 50/50. Mmm. I had tried "Peanut Butter Bars I" before I tried this recipe, but that recipe was a little too dry/gritty for my liking. This one still has the yummy graham cracker taste but it is MUCH more moist. I am in love with these!!!!!!!!

I took some advice and used milk chocolate instead of semisweet.  I think there is too much of the peanut butter recipe and not enough of the chocolate.  Next time I'll half the peanut butter part.  With having so much p.b. I used my mini-muffin pan to create my own little peanut butter cups. Those turned out a little better that the bars since the p.b. to chocolate ratio was better. They are yummy though!

Like some other reviewers I had to put mine in the fridge to set up. Super easy recipe...it took 10 minutes from start to finish. I used natural peanut butter and only 3 cups of sugar with a pinch of salt. I also added some hazelnut liquid coffee creamer to the melted chocolate. Turned out tasting perfect! It does make a LOT though.

It would be five stars, but I had to modify the recipe to suit my tastes. For those of you who don't like ultra-sweet desserts: I significantly decreased the amount of powdered sugar. I'm not sure how much I used, because I just went by taste, but I recommend starting with two cups and then adding to taste from there. I also used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy because I really felt it needed a more interesting texture.  As for the chocolate topping, I used dark chocolate chips. With those changes, my favorite flavor combination is epitomized in this dessert!

Very good.  My kids went nuts for it.  I had to put mine in the refrigerator for it to set up.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I would make this again though.

My coworkers loved this recipe.  I thought it was a little rich but lacking something.  
I also tried it with crunchy pb which made it more bar-like.

My family and friends really enjoyed these. I followed the recipe exactly. If you want to speed up the cooling time, stick them in the freezer for about half an hour. They're great if you store them in the refrigerator!

While I did not use the chocolate icing given in the recipe (I had no chocolate chips in the pantry, so I used a Texas sheet cake frosting recipe instead), I must rate it a 5 given the simplicity of the dessert and the flexibility of the recipe. If I didn't have enough graham crackers, I crushed up Frosted Flakes. I made this 3 times in one weekend for friends and had no left overs!

I have made a similar recipe each Christmas for years, but hated the way the frosting broke when cutting the bars.  This frosting recipe worked out great!  Thanks.

This was yummy, I halved the ingredients and still had a big trayful. As I live in the U.K I could not find grahamn crackers in my local supermarket and weren't really sure what they are, so I used digestive biscuits instead. I was v. impressed with how quick they are to prepare, I completed making the bars in about half hour which included shopping for ingredients. I will definatly be making these again!

Made these bars for Christmas this year and they are so easy and quick to do . My husband and I just love them. Took a tray of goodies to my former co-workers
and they all wanted this recipe. They woofed these bars down before anything else on the tray. They are nurses and love goodies.

I used butter instead of margarine and crunchy peanut butter in the mixture. I also made my peanut butter bars a bit thinner than suggested. I spread the mixture into a Calphalon 12 x 17 inch pan and then set the pan in the freezer  for about a half an hour or so. The mixture set nicely in the freezer! (Can be stored in the fridge to ensure the bars don't fall apart and get "mushy".) 
*The thinner the better in the pan! Don't forget to freeze after! Yummy!
  I also posted a pic of my peanut butter bars.

I used Splenda instead of sugar to make these diabetic friendly. Cut amount of sweetener by half and just love them.

Great recipe, can also be used to make peanut butter balls! Only thing I did different was used 3 cups of confectioners sugar  instead of 4.5 cups! I did try to melt the chocolate with the butter and it didn't work so I remade it without the butter in the chocolate and it worked out, maybe that was just me doing it wrong, I don't know :)

I've tried several different peanut butter bar recipes over the years, and this is my favorite. It's so easy AND delicious! I followed the recommendation of the previous reviewers and sprinkled a little sea salt over the peanut butter mixture, refrigerated it a bit, and then added the chocolate topping. I chilled it again before letting it come fully to room temperature to cut it. It cut pretty well, but next time I'm going to line the pan with foil so I can lift it out to cut it. That will be easier yet!

This is the easiest, yummiest way to extend your Christmas cookies or wow your guests with a beautiful treat. So quick and easy to make with amazing flavor. I make with dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet. This is the peanut butter fudge from your childhood.
