I usually like to make the recipe as called for the first time, but this time had to use what I had on hand...only 1lb pkg ground turkey with the rest of the amounts called for, instead of decreasing them. I had to sub peach chutney for the cranberry sauce, which turned out great! When I made the turkey mix, it tasted Very bland so I added 3/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Five minutes on each side was perfect.The result was a very moist and tasty burger! The cheese melted inside is a nice touch. Very quick to make....will definitely be making again!
