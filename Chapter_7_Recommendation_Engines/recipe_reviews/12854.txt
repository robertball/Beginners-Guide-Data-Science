I am the kitchen master at one of the largest and most popular places in the Lansing/East Lansing area. We serve a house prepared version of coconut-shrimp that falls behind this recipe in preparation and taste. At home this will be the one I use from now on.  Thank you for your submission Holly.

The shrimp was way over cooked.  Will stick to my regular proceedure; one box of tempura mix, prepared as directed, dip shrimp in tempura batter, roll in coconut, coating well, drop into hot oil, (deep fryer on highest heat), also, do not put in the fryer basket, leave basket on the bottom of the fryer until shrimp is ready to remove, cook 4 minutes, drain on rack with paper towel under the rack, stays very crispy and shrimp is very tender.  The hot oil will help keep the coconut on the shrimp.  Dipping sauce was very good!

I love coconut shrimp and this recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I tend to not use as much water so the batter is a bit thicker and I also mix in some flour with the coconut so it sticks better.  As for the dipping sauce, I use pepper jelly and cut down on the mustard a bit.  It is amazing.

SECRET TO COCONUT STICKING which I'm surprised hasn't been mentioned: You have to chill the shrimp for at least 30 min. as recommended in another coconut shrimp recipe on this site!  after you take it out of fridge, use your fingers to mold/glue on the coconut to the shrimp after it's been in the fridge for at least 15 minutes (but put back in fridge so it can continue to meld together). Just press down on each shrimp that is covered with coconut & the batter that has had time to meld onto the coconut will catch any lose flakes. I do this each time and never have any problems. Coconut burns easily, so I only cook about a small batch at a time so I can monitor their progress and flip faster.  Also have paper towels ready after you fry to soak up the excess oil! This was very good, but don't get the point in heating your oven up for 5 min when the frying has already finished them off.

Made this because my boyfriend loves coconut shrimp.  We both thought it was as good as, if not better than the restaurants.  I did have trouble with coconut not sticking...use thicker batter next time.

This was a wonderful recipe! The dip was to die for! I served this at a dinner party and everyone enjoyed. The dip was absolutely wonderful. One helpful hint: I put the coconut in a large freezer bag (with some flour) and shook up the shrimp in the bag. It made things a little less messy. Thanks for a great recipe and I will make this again!

This is really good.  Like mentioned by previous reviews, I made the batter thicker & added a little flour to the coconut for the shrimp coating. I also didn't bake the shrimp as it wasn't necessary. The dipping sauce is good too.

My husband and I love these shrimp! Like other reviewers, I suggest using less water to create a thicker batter. I also cut down on the mess by putting the coconut in a bag, dropping the battered shrimp in, sealing the bag and shaking the shrimp around inside. I also found it was not necessary to bake the shrimp. The dipping sauce was PERFECT and would compliment chicken and pork as well.

This recipe started as an appetizer with super jumbo shrimp. By the time it hit the table no one wanted their filet mignon. ( also, skipped baking after deep frying)sv

I should have followed some of the other reveiws and made my batter thicker. I had a very hard time getting the coconut to stick. Perhaps adding an egg also would help,sorta like a tempura batter. There's got to be an easier way to make this work. The dipping sauce however,was very good. I used apricot jam instead of marmalade(I don't care for the flavor of marmalade) It was fabulous! You could use it on just about everything! Pork, chicken and seafood! Thanks Holly

I am giving this recipe only two stars because it has two major flaws. (1) The batter is too thin, and (2) suggesting that these succulent juicy shrimp be cooked for a total of 9 minutes is criminal! Granted, if you leave out the ice water and skip the baking stage (The whole reason its called "Twice-cooked") you end up with great shrimp, but then... that's a different recipe. I'll give that recipe 5 stars, but not this one.

I tried this recipe just as written.  The first two batches I fried were basically fried shrimp with fried coconut on the side!  Every bit came off in the frying.  I tried chilling the next batch of shrimp, per one reviewer's suggestion, this helped a little, but having to "mold the coconut" onto each shrimp was way too much effort for not enough result.  I ended up simply sauteeing the rest of the batch, and serving over pasta.  The only thing I didn't try was to add flour to the coconut.  I even tried some by making a paste of the batter and coconut...these actually did the best, but again, that was way too much effort.  I have a big family, and it would take too long to get enough made for us.

A keeper! I did make the batter thicker, following advice in the reviews. Used colossal shrimp.  Did not even bother with the dipping sauce. The meal received raves, with a command repeat performance the following week.

These were amazing and the sauce was fantastic. My husband asked me to make them again the next day. I think I'll add some panko next time but it is a great recipe.

Awesome!  I use the frozen shredded coconut that is found in the freezer section.  The sweetened coconut makes the shrimp too sweet. As I cooked the shrimp I put them in an oven that I kept warm at about 200 degrees until all of the shrimp were cooked.  I then preheated the oven to 300 degrees and cooked the shrimp for about 5 to 8 min.  Keeping the shrimp warm kept them crispy.  I will make these again and again and again.

Awesome recipe!  Next time I make it I will reduce the amount of orange marmalade and try adding a few dried hot chili peppers (whole) just for a little "bite" to counter the dips sweetness.  Might also take up other reviewers suggestion and try a pepper jelly instead of the marmalade.  I had no trouble with the batter, coconut sticking to the shrimp, etc.  Make his often...it's great!!

I always use allrecipes but this was the worst one I've done.
Zero flavor and cooking instructions needed to be more specific.
I burnt the first 4.

An average coconut shrimp recipe. We cut the water back to half a cup and added a quarter cup bourbon to the batter. This complemented the flavors perfectly. To the already delicious orange marmalade dipping sauce (which was a bit overly sweet for our taste), we added 1 generous tablespoon of soy sauce. This cut the sweetness while giving it a bolder flavor. This is certainly a dish you can have fun tweaking and eating!

This is delicious!  We made a batch last night using plastic bags for the batter and for the coconut, which really cut down on clean-up.  We used ~3/4 c. ice water in the batter which helped hold more coconut on and we added chipotle mustard to the dipping sauce to give it some more kick.  Served with cornbread and green beans.  Very tasty and we'll make again. Thanks Marbalet!

I was very disapointed in the fact that 4 min. was to long to cook the shrimp, putting the shrimp in the oven for 5 min. made the batter to crisp and dry. I think I would only cook shrimp 3 min. and put in the oven for a couple of min. and thats it. The dipping sauce was GREAT. We baked true cod fellits to go with it. I put the dipping sauce on top of the cod before I baked it. That was out of this worrrrrld. Try it, you'll like it

Very very good- just like in the restaurant.  They weren't greasy like some others said theres were, but maybe its because I drained them on paper towels before putting them in the oven.  The sauce was very good as well.  The coconut was a little difficult- i would suggest sprinked it on the shrimp rather than rolling them in it- when i did this, it got the other cocpnut wet from the batter and then it wouldn't stick to the other shrimp.  Other than that, it was quick and easy to make!

Loved this even though I can't stand coconut. Made this through the frying stage, then refrigerated. Popped them in the oven for 10 minutes to finish before serving. Next time I'll add a little more hot sauce for a bit more fire.

This could be very good but i wish i read the review on how to keep the coconut from falling apart before i made it. Next time i will *refrigerate before frying*. I followed the direction and baked after frying but i think that step is a total waste. I Think it was a bit over cooked. Shrimp cooks within mins so no need to bake after its cooked! Why i didn't follow my intuition, i don't know :/ The sauce i thought was very tasty. This has potential to be a 5 star recipe. Just make sure you don't 'twice-cook' it!

Thumbs down! Sauce is way too sweet and therefore a thumbs down in my opinion.Too much work for a less than mediocre dish.Would not reccomend this

I am only rating the sauce as I used leftover coconut shrimp from a restaurant. I sprayed a baking sheet w/ Pam, adding the shrimp & then gave them a light spray too, to help them crisp back up. The sauce is wonderful! Better than the sauce Joe's Crab Shack served w/ the coconut shrimp!!! I thought on the test bite that there might be just a tad too much mustard but changed my mine after diping my shrimp in it...I think it's perfect just the way it is....thanks Holly!

I didn´t use this recipe for the coconut shrimp but the dipping sauce is out of this world, it is the exactly one served at Outback and the flavor is just amazing, I added extra hot pepper sauce not to make it hotter but to cut the sweetness a little bit, very easy to make and enjoyable with almost everything...thank you Holly! I´ve been looking for this for quite some time and now I will make it again and again and again...

The flavor was great, but I had a hard time getting coconut to stick to batter. It turned into a huge goopy mess.  My deep frying skills need improvement.

I thought they were very good the only thing I had a problem with was the coconut wasn't sticking very well. I think maybe next time I would use less water so the batter is thicker.

Good, but not worth the mess.   Perhaps freezing them, or chilling them in between coating and frying would help.

I try not to futz around with recipes the first time around. I also try to make it a point to not take too much of other peoples' reviews & suggestions too close to heart. I figure the person that submitted it, submitted it that way for a reason. I should have paid attention on this one. The batter needs either twice the flour, or half the water. It was a drippy, useless mess. Finally, on the last 10 shrimp I just dumped the coconut itself into the batter. I probably used about twice the amount of coconut called for before mixing it with the batter. The sauce: yuck. Way way too much mustard, kills the whole idea of coconut shrimp. I get the concept of wanting a little spice - but mustard just didn't work. I'm kinda glad I planned on a second sauce, since I'm not a mustard person to begin with. I chopped up a can of Dole's Mixed Tropical Fruit - it was scoffed up. And so were the shrimp, by the way. So despite me nearly wailing this one across the room, to be fair, they were very good. But for inaccuracy, disproportion & personal aggravation I only gave this one 3 stars.

This recipe was a bit of an ordeal to make.  It was messy and difficult to get the coconut to stick.  Definitely make the shrimp just the barest light brown before putting in the oven or the shrimp will be tough.  As far as the sauce, I didn't have the correct mustard so I used stone ground mustard and it was delicious...very zippy!  My family loved this recipe.

these are awsome and I love coconut shrimp though if you make the batter thinker and dip shrimp in coconut after they are battered the coconut sticks much easier then to the shrimp alone. also another good dip is a creamy pineapple garlic dip (which is a recipe on this site aswell)it says to chill dip , but it is also awsome heated and served warm.

Excellent texture to this batter; makes crispy, flaky coconut shrimp!  My husband and I both agreed that the 1 Tbsp. salt must be a typo; I cut the amount in half and it still seemed a bit salty.  Next time I'll use only 1 tsp. or less and will use SWEETENED, shredded coconut (we like our coconut shrimp with a slight sweet taste, not salty).  I skipped the baking step since I used pre-cooked shrimp to start with.  The dipping sauce is super!  Even my 21- mo.-old daughter loved dipping her shrimp in it.

Delicious! I am guilty of changing a few things though. I used store bought batter mix from the seafood department and used that in place of the 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup cornstarch & salt. I didn't have any problems getting the coconut to stick to it. I also used sweetened coconut because that is what I had. In my opinion it was perfect! The sauce was also perfect. The entire dish was VERY quick and easy.

Really good recipe.  You have to really pack the batter on the shrimp to make it stick, but delicous!  I made it for guests and they loved it, but I thought it was too involved to make while having company.  Would make again.

GREAT COCONUT SHRIMP !!
Definitly use less water in the batter or add flour to the coconut to help the batter stick to the shrimp. It tasted great with the sauce. Will make over and over. THANKS!!

Excellent!  As suggested by others, I used about 1/4 cup less of water.  Put the coconut in a ziplock bag and had no problem getting it to stick.  Had to watch the shrimp closely as it cooked quickly and tended to burn if left too long; probably b/c I used only about 1/2 cup of oil and turned the shrimp halfway through.  I used sweetened coconut b/c that's what I had around and it was not too sweet.  Drained the shrimp after frying and had no problem with being to greasy.  The sauce was great--even my husband who puts hot sauce on everything loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

The shrimp was great - but the sauce was too strong for the shrimp. I am not sure if it was the orange marmalade or what but it was bitter and had a bad after taste. Just my opinion - I wanted something sweeter to compliment the light coconut taste.  So I redid it  and replaced with apricot jam, omitted the hot sauce, and reduced the dijon mustard in half and it was much better.

We cooked these without baking them in the oven.  We used pre-cooked shrimp and just fried them in the oil.  They turned out pretty darn good but lacking coconut flavor.  Make sure the batter is really thick (less water) so that it sticks to the shrimp.  A lot of fun to make with my friends!  Thank you!

Really good - especially the dipping sauce! I only fried the shrimp - baking would toughen it too much. It was light ans crispy - not too greasy. I actually used homemade blackberry jam in place of the marmalade - which I didn't have. And although it changed the color from golden to a deep wine color, it was terrific!

The shrimp were ok, but I didn't fry them - just baked them and attempted broiling them. The sauce was delicious...!

I cooked the shrimp only once. I coated the shrimp with House Autry seafood breader before dipping them into the batter and coconut. For the batter,I used beer instead of water. I deep fried the shrimp for a couple of minutes and that was it. Preparation takes a while but this recipe is good.

This was good but once fried I could taste very little coconut. I even used the sweetened coconut and there were a lot of flakes on the shrimp. The dipping sauce made them better and added taste. I added about 1/3 cup of pineapple perserves to the dipping sauce and I think it made it better. The orange was overpowering before.  I will probably make them again just because they are different and this is probably just as simple as the other recipes out there.  The people eating them like them because they don't know how much trouble it took:)

I had a hard time getting the battered shrimpt to stick to the coconut. In fact, so much came off in the coconut that I finally gave up and just dumped the coconut into the batter to cut down on the mess because the coconut was becoming clumped with batter. This worked out better. Overall the shrimp tasted too greasy. The baking in the oven definitely helped to crispen. I probably won't attempt this again. It was a lot of work! They tasted nice, but I was so frustrated with the coconut that it was hard to enjoy. 3.5 stars.

YUM! Just be sure and use unsweetened coconut. I made it once with sweetened coconut and though edible, it was too sweet. I also don't usually have marmalade on hand and have used Major Gray's chutney as a substitute very successfully.

I also had a difficult time getting the coconut to stick to the batter-many of the fried shrimp had uncoated spots. The overall taste was not impressive. The dipping sauce was too sweet for my taste.

I made this last night and followed the recipe to a t! It was very easy and I cooked them for 7 minutes on each side on convection bake. My fussy husband are every single shrimp!!! This was so good!!!! I used as the dipping sauce orange marmalade, horseradish and ground mustard. Great compliment. Two thumbs up for this recipe.

I decided to cook this for my family, not expecting it to come out this well but boy was I wrong! This was the best meal that I have ever made and my parents kept commenting that this was a restaurant quality recipe. The dipping sauce compliments it great as well. I paired the shrimp with a loaded baked potato, and you've got yourself a nice, hearty meal!

Excellent.  Used beer rather than ice water and decreased to about 1/2 cup for a thicker batter.  No need to bake at 300 degrees.  Fry in batches, drain on paper towels and place in warm oven (170 degrees) until all batches have been fried and you are ready to serve.  They were pretty sweet so I think I may use 1/2 sweetened and 1/2 unsweetened coconut the next time.  
The dipping sauce is delicious but I think a creole mustard would kick it up a notch.   
We doubled the shrimp (3 lbs) and therefore doubled the dipping sauce, but it really wasn't necessary.  We had about 1/2 the sauce leftover.

These shrimp were delicious!  I followed a suggestion by using less water than the recipe called for so the batter coated the shrimp.  I used frozen peeled and deveined shrimp that I thawed in lukewarm water. Be sure that the shrimp are throughly dry before battering and frying.  Although my husband lovd the dipping sauce, I didn't care for the bitter flavor of the orange marmalade and wished that I had used less dijon mustard. I ended up adding more honey to the sauce that I made for myself and it was great with the shrimp.  In our fryer, set at 350 degrees as the recipe called for, the shrimp were done after about 3 minutes and would have been overdone if I had left them in for 5 minutes.

good recipe, but way too much salt - decreased to 1/4 tsp. also added 1/4 tsp curry powder and 1/4 tsp paprika - gave the batter a nice spice.  reduced ice water to about 3/4 cup.  dredged shrimp in flour before dipping in batter. didn't bother to bake afterward either.

To die for!! I made this as an appetizer at a dinner party and my guests loved it.  The shrimp were hot and crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside - and the sauce was sweet and hot at the same time, the perfect accompaniment.  Putting them in the oven not only crisps them up a little more, but allows you to serve them hot for your guests.  My compliments to the recipe creator!

Great recipe, great flavor, had to tweak the proportions of flour and water a little; as the  batter seemed a little weak. I also added a little home grown dehydrated garlic.  I added a 1/2 cup of ice cold beer instead of ice water.  The shrimp was very moist and still tender. A Keeper

I cut this recipe in half because of the number of prawns I had. It still worked great. After getting into it I realized we were out of marmalade so instead of found a can of mixed tropical fruit in my cabinet, finely chopped about 1/4 cup and added rest of dipping ingredients.  It was awesome!  My husband says better than any restaurant and I agree!

Good recipe but the shrimp were a little greasy. I recommend to blot them good before putting them in the oven. I also only used 3/4 C water to keep the batter thick and it worked well.
The dipping sauce suggestion made the dish. Will make again.

my husband made theese they were fantastic, loved the sauce it complimented the shrip perfectly. We used a lot less oil to fry in and just fried for 2 or 3 min then fliped and did the other side(less waste). I defiantly want him to make theese again!!!

Overall a good recipe. The only criticism is that the batter was a bit thin and didn't stick to the shrimp when you dropped it in the hot oil. Next time I will make the batter thicker.
