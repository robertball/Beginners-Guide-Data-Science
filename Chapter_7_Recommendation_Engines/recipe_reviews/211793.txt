This was very tasty.  It was much milder/blander than I expected with the given seasonings.  I accidentally undersalted since I had seasoned the ground beef but forgot to add more seasoning after adding the potatoes.  It was slightly dry--I might moisten with a little broth next time.  I used one small Yukon and one small sweet potato.  I wonder about adding chopped spinach or peas or shredded carrots next time.  Definitely worth trying again; I've never had this before but seems like it could be a good comfort food and is easy to make.  I used too many sheets of phyllo so it wouldn't easily bend so I left it in long tubular rolls.  I notice a 16 oz. box of phyllo contains 40 sheets (5 sheets per serving), so next time I would use that as a guide.  I was confused and didn't intially realize that this should create 8 individual rolls, and perhaps only uses half of a 16 oz. pkg. of phyllo if only using 2 sheets per roll.  I would think they could be shaped into a round spiral easier with fewer sheets of phyllo.  I ended up with five long rolls.  Definitely worth trying again.  Kids and hubbie all ate and liked.  We only ate about half of this so I would think it could easily serve 6 with a side dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe--I love trying new food combinations and the allspice really intrigued me.  I might even add a little more allspice next time.  And maybe minced apple.  Hopefully fruit or other veggie additions would not completely destroy any ethnic authenticity.

I do not know if this is authentic or not, but my whole family enjoyed this.  I made it as directed - only I 'browned' the potatoes and onions with the beef and seasonings.  I couldn't make the pinwheels work, so I cut the phyllo in half and made them more like large spring rolls.  Didn't change the taste.  I used sour cream seasoned with garlic, dill and Mrs. Dash (garlic seasoning) as a dipping sauce.  Very tasty and easy to make.

This recipe is easy but not quite the MOIST burek I love so much! I think moisture is also the key to working with phyllo dough so here are a few ideas. 
1) Don't drain the beef too much - or at all! The grease helps to make the dough sheets pliable. 2) When you are not using the dough sheets cover them directly with a damp kitchen rag so they don't crack when you roll them up. 3) If the dough still isn't moist enough to work with you'll have to keep lathering on the butter as you roll it. Also I threw an egg in the beef mixture, which seemed to help.  

A little more grease may not make it healthier but it definitely makes it more delicious and more authentic!

This is very authentic taste to it. I see a lot of complains about rolling the dough. I actually make my own phyllo dough as do most bosnians so when we use thr roll technique the dough is more water based. Buy you can always stack eith the store bought phyllo. My father loves it this way and since it does take a long time to dry your own homemade phyllo I just used the store phyllo and stack with layers. Also I dont use allspice, I guess i make it a little past the original by adding cumin to the recipe it really gives it a deeper taste. And I love the natural yoghurt but for those unable to get it you can always use butter milk and dip it in the buttermilk or even sour cream and just dip it like that. Also with this you can feel free to expirament with different fillings I love cheese filling, I just take some cottage cheese one egg and a little salt, some add spinach its very good.

I make Burek but I make it in around 10 inch cake pan, I layer the phyllo dough then about half way I put in  amixture of pork sausage and ground beef then layer it the rest of the way. My brother-inlaw is from Macedonia and this is how they make it. I think it looks like an apple pie.

I have been cooking for many years and enjoy trying different cultures foods. I decided to try my hand at making this because of the reviews and the fact that I've never made Bosnian food before. The meat turned out great but was dry. It needs a sauce to cover it or dip it in. One of the reviewers said that it was difficult to roll into spin wheels with more than 2 sheets. I can tell you with only using 2 and even trying 1 that rolling into spin wheels with packaged phyllo isn't possible. I tried with 2 and then with 1 and it just wouldn't work. My rolls ended up breaking. I think a softer wetter dough is necessary to make them into spin wheels.

I wanted to like this, but I didn't. A tablespoon of allspice to a pound of lean ground beef is thoroughly overwhelming. After tasting the filling with allspice/paprika/salt/pepper I knew I needed something else, so I looked for other versions of burek on the internet. I found recipes that also called for dill & parsley, so I added those. That still didn't cut it for me, so I added ground cayenne pepper, which made it tolerable, though no longer authentic. My husband liked the finished product, but I did not. 2 sheets of phyllo dough is wrappable if you are experienced with working with it; I'm not, but by the last one I had the hang of it and could make the snails. I had leftover phyllo, so I filled it with a mixture of honey, chocolate chips, and cranberries and rolled it up the same way, and basted it with butter too, for a "dessert" phyllo. I guess allspice is just not to my taste, but thank you for sharing your family's recipe. I enjoyed making them :)

The reason this does not taste good is because it is missing a key seasoning called Vegeta. Vegeta is used in almost all Bosnian dishes. You can usually find it for a couple of bucks in any European, Greek, or Bosnian grocery stores. If you can find this and omit the allspice you will taste a huge difference. I hope this helps!!

I too wanted to try something different and am very glad i did.  This was definately filling, but beware it will stink up your kitchen with all that onion lol.  The crispyness of the filo and the spices...thought it was awesome, had it with a salad and dipped them in a sourcream/vinegar (light).  Awesome, even my kids (6 & 7) liked it.  I will be making again:)  TYSM for the recipe.

Wanted to try something new and different and this looked good!  Entire family was doubtful as we were cooking it but it turned out delicious!  Need a recipe for the yogurt sauce to serve with it...we tried it with a variety of toppings (honey mustard was the best!).  We doubled the recipe and had a lot left over, it's very filling.

I tried this recipe when I had a little too much phyllo dough in the fridge. I ate it just as it came out of the oven and wasn't a huge fan. By chance I was hungry and went to try it again the following night and found the flavored to be much better! The allspice defiantly blended better to the beef after having time to soak.

I gave this 4 stars because it was very easy to make, and pretty good. A tad bit dry though, so it really needs someting to dip it in. Unfortunatly I did not have yogart, but it actually went well with some spicy mustard.

My husband helped a coworker who is from Bosnia build a deck on his house. His wife prepared them a lunch of Berek and pickled veggies. I did some research and have tried to recreate berek and this recipe is really good. I don't know if its our American taste buds  but I too thought it was a little bland. I made a spice mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, pepper and a little dried oregano. I boiled the chopped potatoes for 5 minutes and added to the browned beef and onion with the spice mixture. I used 3 phyllo sheets per berek and brushed melted butter to seal. I tried the snail shape and it broke so I just rolled into a tube and put them next to each other. They were flaky and delicious. I made a spread of sour cream, dried dill and garlic powder. I love allrecipes.com because you can find a recipe that you have never tried to make before but can tweek it and make it your on that your friends and family love. Thanks, So GOOD!

Really delicious!  I forgot to make it into a snail shape, instead I just put all of the long tubes next to each other on the baking pan.  Used cumin instead of allspice to make it a bit more similiar to Central Asian pastries I've had.  Some of the tubes opened up during cooking cuz I didn't seal them well enough, but it didn't affect taste.  Served w/plain yogurt and sriracha sauce, YUM!  Definitely will make again.  My 4 guys all loved it!

For those people who are having trouble 'snaking' the filled pastry - change the wash you're putting onto the philo dough to 2Tbsp melted butter, 2Tbsp water, 3Tbsp Greek yoghurt and 1 large egg. Whisk together.

Also you'll need more layers of dough. I used 2 as the base > brush with egg wash > layer of dough > brush with egg wash > layer of dough > brush with egg wash > fill with meat filling, roll. Total of 4 sheets of dough per roll gives it a good bit more structure.

I was looking for a recipe to use up ground beef and phyllo dough and came across this.  It was delicious as written, and wonderful to use as a base to build upon!  Now, I had not used phyllo dough before, so I'm sure  I messed that part of the recipe up, but even so it was delicious.  Will make again.

Great recipe, my Croatian great Aunts would make this and I would watch as a child.  Only difference they used pork instead of beef and added a mushroom sauce for it.

It was way too dry. Hard to eat alone. Dipped it in yogurt sauce from this site. Helped it tremendously. Disappointed. I wanted to really like it. .

I really want to like this, I really did. I had an authentic version made by a Serbian once and that inspired me to try it myself.  It was really dry. I'm not sure if it was because I used lean beef or that I drained too much fat off, but it was way too dry. I also think that the amount of spices was a bit much. 

I will definitely try this again though but may tailor the recipe a bit differently and try others' advice and get that spice vegate(?)

The potatoes were not cooked all the way through, even though the outside was beyond golden brown and nearly burned.  The dough was so crackly and brittle.  My soon-to-be ex boyfriend is Bosnian and he doesn't like it.  Or maybe I'm just a bad cook.

instead of using a whole tablespoon of allspice, i did a 1/2 tablespoon of allspice and a 1/2 tablespoon of veggeta instead. also, when i was mixing the beef/potatos/onions, i added a little bit of olive oil and water so it wouldnt be dry (but dont over-do it). i added enough water to where the meat and veggies would soak it up but in 5-10 minutes there wouldnt be any water left on the bottom. enjoyed the recipe  it was awesome!

I wanted to like this too! I was thinking...onion, potato, hamburger, butter, yum, you can't go wrong with comfort food! I was wrong. I think it is the spices and potato, I don't know. I have to honestly say that this is the most blah tasting dish I have ever made. At first, I was thinking the amount of spices would be too much, but went ahead and made it as the recipe called for. To me, you really don't taste anything, it is like the flavors all cancel each other out. The only redeeming aspect to making this was the note from another reviewer that suggested something sweet for the leftover dough. I used cream cheese and dribbles of butter in mine and wish I had made more of those.
