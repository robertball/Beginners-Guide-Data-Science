We love this recipe. It is very easy to make and tastes very good on a cold winter evening. Plus it makes a very big pot so there is plenty left over for lunch.

I thought this recipe needed some more spice but I used no salt tomato sauce and no salt diced tomatos so that was probably my fault. So I added a pack of Lipton's onion soup mix (so no longer low sodium at all!!) but ummm...sooooo good. I think I am addicted!

Just made this stew this afternoon and it turned out GREAT!! I added a bit more tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes. Very flavorful filling and healthy (used ground turkey instead of beef). Thanks for the recipe!

This is a classic vegetable beef style soup. It is easy to make and the ingredients are inexpensive. The stew filled my 8qt Dutch oven. Everyone was well-fed lunches were made for the next day and I put some in the freezer for a rainy day. Excellent recipe!

The family loved it. It was really simple to make as it doesn't take long and only needs to simmer. I hardly ever measure ingredients but I'm sure I did not add all the recommended water... maybe a little more than half. And a soup like this I always throw in a handful of cheddar cheese to give it a creamy taste. I also added some organic shell pasta to really fill everyone up!

This was such a filling and hearty dish. My family loved it. I did add one can of kidney beans and elbow macaroni(for my kids!). I will for sure make this again on a cold snowy afternoon!

Easy and Tasty. I used canned green beans and kernal corn in place of the frozen vegetables. I also added about 2 cups cut carrots and 3 potatoes chunked. I cut the water down to 5 cups and I felt the soup was a little watery tasting so added some beef boullion which improved the flavor. This is a thick and hearty stew if you use raw potatoes and simmer 45 minutes. I would make this again.

I had the pleasure of sending the picture when I made this the other day. What a great recipe. I cut the whole recipe in half and it turned out just fine. I cooked longer that it suggested. Simmered it for about 2 hours. Thought the name of the stew was unique. MY husband and I really liked it. Would be very good on a cold night for supper.

This stew is my family's new favorite. I add a little more ground beef and it lasts even longer. You can vary the vegetables and use more or less tomatoes to your taste. Fast easy and budget friendly. Great recipe.

I had some rich onion soup type broth to use up so I used this recipe as to the beef and veggies. Used only 1 lb of beef but added the amount of veggies as written but didn't cook the vegies for an hour because I hate soggy veggies in soup. Lastly I added ditalini pasta. The end result was absolutely supurb and I credit this recipe for a great starting point!!

This recipe is very easy. I made some minor adjustments to add a bit of spice and flavor. 1 can of rotel 4 teaspoons of chicken bullion granules or 4 cubes (whatever you have) I also tossed in 1 and half cups of rice. This recipe is just as good the next day and keeps very well.

This recipe is fantastic. I double it to feed 3 guys and we have leftovers for lunch for days. I basically follow the recipe exactly with the exception of leaving out some of the tomato elements. I usually leave out the tomato soup because it is so high in sodium. I add extra carrots because we like them and also add some salt-free or low-sodium beef broth. This is easy wonderful and if you add a pasta of some sort very satisfying.
