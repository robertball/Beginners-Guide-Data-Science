This is a good starter recipe. However, there are a few things I change that makes it a very good chowder. First, I use an extra can of corn and change it to cream style. Next, the ham became too rubbery. So, I now I boil chicken and shred it. I then boil the potatoes in the chicke water for about ten minutes. Then, I mash them just slightly. This makes them much softer and adds to the texture of the chowder. Finally, I add corn starch to thicken the broth. It sounds like a lot of work, but really it's not.  It makes fantastic chowder, and I always double the recipe. That way I can freeze   the leftovers and have anther meal or two on hand for those days when cooking seems like too much work!

To be honest, I rarely follow a recipe to the letter unless I am baking, but I did use this one as the starting point for my potato-corn chowder and thought I'd share my modifications because it turned out great!  First, I used russet potatoes, but left the skins on for the extra nutrients and rustic feel.  I also added some chopped carrots and a couple of cloves of garlic, and used a whole bag of frozen corn.  I used chicken stock rather than water and did not cover the vegetables.  For spices, I added a good dose of kosher salt and black pepper, some ground sage, and a little crushed red pepper for a little kick.  After the 8 or so hours of cooking, I ladled about 3 cups of the stock out of the crock pot, made a roux, added the stock to it along with the condensed milk, let it thicken for about 4 or 5 minutes and then added it back to the crock pot and let it cook for another 30 minutes.  It was delightful!  Perfect for the snowy day we're having!!

Thanks to all the helpful reviews, this corn chowder turned out wonderful!  Used 1 can chicken broth in place of the bouillon cubes & water, added 1 can creamed corn, added 1 clove minced garlic, added 2 carrots diced.  I waited to add the ham until there was 3 hours left in cooking time so that it wouldn't' turn "rubbery" & that worked out great.  After adding the evaporated milk & allowing the 30 min additional cooking time, it was still a little too liquidy to be a chowder, so I added a corn starch slurry which thickened it up nicely!  It tasted good, but I felt it needed a little something, so I threw in a dash of rubbed sage & a dash of marjoram -- PERFECT!!  This was SO delicious!  Served w/ biscuits & we are looking forward to leftovers.  Thanks for the good starter recipe!  :)

Great Recipe!  My husband ate the leftovers and he NEVER does that!  I used chopped, smoked sausage instead of ham. Next time, like other reviewers, I will use less water (or canned chicken broth) and real cream, or half & half instead of evaporated milk.  Loved the smell when I got home from work!  I did all prep the night before; except potatoes, so it was very easy in the morning.  I plan on making this one again!

Very good chowder.  Here are the changes I made.  Added only 1 cup water.  Added 2 finely chopped carrots.  Only used 1 onion.  Used 3 bullion cubes.  Added chopped garlic and Emeril's spice.  Added a can of creamed corn.  Added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese at the same time as the milk.

A hearty and easy soup.  I added only one cup of water, instead of "water to cover" as the recipe called for.  Along with the liquid from the corn and what cooked out of the vegetables and the milk added at the end, that was enough to make a nice thick chowder.  As others had suggested, I added an additional can of cream-style corn for more corn flavor.

I'm a pensioner living in the UK and before tinned sweetcorn arrived here we made soup using a ham hock which we simmered gently for hours until the meat fell off the bone. 
The cooked ham was diced, put to one side then mixed in with the soup along with a swirl of cream when serving. 
The other ingredients (excluding corn, salt & evaporated milk) and using leeks when available, were simmered in the bacon stock until cooked.
This Potato & Ham soup was a family favourite. I have made it all my life but about 30 or so years ago when tinned corn became readily available I starting adding this sometimes for a change.
I'm only giving this 4 stars because I don't think the diced ham can give anything like the strong bacony flavour of cooking your own on the bone!

I thought this was great. Added 4 oz of mushrooms that were going off, and thickened the soup with a cornstarch slurry. I agree with the extra can of corn suggestion. Really an easy and enjoyable soup.

Excellent. Only made minimal changes; first I did add a can of creamed corn to more creamy corn flavor. I was hesitant to add all the water called for b/c of other reviews, but I did add enough to cover slightly and ended up adding a bit more since there was so much stuff in the crock, it really needed the liquid to be a soup instead of ham and veggies floating in a teeny bit of water! Also added just a bit of garlic but other than that wonderful flavor, I don't think it was bland at all (making sure you have adequate chicken boullion, salt and pepper) it tasted exactly what I was hoping a corn chowder would taste like, corny and creamy! I also did add diced carrots with the celery, I thought they were on there but when I went to make it apparently there are no carrots called for. Added barely a t of cornstarch, maybe 1/2 t, before done just to make sure it was nice and creamy, not overly thick. I will definately make this again and again! Was a breeze to throw in the crock in the morning and have a great hearty chowder when I came home. Also did not peel potatoes, completely unneccessary and a waste of time I think.

This was quite good - I used only one onion (not a huge fan) added one more can of corn and a can of creamed corn, then added cornstarch in to thicken...yummy!

This is was awesome slthought I made some changes.    first I stir fried the onions in a stick of butter, then I added about 3 tablespoons of crumbled bacon to the stir fry, then added the potattoes about 2 mins later, stired and covered to cook for about 3 mins, then I transfered all to slow cooker.    I then added a can of corn kernne and a can of creamy corn.  I used c hicken brothe instead of water.  The results was absolutely amazing!!!!

This is a great, quick chowder recipe. I'm not sure why some of the reviews are claiming this to be more like soup than chowder, but it may have something to do with adding water. The recipe calls for chicken boullion cubes, but does not say to dilute in water. Nor does this recipe call for chicken broth. The liquid from the corn and the can of milk are all you need to turn these ingredients into a deliciously thick corn chowder!

DELICIOUS. Made a few changes though based on my tast and what I had on hand. Used Chicken broth instead of water. Sauteed onions, celery, potatos, carrots and several cloves of garlic in butter before placing in the crock pot. Added a bag of frozen corn, a can of creamed corn and 1/2 a ring of kielbasa with salt, pepper, and marjoram. Wow what a meal!

Maybe I'm an idiot, but I've made this recipe twice and failed both times! The first time was my fault, I didn't read the directions carefully enough and added the evaporated milk at the beginning. But the second time I followed it perfectly and it tasted really watered down. Well it really had no flavor. I'm not giving this a third try. I'll just try a different recipe next time.

4 stars because I made some modifications to the posted recipe after reading other reviews. 5 stars with my modifications... I added an extra can of corn plus a can of creamed corn. I substituted 12 oz chicken broth for the water, and used a pint of half and half (plus some corn starch) instead of the evaporated milk. It was sooo good!

I used 7 potatoes since mine seemed on the small side, only one onion, 2 tsp. Better than Bouillon instead of the chicken bouillon cubes, along with all the other ingredients called for except the ham.  I covered with 2 cups water and cooked on HIGH for 3 hours.  Then I added the ham for another hour.  Before adding the evaporated milk, I removed 1 cup broth.  At the end I mashed just a few of the potatoes. I added a little salt and white pepper.  We enjoyed this.

This is perhaps the best soup I have ever made.  I used huge red potatoes (left skins on), cut back on the celery, and used two ears of fresh corn on the cob.  I thickened a little of the room-temperature evaporated milk with some cornstarch = perfectly thickened in a short amount of time.  People, don't be afraid if you have to thicken something .... it is so easy to do!!!  I cannot wait to serve this at dinner to see husband's reaction.  lol

This was okay.  I didn't think it had a lot of taste.  I added carrot and bacon and it still was rather bland.  One thing to note:  Make sure the potatoes and any other veggies you add are completely cooked before adding the evaporated milk.  I tested a couple of pieces of my potatoes and they seemed done, but when I served it, there were still some pieces that were a little crunchy.  So, I turned the heat back on low for a couple of hours.  When I looked at it again, the evaporated milk had burned and formed a brown skin over the top of the chowder.  I ended up tossing the leftovers because of this.  I will probably not make this recipe again.

I added a can of cream style corn and I used frozen shredded potatoes (easier and quicker), and my family loved it.  Garnish with cheddar cheese and serve with cornbread.  I will definately keep this in my rotation.

I just wish this were a little creamier. I too thickened it with some corn starch, omitted the water, nixed the ham and used some garlic powder because I was in a hurry. I only added one onion, and I'm glad I did because when I came home my house smelled of it! I puréed a little bit of to to get the chowder consistency as well. I also used 2 cans of sweet corn and 1 cream corn. :) yum.....!

I love this recipe!  It was so yummy.  I drained my corn before adding it because there was plenty of liquid without it.  I did add some oregano, basil and marjoram.  Two thumbs up.

Delicious!  I used less potoatoes as we are trying to reduce our carbs and increased the corn.  The milk at the end was a great feature to add creaminess to the chowder.

I will be making this again!

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe.  It basically tasted like a thin, tasteless potato soup.  I only used 4 potatoes too, because I knew there was going to be too many...  I even tried to thicken it up with milk and flour, and added frozen corn instead of canned (hate canned).  I also used my homemade chicken broth instead of boullion.  I might try to liven up the leftovers, (and there are A LOT of leftovers) but I'm not sure it's worth it.

This was pretty tasty.  Here are the changes I made--2 med. size red pot., not peeled; 1 onion; 2 stalks celery; 1 can creamed corn; drained corn; 1/4 c. low fat marg.; 1 c. water.  2 cubes bouillon made this too salty.  Next time I'll use 1 can low salt chicken broth and omit water.  My husband thought this was ok but he's not a fan of stew for dinner.  I'll still make this again though because it's different and easy.

I loved this soup. It smelled so good cooking in the crock pot all day, I had a hard time staying out of it. I would try another can of corn next time. I think it just needed that little bit extra. I also added some flour to the soup to thicken it, along with added some chedder cheese to it at the end. Just to melt the cheese. My husband and son are not big soup eaters, but each went back and ate 3 bowls. I had no leftovers... Great recipe...

Good starter.  I also added a can of cream style corn and 4 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken.  Was a hit the tailgate.

Made this again today.  Did not have potatoes, so I substituted two cans of cream of potato soup.  Instead of thickening with cornstarch, I added a can of cream of celery soup too.  Next time I may not  add as much water like some of the other reviewers.  Also added chopped red bell peppers for a bit of color.   It's very good.

This was my first time making corn chowder.  It was delicious!  Great recipe!  Here were my changes: I used a slice of bacon, not ham.  I added cubed chicken as the meat.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth, covered the veggies in water, and used 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  To season, I used paprika, a little sage, a little hot sauce, mustard powder, salt, and pepper.  I will be making this again for sure!

as many others mentioned, you need to SERIOUSLY doctor this to make it good and i wish i had done that. If you make as listed it is not creamy and lacks flavor. Adding flavor after cooking as directed didnt help.

Great recipe...just tweaked it a little.  I left the skins on the potatoes, used bacon instead of ham, 1 can creamed corn and 1 bag frozen corn, and instead of the bouillon and evaporated milk I used 1 can chicken broth and a little starch (without the starch it was too soupy).  Would def. make it again!

Great, easy recipe.  I use chicken instead of ham (Organic skinless boneless legs, more flavor) and to thicken I add a square package of frozen winter squash.  it sweetens it a bit, thickens it, and is healthier than corn starch.

Good to start, but you can substitute bacon in a pinch and I added baked butternut squash cubed and it added flavor and hidden vitamins the kids didn't realize!

Thanks for the great base recipe! My whole family LOVED it! I did make a few changes... I added more celery and used at least 3 cups of frozen corn. I processed about 2 cups of corn before adding to give it a more creamy texture. I melted the margarine and mixed it with 3-4 TBSP of flour to help thicken as well. As others suggested, I added the ham near the end. It turned out great and I would definitely make this easy recipe again!

easy, but very very basic, almost a bit bland.  i added garlic cloves and used chicken instead of ham.  put the chicken in frozen and shredded it right before serving.

I doubled this recipe and threw all the ingredients for this in my crockpot. I used homemade chicken broth, about three cups, added a can of creamed corn and used up the last remains of my Christmas ham (including the bone). I also added a little Frank's, for just a touch of heat.
TIP: Want to thicken up your soup just a little? Use the last of your mashed potatoes that were leftover. Keeps with the theme of the soup and cleans out your fridge at the same time. ;)

Great recipe!  Of course, I made changes with what I had on hand: Less onion, as some people suggested, I added chopped red bell pepper, I used thawed frozen corn, and instead of regular potatoes, I used sweet potatoes (not yams!).  I was worried all day what it would taste like with such a big substitution, but it was great!  I love slow-cooker recipes because I work all day & it's nice to come home to a hot meal!  I even prepared this one the night before & put it in the refrigerator overnight & placed the crock into the base & plugged it in in the morning before I left!

After reading the reviews on this, I used the more flavorful Yukon Gold potatoes, used a can of chicken broth;INSTEAD of the water, added 1/4 tsp.thyme, dash of ground cayenne, extra cup of canned corn, some bacon bits and some green onion in place of SOME of the second onion. I didn't use "salt-cured ham" but rather sugar-cured and smoked, so mine was not too salty at all. I cooked ON HIGH hoping it wouldn't take as long since I started only 5 hours til dinner time. It STILL TOOK 6 hours to cook the celery(I regret just chopping;would of cooked quicker sliced THINLY) and potatoes til soft. I think it had a very good flavor except there was too much sweet onion flavor for our tastes; even though I used SKIMMED evaporated milk. I did add about 2/3 cup of 1/2% milk also, to help make the skimmed a little creamier. It would have been better if I had used whole evaporated milk like recipe called for; but too much fat for my family. Thank you, for sharing. I now know, how to SLOW cook, WITHOUT CURDLING, chowder.

This turned out great. You do have to be careful not to add too much liquid.  It would be easy to end up with runny, thin soup.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and they held up very well after being in the crock pot nearly 11 hours.  I also used 1 cup of fat-free  1/2 & 1/2 instead of evaporated milk.  Will make again.  Thanks for a good recipe!

This "chowder" was very flavorful. I did, as others suggested, and used one can of regular corn and one can of creamed corn. I did find this chowder to be very thin and "liquidy". I tried thickening it by putting a few cups of it in the blender before adding the milk. This helped a little but not nearly enough. Next time I make this, I will not only blend some, but I will add much less water. As other reviewers recommended, I topped the individual servings with some grated cheddar cheese. I also added some fresh chives and some crumbled bacon which added some nice flavor.

This recipe is not bad, but not great.  I think if you used a ham hock instead of cubed ham it would be a lot better.  If I make this again I think I would try that.  It was quick and easy though.

This chowder was really good on a winter day, but did need all day to soften the potatoes.  I only made a few alterations; 2(11oz)cans of corn; l can of chicken broth(instead of bouillon) & of course Cajun seasoning (instead of salt & pepper), since I'm from LA. SDamare(Slidell,LA)

I had vegetarian friends over for dinner, so I didn't add the ham.  I worried that it would taste bland, but it was great.  I definately needs the full 8 - 9 hours otherwise the potatoes won't be done.  I will definately make this again.

This recipe was delicious!  I served with some oven baked bisects and it was a huge hit.  The only thing I changed was that I used half low sodium chicken broth and half water to fill the soup.  I did JUST enough to get the veggies wet.  I will make this again!  A great fall recipe.

It was devoured like it was the last available meal on earth. Use creamed corn, and double the amount. I used chicken instead of ham, but I'm sure either is delicious. Tweak to your taste, of course, but even as is, this recipe is a monster hit.

I made this recipe the other night and had company over.  It was a great success!  The men were licking their bowls!  I made it on high for 6 hours, and didn't use quite as much onion.  It was delicious and I will absolutely make it again.

This was very watery and bland. I added TWO cans of creamed corn and 1 can of water and it was still watery. I tried to thicken it up with some flour, but it didn't really help. You could barely taste the corn. I will not make this again.

Good, but not great. We served it in bread bowls which was fun and added some needed thickness to the broth. I used chicken broth rather than water, and omitted the celery, but otherwise followed the recipe. My family liked it better than I did, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This soup was a bit watery for my taste.  I could have thickened it up with a flour/milk mixture but I didnt want to take away from the original recipe too much.

This was awesome. I did add a can of creamed corn. Also I used 6 oz of heavy whipping cream and 6 oz of skim milk. Also added a rue of 2 tbsp corn starch mixed w/a little water to the milk. Cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 5 hours. Delicious!

This was good with the additions of some spices that other reviews suggested-salt, pepper (I used cayenne), parsley, sage, and crushed garlic.  It's not a 5-star recipe but it's good for a cold day.

This was excellent - usually I'm not a big fan of corn chowder but DH really likes it so I tried it and everyone really liked this!  I only made one change, like many I added a can of creamed corn in addition to the other can of corn - we'll have this again!

What a wonderful chowder! I followed others' advice and added a second can of corn. Also, before adding the evaporated milk, I gave it few zaps with the upright mixer to give it a little thicker consistancy. Thanks for the recipe DonaldB.

Could use a teensy bit more flavor but definitely delicious.  Halved the recipe to fit in my tiny slowcooker and used chicken instead of ham since that's what this Lancaster County native is used to in her corn chowder.  Pretty delicious, will definitely make again.

SO yummy!  I had never had chowder with ham in it, and had not tried it in a slow cooker.  SO GOOD!  I followed another reviewer, as I like more corn, and want it thick.  So I did one can or corn, and two of cream corn.  One can of chicken broth, and no water.  I didn't do celery, but that is because we really aren't fans of celery.  Just a good comfort food!

Easy and filling. I added carrots and some extra potatoes. Also used skim milk instead of evaporated and added a bit of cheddar cheese at the end.

I thought this was veeery good. The butter gave it a chowdery flavor.It does make a lot but my hubby and I love leftovers. Did not have ham, so I cooked a chicken and threw that in. Also, I used frozen corn a lots of it. I also thickend the soup a little, it turned out great, good meal for a cold day

I made this recipe pretty much just as specified, and agree with many other reviewers-- it needed something more and it's more of a soup.  I used Yukon gold potatoes since that's what I keep on hand.  My only subsitutions were a little less onion, since I'm not a big onion person and skimmed evaporated milk.  Next time I make this (and I will, because my husband loves corn chowder) I will not use water and bouillon cubes but a can of low sodium broth, more corn (and I'll try the can of creamed corn), 2% evaporated milk for a little more richness, and I'll cut the butter in half.  Maybe add a little extra ground pepper.  Serve it with crumbled crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, and scallions as toppings and it would be great!!

I agree with many others that this is a good starting place for corn chowder. I used 2 lbs of uncooked, cubed chicken instead of ham, and left out the bouillon. Following the advice of many other reviewers, I just added a cup and a half of water, instead of covering the veggies, and then used 2 cups of heavy cream and 3 Tbsp corn starch after it had cooked for 8 hours. It is AMAZING with sourdough bread!

This was a great recipe to use for a guidline.  I did everything the recipe said, but only one onion which was more than enough.  I also added: carrot,extra can of corn cream style,touch of garlic, and sage.  Also I only cooked for 5 hrs on high.  Also I used only chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  I would add slightly less liquid next time as this turned out to be more soupy than chowdery.

I made this corn chowder today for supper. It is excellent. This is my third time making this recipe. The first two times I made it I used ham in it but today I decided to put shredded rotisserie chicken in it. I also used some of the other reviewers suggestions such as addding carrot and using 1 can of cream style corn in it. I also used chicken broth instead of water and bouillion. I also added some spices to it. I added marjoram, sage, basil and oregano and I made a slurry with two tablespoons of cornstarch with a little bit of water and added that in with the milk. It turned out awesome. It was was very creamy and a little thick the perfect consistency. Thanks for a great recipe.

I saw this recipe in my email this morning as the recipe of the day.  Not knowing what to cook for dinner, I thought...great I have all those ingredients...I'll give it a go.  In 20 minutes I had it in the crock pot.  As others suggested, I added 2 cloves garlic and  4 diced carrots and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also used 1 can of corn and 1 can of creamed corn.  I added the ham about an hour before serving.  I had no evaporated milk, so I added about 1/4 cup skim milk and a fairly large "blob" of sour cream.  I added quite a bit of pepper and no additional salt. I also stick blended about 1 1/2 cups of the soup just before serving.  Perfect consistency and delicious.  Outstanding and will make again.  Great way to use a little leftover ham which had been in my freezer since Thanksgiving!!  Thank you Donald B

This was good.  I took the advice of others and used 1 can of whole kernel corn and 1 can of cream-style corn.  I also waited until there was only 2 hrs of cooking time left to add the ham and it wasn't rubbery at all.  Overall a good recipe.

This is the easiest and most delicious quiche I have made. What to do when you run out of flour...replace with corn meal.  It is then even more delish. Frummie

delicious !  i used the  extra corn other reviewers suggested  but i also switched heavy whipping cream for the can of evaporated milk and used a corn starch slurry to thicken it a bit and used a bag of frozen crinkle cut carrots for color.  all the members of my family loved it!! I will definitely be making this again!

I took the advice of some of the other reviews. I left out the water, and ham. I also chose to use less onion. I added fresh chopped carrots, used new potatoes, chicken broth,  thyme, marojoram, oregano, 2 % milk instead of evaporated milk, and added cornstartch to thicken (about 2 1/2 tablespoons). For an added kick I also added cayenne pepper. The chowder tastes amazing! I will use it again :o)

Great recipe. Made some adjustment from reading others recommendations. Used Chicken stock instead of water to cover potatoes. Added cooked bacon instead of ham and used heavy cream instead of evap. milk. Used 2 cans of sweet corn and 1 can of cream corn. I also added a tablespoon of diluted cornstarch in water to thicken. Did't need to add any salt at all. In fact I will use only 1 chicken bullion next time.

I liked this recipe. I took the advice of others and added a can of cream corn and cornstarch. I added 5 cups of water, next time I might cut it down to 3 or 4.  Served with campground cornbread.

Great chowder! I changed the recipe a little.  I added 2 14 oz cans of mexicorn, mushroom, and carrots, and cut the potatoes down by 2.  I also used 1%milk instead and warmed it up with some flour before putting it in the crock pot and I added a cup of shredded cheese at the same time.  Everyone loved it!

SUPER!!  We used this recipe in a family cook-off and it received high scores from everyone from little kids to grandpa and grandma.  Basically followed the recipe, but took into account a few other reviewers.  I didn't add quite as much liquid (chicken stock), 2 cans of regular corn and 2 of creamed corn.  At the end I added 1 C of heavy cream (all I had on hand).  We loved this, even my picky eater son, and this will go into our soup rotation!!

Made a few changes - used only 1 onion, skipped the ham since I didn't have any as well as the celery (which I just don't like,) 1 can corn + 1 can creamed as per other's reviews (though next time I might even add another can of corn, but drain it,) used chicken broth instead of water & added in corn starch & half & half per other reviews.  Only problem w/ mine (& it was my fault) was putting to much chicken broth in so it was more of a soup texture than chowder texture.  But overall good tasting & will make again - it's a good & relatively easy crockpot recipe & was exactly what I was looking for.

Used extra corn and cream of corn, plus half and half.  Very water, I should have used corn starch or flower.  Also very bland.  If I can find a way to spice it up I'll make it again since it makes a lot and would be good for freezing.

I did not care for this recipe. I thought the broth was far too thin, I had to add corn starch and it was still missing something...definitely not enough corn. I would probably not try this one again.

This was a big hit in my house.  I added some leftover asparagus toward the last half hour, and it was a colorful addition.  My kids especially liked it and asked for seconds.

Delicious.  I added more ham to mine, and it doesn't really have enough corn to be called a "corn chowder".  Make sure to pick the small waxy potatoes, I used baking potatoes for mine and it wasn't bad, but could have had a better mouth feel.

I thought this was very good.  I used already cooked and cubed potatoes - the"Simply Potatoes" brand instead of peeling and cubing raw potatoes.  Worked well.  I would add less water than this recipe called for though.

This was an excellent meal on a cold winter's night!  We substituted apple sausage for the ham which added to the flavour.  I left the water about 1 inch below covering (recipe says to cover) and the texture was rich an creamy. Thanks!

I cooked this for 8 hours on low, came home and added the evaporated milk and let it cook for another 30 minutes like the recipe said, but it was still quite watery, so I added some cornstarch.  Next time, I'll also add twice as much ham, but that's just a personal preference.  All in all it was a good week night meal.  A little more prep time in the morning than I like, but I made it work.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Like another reveiewer on here I am also from Louisiana (Slidell to boot)I cajunized it a little. I put in some cajun seasonings and instead of ham I used tasso (which, to you uninitiated, is a lean, cured, cajun pork). I also thickened it a bit with a dash of corn flower. This ones going to be a staple.

I used smoked turkey sausage instead of ham, and added carrots, & 1/4 lb velveeta.
Hubby liked it, and it had good flavor just nothing to write home about. I won't make it again.

Our family enjoyed this chowder! The suggestion of adding shredded cheddar cheese was a good one. We added it on top of our soup at the dinner table. We may double the amount of corn next time, but otherwise a great recipe.

I thought this soup delicious, hubby didn't. oh well... I'll make it again for myself and freeze it in portions to enjoy for noon meals. I used no salt corn, plus added creamed corn for a thickener, less onion and a few dashes of paprika.

Definitely was a big hit here.  With a 5 year old daughter who turns her nose up at the word onions, she had thirds of this chowder.  My husband and my 2 and 3 year old loved it too.

This was really good, but I did change things a little. I used chicken stock to cover in place of the water and bouillon. I added a couple cloves minced garlic, in place of the evaporated milk, I used half and half and sprinkled some sharp cheddar and chives on top before serving. Very easy and very good. It's a keeper!

I used already cubed ham and frozen kernel corn.  I loved the broth because it was light but so flavorful.  It is also lower in fat & calories but you wouldn't know it.

Very good and easy. It was too thin for our liking. I transfered it to a pot and added a box of Jiffy Corn Bread mix and let it simmer for fifteen minutes and it was perfect. It reheats great.

I made this for a dinner party just a couple of days ago.  I loved how easy it was to prepare!  I put all of the ingredients in the crockpot and didn't fool with it the rest of the day.  The chunks of potatoes, celery, ham and onion were a hit with my 2 year-old, who loves "chunky" soup.  My guests loved it and all asked for the recipe.  It is easy to make a low-fat version, too, by using lowfat margarine and fat free evaporated milk.  That's what I did, and the taste was still fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.

Used a litre carton of chicken stock, a cup of water & 1 chicken bouillon cube, instead of the “water to cover”. Also used 1.5 cups of real pre made bacon bits, instead of the ham. Used regular milk & thickened the soup with a bit of corn starch. Everyone loved it.

Yes I am usually not a soup fancier, but this soup really turned out very well. i modified the recipes for 2 people and instead of chicken bouillon used low sodium beef broth . Lots of room to improvise.

This was a great soup to come home to after a long day of work.  I did modify it a bit, to make it vegetarian.  Left out the ham, and used veggie bouillon instead of chicken for my kids sake. Sprinkled a little cheese on it when serving and we were all pretty impressed.  (although hubby and I both agree it would've been better with the meat)

I really enjoy this recipe! I am just learning to cook and so I chose this recipe because it has simple ingredients, and little work. What I also like about this recipe is that it is easy to add or remove items to your tastes. I typically make it with bacon as this is what I have on hand. I also find that adding a second can of cream corn is good, especially if you don't have or don't want to use the milk. Very yummy! Smells and tastes excellent.

this was ok not anything special.  I have never had corn chowder so I dont really have anything to judge the taste by.  We love corn and especially creammed corn.  I think maybe t would be better if it was made with creammed corn instead of whole kernel.

Was in the mood for corn chowder & this looked like a good place to start.  

Here are the changes I made: Made 6 slices of bacon (reserved it for the top); Used a little of the bacon grease to saute the onions; Added some carrots; Added some crushed red pepper; Added can of cream corn; Omitted the ham; Used one vegetable bullion & one chicken bullion (ran out of chicken).  

Next time I think I will drain the corn and add a little of instant mashed potatoes if it is thick at the end. 
 
I served it with bacon, cheese & osyter crackers.  My kids loved it! Thank you.

Very good - husband and 5-year-old both ate three bowls of it.  My changes - from reading comments: added a can of creamed corn, added some dried sage, did not use water/bouillon to cover - instead used 1 cup of chicken broth, made it without ham - added a little crumbled bacon and shredded cheese when serving, added a .5 tsp of corn starch when added can of evap milk.  Great consistency.  Hardest part was chopping the potatoes, which I left the skin on!

I had to make a few revisions to this recipe, and that is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. I used a bag of frozen corn instead of canned (all I had). From the beginning, I could tell that this would be more of a soup than a chowder, so I did add a cornstarch/water slurry and used an immersion blender for half of the soup at the end. This helped it thicken. I think that next time, I'll use even less broth for cooking. I added marjoram, basil and oregano to season. Very filling - and I'll make again!

Made this for a large group and everyone loved it.  I so appreciated all the reviews and included some of the suggestions when I made it, like adding a can of creamed corn and not putting the ham in till about 2-3 hours before it was done.  As it was getting closer to the end I also tried to mash the potatoes a bit with a potato masher just to make the chowder a bit less chunky. Overall this was a big hit!!

I would make this again. I added a can of creamed corn as well as garlic and dried basil. I also added 1/2 pound of Velveeta cheese during the last 30 minutes of cooking. I added the can of milk in the beginning had no issues in the end. My kids liked it, that says a lot.

Very yummy, but like most others I put my own spin on it.  Used chicken broth, garlic and half creamed corn.  I added some hot sauce for a little extra kick.  Since I prefer a thicker style soup, before I aadded the evap milk, I took out several cups of soup and put it in the blender then added it back in.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good!  I substituted the evaporated milk for 1/2 and 1/2 and I added Sriracha for some heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was delicious! Next time I will use another tin of corn, though, and proper evaporated milk (didn't have any so used fresh milk).

Very hearty, easy enough to prepare and smelled great cooking. Also, it was nice to try something a little different from our standard fare, but it was missing something.  I probably won't make this again.

This recipe was great. I love corn, so it was perfect.  I changed a couple things though: 3 cans of corn (two whole cernal, one cream style), no celery (yuk), and used turkey ham rather than pork ham.  I also added corn starch when I added the evap. milk to thicken the chowder.  I also added hot peppers, cumin, chili powder and any other seasonings I love.  PERFECT CHOWDER!

The whole family enjoyed the soup. But, there were far too many onions for our taste. I will use 1/4 the onions next time.

Good chowder.  The ham complements the flavors wonderfully!  I found it a little too thin so I removed some of the broth and added flour to thicken.  I would suggest using fresh corn when in season.

I made this one night and my boy of less than 2 years just loved it. It was easy and ready for us when we got home from work. I think everyone will really enjoy this. It is a big hit in my house.
