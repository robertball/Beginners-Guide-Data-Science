Wow, these were delicious!!!  I made some changes based on preference (way less sugar- 1/2 cup turbinado is the only sweetener I used, whole wheat flour in place of the white, extra baking powder in place of the baking soda).  Then I made some changes based on what I had on hand (grapeseed oil in place of canola, almond milk in place of the coconut milk, and ginger in place of the nutmeg.
They turned out just lovely and my family was very pleased. Thank you for a delicious recipe!!!

I know this post says vegan muffins but both white and brown sugar contain bone char from cows and other animals. I loved the recipe but added an alternative for the sugar. I just thought I would mention it since a lot of people are unaware of the bone char in the white and brown sugars.

Loved this recipes but changed it up a little. Instead of the 1 cup of canola oil I used 1/2 c. coconut oil and 1/2 c. applesauce. I also added 1 c. of chopped walnuts. And I topped them with a streusel topping of 1/4 c flour, 1/4 c each brown and white sugar with 1 Tb. vegan margarine. And instead of 12 muffins- it made 24 big ones.- thrilled with the recipe.

I just made these muffins and for the life of me can not figure out how it says it makes a dozen, that is exactly what I wanted but by the time I finished filling my muffin pan of 12  I still had half of the batter left.  I ended up putting it in 3 small loaf pans.

Great recipe!  I didn't have any eggs to make my usual banana bread recipe, and now I'm not sure i'll go back to that one.  I substituted vegetable oil for canola oil, and added in 3 scoops of Greek honey yogurt and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.    The muffins turned out great - even the skeptical husband loved them!

Very good and moist. I used 1 cup applesauce instead of oil. These MUST be cooked as muffins! I used a loaf pan and it doubled the cook time and the outside became overcooked and hard. A great muffin recipe!

its the best banana  bread recipe i've had.  I also halved the white sugar, probably could have halved the brown sugar as well.  This is going to be my go to recipe from now on.

First off, the smell of these muffins cooking was heavenly. The taste and texture were terrific, and I'll definitely be making them again. I followed the recipe exactly as listed. The only other comment I can add is that there was enough batter to fill 12 muffin cups plus half of a bread pan.

What an easy and great recipe! My family loved these. Note: I altered it slightly to reduce the amount of sugar and oil and they still came out moist and delicious! 

My alteration: I used 5 very ripe bananas (which are sweeter) and only used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of the 1 cup this recipe calls for. I also substituted 1/2 the amount of oil for applesauce (so 1/2 cup oil; 1/2 cup applesauce (which also adds an element of sweetness)). I will do the same method next time or possibly use coconut oil instead of canola oil as I see another user has done. Yum!

I wanted to bake for my daughter and her vegan college roommate. This was a perfect recipe! The only change I made was to add 1 cup of vegan chocolate chips. This might be why I had enough batter left over to make a medium loaf cake too. I found that one overfull icecream scoop per muffin was just right. Ten minutes in the pan before turning out on the rack worked, with just a slight amount of prying. I'm bringing to recipe with me when I deliver the muffins to prove that they're vegan!

These were very good! Flavorful and not too heavy. I didn't have coconut milk so I used soy, and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I think I'll try all applesauce next time, because there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for a wonderfully tasty vegan recipe.

I made these last night and was blown away by how good they are. I've been baking vegan goods for almost thirty years, and I've never produced a recipe that worked this well. I suspect the coconut milk and oil make a huge difference and am going to try them in my other recipes.
After reading the other reviews, I used 2 Cups white flour and 1 Cup whole wheat pastry flour. I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 Cup. I did half and half coconut oil and canola oil (and found out that coconut oil has to be melted if it's solidified). I also got 24 muffins from the recipe. I'm using regular-sized tins; maybe the recipe refers to the oversize tins.
Next time, I plan to throw in some walnuts, dried fruits, and maybe some chocolate chips.

I ran out of eggs and had very ripe bananas that I needed to use.  I found this recipe and just happened to have coconut milk in the pantry.  These turned out to be the best banana muffins! I made exactly as written.  They came out perfect!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Thought these were great, used half whole wheat flour half all purpose, substituted almond milk instead, and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup total, easy recipe!

Great tasting but something I noticed about this recipe that I wanted to mention: I believe the creator used a large muffin tin, because in my standard muffin tin it made 18 muffins and they took about 18 mins to cook, not 30. So make adjustments if you use a standard muffin tin.

The best vegan banana muffin recipe that I have tried.  I halved the recipe because it made a large amount of batter and I wanted to eat the muffins fresh out of the oven.  I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Used coconut cream instead of coconut milk (which was of a thicker consistency).  Beautifully golden on top once baked.

This is my go to recipe when I have some over-ripe bananas! I usually sub half the flour for oats and every once in a while I’ll add a handful of mini chocolate chips. You can also definitely get away with cutting the white sugar in half. Always a winner! :)

Excellent banana bread recipe! Due to on hand ingredients, I used almond milk and melted coconut oil. I was also about a banana short, I'd say. I mashed the two bananas that I had in a two cup measure and then added applesauce to make two cups. Because I was having a chocolate craving, I mixed wet and dry ingredients together before adding cinnamon and nutmeg, split the batter in half, and added the spices to half and dark chocolate chips to the other. Both came out fabulous! I baked them in loaf pans instead of as muffins. It took about 45-50 minutes for them to cook through. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe - delicious and easy to make! I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and it turned out great! I also used less sugar than stated and used a mixture of coconut sugar and brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Oh, my, god. Is all I can say! I am in love. I'll be making these all the time. 
I had to make a couple of changes to avoid a grocery store run. I used coconut oil instead of canola, and I actually used pumpkin pie spice instead of pure nutmeg. 
Also, I split the batch and added chocolate chips to half. Either way, the muffins are perfect. Thank you for this recipe!

After reading the reviews, decided to try this as a new friend is vegan. I did cut back a bit on the sugar. Used olive oil cause it was all I had and substituted almond milk for the coconut milk. I also added some ground ginger too. It was really good!! Everyone loved the muffins!!! Even the kids!! Want to try it again with halfing the oil with some applesauce like some of the other reviewers and adding a little vanilla. Thanks for this great recipe!!

These were incredible! The only thing I changed was 1/2 cup white sugar to 1 cup brown sugar and for the salt & spices I just sort of eye balled it and AMAZING! They are good enough to eat without vegan butter! I usually can't eat much fruit raw or it will upset my stomach, ESPECIALLY bananas but these sat just fine. Thank you very much for this recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I am the only vegan in my home.   I made these and loved them.   The other non vegan family members scarfed them down to and we're surprised to find out that they were vegan.   I substituted soy milk because I didn't have coconut milk.   Yum yum. Thanks MIEKO1

BE AWARE this recipe as written makes 24 MUFFINS not 12. They are delicious, but now I get to find out how well they freeze. I used vanilla soymilk, cut the white sugar in half and substituted applesauce for most of the oil. Added chopped walnuts and topped with cinnamon sugar before baking. You would never know they are vegan!

These were great!  I used 1/2 the sugar called for in the recipe.  Also I used whole wheat flour.  Excellent and really moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made the per recipe. They have great flavor. The amount of spices is just right. However I am giving only four stars because they were I bit too moist and way too sweet. I think I will try again cutting down on sugar, oil and banana.

These are the only banana muffins I will make from now on! I did add chopped walnuts and also the streusel topping that another review had suggested. My whole family LOVED them!

Good! Thanks for the recipe. I used vanilla in place of nutmeg as I didn't have any, avocado oil in place of canola, and coconut/almond milk.  The batch made 18 muffins.  I ate one to try my handiwork and then I looked at the nutritional info. 450 calories??? Something like that.  I'm on a diet and now I feel like today is ruined. So anyway I hope that isn't right   Good recipe.

I substitued organic original soymilk that I had, for the coconut milk. I substituted sucanat for the regular sugar, and just an organic cane sugar for the lesser amount of brown sugar. I used 1/2 the amount of "true" cinnamon, and grated nutmeg enough times just till I smelled it. THose are the main differences. I used unbleached, unbromated flour, aluminum free baking powder, expeller pressed safflower oil and Himalayan salt.
These are absolutely awesome! And they are moist the next day! Probably because of the amount of oil. Worth every calorie.

I used 100% whole wheat flour, half the oil with applesauce. Next time I'll half the sugar and the ginger. I used an ice cream scoop to fill the muffin tins. Done in 19 minutes.

great eggless recipe where the milk can be subbed as well. I love the cinnamon and nutmeg. Only thing we do differently is add dark chocolate chips :)

Updating four years later - still my favorite banana muffin recipe  - I do add a cap full of apple cider vinegar and a tsp of vanilla to mimic buttermilk and a little bit of sweetness. If I'm using a milk substitute that is vanilla enhanced then I won't add the vanilla.

Part of my family is dairy free, so this was perfect for us. I substituted almond milk for the coconut milk and it was great! I have a large family but I did not end up needing to double it. I am so making this again!

This recipe is amazing! you would never know that they are vegan and not conventional muffins. I used almond milk because of a coconut allergy, but they came out perfect anyway. Great banana flavor, super moist with great texture. Will definitely make again. This made 18 muffins for me.

These are delicious. I used applesauce in place of the oil.  And used 3/4 cup white sugar. I made a loaf. And muffins with the rest of the mix.  But the flavor is more Apple cinnamon with a hint of banana.

Jan 03, 2020 I had 12 over ripe bannanas and a son who is VEGAN so I made these
I accidentally used my SILK soy vanilla milk instead of his OATLY milk. No eggs, no cow milk.
Added walnuts and these are the most moist scrumptious bannana nut muffins I've made yet.
Second 3x batch again 2.1.2020 used coconut oil and warm ingredients.

This is the best vegan banana muffin recipe I’ve tried! My muffins usually come out a bit oily, so I reduced the oil by 1/4 a cup and the muffins came out fluffy and delicious! The recipe adds as a good base for change; I added some oats into the batter and topped each muffin with granola before baking, and they were amazing. 10/10 recommend!!

Was a fairly good base recipe, substituted 3/4 coconut and 1/4 avocado oil for the canola (and substituted about half brown sugar instead of white); added 2tsp of Vanilla extract and a splash of black walnut (for personality idk) and they were bomb. next time would try walnut pieces as well.

Very nice recipe! I made some changes and loved it: used only 1/2 cup of xylitol instead of 1&1/2 cup sugar. Only 1/2 cup oil ( used coconut instead of canola) and 1/2 cup of home made apple compote. Added some almond flakes and cranberries on top of each muffin. Result was perfect for my taste. If i have used the original sugar quantity for sure it would have been too sweet for me.

Excellent! Half the recipe makes 12 muffins.  The only ingredient changes I made were to use Unsweetened Almond Milk instead of Coconut Milk and I added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I baked for 25 minutes instead of 30.  They came out nice and moist.

This recipe makes 20 big fluffy muffins. I baked for 30 minutes and they were done perfectly. I filled silicone muffin liners about 7/8 of the way full and these rose nicely without going all over the place. I subbed 1c whole wheat flour with 2c all purpose flour and added 1/3c chopped walnuts. Will be wonderful for Thanksgiving guests this year.

I halved the recipe since many previous bakers have said it makes more than a dozen.
I use 1/2 cup of Almond Meal and 1 cup of All Purpose Flour
1/4 cup Coconut Sugar + 1 tsp of Agave Syrup
1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of 1 cup of canola oil
1 tsp of Vanilla
1 tsp of Ceylon Cinnamon (doesn't have the heat as regular cinnamon, better in baked goods)
Mix all the wet ingredients first, stir it until it looks almost completely blended; stir all the dry ingredients together too and then mix the wet and dry ingredients.
And followed the rest of the instructions.
My family was already milling around the oven as it was baking.

Do to other food restrictions I had to use gluten free flour and almond meal (1 1/2 cups of each) and reduce the sugar (1/2 cup brown sugar). I also only had 1/2 cup of coconut oil. 
They turned out great! I got 24 normal sized muffins and 12 mini muffins.

This recipe is a keeper!  The muffins turn out very moist and delicious.  I use 1/2 cup of raw cane sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar.  I skip the brown sugar.  Instead of canola oil, I use 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I also add walnuts because I love them.

I was a little on the fence about this one as there were a couple of things that bothered me, but the taste and texture are really good. A nice fluffy muffin that is so moist. I think I would like to try this with a whole can of coconut milk next time and less canola oil as well as a little less sugar.

These were so fun and easy to make, I substituted the coconut milk with unsweetened almond milk and they turned out just fine. On the second batch, I sprinkled a couple chocolate chips across the top of each one and they were FANTASTIC! I highly recommend using this recipe instead of throwing your overripe bananas away :)

These were delicious! I had four ripe bananas so I ended up with 12 muffins and six mini loaves. I substituted brown sugar for the white and almond milk for coconut milk. I was surprised to see nutmeg in the ingredients but they were really delicious!

Moist and just the right amount of sweet. Have never made banana bread into muffins before, but these turned out to be addicting. I took three down in 5 minutes. Haha. Will def make again and again.

Excellent recipe. Substituted coconut milk with almond milk, and instead of 1 cup canola oil I used only 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup applesauce. Makes 24 very, very delicious muffins! Also makes the house smell amazing.

VERY deliciously moist.  Agree with several others who have commented about the amount of sugar being too much.  When I make these again I will definitely cut this in half and maybe substitute with raw sugar.  This made 30 muffins, not 12!

Really enjoyed these! I did use 2/3c white sugar and 1/3c packed brown sugar instead of the whole amount as I thought that would make them much too sweet (they are perfectly sweet enough with reduced sugar). Also used 1/2c butter flavor coconut oil and 1/2c applesauce. Even with subs they came out delicious. Next time I plan to do half all-purp flour and half whole wheat. These would benefit greatly from some flax added somewhere (perhaps two flax eggs, 1/4c oil, and 1/4c applesauce?) and some walnuts for healthy fats. I’ll make these again and mess around with it a bit. I loved the amount of banana and flavor! Most banana muffins don’t call for as much mashed banana and it’s a shame! 


This made 12 decently sized muffins (3/4 full) and a loaf of banana bread, I don’t think I could have fit the batter in only 12 muffins!

I only had 1 cup flour so also used 2 cup almond flour, also no nutmeg, so used half-tsp ginger. I used stevia instead of white sugar.
Loved this muffin, rose beautifully, great texture.
p.s.
I had leftover coconut milk from the can - I heated it, added melted 3.5 oz  dark chocolate, stirred in walnuts, let it set in fridge - enjoying it now, it's yummy.

These were very tasty. I made them for a vegan friend of mine and I was surprised at how good they were. Based on other reviews, I didn’t add all of the sugar – about 3/4 cup instead of one full cup. They weren’t too sweet so I could go either way. I substituted coconut oil for the canola oil, and added chopped walnuts to half of the mix. It made 16 large muffins.

Used soya milk instead of coconut milk (it's what I had on hand). Came out amazing!! I'm not even vegan (made this recipe because I had no butter but had already defrosted my bananas). Better than every non-vegan recipe I've tried.

This is a fantastic recipe and I've made it several times, always to rave reviews. Here are my changes - I do 50% white flour, 50% wheat to boost fiber and protein. I replace half the oil with applesauce, and I do 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 sugar total because that is plenty sweet in my opinion. 
One thing I will say is that I think the cooking time is way off. I bake for around 18 minutes when the toothpick comes out clean and slightly browned on top, and they always come out moist yet fully baked through. Because of this I think baking it 30-35 min is too long.

These are the best banana muffins I've ever had! Soft, dense, perfectly flavored, just so good! I used large muffin cups, filled them 2/3 full and got 11. They aren't the healiest, so if you're a health nut, you may want to substitute applesauce for some of the oil, and reduce the sugar a tad, but I made them as written, and wouldn't change a thing.

These were easy and delicious and made 24 muffins for me. I iced them with a vanilla vegan buttercream and instead of using coconut milk I used Banana Milk—-a boxed non dairy real banana-infused almond milk. Everyone loved them, even the non-vegans!

Great muffins, these were a hit with the entire family including a 7 and 4 year old.  Our 4 year old is allergic to dairy, so these kinds of recipes are fantastic for us.  I wasn't sure if the recipe meant 2 cups of bananas that are then mashed, or 2 cups of mashed bananas.  But all we had were 3 old bananas that were 2 cups mashed down into 1 cup, and they worked perfectly.  With regular muffin pans used, we got 2 dozen muffins (cups filled 1/2 way) and 8 mini muffins from the batter.  Will definitely make again - thank you for the recipe!

My husband and I are trying to eat healthier and lower our calories so I made a few adjustments and the muffins were wonderful. I substituted plain almond milk for coconut milk, whole wheat flour for white, used applesauce instead of oil and replaced the sugars with 3/4 cup Stevia. I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts for flavor.

I had some frozen banana's and wanted to make muffins, but then they only made a little over a cup of mashed banana, so I added strawberry fruit spread to make up the difference and reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  Wow were they good!!  I did have to cook them for the full 35 minutes, but they were so light and moist, and the strawberry gave it an extra fruity taste.  The recipe was very easy and fast to make and the result was really exceptional.

I made this recipe vegan and used monk fruit sugar instead of regular sugars and added walnuts and chopped dates.  Excellent.

I  used1 1/2 c  gluten free basic flour and 1 1/2  coconut flour, and used almond milk. I couldnt bear to use 1 cup of canola oil, so I put 1/2  cup of oil and another 1/2 c of almond milk. I put  some blueberries in too. The family loved them!

I’m cut the canola back to 2/3 cups and increased the coconut milk to1 1/2 cups.  Fluffy, slightly spongy, not too sweet and perfectly seasoned.  Delicious!

I did reduce the amount of sugar a little bit. I thought they were perfect, but my husband wished they were sweeter. Personal preference, I suppose. I had more batter than would fit in the 12 muffin cups, so I filled 6 more in another pan. The other 6 were much smaller and denser, so I would recommend, if you have extra batter, to fill the extra muffin cups just like the first 12 instead of trying to split the remaining batter and having very small muffins. Fill those cups up! They’re so good!!

Following another commenter's advice, I cut the sugar by half.
I also used soy milk instead of coconut.
To make 12 muffins out of this recipe the muffins would be very large. I used a regular muffin tin and got 22.
In my oven - 175 fan-forced - they took 20 minutes.
With these adaptations the muffins turned out really well!

If you use all natural cane sugar it's vegan no bone char. Cane sugar has brown color to it white sugar isn't naturally white. And there is organic brown sugar you can use got vegan. Not all companies is bone char. But I love this recipe and I used all natural sugars.

We loved these muffins--even my husband who isn't anywhere close to being vegan!  I didn't have any nutmeg though, so I left it out. And I added toasted walnuts to half of the batch, because I like the crunch. Otherwise I prepared them exactly as stated. Yummy!

omitted all white sugar (but left the brown sugar in)
2/3 cup oil instead of 1 cup oil
3 medium bananas

turned out well, would make again, maybe reducing the brown sugar as well

First things first, it makes more than 12. Have two muffin pans ready. Second, this recipe at its core is so simple that I know it can be versatile. I can probably add chocolate chips or blueberries and not worry. And since my eggs usually go bad before I can use them, this is now officially my go to muffin recipe. Would take this any day over a regular muffin recipe. Oh, and they freeze nicely too!

These are always amazing. Bananas are a MUST - but I usually add chocolate chunks or chips, or blueberries. Amazing :) I cook a little longer to get the top a bit crusty.

just made these- took others advice and changed a few things.  I cut the sugars in half, used ginger instead of nutmeg and replaced the oil with applesauce.  I cooked the muffins in my cast iron muffin pan with paper liners (they stuck a lot), and made a loaf too.  Loaf took about 20 mins longer.  Will make again- may cut the sugar further because the applesauce added a lot of sweet.   Thanks for the recipe!

Giving this 4 stars because I made some changes that I know were necessary to a 5-star recipe (for me... we're all different!) :)
First, from other helpful reviews, it seemed these were cooked in large muffin tins, vs. the standard cupcake-sized ones. 20 minutes is perfect for the smaller size that many people are used to. 
I could tell these -for me- were going to be too heavy on the spices and salt. I reduced the salt a tad, and cut down the cinnamon by 1/2t  & nutmeg by 1/4t. I also went a tiny bit lighter on the sugar. Result was a perfect, still VERY cinnamony muffin that I am quite fond of! Thanks to the submitter for the inspiration!

These were one of the best muffins I ever made. I made 6 plain then to the remainder  of the batter I added chopped walnuts and vegan chocolate chips. 

Note:  I used large muffins tins (6). Used paper liners and lightly sprayed bottom of liner.  The recipe made 12 large muffins.

Followed the recipe exactly. The muffins came out moist and tasty.  My vegan grandson really enjoyed them.  I had enough batter left over for another dozen muffins, so the next time I will half the recipe. Thank you for the recipe!

Super tasty, and you can’t even tell it’s vegan! I added some walnuts on top for flavor. I used soy milk instead, and it tasted fine.

So delicious. husband loved and said it tastes like it came from a bakery. ^_^  Used almond milk I had on hand instead of the coconut milk and assuming it lost nothing in the translation. Also added tiny little chocolate chips a 10 oz bag and vegan because I love chocolate in my banana bread like my mom used to make. I was able to make 12 muffins filled to the top and plenty of leftover batter to make an additional small 6 inch loaf.

Great recipe!!! I’ve made it a dozen times and have slowly reduced the amount of sugar each time. 
I now add ZERO sugar to the batter. You will need 3-5 bananas to make 2 cups and when I’m short on bananas I make up the difference by adding unsweetened applesauce. I only have cow’s milk and I’ve used 1% and skim, both work great. I also use avocado oil instead of canola. When I’m short on avocado oil I make up the rest with melted coconut oil. I only add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and no nutmeg. I do add some oats and a tiny sprinkle of sugar on top before baking. Dried cranberries are also a nice touch! These muffins freeze really well and you get the carby comfort with less guilt in the morning! This recipe makes 18 muffins and I only bake it for 25 mins at 350 degrees. :)

These are the best banana muffins ever!  You can’t even tell they’re vegan.  They had a slightly crispy top and a moist center!

This was so easy to make. I halved the ingredients and still had enough mixture to make 10 good sized muffins. I didn't use cinnamon or nutmeg but I added chopped walnuts. They were delicious and great with a cup of tea!

I half'ed the recipe, used 1/2 cup of coconut sugar only, 2 bananas, used sunflower oil instead of canola, whole wheat flour instead of regular, soy milk, added vanilla, and 1 cup of chopped walnuts. Baked exactly for 26 minutes (seems to be the perfect time for muffins in my oven), and they turned out delicious!!! I used foil tins, sprayed them with coconut oil, came up with 11 muffins. Amazing recipe! Will definitely be making it again!!!

These are AMAZING. My non vegan kiddos can’t stop eating them, and have requested that they become a staple. I added pecans, and I’m going to try substituting applesauce for the oil. I highly recommend these!

Great recipe.  I halved the white sugar. I used silicone baking cups, so the baking time was shorter than 30 minutes.  I actually got 2 dozen out of this recipe.  Will make this again.

Excellent as is, or sometimes we add flax meal and coconut. The muffins look and taste great topped with a few pumpkin seeds and sprinkled coconut too. This one is a family favorite!

I made these muffins (keep in mind I am no baker) for my son who’s one years old and has a dairy and egg allergy. They were super easy to make. I had all the ingredients in my pantry, and my son loves them! I didn’t add nutmeg due to his age and substituted rice milk for coconut but sill turned out great! I highly recommend this recipe!

I had one old banana left so halved the recipe and it worked a treat for 6 fluffy muffins. Replaced canola oil with rapeseed oil which seems to have worked. And sprinkled the top with oats to give it a coffee shop look!

I was surprised by how good these muffins were since I don't normally eat vegan food. I used 1 cup brown sugar and eliminated the white sugar altogether and then the sweetness level was just perfect for my family.

Visiting my vegan neighbours today so thought I'd try a new vegan recipe. Can't keep taking the same one. :)  The tweaks I made were: 2 C white and 1C whole wheat (which is something I tend to do with most recipes calling for all white); 2 smashed bananas and 2 smashed kiwi (removed pith); instead of brown sugar, I had some leftover dried up fudge from the holidays (not mine :0) so I pounded it down to crumbles and added that. Otherwise, recipe followed as shown. These are incredibly tasty and moist. This can be used as an excellent base for other flavoured vegan muffins. Thanks so much!

These were wonderful.  I tweaked the recipe:  smashed 4 bananas which = 2-1/2 cups so I only used 1/2 cup of milk, to keep the "liquid" at 3 cups.  Instead of a cup of oil, I had 2 snack packs of applesauce on hand which made slightly less than 1 cup, so I added enough oil to make it a whole cup.  The proportion of wet ingredients to dry was perfect.  My family asked me to add chopped pecans, mini chocolate chips and shredded organic coconut which I did without increasing the wet ingredients, and these muffins were delicious!  Yield:  6 larger sized muffins from a 6-muffin pan, and 12 smaller/regular sized muffins.  I baked them for 30 min. at 350 as called for in the recipe, and they turned out perfect, moist and yet not gooey.  I will definitely make these again - they were a huge hit - and my pregnant daughter-in-law found them to be appetizing and "comforting" to her delicate appetite.

We have dairy and egg allergies and loved these muffins! I used 1/2 avocado oil and 1/2 palm oil for the oil and you couldn't notice the change. They were delicious! I cut sugar down to 1 C total (1/2 brown 1/2 white) and they are still plenty sweet; could be because some of my bananas were black and very sweet! I also had to substitute out the coconut milk due to coconut allergy; I used soy milk instead with no issue. Baked mini muffins 30 minutes and they were perfect. Did regular muffins 35 minutes and they were done, but brown on top so need to bake lower in oven. My only warning  with the recipe is that it says it makes 1 dozen, but it makes WAY more. I did an additional 2 dozen mini muffins, so I think it should say it makes 2 dozen regular muffins. Or, you could half the recipe to make 1 dozen.

Great recipe!  But just wanted to address a previous comment about refined sugar being processed by bone char.  Good news! Costco's Kirkland Organic Sugar has not been processed by bone char, is not processed with or around any meat and is vegan  Item #901991.  I researched this and have an email from them to confirm it in case any of my vegan guests want proof.

Delicious!  These muffins are moist and bursting with flavor.  My husband is transitioning to a Plant Based nutrition, so I was eager to try this recipe.  Results: super pleased and my husband enjoyed them.  This will be our go-to banana muffin recipe.

My vegan daughter likes them!  Have made recipe as is, with swapping a small amount of the oil with extra coconut milk, and with adding chopped pecans.  All worked well!  Thanks for sharing easy vegan recipes made with kitchen staples!

The absolute BEST banana muffins I've ever had!  Made them exactly as written, no changes needed.  Both my husband and toddler love these!  For me, 1 batch made 24 mini muffins (for my son) and 13 regular size muffins.

These were delicious but like most everyone else I altered the recipe just a little. Because everyone else said that the recipe made way too much I just cut each of the ingredients in half. I only used 1/4 cup oil and used 1/2 cup applesauce. Also, I had three small ripe bananas and I didn't measure them. Finally I added 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries folding them into the batter at the end. What turned out was 12 medium sized muffins that turned out great.

These taste better than my regular recipe. I made these for a dinner party and everyone gobbled them up. My Vegan BF was so impressed. I will definately make them  again and again .  This recipe will make 24 muffins.

Made the recipe as is, except for the reducing the total sugar by two thirds as many reviewers have suggested. Didn't substitute half of the oil with applesauce as I didn't have any on hand. 

Muffins came out way too greasy and crumbs were also mushy as a result of all the oil. However, flavour was good and nicely sweet. Would highly suggest reducing the oil used, even if you're unable to substitute with an alternative.

I made these the way the recipe says and they are delicious. I did, however, half the recipe and still ended up with 12 standard size muffins. I will be making these again soon!

Really delicious!  However, this is not really a healthy recipe with all the oil and sugar!  Suggest replacing some oil with applesauce, and decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup  and omit the brown sugar.  I added chopped walnuts to increase the fiber and protein.  Makes enough batter for 24 reg sized muffins.  Like I said, loved these, but need some tweeking to improve nutrition.

Moist and flavorful with a nice crunchy top!  I decreased the sugar, substituted gluten-free flour for white flour, and added more bananas as the ones I had were small and ripe to eat  but not ripe for banana bread (usually a little more mushy and sweeter).  I didn't have nutmeg in the pantry but instead used 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/8 tsp cloves.  Instead of canola oil, I used avocado oil which has a high smoke point and has a mild flavor to use in baked goods.  The recipe made 17 large filled muffins (filled 3/4 full -- will bake up and crisp on the top yet be moist inside).  Added a bit of coconut butter spread and it was a hit (even with my non-vegetarian boyfriend)!

Delicious! We make these almost every weekend.

First, the recipe makes 12 jumbo or 24 regular muffins. I usually cut it in half to make 12 regular muffins.

A few other changes:

Whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose.
Reduce the white sugar by half.
Plain applesauce instead of oil.
Add 1/2 t. vanilla and 1 T. flax seed meal.

I also fold in about a cup of frozen blueberries.

I made this with regular milk (did not have coconut milk), and I made it in a mini muffin tin and baked for 20 minutes. So good!  Even my vegan-averse husband loved them. Will be making several times again in the future!

I replaced coconut milk with cow's milk, added 2 tbsp. of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup, eliminated the baking soda, added chocolate chucks, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top instead of mixing cinnamon into batter. Delicious!!! My kids couldn't keep their hands off.

I used coconut oil instead of canola and added chocolate chips. They were moist, flavorful and had an excellent texture.  My kids took some to school to share and all their friends want the recipe to give to their parents. They are so good the kids asked me to make more the next day.

I had enough batter for 16 and they were all gone in two days.

These are so good, and, they can be made from things most people have on hand. Strict vegans may want to swap out the sugar - see other comments. I added a 12 oz. bag of vegan chocolate chips and swapped out 1/2 cup of the canola oil for coconut oil. M

Half this recipe made 9 large muffins.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and about a half cup of pecans along with a dash of cloves.  I only had 2 bananas which came out to 1 cup in case you are wondering how much you can make.  Also, I used gluten free flour and they came out wonderful!

I am not a vegan, but my younger sister is and she came down for the weekend. I tried this recipe and made no changes other than throwing a couple handfuls of fresh blueberries. She loved it, I loved it, and you don't miss the egg or dairy. Again, this is from a committed non-vegan: I would totally make these again. But be aware: It made 18 BIG muffins. And a couple handfuls of blueberries shouldn't cause that much expansion of the batch size. It makes more than they tell you.

I love baking in the Fall and Winter, this was my first bake of the season! I followed the recipe exactly except I made a few modifications. Instead of coconut milk I used almond milk. Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil. I used whole wheat flour. I didn't have baking powder so I just doubled up on the baking soda. I ADDED: about 1/4 teaspoon of clove, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, a handful of shaved coconut and raisins, and two eggs. It turned out perfect! Just the right amount of sweetness. Also instead of making muffins I made a bread in a square pan. Came out moist and fluffy. I think next time I'll try 3 eggs to hold it together better, but We were still very happy with it. Try it toasted with cream cheese!

I omitted nutmeg, because I didn't have any, substituted canola oil with vegetable oil, and added only 1/4 cup each brown and white sugar. For me that was sweet enough. I also added a handful of chopped walnuts to about 2/3 of the batch. There was enough batter to fill 17 muffin cups almost to the brim. While hot, these muffins were DELICIOUS!  So fluffy and moist! And quite filling. However, they became tough and a little chewy in just a few hours.

Made it as written first time. Has too much sugar for my taste, so I used less next time. I use this as a good base recipe, but add chopped almonds, ground flax seed meal, berries, etc. Depending on what I have on hand, to make vegan muffins for my family. You can substitute whatever kind of soy, almond, cashew or other "milk". Also, we prefer grapeseed oil if we have it. Still, the only thing I don't like about it as written is the amount of sugar. I prefer about half as much.
Note that it makes more than my 12 cup muffin pan will hold, so I put the rest into a small loaf pan (it has to bake about 10 minutes longer).

I made an experiment for healthier version. I cut off all the sugar and oil. I added 1/2 more cup of coconut milk and 1/2 more cup of mashed banana. For the flour I use 1/2 oat and 2 and a 1/2 cup of millet flour instead. I'm so surprised it turns out to be wonderful. Not too sweet, soft and moist. Thanks so much for the recipe.

These are amazing! I like them better than regular muffins. this does make a lot though. I made half the recipe and got 12 full muffins and 9 mini muffins. I also added some chocolate chips (non dairy) to give them some more flavor. I think adding walnuts would also be delicious.

This is a great recipe in terms of ratios but I made a lot of substitutions. Mine came out fantastic!!!! I see some people commenting about the sugar not being vegan. Of course if you're vegan also do use nice organic vegan sugars. I did this and always have them around as I'm sure most strict vegetarians or vegans do.

Great Recipe!!! I did take the advice of others and used 1/2 cup white sugar. Also used 1/4 cup oil and replaced the liquid with the juice of 1 apple and 2 carrots. And I used soy milk instead of coconut oil. Simply because its what I had. I am sure the recipe would taste amazing made the original way too. Thanks for sharing. ....... and I only had to bake 15 mins. It made 24 muffins.

I made it with only 1 cup of brown sugar, and 2 bananas (that's how many I had in the pantry), and they were amazing! Our guests loved it, nobody could believe it was a vegan recipe. Big hit, will definitely make it again soon!

this is the best muffin recipe I've ever used - they are not crumbly (which is often the case with vegan muffins) they aren't too sweet and have the perfect amount of banana.

they always turn out amazing, soft and moist!

This recipe makes 24 regular size muffins and 24 mini muffins for me. The mini muffins only take 20 minutes cooking time. I also bake at 375 because I like a nice brown top on the muffin. That being said, these are really, really good. I also reduce the oil by half and use 1/2 C applesauce and reduce the white sugar by 1/2 C just because it suits our tastes. I've added nuts, or dates to this recipe as well. We're not vegans, but this is a great recipe to have when you don't have any eggs, so I keep the pantry stocked with coconut milk at all times. Bananas don't keep in a hot climate. By the way, I have made this recipe as written. The changes I've made have been made over several batches. It's good as written except the the amount of muffins resulting from the recipe is way off. Go ahead and try it. You won't be disappointed.

Who knew that vegan banana bread could taste so awesome!   We followed recipe as written, with the exception of adding chopped walnuts.  The pan we used made extra large extra large muffins.  

Watch the timer--we baked ours for 30 minutes and they were just slightly over baked.

These were sooo yummy!  I used Olive Oil instead of Canola (didn't have any and was too lazy to run to the store) and I used Cashew Milk instead of Coconut Milk (Coconut Milk hurts my stomach), but they came out beautifully!  And I assume that the 12 muffin instruction is if you use a jumbo muffin pan.  This recipe made 28 standard muffins (cupcake size) and were perfectly cooked at 17 minutes.  I will definitely be making these again!

I love the flavor and the concept of this recipe! I too reduced the amount of sugar called for and halved the recipe. That was fine. The thing I did incorrectly was to exchange half the flour for rolled oats. My proportions were off and I ended up with more of a firm pudding rather than muffins! I will try again, and tweak those proportions so these can serve as breakfast!

This recipe is great for lactose intolerant folks!  The texture actually came out pretty fluffy- almost more like a cake- but got denser after settling in the fridge.  Definitely a keeper for me.

Wonderful recipe! I brought a cake to a party and everyone couldn't believe how delicious it was or that it was vegan! I also made it gluten-free which surprised everyone because of how moist and flavorful it was. First, I substituted the regular flour with 1 cup Gluten-free flour (King Arthur), 1 cup Tapioca flour, and 1 cup soy flour. Because I didn't have coconut milk on hand used 1 cup of Soy milk. This is a keeper I will use again and again!

Made 19 muffins.
Only used 1/2 cup raw sugar in place of both brown and white, and used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of the 1 cup of oil.

A good basic framework recipe for vegan muffins...but I only use 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup maple syrup as sweetener, and use healthy flour blends...always comes out great !

I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the coconut milk. I also divided the flour into 2 cups all purpose, 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry, 1/4 cup oat bran, and 1/4 cup almond meal. Perfection!  

The 1st time I made them I had used more whole wheat pastry flour and oat bran, and less all purpose, but they came out too dry.

Was looking for an egg-free muffin for my allergic son. This muffin is great with some changes: 1/2 cup of white sugar (not 1 cup) and used white whole wheat flour in place of half of the all-purpose. I also used whole milk in place of coconut milk because that's all I had and we did not need it to be vegan. They came out fluffy and muffin-y, just like you want a muffin to be!
One note: if you stick to 12 muffins, this recipe makes BIG muffins. We could have made 18 with the amount of batter the recipe makes. But opted for big muffins this time. :-)

Tasty! I changed the ingredients a bit to fit what was available in the fridge, blueberry vegan muffins work great too! I didn't use nutmeg in mine because I have an allergy but I'm sure with it included, it'd be a lot better

These muffins were super easy, but I did make some minor adjustments: I used almond milk instead of what they suggested; 2 teaspoons cinnamon (my favorite!); and didn't put any brown sugar. I used my jumbo muffin tins and it made 10 beautiful muffins.They came out perfect! I like this better than banana nut bread!

Have made these twice - Maybe it's the size of my muffin pan, but I got 18 plus one 6-inch pan size that I am going to share with a freind.  Also I was short on bananas and subbed in applesauce for 1 cup. These are great warmed up with cream cheese or buttery spread. Kids love them too! I will up the dry ingredients a bit next time so I don't have a scant bit of coconut milk left over, or maybe eliminate some of the oil instead.

I saw the recipe and thought 3C of flour that is a lot, and the fat I think is too much, I only add 1 C of coconut oil and I cut the sugar as well I only add I cup of brown sugar, I'll say they came up nice soft and no too sweet! that is why I'm baking my muffins, most of the muffin that you buy they are super sweet.
I'll put 6 very rip bananas (2C) i think if you want the muffins be more sweet you can add more bananas? I think I'll try it next time!

These were great!! Super fluffy and moist. I substituted the sugars for coconut sugar and they still tasted great! The coconut milk adds a little extra instead of using just plain almond milk or soy milk. I made muffins,  bundts and loafs with this recipe and I will definitely be using it again! 10/10!!

Made this over the weekend - very quick and simple recipe! Some reviewers thought they were too sweet; I used unsweetened coconut milk, and left the sugar as specified. I also added about a cup of chopped walnuts for texture. This recipe made about 2 pans (48 total?) of mini muffins!

i used this as a test run for what i plan on making for bf's daughter now that she's turned vegan.. this was such a SUCCESS.. i didn't have ripe bananas, but did have some pumpkin puree that i made earlier in the day so i subbed that.. also subbed soy milk for coconut milk, but followed the recipe otherwise.. if i do pumpkin again i'll be sure to add a bit more sugar as it was on the less sweet side, but it makes sense as bananas add their own natural sweetness.. oh and the yield is double (if not slightly more) than what is written.. ty so much for the recipe! ~~UPDATE: made a half batch for bf to take to snack on at work.. this time i used the bananas and the coconut milk.. subbed apple sauce for the canola oil and instead of using 1/2 cup white sugar i reduced it down to 1/4 cup and added 6 packets of stevia.. bf said these are killer and was surprised that they were the vegan muffins.. ty again for submitting

Best muffins ever!  My son is vegan so gave these a try.  Very moist.  Didn't change anything, and wouldn't.  Have lot's of overripe bananas so will be making more tomorrow.

I made these the first time a vegan friend came over, it was New Year's eve. Even though we had plenty of other sweets all my non-vegan friends went straight for these and now I make them even if no vegans are visiting. Very simple to make, tasty and a perfect crunchy top.

Definitely a keeper! So good! The only things are that they somehow managed to provide me with 24 muffins, rather than 12. Also, I only baked them for 15 minutes. If I baked them any longer they would've burnt. I substituted almond milk for coconut milk, but it still tastes incredible. I really enjoyed it!

I used half the sugar and 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Also used 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy flour mixed with 3 tablespoons water and added this to the liquid ingredients. Excellent vegan recipe.  I would definitely make it again. Makes 12 large muffins.

Used 1/2C coconut oil and 1/2C applesauce instead of canola.  Also added about 1/3C of shredded coconut flakes.  So delicious.

This recipe came out awesome! It was so moist and yummy. Everyone loved it. 
Some deviations : 
-Used 1.5 C whole wheat flour and 1.5 C all purpose flour
-I used 3 over ripened bananas ( i didn't measure, but it was less than 2 cups)
-I added some raisins and dried cranberries
-only used 1 cup of sugar, 
-I baked it in a square pan to fit in my convection toaster oven.

Even with those deviations, it baked perfectly, had just the right amount of sweetness and banana flavor.

Love this recipe, you can get by with half the white sugar for sure... And I love using this recipe but subbing pumpkin for bananas and pumpkin pie spice for the spices, perfect for fall!!! They don't last long in our house though

Delicious! Super moist. I tweaked it a bit. I used coconut oil instead of canola oil and I did 1C whole wheat flour & 2C unbleached all purpose flour. I also added a couple large tablespoon scoops of non fat plain Greek yogurt and about 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce. Also added a cup of vegan choc chips. Yum yum good.

These were delicious, but more of a dense banana bread than a real muffin.  The lighter "muffin-y" texture comes from eggs, so obviously it's not there.  Almond milk works fine in place of coconut milk, and that was the only change I made.  The nutmeg was a little overpowering, I would cut by half.  If you're looking for a vegan muffin, or for a decent personal-portion banana bread, these are great.  However, if you are not concerned with keeping vegan, I recommend looking for a more classic muffin recipe.

Very good. I made exactly as recipe is written and they turned out really good. Next time I make these I'll be cutting the cinnamon down to one teaspoon not two because I felt that it took away from the banana flavor too much.

We love this recipe!! I made a couple of subs, including using whole wheat flour instead of white (3/4 cup ww for each 1 cup white), replacing the Canola oil with coconut oil and the coconut milk with pumpkin spice soy milk (it's what I had on hand, sounds weird but it worked!) Im making my second batch right now because they are great little snacks when I'm up with the baby in the wee hours of the night, and I ate the last one this morning!! :-) yum!!
