I almost gave this recipe four stars but I just think it doesn't have enough flavor as written. It also isn't the best for leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly and if I were to make it again I would add 1 tbsp. of italian seasoning.

I made a couple alterations/substitutions:
I used a package of fat free cream cheese instead of the chive and onion because even the reduced fat chive/onion was too calorie/fat laden for me. I also used a cup of fat free chicken broth because i wanted more sauce & I had to thicken it w/a little flour. Instead of sherry i used marsala wine (double the amount it called for) and fresh garlic and basil fettucine. I did use a yellow pepper but a white onion was what i had on hand. my husband and i were both impressed with this meal and i let him take the leftovers for lunch!

This pasta rocks! Rich and creamy you'll wish you had doubled the recipe.  Very very easy and the only thing I changed was that i used linguini. Enjoy!

I used milk instead of chicken broth - yummy! Also, used "kid friendly" pasta - fun shape & easier to eat! This will be a "staple" at our home! Quick, easy & yummy!

I found this recipe pretty good.  I used penne pasta instead of the fettuccini and used the advice of using italian seasoning which added flavour.  I used a red bell pepper and just regular cream cheese. I also added some fresh cilantro after the cream cheese and it turned out pretty good...and tasty!  To finish it off I sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over top and served with garlic bread.  If I could make a suggestion it would be to let it sit on the stove covered for about 5 minutes before you serve it so the sauce can thicken up a little (as mine was initially a little runny).

The only changes I made were to use yellow onion and red bell pepper instead of red onion and yellow bell pepper. It's what I had. I thought the chive and onion cream cheese would have a stronger taste, but it didn't. The sauce is rather light and sparse, certainly not as heavy or as much as an Alfredo style sauce. With all that said, I liked this dish.

Delicious!  I used green peppers instead of yellow.  Also, I used regular cream cheese and added chopped green onions.  My family was in awe of how good this tasted!

Very, very good!  My husband was sick and wanted some comfort food and this fit the bill for him.  I added about twice the amt of sherry and half the amt of chicken broth but added extra chicken boullion to make up for it.  In addition, I didn't have any chive and onion cream cheese, so I used a regular block of cream cheese and added dried chives and a chopped green onion.  It was yummy!  Thanks!

This recipe was fairly tasty but nothing special. I would have liked the sauce to coat the noodles more... don't know if I used a bit too many or if the sauce amount just isn't to my proportion liking. I don't know that I'd make it again but it was decent.

This was very good, although I had to modify a bit based on what I had on hand.  I used regular cream cheese (7oz) and a red pepper.  I also used the entire can of chicken broth and then thickened the sauce with about 1 Tbsp of cornstarch.  I used a very generous amount of pepper and about 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning as well.  Great option for chicken and fettuccini if you don't want alfredo!

This dish was decent, but nothing special. Made it as described here, but next time I will try more spices to zip it up.  Not sure how anyone's sauce came out runny - mine was almost too thick.  I thought maybe it would be better the next day...didn't reheat well AT ALL.

I gave this two stars for the idea. I looked at the ingredients that go together and wondered if it was going to be good. After making this, I tasted it and knew my DH would not like it as cooked. I will stick with my tried and true Alfredo I usually make.

The pasta seemed to suck up all the sauce when added. So I just added a little milk to help stretch the sauce.  Other than that one change we thought it was great.

Sauce was way too runny -- I should have added some cornstarch along with the chicken broth for thickening.  Other than the thin sauce, this turned out to be a standard stir-fry (although flavors are pretty subtle.)  Sorry -- Nothing remarkable to make me want to repeat.

This recipe was good.  All three of my kids liked it (even the picky 6 year old), which is amazing.  I left out the cream cheese because my husband is lactose intolerant.  I also added 2 tsp. of cornstarch blended with 1 tablespoon of water to thicken up the sauce.  Was very good.

My husband and I didn't really care for this recipe.    The sauce did not have much flavor.   I am not sure what I could have done differently.   I reviewed the other suggestions before making our dinner, and I was really looking forward to tasting this wonderful meal.  I doubled the veggies & sauce, but I don't think it helped much.  I was really disappointed.   I won't be making it again.

My partner doesn't like cheese sauce so I deleted it but this meal STILL was fabulous!  Great, easy recipe to prepare after a long day at work.  Plus, you get plenty of nutrition from it (especially if you add more veggies)!

This is a good, easy to make dinner that the whole family will like a lot.  My one year old twins mmmmmmd between every bite.  It is on my regular rotation of meals now.  Only reason I put 4 is because I don't think it is absolutely amazing.

This was good, I don't think I'll be trying it again. It needed alot of spices, but that might have been because i used plain cream cheese instead of with chives.

I didn't want to rate this, but I had to, in order for the review to post.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  But, I did want to let you know my mistakes.

1) I thought this was going to taste like alfredo...duh
2) I didn't use chive cream cheese, I used plain cream cheese and fresh chives...ewww
3) I couldn't use garlic (cry), dh is on coumadin
4) Thought I had sherry it was marsala (don't ask how I mixed that up)

So, my end result tasted like plain cream cheese and onions...terrible.

I admit that I didn't taste this, since I'm the one vegetarian in my household.  I did think it smelled great while cooking. However, I heard the same complaint from my husband and 2 teenagers that the dish had a funny aftertaste.  They each ate a small portion and the rest ended up in the garbage disposal.  I was careful not to let this boil and I also used a known brand of cream cheese (Philadelphia), so I'm not sure what the problem was.  This is certainly not what I was expecting based on other reviews, but I won't try this again.  I'm giving it 2 stars based on the nice aroma.

This is a GREAT recipe.  Don't skimp on the garlic!
Also...crushed red peppers made this great tasting sauce even better.

Made this last night and it was very good. I omitted the salt because there is lots of it in the chicken broth. This is a keeper!

This was my first time ever making this dish and it was EXACTLY how I wanted it to taste! I didn't have any sherry so I just skipped out on that. Instead of the flavoured cream cheese, I used regular and I also added table cream to thicken the sauce more. Loved it and I will definitely cook this more often :)

I did add some diced celery, 2 tbs basil, 1 TBs tarragon;  extra sherry and leftover artichoke hearts and baby corn; used regular cream cheese;  served over California gold rice.  Yum!!   I could eat the sauce with a spoon :)

This was super easy and oh-so-yummy!! Way better than Olive Garden...though I took the advice of another reviewer and added about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, I think it made it extra fabulous.  My boyfriend even took the left overs to work the next day and said everyone was jealous of his food :)

**Update! I had this for leftover lunch at work and it was even better**I laugh every time people give a decent dish a poor rating because they didn't follow the recipe!  Very tasty, quick and eash.  I used the low cal cream cheese and dry Italian seasoning and no wine. Yummy, my son ate two bowls ? !

I've been making this for years, it's easy and delicious. I used red peppers as well as yellow. And when I can find it I use light garlic cream cheese as we are garlic lovers in my house!

I agree with other reviews that the outcome was slightly bland as I followed the exact recipe without tweaking.  My end result was also too heavy with cream cheese.

Even with extra tweaking and additional ingredients, I was still disappointed with the outcome.  I added extra white wine, chicken broth, fresh basil,roasted red peppers, etc.  I think I really should have payed more attention to the amounts going in...it turned out way too 'cream-cheesy' and overly thick.  For the amount of fat and calories, you are better off fixing your regular alfredo that is consistently good.

My mom is a fettuccini fan and this was well received. I used red pepper instead of yellow. We love veggies so I added chopped broccoli and fresh mushrooms. Used 4 tablespoons of wine.

Excellent.  I added a half of red bell pepper julienned, about 3/4 tsp dried basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, pinch of thyme.  I went "full calorie" with the cream cheese, but cut back on the amount of pasta I served.  This was really good, will definitely make again.

Fast and easy is right.  I had this meal on our plates in 3o minutes.  The flavors are great but could use a bit more perhaps marjoram or thyme.  A very comforting dish for a winter evening, rich and smooth.  I consider it a winner.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. I thought that the red onions were great. I also made my own cream cheese mixture by buying normal cream cheese and just adding fresh green onions and chives (dryed or fresh). This is a very easy recipe to make, just make sure to use a large pan or wok because this recipe makes a lot of food! :)

Everyone in the family enjoyed this recipe.  I used minced onion instead of the red onion and I was out of sherry so I used red wine.  Nice flavor and easy to prepare.

I loved this recipe. I added fresh mushrooms, and omitted the Sherry, as I didn't have any on hand. Even my VERY picky 2 and 5 year olds ate it. It was quick and easy to prepare. Will definately make it again.
