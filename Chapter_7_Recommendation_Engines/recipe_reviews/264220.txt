Since it was the first time I tried this recipe, I made it exactly as it was written.  It was fabulous!  The flavors of the peppers, onion, garlic, and sausage infused the bread with deliciousness.  The crunch from the toasted bread on top  completed the total flavor.  We had it for dinner with garlic, butter, and Parmesan asparagus and fresh garden veggies with zesty Italian dressing and cheeses,  I will definitely be making this again.  Only thing I will change is to add a little more sausage, as per my husband's request.  If you like a really savory breakfast, this would be the dish to use.

We really liked this. I made the original recipe. It made a big amount so we had leftovers.  Nice spice.

I made this exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it.  The only thing that was different was that I baked it for about 90 minutes, perhaps because of the altitude here in Denver.

Wow  thought that a sausage egg bake would be meh at best.  very good.  I made it in the strata style (layers) the recipe allowed  for 2 layers of everything except doubled cheese and sausage and 2 xtra eggs.  

Went like this:  1st = sourdough bread strips then divided cheese, onion mixture, sausage, then bread, cheese sausage again. then pour "wet" mixture over everything
