This is one of the first recipes I've tried from this site, and has become a staple in our house.  Here are the tweaks I've made:  First, I cover the chicken breasts in mayo (sounds gross, and I don't like mayo, but it keeps the bread crumbs on and the chicken moist). For two chicken breast halves, I mix and coat with 1/2c bread crumbs, 2Tbl Ranch Dressing mix, and a dash of paprika. Love it!

awesome recipe for people to tweak with... Instead of using dry ingredients i used peppercorn ranch dressing in a bottle, to coat the chicken, then seasoned my bread crumbs with black pepper, oregano, parsley , garlic salt, bit of dill... 
heaven!!!!

This chicken is very good & quick & very light... I have made this many times, I do have a suggestion... to make it more moist - brush plain non-fat yogurt on the chicken before the breadcrumb mixture... it doesn't alter the taste, but provides a moisture to the chicken which is outstanding!!! (please note, that I do not think ANY recipe should be altered until it has been tried as written)

Now that I have made this several times, I found an interesting quirk. I noticed TWO different kinds of ranch packets at my local store. Ranch DIP and ranch DRESSING mixes. Both made by the same company. If you use the DIP mix, your chicken will be salty, overpowering, and will taste a bit like kitchen cleaner. Using the DRESSING mix gives the chicken a nice ranch flavor. Do NOT use the DIP packet.

Made right, this is easy to prepare and tasty. The chicken was so moist. I use two breasts, and combine one ranch packet with 1/4 c. Italian bread crumbs. Just stick the seasonings in a bag, wet the chicken, shake it up and bake. I don't even find it necessary to pound in order to get a good, juicy result. I bake at 350 and it's done in about 25 minutes. I will continue to make this in the future.

Yummy!  Like the others I doubled the bread crumb mixture and only used 1 and a half ranch dry dip packets.  I also whipped an egg and dipped each piece of chicken in the egg before rolling in the dry mix.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and they were perfect.  I will make this again.  My very picky 8 year old requested seconds!

My husband described this chicken as "blah".  I found it a little bland as well.  I guess we're amongst the few who didn't care for it, and I won't make it again.

Yuck! This was way too salty...and I'm a lover of salt. The power of the salt completely overpowered the entire meal!

This recipe was pretty good, but I'm giving it a three because I feel that it could use some adjustments. Like the others, I began by using only one pack of dressing mix, but I still thought that the taste was overwhelming. Next time I will only use half of a packet. With the right amount of dressing mix, this would have an awesome taste. My husband liked it anyway.

I give 4 stars because it was so easy...but it was also salty.  I did read the reviews and reduce the amount of salt...but apparently not enough.  All in all...it was ok, but I am not sure I would try again. Thanks anyways for the post.

I am currently cooking this as we speak so I will update. PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BAKING!

For those that have said it was TOO SALTY, YOU MOST LIKELY USED THE WRONG SEASONING! Hidden Valley Ranch makes THE SEASONING FOR DIP & SEASONING FOR DRESSING! They are different. The dip mix is extremely salty as I made the mistake of thinking they were the same and mixed as a salad dressing. I couldn't even eat the salad bc it was too salty. Please note the recipe calls for the dressing mix as well; not the dip mix. Read the seasoning packet carefully before purchasing. The ranch dressing mix isn't salty at all.

This was really good. Here are my alterations: -used chicken legs and 2 pork chops I had left over (seasoned with black pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and few shakes of seasoned salt). -changed the cornflakes to panko breadcrumbs seasoned with parmesan cheese, garlic powder, italian seasoning, parsley, and red pepper (really brings out the flavors). -dipped the meat directly into the ranch and then into seasoned breadcrumbs so I omitted the butter. (I was also afraid that it wouldn't "stick" right to the meat, so I chickened out and did it separately lol) -baked at 375F for about 40-45 mins.

This recipe is excellent. My husband, who does not like white meat chicken ate every last bite. I had the leftovers for lunch during the week and didn't get tired of it at all. I served it with chicken flavored rice and sweet corn. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This was very good.  My 4 year old & 15 month old both loved it.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and modified it slightly.  I dipped the chicken breasts in egg before I coated it.  For 2 chicken breasts, I used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 2 tbsp of ranch.  I also added paprika which one of the other reviewers suggested.

My husband and I loved this recipe! We cut the ranch mixture by half and added a little paprika and garlic powder and it was great! I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray and flipped the chicken half way through cooking time. This is a must try!

My whole family really liked this!  Because so many reviewers had thought the ranch mix was too salty, I took the advice of another reviewer and made it like this: Brushed some good ranch dressing right onto the chicken, then seasoned the bread crumbs with pepper, oregano, parsley, garlic salt, and a little parmesan cheese.  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes and it came out perfect!  So easy!

Everyone in my family enjoyed this dish.  I followed the recipe with one exception.  I did drag the chicken through sour cream to help the topping sick better.  I would have used egg but my son is allergic.

This is somewhere between okay & pretty good.  I dredged in flour, beaten egg, then combined mixture of 3/4c plain breadcrumbs & one pkg (3T) ranch dressing.  I baked on a pam-sprayed dish.  It was moist, but still kinda eh.  I tasted the sugar/salt in the mix.  Yeah, it is part of the flavor; but just didn't grab me as something I'd want again.  Good for tonight though.

I loved how easy this was, but I think next time I might want to marinate the chicken in something before coating and baking it. The coating was very tasty, but the chicken inside was bland.

As the wife of a chicken fanatic, i'm constantly looking for new and easy chicken recipes. We loved this in my house. It's simple, low calorie, and an inexpensive staple meal for us. The first time I made this I used two bone in, skin on chicken breasts and I cooked them too long, they were still moist and delicious, just a wee bit over cooked and threatening to be "rubbery." I served alongside roasted red potatos and broccoli for a delicious and balanced meal.

This was a nice change from just breaded chicken.  It did not have as strong a ranch taste as I would have liked, but it was quick and easy so I will keep in it mind for future use.

This did not work for me.  The chicken breading stuck to the pan (which I should have greased) and the taste was very, very salty. I may try it again with a few alterations.  Thanks.

I thought this was great and my kids ate it with no fuss. Taking hints from other people I added some dry mustard, celery salt, Pepper, and garlic seasoning  to add a little more taste and Double the bread crumbs. Only question I have is How so you get the mix to brown up more I can never get it to brown for me in the oven I think I am doing something wrong.

Made this for the family & I was the only one that liked it. They couldn't get past the sour tang of the ranch flavor. I'd make it again, but with only 1/2 the ranch mix and add some Parmesan cheese & Cajun spice to the crumbs instead.

I am all for easy, no-fuss recipes and this truly fits the bill.  Since I had chicken legs already defrosted, I marinated those in Frank's RedHot for about an hour before coating them.  Spritzing the coating with spray butter before baking on a crumpled-foil lined pan made them crispy.  Not haute cuisine, but quite tasty nonetheless.  Thanks!

I gave this 4 stars because it was so simple to make. It was flavorful and was good but for me personally the ranch overpowered the chicken. Maybe it was that I used breast tenders instead of just breast filets. I also didn't have any bread crumbs so I diced up some flavored croutons in my food processor and used that instead. I will make again and use breast filets and see if it isnt as overpowered. Thanks for the quick recipe!

This was good chicken.  My kids liked it.  The only thing I changed was I added a bit of melted butter over the top prior to baking. (makes crispier)

Maybe I should have used the name-brand dressing mix instead of the store brand, because this did not taste good at all.

If you love the taste of Ranch dressing, then this is a dish you must try.  It couldn't be simplier to make!  And it's quite tasty.  Some reviews mention it was too salty or the ranch flavor was too strong.  My boyfriend and I disagree - but then again, we happen to love Ranch dressing!  With only three ingredients, anyone can make this dish and feel like a Chef!

This is one of our all-time favorites and I always make a special effort to pick up the Ranch packets at the store so that I can have it on hand for a quick dinner.  Can be used for chicken legs, halves, thighs or any part of the chicken.  Delicious AND easy.

I tried this with a friend of mine and the immediate reaction was "oh, wow."  Definitely a recipe worth keeping.  I used fairly thick chicken breasts, so 30 minutes was fine, but it strikes me that for thinner breasts 20 minutes might be better.

This was a good "middle of the week" recipe. My hubby and picky 2 year old ate it... what more can I ask for? The chicken was tender, and definitely full of flavor. (almost too much for me!)

Loved this recipe! It is a keeper.  It has a real zing to the flavor and my chicken was so juicy!  I think juiciness depends on the chicken you buy or your oven.

I made this tonight I didn't have the dried ranch, so I used regular ranch dressing. I ran it thru the dressing than buttered crushed crackers sprinkled parmesan, Romano and asiago cheese and a little bit of garlic salt. Turned out great, tender and great flavor!

Family loved this.  I coated the chicken in mayonnaise before dredging in coating, it stayed nice and moist that way.

I cut mine up into "chicken finger" size after pounding the chicken to tenderize it.  I also didn't have the ranch dressing mix, but had creamy light ranch dressing.  I coated the chicken in the dressing and then dipped it in the bread crumbs.  Really like the flavor.  Would be better fried (what isn't)  but I will bake it again next time for the health benefit.

It needed a little more flavor.  So I experimented and used 2 Cups rice crispies, instead of bread crumbs, and also added 1/4 C of Parmesan cheese.  I also put 2 egg whites in a bowl and dipped the chicken breast in that before throwing it in the mixture in the bag.  So everything stuck to the chicken really well.  The added Parmesan really gave it an extra kick.  I gave it 3 stars because the original recipe is pretty bland.  But my Husband and family LOVED the changes I made to it.  Absolutely delicious!

Very Very good! My husband and daughter both really liked it! I soaked the chicken in milk while I was assembling the Ranch packet and bread crumbs and then I rolled the breasts in the mixture. I also melted 2 tablespoons of butter and drizzled over the coated breasts, this aided in browning and crispiness. They turned out really moist, crispy and delicious!!!!

Very good, will make again! I did dip the chicken breast in egg to help the coating stick which worked really well. Didn't taste to salty to me or my husband and we're used to low salt dishes.

My husband LOVED this chicken!!  I did tweak the recipe a little, though... I used 2 pkgs. of ranch mix, italian bread crumbs (b/c that's all I had on hand), & I added onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt & pepper to the bread crumbs.  I also coated the chicken with mayo before covering in the bread crumb mixture... it helped the chicken stay moist.  It wasn't bland at all!!  My only issue was cooking it on the cookie sheet w/o any cooking spray caused the breading to come off in places.  I'll probably cook it the next time in a glass casserole dish.  Otherwise, it was AWESOME!!!

This was very good.  Only used 1/2 of the Ranch Dressing mix because of the sodium.  Also added some pepper into the mixture.  The family loved it.  Served with a green salad and corn on the cob.  Yuummm!

These had very good flavor. I think i'll try the suggestion of dipping them in mayo next time though as the breading didn't stick to the chicken or brown very well. Other than that 4 stars, it's a keeper!

Liked the simplicity & flavor! I listened to others and  only used 1 pkt ranch w/1 cup bread crumbs.  Dipped in egg, bread crumb mixture and sauteed in olive oil.  Nice change!  Thanks!

I dip in egg first, then coat.  I have used breadcrumb and panko crumbs - both are good.  Easy but nothing spectacular.

Super easy and very tasty! I made this for 2 people with 2 chicken breasts, a full packet of ranch mix, and about a tablespoon of bread crumbs, and it was perfect. The crumbs/ranch topping gets a nice crunch.

I'm sorry ~ but, I was not impressed with this at all. I only used 4 breasts and I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 2 packets of ranch seasoning. The chicken lacked any sort of good flavor. I tasted something but not quite sure how to explain it. There was NOTHING crispy about this chicken other than the fact that it stuck to the bottom of the pan and was slightly black. I will not be making this again ~ it was too dry, as well ~ there are so many other better chicken recipes out there.

We made this last night and really enjoyed it.  The only change I made was to add a little paprika for color--a trick I learned from another "oven fried" chicken recipe that gives it more of a browned look.  The ranch flavor was a little strong for us.  Next time I will use the proportions of 4 4-oz. boneless chicken breasts, 1 envelope Ranch dressing mix, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I would also dredge the chicken in a shallow bowl or pie plate.  I use the plastic bag for coating a lot of things, but never had much luck with it when there are breadcrumbs.  I may also soak the chicken in buttermilk as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks, Christine, it's great to have another "oven fried" recipe, especially one this simple.

This recipes is great! I made it for the family I work for (I'm a nanny) and they loved it! 
I dipped the chicken in ranch dressing, then coated with bread crumbs using a pastry brush. I also flipped the chicken while it was baking.

This was okay. The bread crumbs and dressing mix didn't stick to the chicken as easily as I'd thought they would. This resulted in a less of a "breaded" chicken than I'd anticipated. I also used about one and a half dressing mix packets, since other reviewers had mentioned its being too salty. I didn't have a problem with the salt, but the taste wasn't as "wow" as I would've thought. It was better than just plain chicken, but not spectacular. I would probably make again.

Loved this recipe!!! I went for a more baked taste than crispy. I added a little water and covered with foil and it baked and tasted so delicious. I also cut up some red potatoes in chunks and shook them in the ranch and bread crumb mixture and baked them along with the chicken. My 4 year old went back for seconds! Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I dont usually comment on a recipe, but this was so tasty and easy I had to!  I did tweek it slightly though.... I marinated the chicken breasts in a ranch dressing and greek yogurt mix for about an hour first.  The breadcrumbs stuck perfectly and the chicken came out crispy and tender!  Thanks! (Oh! and very minimally salty)

I tried this recipe last night and my husband said the chicken was moist. I used another reviewers tip and used mayonnaise on the chicken before mixing on the bread crumbs but I didn't have bred crumbs so I used a box of extra crispy shake n bake and it did the job. Will use again.

This was really good, my picky eight year old asked for seconds - that makes it a keeper! I followed the recipe but also used an egg as others suggested. I also used thin chicken breasts which made it very flavorful (and faster to cook). Will definitely make again.

I used organic chicken legs.  The only bread crumbs I had were the italian style, and it still turned out great.

I made this recipe exactly as described. My family loved it! It is extremely easy and perfect when you don't have a lot of time - I put sweet potato fries in alongside the chicken and everything was done at the same time.

First I should say I made this exactly as the recipe called for, as I believe if I tweak it to make it good, its NOT the recipe written. I found this chicken to be very dry. The inside was dry, the outside was dry, and the taste was very bland. I would probably not make this recipe again.

Tried recipe as is and turned out pretty good.  Second time i made it, coated the pieces with a thin layer of mayo.  Doubled the bread crumbs and used Fiesta Ranch dry mix instead.  IT was outstanding!!!!!!    Extremely moist inside and the taste was great!

I was expecting a better tasting chicken. I was just ok. Nothing fantastic. I think this recipe needs a little extra something, but I just can't put my finger on it. There wasn't much flavor to it.

I thought this turned out really well.  I followed other suggestions and dipped the chicken in flour, then egg, then the ranch mixture, and it cooked up wonderfully.  I didn't find the ranch taste overpowering, but if you're not really a fan of that particular flavor, you may want to reduce the amount of mix you use, as it is a little strong.

Accidentally found a great alteration to this! I forgot to buy the packages of ranch dressing so I added lemon pepper and some garlic herb seasoning to the bread crumbs.  And my bread crumbs were actually Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing mix.  I dipped the chicken in ranch dressing (generously) so the crumbs would stick and it worked perfectly.  My family loved it!

Very easy to make & very delicious!  I made sure to use low sodium bread crumbs so that it wasn't too salty (as some people complained about).  I used 3/4 pack of ranch, 1 cup breadcrumbs, and added some Parmesan cheese to the breading mixture for 3 chicken breasts.  Will definitely be making again!

This was a very quick and easy dinner and gave otherwise bland chicken a very strong taste. (We like strong tastes in our house so we don't mind the extra salty taste from the ranch)   I change one thing every time however, and that's coating the chicken with egg whites before shaking it in the ranch and breadcrumb mixture. It helps it stick and also gives the chicken and bread a little kick while helping it stay moist.   Other things that I've mixed in with the ranch and breadcrumbs are (not all at once of course): ~Chili powder~ ~Garlic seasoning~ ~Italian seasoning~.   Also another way to add extra personality is to use flavored breadcrumbs like garlic or italian. No matter what I do to this recipe it still tastes great.

UPDATE: Made this again and did a 3 step coating on the chicken of flour, then egg white then the breadcrumb/ranch mixture.  Came out absolutely fantastic!  1st time making: This was really good!  Make sure you get the ranch DRESSING mix and not the dip mix as the dip is way too salty.  I thought the dressing mix made the chicken a bit salty but not too bad.  I added paprika to the mix and coated chicken in light mayo prior to breadcrumbs per other reviews and this turned out fantastic.

This recipe is right up my alley - easy and delicious. As per Jenn's review, I just brushed chicken breasts with ranch dressing (not from packet). Without measuring I sprinkled on bread crumbs, then added panko crumbs I had and also a dash of italian seasoning for more flavor. It was in the oven 40 minutes, the last fifteen covered in foil. I served it with stuffing and cranberry. Loved it!!

I made this recipe last night.  It was quick and easy, but rather than use the packaged salad dressing mix, I brushed on Ranch Dressing, dredged the chicken in a breadcrum mixture that I had already mixed in some parmesan cheese and then baked.  It was delicious and not too salty.  Thanks for the quick recipe! JH

Excellent! I also put a little light mayo on it first and the coated it! IT was really great! I added a few more regular bread crumbs and it helped cut down on the salty taste! I served it with plain brown rice and it was a hit! definately making it again!

My whole family thought this was disgusting! I followed the recipe exactly as it is wriiten and it tasted like I sprayed the chicken with a household cleaner. Needless to say, we ended up eating cereal for dinner that night.

This was great!  Like other reviewers, I added a dash of paprika and spread mayo on the chicken before coating it with breadcrumbs.  I made this for my sisters and although one of my sisters was slightly disgusted at the prospect of eating mayo with chicken, it came out perfect and didn't taste like mayo (you’d never even know it had mayo to begin with in fact)!  I've made it a few times and it will be a staple in my home.

I loved this! Great for easy entertaining. I found it much better to cut the chicken into small pieces, put them in a bowl, and cover them lightly in Mayo. Sprinkling the ranch mix and bread crumbs, while stirring helps it to be covered much more evenly. Because the chicken is in smaller pieces, it also cooks quicker.

My husband loved this. I'm vegetarian, so I'll have to take his word for it. I did tweek the recipe a bit. I mixed 1/2 packet of dry ranch dressing with 2/3 c. low fat milk and a little eggbeaters . For the dry mixture, I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half plain. Added a little pepper. In 350 degree oven, baked chicken for 20 min. Flipped over for another 10 min.Prepared yolkless noodles, drained and mixed in ranch/milk mix.Threw in 1/3 cup grated cheese. Poured noodles into 9x11 glass pan Placed chicken on top. Topped with grated jack cheese. Baked until cheese had melted.

I made this for 6 adults (one who is a very picky eater) and 1 toddler, and they all loved it.  They were so suprised how much flavor it had without actually marinating the chicken.  I would recommend cooking this one, because if I can cook it (anyone can).

I loved this recipe!!!! It was simple to make and tasted great.  Some people stated that their chicken was dry.  I put a very light amount like 1/2 a teaspoon of olive oil in the bread crumb/ranch mix and it kept it nice and moist.  Some people also said that it was a bit too salty for them.  Ranch is very salty but I didn't find it at all overpowering.  This will be kept close to me.

SOOO SO SO easy!  The only thing i changed was:
barely coated chicken with mayonnaise, barely coated pan with very thin layer of olive oil, and used crackers instead of bread crumbs, because i didnt have any.  I cut mine in half too though.  Also I ate the first one.. then came back like 2 hours later and put a little Jalapeno Tabasco sauce (green, milder one) on top and reaheated it in my toaster oven.. SOO darn easy and GOOD!! (Healthy, too!)

I like things with a kick, so I made this recipe using 9 boneless skinless chicken tenders, 1 fiesta ranch dip mix packet, and 1 1/2 cups of plain store bought bread crumbs. I also coated the chicken strips with zesty ranch dressing before tossing in the ranch/bread crumb mix.  It was quick and tasted great!

Excellent!  I used 4 large chicken breasts, 1 package of Ranch, a few slices of reduced calorie bread crumbs and a little bit of light mayo to spread on the breasts before shaking with bread crumbs.  Chicken was moist and very flavorful, not to mention the entire process is quick and easy.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

This was just okay.  I added some garlic and pepper. I'm not sure what I did wrong but my chicken wasn't very crispy at all, it was soggy. I don't think I'll make this again.

This was fantastic! I only made one change by using Italian bread crumbs, but that seemed to balance the salt.  The flavors were just right and this was delicious!

Very good. Extremely easy!! Even my picky husband said he liked it. The ranch gives it a "zing" that the kids (3&5) said was too "spicy". Very good overall.

This was so simple.  I used 1 pkg. ranch mix for 4 chicken breast halves.  I didn't measure the bread crumbs, but just used enough to coat the chicken.  I had to bake them about 40 minutes, but besides that, it was speedy and easy.  The recipe didn't  make me go "WOW", but easy and good enough for an easy weekday meal.

MMMM! I am a novice cook, but this recipe was so easy to prepare that my chicken tasted straight from a restaurant! I absolutely hate cooking meat because I can never get it perfect, and I rarely like my own meals even when everyone else loves them--but this was delicious! I used Italian breadcrumbs and a little more ranch mix. The bottom of the chicken was a little gooey, but I don't know what to do about that. It wasn't crispy in the general sense, but it gave the chicken a little crunch. I thought it was excellent, and will be making it again! My roommate loved it as well, and he didn't think he would because he hates ranch dressing.

This chicken came out really well.  Because other reviewers had a problem with sogginess, I first dipped my extra-thin breasts into an egg/milk mixture and then coated them.  I would say that for almost 2 pounds of thin breasts, it took two ranch packets and a good cup of breadcrumbs.  Just the right amount of flavor.

Can't get any simpler but definitely double the bread crumbs as suggested by others. Not crispy as the title suggests, but I'll make again.

My chicken definately didn't get crispy the first time I made this.  So what I did the next time was to add just a touch of melted butter to the pan.  I used a pastry brush and just lightly brushed the butter on the pan.  They actually turned out ok....not great but my family ate the chicken and liked it!  Smile....

This was pretty good.  I did add the paprika as other cooks suggested, which helped the color.  I also doubled up on the bread crumbs as the Ranch seasoning would have been a bit salty for us, otherwise.  My husband liked it as did I.  To help prevent the chicken from sticking, I sprayed a little Pam on the pan and that seemed to help.  Nice that it was so easy!

This chicken had little flavor.  I couldn't tell there was ranch in it.

there was nothing really special about this and the chicken was not crispy at all.. didn't taste bad, but probably will not make again.

I thought this recipe was awful. Followed the recipe as it said and 20 mins through the cooking time, I had to get a scrapper to break it loose from the pan. Not to mention it was black on the bottom. Don't waste your time or money.

Outstanding! Doubled the breadcrumbs and left the seasoning as is. Served with mashed potatoes and fresh corn for a quick, delicious dinner.

I altered this recipe - partly because I didn't pay too much attention - but it turned out the juiciest chicken I've had in a long time.  I dredged the breasts in ranch/parmesean dressing then dredged in fresh bread crumbs - was out of the box!  It came out great and was no fuss at all.  Excellent and not too salty at all!

I've been dairy free, so I had on-hand my homemade ranch dressing (mayo, coconut milk, lemon, onion powder, garlic salt and fresh herbs). 

I halved the chicken breasts. It worked out perfectly as other suggested to first dip in the dressing and then coat with gluten-free panko bread crumbs to which i had added a little oregano and pepper. Came out perfectly moist after 28 minutes with a delicious breading. Definitely will make again.

I made this but made some changes.  I made a beer egg mix to dip the chicken breasts in.  I spiced the mix up with some cayenne pepper.  Garlic salt and pepper.   It was really easy to make and bake.  Tasted great and will make again.

I like chicken and I like ranch dressing so I thought I would like this recipe, but the  breading was very bitter, much like lime juice.  Wife couldn't eat it, I suffered through and finished my portion.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Won't make again and would not recommend.

Super easy to make! I coated the chicken in egg first and followed the recipe. the only thing I'll do differently next time is use a one and a half ranch dressing packets instead of two (it was a little salty).

I used a half and half mix of bread crumbs and ranch mix and it was good but really needed more ranch flavor. I will use two packages of ranch mix next time.That was my fault for changing it, but what I got was very good too!

This will become a regular at our house. Using the mayo to help the crumbs adhere is a great idea, and there's no hint of taste from it. Thanks for the hint Katie K and for the recipe, Christy J!

So good. Just a switch up suggestion if you are looking to go a lower calorie, fat, and carbs count I used a Chex cereal and just rolled it in a zip lock to make the "bread crumbs" I actually used three cups (before they were smashed) for 5 chicken breast and had breading to spare. Still comes out delicious and crispy and really sticks to the chicken! :)

I giver the chicken on,y four stars because it needed a little more breadcrumb to actually cover the chicken. But it came out moist and tangy. Also we used seasoned bread crumbs and it still was awesome :)

I love chicken especially when it is crispy. This has the crunch and taste without the oil. I like to put more ranch in it to add more flavor. Yummy!

This recipe is pretty basic but all in all very good.  I coated the chicken in mayo (as the other reviewrs suggested) and used Planko breadcrumbs.  Added a lil paparika, garlic powder and a dash of cayenne (just for fun)!!  Chicken came out sooo moist and yummy.

Fantastic recipe!  It is kid friendly as well.  The only changes I made were to coat the chicken in egg so the seasonings stuck better.  I also used only 1 1/2 packages of ranch the second time I made it.  If you like ranch this is for you!

This is a very easy, tasty meal  I used 4 chicken breasts /1/4 cup of Italian Bread crumb /1/4 Parmesan cheese /1/2 cup Ranch dressing salad (not powder)and Garlic Salt . I cook on 375 for the first 20 minutes and flip over add another 20 minutes total cooking time or depending on how thick my chicken breasts are. This chicken never comes out dry and is very flavorful and very fast and easy to cook.

This is a very easy, very healthy, very tasty meal. I use whole chicken breasts and cook on 400 for 20-25 depending on how thick my chicken breasts are. This chicken never comes out dry and is very flavorful. I make it so often that I have a ranch/bread crumb mixture already prepared in a bag in the pantry. If you don't think it is flavorful, use seasoned bread crumbs and more ranch. You can also soak the chicken in lemon juice for about half an hour before adding the bread crumb mixture.

WOW! I always have trouble cooking chicken, as it can easily dry out or not have good flavor. This recipe was SOOOO easy and packed with flavor! I'm not a huge ranch fan either, but MAN, this chicken is good! I think it would also be good in a salad with avocado, hard boiled eggs and bleu cheese. YUM.

There are only 2 of us so i adjusted the recipe to serve only two, i used 2 chicken breasts (pretty good sized ones, half a package of ranch dressing mix, and just a little more than a 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs). it was wonderful, my husband gobbled it up and asked for seconds! this one is going in the weekly routine, it's easy and i usually have the ingredients on hand!!

The flavor of this was just ok. I liked the way the breading stuck to the chicken but it really didn't flavor it very much, nor brown very well. I did get rid of the last little bits of breadcrumbs and it was tasty enough, but I probably won't make again.

This recipe was easy to make, but very dull.  Even when I adjusted the ingredients the second time I made it, it was still just ok.  No one ranted, but no one raved either.

A little on the salty side for me.  Maybe I didn't use enough bread crumbs and too much of the ranch seasoning

The 4 stars are for ease of preparation & just okay taste. Not sure where the crispy comes in as our breading never got there. The chicken stays nice and juicy, but not a lot of flavor, even though I did add extra garlic powder and cajun seasoning. I don't think I'll make this again.

I brushed a little bit of light sour cream (thinned with just a bit of milk) onto the chicken before coating them in the bread crumb/ranch mixture.  I only used one packet of ranch because that was all I had, and I used Italian bread crumbs.  I baked the chicken on a rack and the crust stayed on perfectly and the texture was great.  I thought the chicken was a little bland, so next time I will be sure to use two Ranch packets.

I cut this recipe in half. I used 8 chicken tenderloins, 1 ranch dressing package, and 1/4 c. bread crumbs. I also coated the chicken with fat free yogurt before the bread mixture. Very good, but a little salty.

After reading reviews, I decided to try this recipe. But I used triple the bread crumbs so the ranch dressing would be a little more divided out. My family loves it and I make it about once every two weeks!

What a simple yet wonderful recipe!  I too, at the suggestion of many members, coated the breasts in mayonnaise and then coated with ranch/bread crumb mixture.  My boneless breasts were thick so I baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  Very juicy and flavorful!

I'll give this 4 because it's very easy but it is salty and I had to heat it up at the last minute under an higher setting to get it crispier. My kids did enjoy it though.

The chicken wasn't really crispy like I thought it was going to be. Next time I will get my husband to grill it instead of me baking it. There was also not really a 'strong' flavor...but since it's healthy I would most likely do it again.

This is the perfect 'kid' recipe. It's not gourmet but it's fast, easy and my kids ate it all up. I sauteed it in a pan instead of baking and served it over rice.

It was ok but a little on the salty side...I would make it again though, maybe using the premade ranch dressing instead.  Ken's dressing is great.

Very tasty...whole family enjoyed it.  I can't have wheat, so I substituted ground up corn flakes for the bread crumbs...this is great!

I did enjoy this but it was to salty for me. Im sure that it was just because the  ranch mix.  I added nothing extra.  I am not a fan of salt but overall it was good.

The chicken tastes great this way. Adding the dry ranch dressing mix makes it all the better. I've made this twice within six weeks.

Ridiculously simple and good.  No, it's not a gourmet meal but sometimes that's not what you're looking for.  I cut the chicken into nuggets and for the breading use probably a 50/50 ratio on dressing mix/bread crumbs so I have enough to cover all the small pieces.  That also cuts down on cooking time so I can have this on the table in less than 20 minutes from start to finish.

Pretty good flavor.  I first marinated the chicken in buttermilk.  Prior to the ranch coating I dipped the pieces in egg.  I used only one package of ranch dressing and 1 cup of crumbs. Tasted very similar to Shake and Bake.

It was WAY too salty so the kids wouldn't eat it. I think next time I will 1/2 the dressing mix amount to cut back on the salt content. It WAS easy though!

This was insanely easy and very, very good.  I had to wait a while to make this because every time I went to the store all the ranch dressing mix was sold out.  It was probably because everyone was making this!!  I have also subbed pork chops for the chicken breasts and it was really good too.

tasted great, but the bread crumbs didn't cook on the sides of the breast and it looked a little funny.. next time, i'll try pounding the breasts thinner, but will definitely be eating again!

It was very good, next time I will make more breading, as there wasn't enough for us, not increasing the amount of ranch, just because it was a little too salty for us.

This turned out much too salty and strong.  Also, the green color made the presentation of the chicken unappetizing as well.

Quite tasty, but very salty! I would double the bread crumbs and halve the ranch mix next time. I also used the suggestion to add papricka for some color, not sure I liked how the 2 flavors mixed, but the chicken looked great! Will do again, because leftovers make GREAT sandwiches!

Very good! I gave it a four only because the way it was written was bland. I used a full cup of breadcrumbs upon making it the second time, and also 1/4 tsp. of cayenne. DELICIOUS this way. My toddler ate like there was no tomorrow. I only wish I'd come across this method a long time ago (or been smart enough to think of it myself!) because I love ranch chicken but with the actual dressing poured over it's pretty gloppy.

Tasted great, but made half as much as it called for. We halved the recipe (4 breasts, 1 packet of ranch, kept the 1/4 cup bread crumbs the same) and ran out after two pieces were coated. What was produced did taste good though and was very easy!

I did a slight adjustment. I wrapped each breast piece separately in some foil sprayed with pam. Also rather than plain bread crumbs I used italian styled ones. The chicken came out juicy and great!!

it came out a bit too strong, the flavor would be better with a little more crumbs and a little less ranch. but overall, it was good
