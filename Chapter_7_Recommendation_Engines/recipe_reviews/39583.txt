Since I am a huge fan of (Chilean) sea bass, I made this recipe several times and played with it before reviewing. In my opinion, the macadamia/bread crumb crust is not worth the trouble. Even when I increased the macadamia nuts and decreased the bread crumbs, there still is no discernable taste that makes the several steps of making and applying the crust worth the effort. In the future I will just bake/broil/grill the sea bass and forget the crust.  The mango cream sauce is another story. It is excellent and makes for a great presentation. I have made it several times with heavy cream and several with Crème fraiche.  I have used slightly green mangos and ripe mangos. I prefer to use the ripe mangos and if you live in an area where you have an upscale market that sells Crème fraiche (pronounced “Krem fresh”) there is no comparison. Always use it versus regular heavy cream.

Killer!!  I used wild salmon filets, brushed them with garlic infused olive oil, sprinkled with red Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper, then applied the nut mixture directly to the fish and baked at 450 for 15 minutes.  Turned out spectacular; fish was moist and crust was toasted and slightly crunchy.  Omitted red pepper flakes from nut mixture, added freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. of brown sugar.  Do not process nut mixture until smooth; that would make a paste, which would be bad. Pulse the mixture until it is light and crumbly, with plenty of nut chunks left, then apply lightly to fish without packing.  I used fat free half and half for the sauce, and added freshly grated nutmeg, 1/4 cup of mango nectar, and a splash of vanilla (the good stuff, please) to the mango sauce.  With fat free dairy and lemon juice your sauce will often separate or curdle; I pureed it at the end of cooking to smooth this out.  Served with saffron rice and steamed broccoli.  Next time I will use lime juice instead of lemon, and add a splash of coconut rum to the sauce.  This recipe is just too good to miss- Thank you Deanna!!!

This is the best fish recipe I have ever prepared. I served it on a large white platter with the sauce poured across the middle of each piece and garnished with mache and add'l chopped macadamia nuts. To really jazz up the mango flavor since it's not always easy to find a real flavorful mango, I added 1/4 cup of mango nectar to the chopped mango (easily available at most grocers). Served it with orzo that I cooked in chicken broth with a splash of white wine, the juice of half a lemon, and some chopped parsley. An outstanding dish with great presentation and flavor.

Delicious recipe! I didn't change anything except the type of fish I used. I used mahi mahi because certain kinds of sea bass have been terribly overfished due to irresponsible fishing methods. There are many excellent alternatives to sea bass (Chilean sea bass has been particularly overfished) that are more known for sustainable fishing practices. Mahi mahi  and pacific halibut both have wonderful textures to complement this dish. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making it again for sure!

This recipe was awesome!  An easy $30+ entree at any elegant restaurant.  Hubby, who is slowly starting to like more fish, loved this!  I love all kinds of fish so I knew it would be a keeper.  Some substitutions I made: I used Del Monte jarred mango in extra light syrup because the store didnt have fresh.  Also, I was told at the fish market that sea bass is not in season right now, so I used a nice fresh halibut fillet instead.  I also used fresh garlic, which makes a world of difference in any recipe. 
   As I was making this, hubby kept hanging around the kitchen - just smelled too good to keep him away!  After pan searing it per the directions, I baked it at 400 degrees for 15 min. (I had a pretty thick halibut fillet so 350 would have taken forever) and that was perfect. After adding the macadamia crust, I broiled it for about a minute. Any longer and it would have burned, but it came out perfect!!  The fish, the crust, and the mango sauce all work so well together. I sauteed up some zuchinni and made mushroom risotto as my sides.  I can't wait to try the recipe again with sea bass.  I'm going to make this for my parents for their anniversary, its that good.  
 FYI - Definitely use macadamias - even though they can be expensive, the flavor is worth it!

Delicious and easy to prepare.  For the reviewer who had difficulty with the mango sauce: I used a combination of fat free half and half and skim milk so I don't think that's the problem.  I do find when adding lemon juice to milk that it can curdle so I blended part of the sauce first, then put it on the stove at low heat to reduce.

My husband and I love this recipe because of the texture that the nuts give the sea bass along with the contrasting salty and sweet taste of the garlic and fish mixing with the mango sauce. This is a recipe that we seldom have leftovers for.

Outstanding dish!  I pureed the mango sauce in a blender for a smoother texture.  Plus, the recipe called for baking after applying the crust; instead I broiled for just a few minutes until golden brown.

WONDERFUL! I put a small dash of nutmeg in the crust mixture, and it was superb. Also, I used orange roughy instead of sea bass to economize. I just baked it at 375 for about 15 minutes, then added the crust & broiled, per another reviewer's recommendation. Thanks for this unforgettable recipe!

This was the first time I've had chilean sea bass and I was excited to try this recipe, but was left completely disappointed (and broke)! I followed the recipe almost exactly, however it came out flavorless and greasy (possibly due to the oils in the crust) I certainly loved the texture of the fish itself, but the crust and creamy sauce overwhelmed the dish and made it shockingly unhealthy. For those of you who will insist on trying this recipe, please due so first with a much less expensive cut of fish to see if you like it. And do not put vanilla extract in the mango sauce as others have suggested. The extract made it taste like a dessert sauce (although it tasted delicious on the scoop of vanilla ice cream I had afterward.) For a fish like this less is definately more. Do yourself a favor and save the time and money for something else. Prepare with a bit of olive oil, white wine, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley. It will cost less and taste much better

Excellent!  I had to use jarred mango b/c my grocer didnt have fresh.  I also added a dash of nutmeg to the mac. crust.  I used med-high heat to sear the fish for 1 min. per side before baking.  I baked at 375F for 12 mins- then added the crust- then broiled for 2 mins.  I served the mango sauce around the fish along side Lipton's Wild Rice and a lemon slice.  This is one of my top 'Looks fou fou but is easy to make' recipes!

This is my favorite way to eat fish. I get it only occasionally because sea bass is expensive. The mango cream sauce is divine and I have used the sauce on baked pork chops and chicken.

I love macadamia nuts and actually searched the site for recipes that used it. Not as a dessert though, but as a main/side dish - I'm glad I found this one. I used salted Macadamia nuts and the mango sauce came out really delicious - I followed another reviewer's advice and pureed the mango sauce - It was so gourmet looking I was quite proud of the results. I tried this with salmon instead of Sea Bass - works well too :)

One of the BEST recipes on this site!  I used catfish instead of the Sea Bass & it was excellent!  The flavors really mingled nicely.  This is definitely going to be a recipe that's repeated in my house!!

Fantastic!  My boyfriend raved about this dish.  I used Red Snapper because there was beautiful fresh fish at the store, and it's hard to find good fish in Colorado.  We had a nice ripe mango on hand, which was definitely helpful.  Because of the thin fillets I used I cooked them in the oven with the crust on them, worked great.

WOW!  I used orange roughy because my market didn't have sea bass and I skipped the bread crumbs and just chopped the nuts and added the seasonings to it.  I served the fish on top of a pile of blanched spinach sauteed with garlic and drizzled the cream sauce around the plate and on top of the fish.  It looked and tasted wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The crust on the fish was delicious; I used orange roughy and dipped the seared, but uncooked fish in the crust before baking and it turned out great.  However, I tried twice to make the cream sauce and the cream curdled.  I did use half milk, half cream, so maybe that was the problem.

This was out of this world good! After searing the bass, I put them on a cookie sheet to bake but coated them with the nut/breadcrumb mixture right from the start and it came out perfect!  Didn't have time to do the mango cream sauce but will try next time.  Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe was delicious. I didn’t have a food processor so I mixed the topping in a blender and it worked out fine. I used this recipe for Chilean sea bass and Salmon. I personally thought the Salmon tasted better with this recipe. I follow everything exactly but had major problems with the mango sauce. I ended up having to puree the sauce in the blender to get the smooth consistency I wanted. Also, it took a long time for the crust to turn brown, a lot longer then I was going to wait (since the fish was already seared/cooked), so I did what another reviewer did and turn the oven to broil. It browned in a few minutes. Make sure you really watch it if you go this route, cause the crust will burn real quick.

Macadamia nuts are ambitious. Just try to name a legume as delicious. Cashews, almonds, pecans? Please, I just washed my hands. This meal makes me want to sleep with the fishes.

This recipe is ridiculously amazing! FYI - after years of using this website, this recipe motivated me to get off my butt to register for a profile so that I could post a review.  Its literally that good. I prepared 2 for each person and even though I meant to eat both, I forced myself to save one just so that I could enjoy this again tomorrow! WOW.  I followed it pretty closely (little more cream, little more lemon, little more macadamia), but one extra step I added was to use old bay seasoning prior to the oven step. I would think this work excellent with tilapia as well, since its a similar mild white flesh fish, more economical as well.   Deanna - who posted this recipe - thank you!!

My DH and I liked the fish alot more than the sauce.  I used fat free half & half. When I tried making the sauce the first time, it curdled.  I then rinsed the mango off, and boiled in a little bit of water with lemon juice and rum.  I then pureed in food processor.  I put it back in the pot with 1/2 tbp of butter and added the FF H/H and warmed.  I must have bought the driest mango on the planet, because this one was not what I was used to.  That being said, we both did not like the sauce nearly as much as we liked the fish.  I served with fresh sauteed asparagus, salad, and an excellent white bourdeaux.  I used haddock, because sea bass in so expensive here, although we do love it.  I save that for the restaurant scene.  Thanks for the post.  I'll use the bread crumb mixture again.

Took a bit of time to make, but well worth the effort.  I didn't have macadamia nuts on hand so I used a combination of pistachio and peanuts.  I also used ready-made mango sauce from a vineyard.

This was AMAZING!!!! I cooked just like the recipe called for and it turned out just wonderful.  I dumped the entire mango sauce on the fish but next time I will drizzle it on because the macadamia browned fish looks so great!! My husband (with a full mouth) asked me to put this in our permanent rotation.

This recipe was just plain delicious! I used fresh Atlantic cod and substituted cashews for the macadamia nuts. The mango-cream sauce was a pure delight and I can't wait to use it on other dishes, even desserts! I was scared that the half/half would curdle, but it came out perfect for me. I peeled, seeded, and diced the fresh mango earlier in the day and sprinkled the lemon juice over the fruit and refrigerated it, then added the half/half before putting the mix in the sauce pan when I was ready to cook. Yummm! I served the fish with a side of almond/dried cranberry/parsley rice, and a fresh salad of baby spinach,arugula, and slivered carrots. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make.  Instead of sea bass I used tilapia and mango salsa instead of fresh mango at the request of other reviews.  Just as good.  This is better than any restaurant!

We couldn't get macadamia nuts so we substituted cashews. It was amazing!! Can't wait to try 
it with the macadamia nuts. Added a touch of vanilla to the sauce, it enhanced the flavour. 
Mashed the mango almost completely, improved the texture of the sauce. Definitely a favorite!!

This meal was delicious!  It tasted as though I worked very long and hard, but in truth the preparation was quite simple.  I'd recommend this for a special dinner, or picky eater as well!

Sauce could use a little something.  Not sure what yet.  I might double the amount of sauce next time too.

Excellent recipe! I had leftover mangos that were too soft to eat, but were perfect for the recipe! Used this with tilapia instead of sea bass and it came out excellent! Thanks so much.

I made this for my family for mothers day and everyone gobbled it up!!!
I agree with other people who said to cut down the olive oil, and you HAVE to puree the mango sauce. It was a hit!!!!

This is a very good recipe the fish is nice and flaky and the crunchy crust paired with a mango sauce is outstanding.  I seasoned my bread crumbs myself and then added more bread crumbs after adding the macadamia crust.  I paired it with Pico De Gallo and it was great!

I made this wonderful recipe for my husband on valentines day. The only change that I made was to broil the topping for 1-2 minutes at the end. My husband can't stop raving about how good it was! Thanks for the recipe. I did use sea bass.

I also substituted the Sea Bass for salmon for ethical purposes, and it came out superbly!  I used light cream instead of heavy, and added coconut milk and fresh corn to the sauce along with a slew of spices.  The end result was divine.  I may try to make the sauce into a seafood bisque next!

The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't think the macadamia nut crust was necessary.  It doesn't crisp up well and is completely masked by the DELICIOUS mango cream sauce.  I'm thinking you could use this base to make any type of creamy fruit sauce.  We used mahi mahi since sea bass wasn't available and I think any white fish would be delicious with this sauce, as would chicken.  Yum!

I cooked this for my Husband's birthday and he loved it.  The mango sauce was amazing and it went perfectly with the Sea Bass. If you're looking for a dish that is relatively easy to make and impressive....this is it!

I used butter instead of olive oil and drizzle some on top of the fish to increase the flavor. The mangoes didn't melt so the sauce was not smooth. It wasn't a very impressive sauce for me.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I used rock fish since it was the only fresh, wild fish available and it tasted great. I made the following changes: substituted fat-free half & half for heavy cream; doubled the lemon juice; added 2 tsp of white rum to the mango cream; skipped the bread crumbs and red pepper flakes and the pan searing. Update: Tried this again with Orange Roughy and it was very tasty. Any white boneless fish would probably be great with this recipe. I served with sauted snow peas and soba noodles, both dressed with sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and garlic. Gave the meal a Pan-Asian twist. 2nd Update: Tried this again with Halibut and skipped the Mango cream sauce entirely and it was still delicious!

This fish is so good!  I used tilapia filets instead of sea bass, and skipped the pan-searing step - I put the nut-crusted raw fish right in the oven.  I turned on the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end to further brown the crust.  The fish was very good, and the sauce complements it well.

This is wonderful! So delicious, easy to make and it looks beautiful when it's done. I used halibut instead of the sea bass.  The mango sauce is so good, you don't want to miss out on it, it's creamy but not too sweet.  Yummmmm I will make this again & again.

Great dish. I'd highly reccommend this to anyone who enjoys the taste of nuts and creme. This is very rich dish, but the taste is amazing. Go light with the crust (Sprinkle lightly to evenly cover fish, but don't over do it with a thick layer). 

Additionally, easy on the creme sauce as its very rich as stated and a little goes a long way. I used sea bass marinated in black bean sauce. If you're in the NY area, go to China town for fresh fish.

Easy to prepare and tasty.  The "encrusted" component makes an impressive presentation for guests.  Cooked the bass within an hour of catching it - - I'm sure that helped!

Our male guests found the mango cream sauce to be a "bit sweet", while female guests loved it.  Served with basmati rice and sauteed broccoli rabe.  This recipe would work well with any white fish.  Chicken, perhaps?  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  I just used fresh made Mango Salsa from a local store with the heavy cream to make the sauce.  YUMMY!  I also used my left over nuts the next night with chicken and it was very good also.

Impressed my family with this one as I am a beginner cook. Used Atlantic cod because my grocer does not carry seabass. Half way through simmering the mango sauce I puréed and returned to pot. I served with fresh asparagus in a buttery lemon white wine sauce over linguine.

I had to use cod instead of sea bass.  I served with angel hair pasta.  Next time I would blend the cream sauce after cooking to get a smooth texture.

Didn't have any macadamia nuts so I used assorted ones instead and it came out wonderful. Loved the sauce, could swim in it!  Next time though, I would use half the cream to try and reduce calories.  Thank you for such a great and easy recipe.

I used about 3/4 a mango and subbed cashews for the macadamia and flounder fillets for the sea bass.  Very tasty - especially the mango cream sauce.  Unlike another reviewer, I would not omit the nut/crumb coating, as it added a complimentary texture with the sauce.  I left out the olive oil from the bread crumb mixture.  This is an easy, tasty recipe for many kinds of fish.

Excellent.  My wife does not like nuts, so we replaced nuts with Ritz crackers.  This works but doesn't have the same crunch factor.  We will definitely try this with different kinds of fish in the future.

I made this for a large family gathering.  At the time I could not find a ripe mango...anywhere...so I used jarred mango.  The sauce was not quite as colorful but it was absolutely devine!!! I bought extra sea bass and was worried that there wouldn't be enough and there wasn't a crumb left!

The only change I made was 2 tablespoons of sweet Asian chili sauce. This kicked up the taste a little without overpowering it.

Loved the sauce. I also ran the sauce through my food processor to make it smooth. The mistake I made was leaving everything in the skillet when I put it in the oven. Should have changed pans. Was to greasy and Sea Bass is a very expensive fish so I will change pans the next time as the recipe says.

You get gourmet flavor with a reasonable amount of effort with this recipe.  Mine was delicious, and I think it would work well with many different varieties of fish.  I might puree the mango cream sauce next time, as I found it difficult to dice the mango into anything that looked attractive - but the flavor was fabulous.  Picky younger daughter liked the fish without the sauce.  An impressive dish!

Couldn't even get the mango cream sauce to come out. I made it twice, and both times it curdled - the first time due to the heat? the second time due to the lemon juice? I really couldn't figure out how the heat and lemon wouldn't curdle the cream.

Took some time to make, but oh so delicious!  I used mahi mahi, and I'm so impressed with how delicious this was!  I did sweeten the mango sauce a tad with white sugar and added vanilla extract as another had mentioned.  Otherwise the recipe was followed exactly.  I was initially worried about this medley of flavors, but now I'm blown away!!!

To be honest, I'm not sure this even rated 4 stars ...which really surprises me considering the reviews...maybe I didn't execute it well. But I thought the sea bass (I used a chilean sea bass) was wayyy too fatty (never knew it was soo much like catfish) & the crust, while tasty, added a lot more fat & calories than I would like on a healthy dish like fish. I cooked my suace down until it was thick (too thick really) so there was no need to puree the mango & I did add a bit of coconut rum. I didn't add it until the end because I didn't want to cook all the flavor out but it was still a little too subtle. Dark rum would add more flavor. The only changes I made to the recipe, (aside from the rum) was to use cashews instead of macadamia nuts because that's what I had. I garnished w/ a bit of fresh, diced mango (should ahve thrown something green on it too). I'm not happy w/ the way I plated it either...wish I had taken advantage of my too-thick sauce & made a "shmear" across the plate & left the beautiful nut crust of the fish bare. I served this w/ Sugared Asparagus, Hawaiian Slaw & Haupia for dessert. Thansk for lettng me try it but I don't think I'll make it again.

I used halibut wich came out nicely but watch out for bones. I subbed smoked almonds that I crushed in the food processer instead of macadamia nuts.  The mango sauce worked very well! I omitted the red pepper and instead of seasoned bread crumbs, I used plain because I thought it would be a better backdrop to the mango sauce and I think it was. I've used this mango sauce successfully with talapia too. Overall, a very good recipe!

Neither DH or I were very impressed with this recipe. I followed it more or less to the T. The only changes I made were to use cashews instead of macadamias and lime juice instead of lemon in the sauce. The dish is quite sweet. I served it with Asian Avocado as an appetizer, then the Curried cashews, pear and grape salad. It could have been that the former two dishes over-powered the fish entirely but overall, I wasn't impressed and probably won't make this again.

This was wonderful...I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband loves fish and would like it more often. This recipe will make me a fish fan also!!  Next time I might try half and half to cut down on the calories.

This was pretty tasty. I couldn't find sea bass, so I used marlin, and other than needing a little more cooking time due to their thickness, they were just fine. I also added more mango, a couple of drops of vanilla extract, and a dash of white pepper to the mango sauce. Served with steamed broccoli for a full, (somewhat) healthy, and delicious meal. I think next time I'll either half the topping or double the sauce though, as it was a bit dry for my tastes.

Very good. I used Chilean sea bass which is my favorite fish. I baked for 15 minutes because the filets were so thick. I  broiled for 2 min and the topping burned. So next time I will cut it down to a min.

The mango sause was YUMMY. I used mahi mahi because sea bass was out of season and mahi was on sale. My friends really enjoyed this rich combo. It's like making a $40 meal for less then half but all of the favor.

My boyfriend and I made this and we thought it was great. We couldn't find seabass or macadamias, so we used snapper and cashews, and it was excellent. The mango sauce is awesome. The only thing I might do differently next time is use only 1 clove of garlic, so it doesn't overpower the flavor of the sauce. We served it with mushroom risotto and sauteed red and orange peppers.

I had hesitations making this as I am not a great cook when it comes to fish - but this tasted surprisingly delicious - my mouth was watering!! I marinated the sea bass in rice wine for a good 10 minutes to get the 'fishy' taste out, then I followed the instructions. I didn't have nuts so I just doubled up on bread crumbs, and when baked, the bread crumbs taste really crunchy and SOO yummy. I used HALF AND HALF instead of heavy cream (its less fat), and it still turned out very well.

I have never cooked Sea Bass before and I really felt like I was going out on a limb here cooking this as a first timer.  All I can say is "Oh My ***"! This was SO SO good.
The Macadamia nuts and the Mango are seemingly meant to go with the sea Bass. I am rarely so moved by a recipe on this site that I actually come back to leave feedback. I served it with Parmesan Risotto (from a box) and sauted up some zucchini as my veggie. Best part of all, this was supremely easy, but looks like a 5 star dish from a fancy italian restaurant.  Try it once, you'll be so glad.

In the country with more fish consumed per capita than anywhere in the world, I never seem to be able to find the right fish!  No sea bass in Japan in October, apparently, so I used swordfish.  I would recommend marinating the fish a little beforehand in sake or white wine to cut down on the fishiness.  I also highly recommend blending the sauce before simmering.

I enjoyed this recipe, but used Snapper instead, and still found it very good.  I did broil the nut crust to get a nice brown texture, and i also blended in some fresh basil into the macadamia crust.  It was a big hit.  For summer I served this with a spinach salad, topped with avocado and mango chunks with lemon and tarragon dressing, instead of rice or potatoes.

Very tasty. I didn't use the red pepper flakes (I can hardly take coarse black pepper) and it was fine. I broiled it to brown the topping, as was suggested in reviews. Sea bass is expensive and difficult to find in a regular grocery store, so I'll try something different next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I used halibut instead of sea bass. Best halibut recipe I have had.

This recipe is amazing!!  We only made a couple of changes.  We used halibut instead of sea bass because the store did not have sea bass, and we put a tablespoon of butter in the baking tin under the fish.  We also did not have time to let the macademia crusting brown because the fish was already at 145 F, and we did not want to overcook the fish.  But it didn't matter.  This turned out to be simply *awesome*.  My husband and I ate all four servings!  Thanks!

I served this with rice pilaf and a mixed veggie blend.  Very good!
I took the leftover mango sauce and put it on top of vanilla ice cream with a few slices of fresh pineapple. DELISH!
Thank you!

we substituted halibut filets for this, and left off the bread crumbs, however the spirit of this dish was preserved entirely I'm sure -- a very simple, very delicious dish.  And the mango cream sauce was so easy and so wonderful to make!

I would love to hear what others are pairing with it though.

Yummy recipe. The only change in ingrediants I made was to use evaporated skim milk instead of the cream and used tilapia fish  I wanted a smoother texture to the sauce, so I put this in a blender first. The contrast in tastes was just wonderful. I'll make this again, when I can afford macadamia nuts again.. :D

This was delicious.  I agree with other reviewers about the macadamia nut topping...next time will do without it was well as puree the mango sauce so that it is smooth.

This was great. I followed the recipe except for adding a dash of Asian chili paste to the mango sauce and pureeing as others suggested. I heated the mango sauce until boiling, let cool a bit, pureed in food processor, and returned to sauce pan on warm until needed. I had a fabulous piece of sea bass - about 12 ounces and 1 1/4 inches thick served two. Served over sautéed spinach with Sushi rice on the side. Can't wait to put leftover mango sauce on something - anything!

Everything was perfect- loved the mango cream sauce and the Mac nuts were a nice touch. The only thing I'll do next time is use a cheaper fish like Orange Roughy or Mahi Mahi. The reason I say that, I used an expensive Chilean Sea Bass and the sauce and crust was a little over powering for that delicate fish. It was very good, just hid the fish flavor more than I'd have liked.

We substituted the sea bass for mahi-mahi with excellent results - and the mahi-mahi (which I buy frozen) is so much cheaper - fear not, try and you will agree!

Made this for my wife and her mom on Mother's Day and it was a total winner! As some others have commented, I used the broiler after adding the crust. I think this is the way to go, you don't want to over cook such a nice piece of fish. The one thing I would have changed is that I would have pureed the mango sauce after cooking to make it nice and smooth. I mashed it up in the sauce pan and it came out fine, I just think the presentation could have gone from good to great. Served with a portobello risotto that was also a total win. If there was one drawback to this dish it was that Chilean sea bass is currently going for $17.99/lb near me, so that keeps this reserved for special occasions. Having said that, I think this recipe would be excellent on something as cheap as the tilapia we get at Costco. That could make this a Tuesday night recipe instead of just special occasions.

I was really expecting this recipe to be amazing from the reviews but for me is was really lacking.  I followed the recipe but had to blend the mangos.  I didn't add any other ingredients to it but wish I was tasting the sauce as I went along because I felt like it definitely needed something more.  The crust was good tasting but would have been better if it stuck and got not just brown but a little crispy.  It was fun to cook dinner with mangos though.

I made the Mango sauce first (made it creamy), when I tasted it... I didnt like the taste... I almost wanted to doctor it up, but I resisted and I am VERY glad I did. I pulsed the nut mixture as per the suggestions so it was crumbly.  Everything went together so well, next time I will add a pinch more red pepper flakes.  This was a surperb dish, I was very impressed, and it was easy!

This was excellent!  I followed the  advice of a few others. For the sauce I skipped the lemon altogether. I pureed Dole mango (no ripe ones in the store), heated it up, added a splash of coconut rum and about a tablespoon of brown sugar, then the heavy cream and cooked until thick. The macadamia crust was awesome.  I spiced it up a little more with the red pepper but the sweetness of the mango sauce was a perfect contrast!

Excellent, I follwed recipe to the "T" and was amazed. Seabass is very expensive but worth it.  I will try the macadamia crust on other fish. My husband and 9yr old loved it.  Thanks for sharing!!

Sorry to be the odd one but we just didn't care for this at all.  The cream sauce was too heavy for our liking.  However, our one year old ate it pretty well hence, 2 stars.

This is absolutely a tasty dish! I forgot to pick up macadamia nuts, so I used almonds as a replacement. It was great, although I'd still like to try the macadamia's next time I make this. The mango cream sauce was the perfect addition!

So freaking good. We made this with mahi mahi instead of sea bass. The macademia crust was delicious. The sauce curdled both times we attempted to make it, so instead we simply chopped up the mango and put it on top. Perfect.

This recipe is both yummy and pretty! I followed the advice of a member and pureed the mango sauce. However, I left it just slightly chunky which added nice bursts of sweetness. I also added about a Tablespoon of dark rum into the sauce. Finally, instead of sea bass I used Mahi-Mahi and served it with a side of black beans and basmati rice. I got much praise from this recipe. I will defintely make it again!

For all the work involoved, I expected the crust around the sea bass to be better.

However, the MANGO cream sauce is to die for and will be used as future toppings for desserts! (Even vanilla ice-cream!)  Just incredible, if that's all you take from this recipe.

Sea Bass is my favorite fish, and this is a perfect recipe that I will make again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly as written. Go easy on the nut topping and the sauce.  I thought more would be better, but not with this flavorful fish, and rich topping and sauce.

I changed this around a little, but I still wanted to comment on how great it was! I coudlnt find macadamia's at my grocer, so I used sliced almonds. For the mango cream sauce, I started heating and stirring it, but I couldnt get to the right consistency so I threw it in my magic bullet and the texture was much better. I added a little salt to the sauce to cut down the sweetness. It came out great.... my fiance loved it! Thanks!

This was amazing.  I served it to 6 and everyone loved it (even my 4 and 6 year old nephews although one didn't like the mango sauce.)  I would definitely make this again.

I havn't eaten fish since 1994 and I've been really closed minded about eating any type of fish, but this recipe has definately opened my mind up, I am slowly breaking into other fish. This one is an ABSOLUTELY GREAT recipe

I made this last night and hubby was VERY impressed!  The fish came out perfect--very moist and the topping added to the presentation.  I didn't have a mango, so I made the sauce with cream, parmesan cheese, lemon, and a splash of white wine.  Will try the mango next time.

This was one of the best meals I have ever made or have eaten at the best restaurants!! What unbelieveable taste!  My husband & kids loved it.  It would be a great special occasion meal but I made it during the week because we had a friend who caught fresh sea bass on a fishing trip -- how lucky were we??!!  And then to find this unbelieveable recipe was a bonus.  I have e-mailed friends to share it and I'm sure they will love it just as much.  I can't wait to try it with other fish and maybe other nuts!  Thanks for sharing this -- I love you for it!

The fish was awesome! Well, it would have been super awesome if it had stopped at the salt and pepper, searing and baking. The breading though was less than impressive, too bland and it took away from the fish.

Excellent recipes.  I used halibut instead of sea bass and half and half instead of cream and it came out delicious.  Make sure when you are heating the half and half not to let it curdle.  Fantastic!

Great Recipe!!! i grilled the sea bass with the olive oil and garlic drizzled on top, instead of pan searing. will certinly  make this again, maybe with another white fish, since sea bass is so darn expensive. my future mother-in-law said it was the best fish she has ever tasted.. a success

I went a little overboard when I bought mangos the other day, and have since been trying to find recipes to use them.  This one has been in my recipe box for ages so I stopped at the fish market and picked up the sea bass - OH MY!  I can't believe it took me so long to make this!  It was hands down delicious!  I did substitute the seasoned bread crumbs (didn't have any)with the panko that I had on hand.  A recipe has to be pretty special for me to make it again - this definitely is!

This was an unbelievable hit!! I cook quite often, and my boyfriend went crazy for this-- his new favorite dish. Said it was as good as something you'd find in a top restaurant. Was a little time consuming to make, but certainly worth it. I used pacific sea bass and it came out perfect. Next time I'll invite people over to share this dish. Perfect for company!

great recipe!  we were in the boonies so we couldn't find half the ingredients....used pecans instead of macadamia nuts, mango chutney instead of real mango, and frozen haddock instead of sea-bass.  It still turned out great!

This recipe is awesome!  Be very careful though, when I put the fish too close to the broiler, the nuts caught on fire.  But once I put it out and scraped off the burned nuts, my dinnner guests raved.  Love it!

This was a nice recipe. Although had to make few changes to it. You can try it too. Macadamia nuts cost a bit too much for me so I replaced them with cashews and creme fraiche works really nicelly with the mango.

Living next to the ocean in California I'm always looking for new good fish recipes and this one was very tasty!! I used Halibut and it came out great. Also, used a tropical salsa for the cream sauce and as it was cooking I used a stick blender to puree it. Gave it a little bit more kick.

I pureed the mangoes & made a creamier sauce.  It was good, but a little bland.  I would rather make Seabass with honeyed apples next time.

I held out on making this for a long time, waiting to get some sea bass.  When I checked for it at the grocer...i was astonished at the expense. I decided to make it tonight with tilapia.  Taking a tip from "guy chef" i left out the mac nuts (didn't have any) and simply sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs atop the baked fish.  To compensate for some of the spices..such as red pepper flakes, i simply added a sprinkling of red pepper to the mango sauce along with a splash of guava-pineapple nectar.  This was a very tasty dish, the prep of the fish alone, even before the crust or sauce...suprisingly, could stand alone, its that good.  Thank you.

I used halibut instead and it was wonderful!!!  We invited some friends over and they agreed with us, it's the best halibut ever.  I added some sugar to the sauce, only because the mango was not very sweet, and a pinch of kosher salt.

Wonderful flavor!  I used a whole fresh mango, but the cream sauce was still a bit heavy for our taste, so I served it with spring mix salad and fresh baked french bread.  Hubby loved it.

I really liked the mango sauce on the fish.  I used cod fish instead of sea bass and almonds instead of macadamia nuts.  This worked nicely.  
I will try with macadamia next time too.

Delightful recipe.  Unusual and very tasty, yet simple.
