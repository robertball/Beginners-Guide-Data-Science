I submitted this recipe and just want to let you know how much tastier this cake is if you can wait 1-2 days before cutting into it.  You will not be sorry!

This was awesome! Very moist and yummy. The only changes I made were 1) substituted 1C brown sugar for 1C of the white sugar, 2) used allspice instead of cloves, which I think would overpower the pears and 3) reduced baking time by about 5min or so.

This recipe was perfect! I was looking for something seasonal for the fall, but unusual. I had never tried pears in cake. It is super moist and very tasty. I used pecans because I didn't have walnuts. But otherwise I followed the recipe.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it in a bundt pan, using 3/4 cup of oil instead of 1. I also decreased the sugar to only 1 1/4 cups, as the icing adds plenty of sweetness.  It was still super moist and delicious- made it for a Sunday lunch and everyone loved it!

I followed the cake recipe exactly but just sprinkled it with powered sugar instead of the butter glaze. It was fabulous. I used ripe Harry and David pears which are terrific on their own and I therefore I didn't want them to go bad. Used all the pears which made three caked. I will freeze them for future use. Will definitely make again!

So I have celiac and had to adapt this to be gluten free. I did 2 cups of brown rice flour, a tablespoon of arrow root starch and a tablespoon of chia seeds. I just greased my pan with coconut oil and the whole cake turned out of the pan beautifully!  I think my husband ate half of the cake within the first 30 minutes of my icing it (not seen in the picture). Overall this was a great cake!

The cake tastes excellent but looked terrible.  Even after oil and flour on the bunt pan, the whole top stuck.  Might have been my Harry and David pears were too juicy! Then the frosting never got smooth and congealed.  It looked like paste on top of my cake.  I will try again and see if I can get it right the second time. Worth mastering!

I made this last night and tried it tonight after wrapping it plastic wrap overnight.  It will be hard not to gobble it up before bringing the rest to work.  Ok, ok, so I'm one of the stinkers who changed things up and not because I'm a great baker but because I don't have a fancy pan :-).  I split the mix between two loaf pans which gave me two squat loaves. I also used half white and half brown sugar because I love brown sugar.  Honestly, I am super happy with how these turned out.  So delicious!  (I think I baked them for a total of 45-50 minutes.  Started at 35 and kept checking them every five minutes after.)  I will be making these again.  Great way to use up those pears we intended to eat as healthy snacks but never got around to them. :-)

very good.  very moist.  I did make just 1/2 the browned butter frosting recipe, and it was plenty for a bundt cake.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  waited over 24hrs to serve this, based on the advice of others.  nice flavor of the spices, I do add a tad more to taste based out of preference.  I used red pears.  I don't know what type would be the best to get a pear flavor.  Mine tasted more like a very nice moist zucchini bread flavor.  very good, and would like to try making this again using a different type of pear than the red pear.  perhaps there would be more pear flavor.

Wonderful cake, I used the fresh pears from our little pear tree we planted last year, so moist great flavor, we waited 24hrs before cutting into it, but I don’t think it’s going to last very long in order to see if taste better after more days have past!

I omitted the pecans but this smelled real good from the beginning till it was ready to eat. My granddaughter kept asking me when it would be done. It was super fantabulous. I defiantly would make this again.

You can't go wrong with eggs butter and pears for taste but the texture was not good plus it was a bit of work for this dessert.
