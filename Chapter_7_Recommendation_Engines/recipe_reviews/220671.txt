This is my kind of salad.  I added crumbled bacon and avocados, because, why not, right?  Just put in everything you love best about salads.  For me, it's not the lettuce! :)

I placed the salad on a bed of lettuce and my family completely enjoyed this. I will make it again for sure.

Hmmm, there is a reason you should eat this on lettuce, because it needs more texture.  Maybe diced carrots, celery, or something crunchy...otherwise all of the ingredients are very similar - soft.  Also, I would recommend cutting back on the feta; the flavor overpowers the dill and dressing.  I think with some adjustments this could be good, but as-is I give it two stars.

Tasty, nutritous, easy to prepare.  What more can one want?  I just got home from a potluck where I brought this dish. I have some left over, but wish it were more. I will be making this again!

Absolutely loved it! I did add mixed greens (not too many). I will make it again, however, I found that it does not take 20 minutes to prepare. By the time you rinse some of the ingredients and chop the others, its longer. Still, it's a winner!
