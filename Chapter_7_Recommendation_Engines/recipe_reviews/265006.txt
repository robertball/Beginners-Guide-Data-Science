I feel like I really shouldn't rate this because I made quite a few changes, but here goes.  I tossed the raw cauliflower with vegetable oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and nutmeg, then roasted it in the oven for 20 minutes (stirring after 10 so it didn't stick).   I used Colby-Jack and a little Parmesan since that's what I had on hand, adding turmeric & curry powder to the sauce along with the salt and pepper.  Topped the casserole with one last sprinkling of Parmesan.

Others have mentioned the dish being watery, and I think roasting the cauliflower helped cut down on that.  I might replace some of the cream with sour cream next time to see if that makes a difference.  I would also add more cheese to the top--nothing like a browned, cheesy top to add zing to a casserole, yum!

I had a similar recipe as this in a keto cookbook using zucchini, I thought this was the same thing but....it cuts out a needed step for more flavor. The other recipe started with sautéing a few tbs of butter, onion, garlic, then adding the cream and cheese to pan and melt, then pour over the veggies.  It pours beautifully, but without heating it all together first, it doesn't pour well as this recipe states  bc the cheese is clumped up in the cream, and covering the veggie is uneven.  I was sorry I didn't just use my first recipe.  This takes 5 mins less bc of no butter, onion, garlic, and melting; but 5 mins more is needed!

Delicious definitely a keeper. I added some dehydrated onion flakes, Cajun seasoning and garlic powder to flavour it up a notch. It turned out a little runny and soupy it could be because I didn’t use heavy cream and substituted with half and half. Still tasted amazing though. Thanks for the recipe

I drizzled cauliflower with olive oil and broil it on low to dry out the cauliflower and proceeded with recipe.  If you are looking for a creamier sauce try adding 4 oz of cream cheese to the mix.

I ended up adding extra cheese (sharp cheddar), but it was amazing either way! My girlfriend doesn’t like cauliflower and she loves this. I make a similar recipe using squash (no heavy cream though). This is awesome.

This was fantastic! I didn't quite stick to the recipe and like someone else suggested, I roasted my cauliflower beforehand in olive oil and mushrooms for 20 minutes. I also added a little bit of tandoori masala seasoning to the cheese mixture before pouring it on my roasted cauliflower. I didn't have any garlic powder, but that would probably be good too. Then I topped off everything with parmesan cheese and popped it back in the oven for another 20 minutes. Will definitely make again!

Great flavor, my cheese and cream did not meld  together to make a sauce though. Next time I will heat the cream and cheese in my Pyrex pan to make a quick sauce, then toss in the cauliflower and bake.

I put my whole  chopped head of cauliflower in a Pyrex dish and  roasted it on 400 for 15 minutes  with olive  oil,  onion powder and salt and pepper.  After 15  minutes added about a 1/2 C cream and 1 C. Cheese and baked  for 25 minutes.  It was not soggy.  It was so delicious.

Delicious and very easy!  I chose to mid all of the ingredients together with the cauliflower, rather than placing the cauliflower then topping it with the cheese and cream mixture.  That works well too.

The taste of this keto cauliflower dish was excellent. I cooked my cauliflower in a steamer to avoid the watery texture and the salt. I do think that it still came out on the watery side though. I added chopped onion, mushrooms and garlic, plus pepper and nutmeg (no salt) to the sauce. 

Okay, I made this again with the other half of the cauliflower and added beet tops and spinach that I had on hand. It was scrumptious again. BTW I used heavy cream and sharp cheddar cheese. I mixed up the cauliflower and greens then poured the sauce over and tumbled a bit more to make sure all pieces were coated.

I used a bag of cauliflower florets, so I wasn't sure how that translates to pre-prepared florets. So my proportions may have been off. I made a bit more sauce, but it ended up a little soupy. But I think it turned out well overall!

I found this when looking for a cauliflower casserole (and it didn't have to be Keto). I used a 12-oz bag of Trader Joe's cauliflower florets. I followed some of the suggestions of the top reviewer. I tossed the cauliflower with canola oil, salt, pepper and a touch of paprika and nutmeg. Roasted at 400F for 15 min, mixing halfway through. I used Colby-Jack cheese, parmesan, one slice of crumbled Velveeta cheese and light cream. Before adding a bit of curry powder and turmeric, I  kept some of the cheese aside for topping the casserole. Baked for another 20 min or so, until it was browned a little. Delicious and light!  Will try with the cheddar cheese the next time, which I think I'll like even better. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few changes because I wanted to add some protein to it and make it a main dish. I add firm tofu. I cooked the tofu and seasoned it before adding to the dish. I added zucchini to it. Also, I melted the cheese sauce first in a sauce pan and lured over the top.  I baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  I would have given it a 5 but it is just a tad bland. Next time I will

Steam rather than boil the cauliflower cuts down on liquid within cauliflower - less watery.  Also used low fat cheddar and unsweetened soy milk  with 2T flour to keep creaminess

Made according to the recipe. Turned out watery and not much flavor. I salted and peppered well. Also made the cheese and cream sauce before baking. Drained the cauliflower for 1/2 hour before putting into the casserole. Not sure what I did wrong. But not a favorite.

Really good.  Sprinkled a little nutmeg on top. Heated up the cream and cheese as suggested by others. Will make again.

Made exactly as written. I’m not on a keto diet, but if all of the food is that delicious, I may consider it. Yum!

This dish was easy to make and very creamy.  It was a bit bland and needed flavor. I will make this dish again and Will probably add a bit of garlic.
I did take the recommendation of the other review and melt the cream and cheese and then toss my cauliflower in and then baked.

I followed the directions given. Made no changes. Loved it. It was far more filling than I thought as well.

Very easy recipe & very tasty.  Next time I make it I will increase the cheddar and decrease the cream. The sauce did not thicken much but was tasty.  I will definitely make it again.
