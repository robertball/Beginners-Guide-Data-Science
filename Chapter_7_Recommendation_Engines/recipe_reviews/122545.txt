Update: Made these a second time and subbed 1 egg for the mayo and I think I liked them better w/ the egg. But in a pinch, its nice to know mayo is a sub for egg/oil. Original review: Was nervous about the mayo, but it turned out ok. Really good cookie---I like the addition of raisins to the traditional CCC. My family wasn't so pleased with the raisins, but I liked them. (:

I think this is the tollhouse cookie recipe with mayo instead of an egg (and added raisins/nuts).   Anyhow I decided to use an egg while making it and thats when it hit me that I knew the recipe already.  My recommendation for awesome tollhouse cookies is the original recipe with the addition of rice krispies - awesome! (and no nuts or raisins)

Delicious! This was only my second time making homemade cookies, the first time being yesterday but I followed a different recipe and it didn't turn out too well..but my husband ate them anyway. 

I did make a few changes to this recipe:
-I changed the serving to 14  
-I didn't add any raisins or walnuts
-I used a total of 1/4 cup sugar (brown and white)
-I used applesauce instead of butter
And they came out terrific!

Thanks for a great recipe!

THese were fabulous. I didn't realize until I'd already started the recipe that I only had 50% fat mayo but they turned out great just the same. I sub'd shredded coconut (1/4 c) for the nuts as I didn't have any and really liked the taste. I should point out that there were 5 stars even though I burned them!! :) The edible parts were divine.
