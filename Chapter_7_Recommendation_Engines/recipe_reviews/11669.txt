It's excellent but I made LOTS of changes based on other reviews.  I chopped tomatoes from a 28-oz can of tomatoes.  I used a 15 oz. can of lima butter beans instead of cannellini beans.  I sauteed three diced garlic cloves in 2 Tbsp olive oil and began the sauce with that. I addded 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano to the sauce.  I doubled the amount of pasta (to 16 oz.) to serve all five people in my family. I crumbled 8 oz. of feta cheese and mixed it with the entire pasta/sauce mixture instead of just putting it on top.  I think it's great now.

I thought this was a great simple meal - easy to make and so good!  I also used plain diced tomatoes instead of the italian style.  I sauteed some garlic and onion first, added the tomatoes along with 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, and some italian seasoning and let simmer for about a half hour, then adding the beans, fresh basil, and spinach.  Absolutely delicious!!  Will be making on a regular basis... mmmm...

Initially this sounded good...but then I read the so-called reviews.  There were so many changes/additions/deletions I didn't know where to begin.  Ladies, make the recipe as is.  If you feel the need to change things & not just tweek...submit your own recipe.  Otherwise just submit tweeks, not major changes!  Sorry for the rant, but I get so tired of reading about a wonderful recipe only to find out it's only wonderful if you make the following major changes...

This was great but I'll tell you what I did.... after cooking and draining the pasta and putting it back in the pot, I put the spinach right on top and then the sauce - spinach did not get soggy and was very good - this is a keeper for me!!

We loved this dish. I will make this over and over again. Super fast, easy and cheap! I made some changes. Sautéed a little onion and 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil, then added a little sherry and let it cook down. Only had plain canned tomatoes so I added a good Tbsp of Mediterranean seasoning, 1 Tbsp of sugar, black pepper and cayenne pepper to them. Added sliced black olives and had to use frozen spinach which I drained well and only used ½ of the box. That worked fine. All I had was fettuccini so I tossed it with the tomato mixture and had to add a little chicken broth because it was a little dry. Excellent!

Great recipe! Like other reviewers, I also sauteed some garlic (2 cloves) in a teaspoon of olive oil and added basil, oregano, and ground white pepper for an extra kick.  I might try a pinch of crushed red pepper next time.

Excellent recipe!  I'm always looking for non-meat main dishes to serve on  Fridays during Lent, and this one fit the bill perfectly!  I did use the plain diced tomatoes and added fresh basil and minced garlic as recommended by other reviewers.  I also added some sliced black olives, and used tomato-basil flavored feta cheese on top.  It was wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again!

Good recipe as is, affordable and tasty. We used whole wheat penne and reduced fat feta. My 14 month old loved it, it was the first time she's had spinach. Thanks for the recipe, this will be in our regular dinner rotation now.

I really liked this. Mine seemed a little salty, not sure why. I used a little less beans (15 oz.) and more spinach--1 lb. frozen bag. I think the original measurements in the recipe are better. Also, hadn't cooked frozen spinach in a while--the fresh definitely tastes better. Next time I think I'll use regular canned tomatoes and add fresh garlic and fresh spices for a better taste.

LOVE this recipe! I would recommend getting the tomatoes and beans started while you wait for your water to boil. Doing it this way, both my water and tomatoes and beans were ready to cook at the same time and were done at about the same time, so I think it saved me about 5 minutes or so of cook time which counts when you have two hungry little ones waiting for dinner. =) I also think this could be yummy cold!

Being Greek myself, I suggest you add lemon and dill to this dish. You can Greekify anything by adding spinach, oil, lemon, dill and feta.

Loved it, it's a keeper!  We did modify as per various suggestions in reviews below.....  -Added  3-4 garlic cloves, a large shallot (b/c I was out of onions) some oregano and added 2 fresh tomatoes to the 2 cans of diced, maybe did not use the full 10 oz. of fresh spinach, otherwise followed the directions.  My family of 4 loved it!

I had to add a lot of stuff to this recipe to give it some flavor. I used all fresh ingredients: tomatoes, basil, spinach, mushrooms, onion, garlic and oregano. I also used crushed red pepper (for some heat), rinsed cannellini beans, low-fat feta and whole grain pasta and added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts. If I had them, I would have thrown in some kalamata olives, too. The basic recipe just needed some "oomph"!

Quick and easy to prepare. Will definitely make again. Next time I will use parmesan cheese, as I think that goes better with the ingredients. Not a WOW dish, but a good quick meal that tastes good. I think maybe some wine in the sauce would be a nice addition.

This recipe is a great base but needed a lot of additions and modifications.   --To make it spicier, I added 1 tsp. dried sage, 1 tsp. dried organo, and 1 tsp. dried basil, as well as 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  Also for garnish, I used 1/2 chopped Kalamata olives (which give it more of a kick and also more of a Greek flair) --To make it healthier, I used whole grain penne pasta  Also another major change I made is that I didn't combine the spinach and the tomato/bean mixture while cooking.  I sauteed the spinach separately with 4 green onions (finely chopped) and 2 cloves of garlic.  Once the spinach was wilted, I added the spinach on top of the pasta and sauce as a garnish.  It did create more dishes, but I believe that the spinach was more flavorful this way and the end result was much prettier than it would have been.  (Note: Make sure to use organic spinach, as regular spinach has a lot of pesticides, and then wash the spinach throughly as it has a lot of dirt on it.  Then, dry it as it releases a lot of water while cooking, and remove the stems and chop finely)  Once modified, as one reviewer stated, it tastes great and is fresh and healthy (not things usually put in the same sentence)!  I will make this often!

This was very easy to make.  I loved the end results-- so colourful and delicious!

I changed just a few things-- I used regular diced tomatoe cans with low sodium and added salt myself.  As the Feta was salty enough I will probably not add any salt to the sauce next time around.

I used a medium onion and several minced cloves of garlic to add some flavor.

I used a 9oz bag of spinach, but I would probably use more next time, as it adds so much flavor and colour.

Lastly, I was running low on spices, so I added just basil.  I'm sure this will be even better with a few more herbs and spices.


Turned out great!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this simple recipe, but like others altered & added my own ingredients too. I also added 3 cloves of garlic & Italian seasoning to the sauce. I mixed in chopped artichokes & sun dried tomatoes (in oil) to the pasta after adding the sauce & feta. Everyone loves it, that has tried it!

Although I wanted to like this one, it turned out pretty bland although I added garlic and herbs to the sauce. I would suggest to decrease the amount of beans by half and add black olives. It's missing something to bring all the flavors together but I can't see what exactly.

This recipe is VERY good! I halved it for the husband and I and the portions were good, maybe a little larger than normal. It made a great sauce, but I think I would add less spinach next time [I added less than 5 oz to begin with].

I haven't even made this dish yet and I'm eager to rate it!  I can see that this is such an easy recipe to make and a fun recipe to modify in a variety of ways.

I am going to make this as an entre' for dinner tonight.  I'll use whole (not chopped) spinach leaves and wilt it in to the cooked pasta so it doesn't cook down too much (Florentine style), and I'll add some grilled chicken for a protein since don't have cannellini beans on hand (next time!). I'll also Greek-it-up a touch more and add some sliced Kalamata olives to the sauce.  I can really see how much fun and flavor we'll enjoy with this dish!

This is great. I read others' reviews and sauted garlic/onion at the beginning, then followed directions as written, except I added the feta for the last two minutes of cooking.

i opted to add some garlic and onion in EVOO before adding tomatos and beans, i thought it was good but it still needed something. I also added black olives. I think I will add more garlic next time

I made this last night for dinner and it was yummy.  I only had plain canned tomatoes so I followed the other reviewers advice and sauted the onion and garlic and added my own italian spices.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I can't wait for dinner tonight to have the leftovers:)

Made suggested adjustments with onions, garlic and oregano and cooked down the tomatoes--that part was great. But there was too much spinach for the amount of pasta and the beans just didn't taste that good with the pasta.  Family ate it, but it's definitely not on the do-it-again-mom list.

I might be unfairly rating this as I can't have tomatoes so I omitted them and added in olives. As some suggested I used Lima Beans in place of the Cannellini beans. 
I added in some garlic, paprika, peppercorn, tuna and parsley. I cooked the beans and olives in a little bit of olive oil. Even with all this the dish was rather bland. The feta was really what made this edible for me but then my husband disliked it.

Great! Nice and fresh. I added minced garlic, salt, and a little tomato sauce and only used half the spinach & diced tomatoes since I was cooking for one. Turned out great!

Loved it!  So did my 3 year old.  Followed the suggestions and sauteed garlic in olive oil first.  Only used about 1/2 as much spinach as called for.  I also dill.  Hope it is as good for lunch tomorrow.  Easy and healthy.

Very good, but needed a few changes.  Sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil. Then added tomatoes with a little bit of the juice and beans (i used garbonzo beans because that's what i had on hand).  Seasoned with salt, pepper and italian seasoning. Added a teaspoon of sugar to balance the tomatoes.  Overall, a good, quick, healthy dinner!

Sauted 3 tsps. mined garlic in EVOO before adding tomatoes and beans.  Added handfulls of spinach at a time adding more as it began to cook down.  Otherwise followed recipe to a tee.  Very good.

This is good but it lacks something. Definitely a little bland without the cheese but super healthy!  Made with the additions of garlic, onions, Greek oregano, and substituted 5 fresh tomatoes instead of the diced. Yum.

I loved this, but hubby didn't! (carnivore!) I made a few changes: sauteed garlic and onions, used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned, and added a tsp of oregano.  I loved it! So fast and easy, and tastes like good health  :)

This recipe was good, but only with help from the other comments. Make sure you add spices and what not to your liking because without them the recipe will be very bland!

This recipe has great potential but unfortunately it just didn't work for me.  Like others, I sauteed garlic and onions before adding the tomatoes. The recipe would have been delicious, had I used regular canned diced tomatoes and added my own seasonings. The italian seasoned diced tomatoes thoroughly overpowered the rest of the flavors, and my dish tasted almost of nothing but sugar and feta cheese.   I will make again, next time with more garlic, unseasoned diced tomatoes, and fresh herbs.

This pasta dish is simply delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter, but had to double this. I did make a few changes with the cooking process, only because of personal preference. I used 1/4 c olive oil with 3 cloves crushed garlic in a large saucepan and slowly simmered, basically infused the oil with the garlic. I then added the diced tomatoes and simmered for 10 minutes, no lid on the saucepan. I used baby spinach so there wasn't any need for chopping and stirred that in until wilted. Last, I added the beans and only heated through about 3 minutes because beans have a tendency to break up and turn to mush if cooked too long in certain sauces, that's why I decided to save them for last. I did add half the feta to the pasta mix before serving for some added flavor, and I also topped the dish when served with some crumbled also. I will make this again as I love Mediterranean flavors and this hits the spot! I may add some chopped Kalamata olives next time, which would really compliment the flavors in this dish. Thank you :)

This is good as is, but has the potential to be fantastic with a few additions (this coming from someone partial to good homemade greek dressing)...wisk together 1/3c olive oil and 1-2tbsp red wine vinegar, add juice of one lemon, a clove of minced garlic and a good tablespoon of finely chopped fresh oregano, salt and pepper, and pour over dish just at the end. I threw in some raw onion and WOW! The fresh oregano,(and maybe even a little fresh mint) keeps it gorgeously greek!

Delicious and easy recipe! We followed the directions except using half the tomatoes and a sauteed onion and some garlic with the veggies (I think it would have been perfectly good without). We will make this again!

We loved this.  Sauted 1/2 diced onion with diced red bell pepper and lots of garlic, then added tomatoes, about 1/2 c. white wine and 3 Tbsp. fresh minced basil and simmered for 15-20 minutes.  Then added beans (used 2 cans), then spinach.  Also used 16 oz. wheat penne.  Enjoyed leftovers for several meals.  Yum.

Wonderfully simple recipe that is full of flavor! I prefer unseasoned diced tomatoes instead of the stewed type. So, I used the diced and like others suggested, I also sauteed some minced garlic (2 cloves) and added 1/2 c. chopped onion in a bit of olive oil with 2-tsp. basil & 1/2-tsp. oregano. This recipe made quite a bit of sauce, so I used the whole 16oz. box of penne and it feed my family of 4 with enough left-over for my DH to take for lunch the next day. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night and I was pleasantly surprised! The combo of flavors is excellent - I will definitely be making this again. One comment: I used regular no-salt added diced tomatoes and added my own Italian spices and a little salt (the sodium in the salt I added was WAY less than it would have been in the regular Italian tomatoes). It makes the recipe even healthier and tastier!

Easy and very good. Filling, but at the same time a refreshing change from heavy pasta dishes. I followed the recipe, only adding some basil, salt and pepper to the sauce while simmering.

Great veggie recipe.  For extra zip, I used the feta with sundried tomatoes.

I added chicken to this dish, and made one other change.  I used a can of spinach (had no fresh).  I will NOT do that again.  That was a mistake.  I will make this dish again, but with fresh spinach for sure.  I will also use more feta.  This dish would probably also be good with shrimp.  Thanks for the post!

I liked this!  I added chicken, garlic and a little oregano because I just can't help doctoring stuff up.  I gave it 5 stars because it's good but mostly because wow, is this fast and easy.

I made a few changes from the orginal recipe, chopped black olives, my own canned stewed tomatoes, extra garlic,and extra seasonings, also put in oven baked for 30 mins, blended the seasonings nicely....so good, will make often also used wheat penne, which naturally adds the sweet to cut the tomatoe taste....

This was so easy and so good!! I've made this a number of times now.  I add lots of fresh garlic and fresh basil.  I also add salt and pepper, a touch of sugar and a splash of worcestershire sauce.  It's a very good, quick meal on a week night!

I love this dish!  I sauteed a clove of garlic in a small amount of olive oil before proceeding with directions.  Also when I added the spinach I included some chopped fresh basil.  Delish!!!  I will make this often!!

I wasn't a big fan of this.  It would have been better with a different cheese.  Overall it was a healthy, filling dinner, but we didn't love it.

This was foolproof!  My boyfriend (who can't cook) wanted to cook for me, so I picked this because it would be super easy.   Even with him cooking it was on the table in 20 minutes.  The only changes I made were to begin the sauce by sautéing an onion and some garlic, and I added a small can of chopped tomatoes and 5 fresh roma tomatoes.  I also added a good tablespoon each of basil and oregano.  We served it with store bought rotisserie chicken, but it would be good on it's own.  Surprisingly the beans tasted really good with the pasta.

I used a whole (approx 13 oz) box of whole wheat penne, not quite the whole bag of spinach, an extra can of diced tomatoes, and added some sliced fresh mushrooms and seasoned it to my family's taste with garlic, oregano, basil, and a little bit of crushed red pepper.  Very versatile recipe that I'm sure we'll being seeing a lot of at our dinner table!

This recipe is now one of my favorites. It is just as fast as regular pasta to make with much more flavor. I did change it a little, all i had was plain diced tomatoes so i cooked them and added some garlic, fresh basil and parsley.

Good vegetarian fare! I added garlic, onions, basil and oregano, plus a bit of soy sausage for a meaty texture. It was pretty darn good! Easy and affordable. Even my carnivore hubby liked it!

We really enjoyed the flavor of this dish. I sauteed 3 tsp minced garlic in 1 tbls olive oil and then added the diced tomatoes and butter beans. I boiled 16 oz penne pasta, but (if you aren't feeding a large family) I think that for a more flavorful dish, 8 oz would be sufficient. Again, wonderful flavor. Thanks!

I gave this recipe to my husband to cook up. I wanted something quick and easy since he isn't all that great in the kitchen. We follow this recipe exactly with just a few minor tweaks. We used can tomatoes and frozen spinach since that was what we had on hand.(Though I'm pretty sure fresh would of made this dish even better.) Based on another review suggestion, we added olive oil, garlic salt and lemon juice. Since we didn't have dill we went with thyme and oregano. The house smelled great as this was cooking up. And the taste was magnificent!! My husband and I decided this recipe is a keeper.

I enjoy making this on a busy weeknight especially on meatless Mondays.  I add more feta (tomato basil flavor) and use frozen steamed spinach as a short cut.

I enjoyed this by adding chicken and some chives.  I think garlic would have also added a nice kick.  My bf didn't care for it, but that is b/c he didn't like the feta.  Overall, a nice basic dish, especially with the addition of chicken for protein.

Like others of course I did a few alterations. I added just plain diced tomatoes, used sweet peas instead of beans and added, salt, parsley, cilantro, pepper and chopped garlic. My girls loved it which makes me happy because they are extremely picky eaters.

Good and healthy, although I made a couple of changes.  I added garlic and parsley flakes, which I strongly recommend, and used 16 oz. of whole wheat penne.  I don't like a lot of pasta sauce on my pasta, so I didn't double the amount of tomatoes or feta.  And I actually halved the amount of spinach (10 oz. would have been overwhelming, in my opinion).  Next time I will double the amount of beans, though.  Will definitely make this again!

A great, fast, satisfying, weight watchers dinner.  I used 1 cup whole wheat pasta and 4 T grated Asiago cheese instead of the Feta and I calculated that this was only 6 points.

Very good recipe. We added kalamata olives to it, which gave it some nice depth.  Artichokes were also a nice add on the second day.  Definitely a keeper recipe that can be adjusted according to your tastes.

I also sautéed 3 garlic cloves and a table spoon of fresh basil in olive oil and then added the canned tomatoes. It was just ok. On the bland side for me. I also needed to add a small can of tomatoe sauce to the tomato mixture to make it "wetter". Sauce is too thick w/o it. If I make this again I would add ground turkey
*UPDATE* This was 5 stars the day after. Maybe the flavors needed time to come together?!" It's great w/o meat now

Very good and healthy too!  The feta cheese is what makes it!  Based on other reviews, I sauteed one small onion + 5-6 cloves of fresh garlic, then added the 1 28 oz can italian tomatoes (cut up)  and later added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes to add more liquid.  To the tomato sauce I also added: 1/2 tsp suger, 1 tsp salt, some pepper, basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, a small can of black olives, drained. I added 2 chicken breasts, sliced  (browned in a skillet w/ ground pepper fresh garlic, onions).  I did not chop the spinach, since it wilts down to nothing.

I found a couple things missing from this recipe- namely oregano, basil, and garlic. I added five cloves of garlic browned well in olive oil and a healthy smattering of oregano, basil, crushed red pepper, and salt.  Very good, I will make again.

I actually made this recipe a few years back from a cooking magazine. I like that it's healthy and has a good flavor. I like to use a flavored feta, and italian seasoned diced tomatoes. It gives it more flavor. We make this often in our household.

Tastes great!  Easy to prepare!  I followed to recipe exactly but used whole wheat pasta. The next time I'll saute garlic before adding the tomatoes and beans. Super vegetarian meal.

YUMMY!  I made a few tweaks to up the nutrition and decrease calories.

-Used whole wheat pasta
-Doubled tomatoes 
-Doubled spinach
-Used fat free feta

I only made a half recipe because I knew my kids wouldn't touch it.  Half recipe still made a LOT; I got 3+ meals out of it.  I will definately make this one again.

adding fresh basil is a must for this dish, other than that it makes a great sidedish or a great vegitarian main dish.

Lacked serious flavor. I think I'd add sauteed onion and garlic next time. Also I used frozen Spinach which I didn't like so will definitely use fresh if I make this again. Quick and easy and satisfying though.

I am giving this dish a four because I added several things to it to make it tastier.  First of all, I sauteed garlic in olive oil before adding the tomatoes.  I added basil, oregano, and a pinch of sugar to the tomato sauce.  This dish is a very nice, cheap vegetarian meal.

Very tasty and easy!  We used garbanzo beans and added crushed red pepper for a little zip.  Used a feta cheese with mediteranean seasonings and garlic.  Thanks for this great recipe!

My husband really liked this! Even my little toddlers ate it (spinach and all).  Only thing I did different was add sauteed garlic and omit the feta.  All in all, a great way to eat healthy.

Very easy to make.  Quite tasty.  The feta cheese gives it a nice salty flavor and brings out the taste of the tomatoes.  The beans add a nice flavor.

A wonderful, easy, and low-cost dinner.  It is a great way to get the family to eat spinach.  My daughters (ages 2 and 3) and my non-spinach-eating husband cleaned their plates.  I also sauteed 3 cloves of garlic before adding the tomatoes and beans and I may try adding some black olives next time.  This is a recipe I am looking forward to sharing with some vegetarian friends of ours.

This is a nice stick-to-your ribs recipe.
I get home late but hate to miss out on a nice meal. This is very good addition to my repertoire of quick and elegant food. Folks in my household love spinach and love beans. I'm not sure they've ever had them combined before. It does work, nicely.
We had white wine with it and thought red would be just as good, if not better.

The reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am not a big fan of the ingredients, but I decided to make it for so many reasons!  Pasta is such an inexpensive meal, beans are so healthy for you and I had them in my pantry and the vegetable you can never get enough!  Put them all together and you have a very good meal!

I thought this was the most disappointing recipe that I have ever used from allrecipes. com. The meal tasted like some beans, mixed in with some canned tomatoes and some cooked spinach. The feta helped. Not a good taste in my opinion

This is a great basic recipe which is perfect as-is, or could be added to to suit personal tastes.  I fixed this as-is and it was great!  I think, next time, I will add some Italian sausage to give that a try.  I also like the idea of starting the sauce with some sauteed garlic.  Easy, cheap, healthy...wonderful!

I don't quite get it....

So it's pasta...and you throw a can of tomatoes with beans and spinach on it?  I don't know if I missed something or what, but to me it was just pasta with tomato sauce and beans.  It tasted alright, but it would have made more sense to just make penne with pasta sauce from a jar.

I wasn't a huge fan of this myself. The Penne was too much pasta I think for this dish. However, my husband did like this a lot.

This was an excellent and easy to prepare dish made mostly from items I keep in the pantry all the time.  It also works really well with goat cheese.

Would have been so much better without the spinach.  It turned bitter and goopy.

I used canned diced tomatoes with olive oil and garlic and added a small can of sliced olives, it really gave it a nice flavor.  Next time I think I will cook the sauce for a shorter time as the uncooked flavor was so good I couldn't stop eating it from the pan!

Pretty good!  I added 2 cloves of garlic, oregano, canned mushrooms, and black olives.  I forgot to get spinach, but it was fine without it.

Made the recipes exactly as is and it is delicious! DO NOT boil your tomato mixture as it will make the tomatoes taste bitter. Simmer on low. I think I will add parmesean the next time I make the dish. THANKS for the recipe.

Awesome, quick, and hearty. I only had kidney beans on hand and they were still delish. I also added garlic and some greek seasoning to the saute.

This was really excellent-I took the advice of a previous reviewer and sauteed a few onions and some garlic in olive oil. Add the tomatoes, cooked about 7 minutes, added the beans, cooked another 3, and then added in the spinach. I also added some additional seasonings-Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes as we like our sauce a little zestier.     A lovely combo of ingredients-a hit with both myself and my 5 year old and a really quick and easy meal-had it with a salad and french bread-super good!

I am not one to alter a recipe and then give it a less than favorable review because I hate to read reviews like that, but after reading the reviews I sauteed some garlic in olive oil and I also added additional dried basil, oregano, and salt and used whole wheat penne. Since the Italian-style tomatoes already had garlic, basil, and oregano in them, I did not consider my additions to be considered outlandish.  I make a recipe very similar to this and it calls for fresh basil on top which would be a great addition but I didn't have any.  My husband and I agreed that this was pretty good as a healthy, vegetarian dish but that funny feeling on my teeth that I get from the oxalic acid in the spinach makes this not as enjoyable for me.  Not sure I will make this again unless I am guilt-riden to eat something healthy and just happen to have all of the ingredients in my pantry.

Yummy, very easy recipe!  Quick for busy moms during the work week!  I've altered the feta for goat cheese for a different flavor.  Either way (feta or goat) it's a great recipe.

Very surprised how awesome this recipe was! I thought healthy and tasting good never went together, but this recipe changed my mind! I added a little bit more spinach, and half of a chopped onion to the sauce. I also used multigrain pasta.

This had excellent fresh flavor. I used a can of diced tomatoes that had garlic, basil, and oregano in it already (Italian style tomatoes?) and only used 7 oz spinach. The beans though, still had a bland canned taste though so maybe a longer simmer in the tomatoes would fix that? This was really flavorful. Even the hungry teen liked this a lot and his only complaint was there was no meat like meatballs in this. Excellent recipe! Thanks.

This was definitely filling at dinner tonight but it didn't "wow" me.  I added two cloves of garlic, about 1/4c chopped onion, a small can of black olives, and Italian seasoning and it still seemed like it was lacking something.  I enjoyed the feta (tomato and basil flavored) but, overall, the dish was a little bland for our tastes.

What an easy meal. I didn't have Italian diced tomatoes so I used regular ones and added herbs and spices. I made this for my daughter who is trying vegetarianism and she loved it. The feta is the perfect addition.

This was a great dish. I wish I had a digital camera; I could not believe I made such a gourmet-looking dish ! Easy and quick, and no need for salt, which is what I'm trying to reduce. Feta cheese gives excellent flavor too.

Wow!  Very tasty AND very fast!  Even the "meat" eater in our house was very surprised!  I added just a little sugar to the tomatoes (because granma always said to) and maybe a dash of garlic salt.  And of course, more feta!

Easy and quick? Yes. Tasty? No. This was very bland. Perhaps with experimentation, could be improved. Needs to be jazzed up with something.

It was great!

2 problems...

1. I didn't use enough spinach; and
2. Canned italian diced tomatoes. Should that have been drained? I feel the sauce was too watery.

Otherwise, this was quick and delicious and unlike all the other people who tried this - i didn't turn it into a completely different receipe

This wasn't super exciting, but it was exceptionally easy, and still pretty tasty.  I added garlic, but otherwise I pretty much followed instructions.  The only thing I did different was adding the spinach in with the pasta instead of the sauce, just because the pot was bigger and spinach takes up so much room before it wilts.

Terribly bland. Beans seemed weird to me with this dish. Use this only as a base to add other ingredients!

This recipe is perfect as written.  It's light with a delicate flavor, quick and simple.  After tasting, I added some black olives that I needed to use up. It's great with the olives as well.

This is a very basic recipe and uses canned ingredients, so I won't give it 5 stars, but it is healthy, tasty and is my go-to recipe for when I bring a meal to another family and need it to be quick.

I used a full pound of the pene and subbed goat cheese for the feta.  It melted in all gooey and all 5 kids I fed it to loved it (all under the age of 8) and many asked for seconds!

This was good not great but that may be more my fault than the recipe's.  Next time I'll either use fresh tomatoes and add my own seasonings or I'll use high quality canned tomatoes instead of the store brand (which I had in the pantry).  Also, next time I won't make as much pasta.  I'll make 4 -5 oz. of pasta.

This tasted great! My family enjoys pasta, so I am always looking for new ways to serve it. The mix of flavors was just right. I did leave out the feta cheese, it was included on the table as an optional add in. Those of us who enjoy feta, and those who do not, both found the dish tasty.

There's something about the beans/penne combination that just didn't work for me. The flavors were OK, but this is not something I will likely make again. If you're a feta fan, add more than the recipe calls for!

Really GOOD!  I always use Hunts or Delmonte diced tomatoes with Basil, Onion & Grlic or with Chillies.  They spice things up.  You gotta add the feta.  It adds an amazing flavor.  I served it with Turkey Kielbasa.

I really enjoyed this... it was very filling, flavorful and nutritious!  I thought I had cannelini beans, but I only had northern beans, so I used them instead.  I also just used some leftover spinach, which wasn't quite as much as the recipe called for, and it definitely needed the full amount. All in all, I would definitely make again.

This was excellent! My husband and I had company over for dinner tonight and we served this dish. Everyone loved it! I did make a few minor alterations, just to accommodate what we had and fit our tastes. I omitted the beans (we had beans last night) and added two cloves of freshly chopped garlic and 2 tbs pine nuts and sauteed them in about 2 tbs olive oil before adding the tomatoes and spinach. Then I added a small can of sliced black olives. Yum! We will DEFINITELY be having this again soon!

I used regular diced tomatoes and frozen spinach that I cooked in the microwave before adding. I also added italian seasoning and garlic salt. It was a little bland. I think next time that I will add more garlic and maybe mix the feta in with the dish.

Made this for my mom when she was in town and she loved it!  Feels good to impress the momma.  I too sauteed extra garlic into the sauce and used whole wheat pasta, just for a little more pop.  Love the recipe though, it's seriously becoming a staple in my house.

Loved it!!! Gave it a 4 because I made some changes based on some of the other reviews. I added garlic and sauteed onion. I also added some olives. Artichoke would taste excellent with this also, maybe I will try that next time!

This will become a lunchtime favorite of mine!  My family did not care for it but I found it light and flavorful.  Not to worry about my family not liking it .... it appeared to be "healthy" for them.

This recipe ended up being a bit watery so I added some Parmesan and flour to thicken it.  Also served with goat cheese instead of feta.  Without the goat cheese it is a bit bland, but still very good.

Here is exactly what I did:
This goes well with homemade garlic bread and/or salad.  Reheats easily.
Serves 4

2 cans Italian style diced organic tomatoes
1 can cannelini beans drained and rinsed
9 oz. fresh baby spinach
~8 oz. penne pasta (ziti will do fine as well)
1/2 cup goat cheese (feta will do fine as well)
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
3 T flour 

1) Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water for 8-10 minutes, or until al dente.
2) While the pasta cooks, combine tomatoes and beans in a large non-stick skillet. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat. Simmer for 10 minutes.
3) Sprinkle parmesan and flour into the mix until it thickens. Add more parmesan if necessary.
4) Add spinach a handful at a time. Cook spinach in the sauce for about 4 minutes, until it wilts. Stir constantly.
5) Serve sauce over pasta, sprinkle with goat cheese.  Some people like a lot of goat cheese.  Some like no cheese at all.  Either way tastes good.

Good base recipe- like others I tweaked it a little. I added a 6 oz jar of marinated artichokes, substituted Pecorino Romano cheese for feta and used fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned. I also added 3 cloves of garlic to the recipe. All told it came out very well. The combination of artichoke hearts and romano cheese is amazing. As a side note, if you use fresh tomatoes they should be added in the last 5 minutes of cooking or they will lose their texture.

This was easy and tasty. The feta really makes this dish. The recipe didn't call for straining the tomatoes so I didn't, but I recommend it. The sauce came out a little watery. Also, it seemed like there was a lot of sauce for the amount of pasta called for, so I would recommend either doubling the pasta or halfing the sauce.

Simple, light and tasty. I added artichokes and black olives too. This was super simple to make and only takes as long as the pasta to boil. Thanks.

This was good, but it seemed to be lacking in something, and I have yet to figure out what.  I tried drizzling a tiny bit of olive oil on the pasta before adding the sauce and this helped, but wasn't quite enough.  Liked overall, but need to add a bit of something....

I really liked this recipe.  Unfortunately, I forgot to drain the cannelli beans, which caused the sauce to be a bit watery.  However, it did provide enough liquid to make a sort of tomato soup.  I also added 1 tbsp. onto the top of the cooked spinach and cannelli beans.  Delicious!  I found the "Baked Salmon II" was an excellent accompaniment with this dish.

This recipe has a good basic concept, but needs a lot of help. First, saute one small onion and green bell pepper in a few tablespoons of olive oil along with some garlic. Beans totally don't go in this dish. Instead use veggie protein (aka veggie crumbles, veggie patties or veggie sausage) like Morning Star. You get that meat flavor you're looking for. Season the veggie meat like you would anyway with spices like salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, basil and parsley. Allow the veggie meat to get a little crispy then add your own or a prepared pasta sauce (the canned tomatoes yield a watery sauce by themselves). Let it simmer a few minutes, then added a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach. Ten ounces is way too much...you'll be okay with 6 oz. Add the penne and stir. I don't like feta, so I grated some fresh parmesan cheese on the top and it was perfect. You can't tell meat isn't in this.

My goodness this was tasty! Very simple to prepare, very easy clean up and very easy on the wallet too. I was a little skeptical of using all that spinach (I bought one of the 9 oz HEB To Go! bags) but since it was cooked down, the spinach wasn't overwhelming at all. Just for personal preference, next time I make this, I may try and see what happening when I scale back the spinach some. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good basic recipe that needs to be spiced up a bit.  Added red pepper flakes, garlic and onion, along with some sundried tomato chicken sausage that I sliced up.  With those additions, it was excellent.

I did a variation on this recipe using couscous because I have so much of it and don't know what to do with it.  I first sauteed onion and garlic with red chili flakes then added 1 can of crushed tomatoes (all i had on hand).  I replaced the beans with soybeans for extra protein and addend them with the sauce. I also added a small can of sliced olives.  I let that simmer for about 6 min then added the couscous and turned off the stove and covered it to let it steam cook.  After five minutes i added the spinach, feta, and some basil and oregano.  It was delicious!  Also good as a cold salad or for a potluck!

This was really good! I followed some reviewers' suggestions and sauteed some onion and garlic with it to add extra flavor. I also used a whole 1lb box of pasta. When I served it, I threw a few capers on top for just a touch more pizazz. I will definitely make this again! It's SOOO easy. Thanks for the recipe!

To be honest, this didn't sound that great to me, so I allllllmost missed it. However, I am so glad I decided to give it a try because it was fabulous and so easy to make. I sauteed some garlic and onion to include in the sauce. I didn't add the beans because they didn't seem to "go" with this recipe.  I added sliced black olives when everything was done cooking, and it was delicious just like that.

LOVED THIS!  It is such a nice change from the usual sauce drenched pasta.  It also has great eye appeal, with the red tomatoes, green spinach, and white beans, pasta and cheese. I used 1 lb. of mini penne pasta, and the 4 of us devoured it!  It might be a bit bland for some folks, but we loved it as is.  The Italian tomatoes I bought had garlic in them so that made it more flavorful.  This is a nice light, yet filling dish.  My family gave it thumbs up, so I will be making this again for sure!

This turned out very good and was simple to make. I used chickpeas instead of white beans. They seemed more "Greek" to me.

I looked at the other reviews and made changes to this recipe and it was good!! I added onions and garlic.  I didn't have seasoned tomatoes so I just added spices.  I also added a chicken breast (just one for 4 servings).   I used whole wheat pasta.  Both my DH and I enjoyed it.

Wonderful combination of flavors.  I could eat this every day!  Try the whole wheat/multigrain pasta with this.

A good basic pasta recipe-very healthy and superfast for an easy weeknight meal.  I added garlic and some italian seasoning and I used frozen spinach but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make it again-loved how quick it came together!

A good base recipe, but a few things need to be added depending on your tastes.  I added basil, oregano, garlic and onion.  I also added chicken to make the meal heartier.

No garlic? What is pasta without garlic? I think this is a great idea as a "base" recipe, but much could be added to this to spice it up. Sounds boring as is.

This was great! I wasn't sure about the Feta mixing with the other flavors, but it was awesome. I think I would add fresh herbs next time, just to make it taste even fresher, but it was pretty tasty!

Extremely pleased with this recipe.  It is inexpensive, easy and very healthy!  Perfect for a single mom of three.  The kids loved it as well.  I used dried beans adding approx 1 1/2 cups seemed to be the right amount for family taste.  Will write this one out and keep it in my real recipe box!

Wasn't sure about the pasta/beans combination, but it worked.  I did add bacon to the recipe, thinking it would be a little to bland without.

One of my favorite recipes...it is very filling! Used the advice of adding basil, oregano, and sauted garlic to perk it up. Mixing the Feta cheese in it was great.

Very easy but nothing extraordinary. Instead of two cans of tomatoes (seemed too tomatoey) I added a few mushrooms and per the advice of another reviewer added the feta in with the beans. It was ok - made it creamy - but next time I'll put the feta on top. Only my husband and I ate it and he picked out the mushrooms and complained about the spinach - but ate it anyway. Kids wouldn't touch it! My 3 year old said he didn't like the "salad" (spinach)!

This has been in heavy rotation at my house for a while now.  I have tried it with and without the sauteed garlic and love it both ways.  I always add a little can of sliced black olives for a little tang.  It's good cold, too and makes a nice brown bag lunch.

Great recipe! I omitted the feta chesse and served the dish with parmesan chesse and red pepper flakes on the side. This should reduce the fat and cholestrol a bit. I thought it was delicious. Thanks

This is a good recipe. I followed some suggestions by other, regarding flavor: Sautee garlic in skillet before adding tomatoes and beans. I added Herbs Provence to the sauce before simmering. I also added the feta to the sauce when I added the spinach. For added health, I used red lentil Penne. No need to add salt or pepper.

This is a simple, easy yet very tasty pasta recipe. I have made it several times with minor variations like using arugula instead of spinach and combining fresh with canned tomatoes and each time we have enjoyed it. I can't find 'Italian style' tomatoes and we are living in Italy! So I just add some typical Italian spices.

It was easy, but not very flavorful! I put a tablespoon of olive oil with the can of beans, then added about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, salt, pepper and one teaspoon of Italian seasoning. This instantly gives it so much more flavor!

The recipe as written is a bit bland as-is but super easy to make, so I'll give it 4 stars because I like it but it needs more to it. However, it is a regular in my house because I found that if I sprinkle my spice mix which is Whole Foods Pizza Seasoning  (weird sounding, I know) on it it's amazingly good! Seasoning consists of a  mix of bell peppers, fennel, oregano, garlic, basil, chili peppers, parsley, thyme, marjoram, and celery. I really think it's the fennel in it that makes it pop. If you make this, feel free to experiment with some spices because that's what is going to take it for it to be over the top! Other than that, I don't change anything in it. Tasty dish with one more ingredient for me, not too bad!

BORING!!!   Where's the spices man?  I even added 1 T of Cavender's Greek Seasoning and it didn't help.

It did need the tweaks. Extra things I did was fry up some garlic and a half an onion to add to the sauce, doubled the pasta, added extra basil and oregano, and added romano cheese because I only had 4 oz feta. I might have over did the beans (two 14 oz cans). Next time I'll add more onion, and maybe try the stewed tomatoes instead with extra seasoning. Easy to make though!

I sautéed an onion,  some chopped garlic and 1 t. of oregano first in a little olive oil before adding the tomatoes which I crushed with a potato masher .  I liked the idea from one person who put the pasta back in the pot, added the spinach and then the hot sauce.  It was perfect and the spinach softened but did not go slimy.

I was disappointed, in that the dish was somewhat bland. On the other hand, it was an excuse for retsina, which is a good thing. I stirred some dried basil & oregano, as well as some sliced olives into the left-overs, to see if that will kick it up a notch. Clearly this is a good base for an easy, healthy meal. I just have to play with it a bit to fit it to my tastes.

This is definitely a keeper recipe in our house. We made it the first time according to recipe directions. A few days later we tried it with added diced red onions. salt and pepper and a tsp of Epicure Jalapeno and Cheese seasoning added. We liked the second edition best.

Very nice. I live in Greece, and used "giant" white beans, fresh basil, and added a fair bit of freshly ground pepper.  Simple, yummy, great with a simple salad.

I agree that it is a mild tasting sauce, this was after adding chopped onion and garlic, needs some more spice but good base sauce to add whatever you like.

I have been making this dish for years.  Can't believe it's only at 4 stars currently.  It is a great simple dish that you can dress up or down.  I would always use all the things listed except the pasta if you are low carb.  But you can add anything you want to it.  The base is a great starter.  I like to brown/blacken sausage with it, add a little lemon and greek herbs.

Great simple recipe and easy dinner. The only thing I changed was instead of spinach (my husband I don't like it) I used chicken breast. I'm picky and loved this. Husband said maybe use different beans and add some garlic. Other than that I  will be making this again.

Very good.  I only used one can of tomatoes and two cans of beans and added sliced spicy chicken sausage and basil. Had this over a small amount of pasta... Trying not to eat much processes starch.... It's a keeper.. Thanks,

I made this for my daughter because she loves feta cheese. I think the cheese is what makes it. I used whole wheat pasta and I added a minced clove of garlic and a little Italian seasoning. I don't really care for feta cheese so I tried it with Parmesan instead and it was a little bland. I tried some of my daughter's with the feta and it was very flavorful IF you like feta :) It may be the easiest and quickest dinner I've ever made that didn't come out of a box!! My daughter loved it and it tastes great reheated the next day also.

I like this recipe because it's simple and versatile. I had to tweak a few things because, I couldn't find the Italian style tomatoes and I used half kale/half spinach (because the kale was about to go). The *major* change I made was making it all using one pot. LOL Made the sauce while pasta was straining. :) Great recipe.

My WHOLE family loved it - and that's saying something! My mother is a chef who makes everything from scratch, and she was impressed. I added parmesan cheese instead of feta, as well as seasoned with salt, pepper and thyme. I served with basic chicken cutlets, and even the kids enjoyed it!

Sweetie, this was delicious. My whole family loved it. About 4 weeks ago I became vegetarian and I have been looking for yummy protein packed recipes. Some people did some whole seperate thing with FRESH garlic and olive oil . Uh-uh, honey, no. I grabbed my jar of chopped garlic from the fridge and dumped a teaspoon full in while cooking. I added a few other things too. Oregano, Italian seasoning, even a little garlic salt, pepper, hint of paprika for no apparent reason, dried basil, fresh basil, and a dab of olive oil. Honestly, you couldn't taste the paprika but everything else blended beautifully together. I cooked the sauce (minus the spinach) the night before and threw it in a Tupperware. By the next day, all the flavors had melded together in the most delicious smelling way. I just heated it up again, added the spinach, served it over pasta, and voila! FOOD!

I made some changes based on what I had or what I could find. Used Navy beans instead of cannellini beans because my husband couldn't find them at the store. Used regular diced tomatoes adding about 2 tablespoons of greek seasoning to the tomato mixture. Everyone ate it and only the kids complained. All in all a keeper.

Loved this one! We added chicken, black olives, and some green onions and it turned out delicious! (We added our fresh chopped spinach between the sauce and the pasta as well. Perfect!)

Great idea!! And a great way to serve pasta a little bit healthier. The beans add a nice creaminess. Just a few tweaks - I added a heap of garlic to start with and sauteed in olive oil, and added some red pepper flakes. Fiance loved it, plus it's so easy on my food budget. Thanks for a great recipe, Joelene!

This dish was delicious and easy to make. However, in the future, I will use about half the amount of Spinach and add a bit more pasta. The pasta also kept surprisingly well for a few days in my refrigerator. I will be making it again!

My kids and I had it this for lunch and we all thought it was great. A couple of them thought it was missing something but not sure what. I left the sauce in the beans by accident and we all thought that made the sauce creamier. Overall really good!!!:)

So fast, easy and tasty.  After reading reviews I did as others and sauted some minced onion and garlic with some crushed red pepper, and then added the tomatoes and beans.  I also put in a tsp each of rosemary and oregano.  I also tossed in some chunks of leftover roasted chicken.  Very nice dish.

I've cooked this probably 6-7 times in the last few months because it is so tasty (my "meat & potato" grandparents even like this.) This dish is fantastic & you can really customize it depending on what you have available. I like feta cheese however plain crumbled goat cheese really makes this pasta dish pop!

I sauteed some onion and garlic in olive oil and added 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano and a dash of crushed red pepper.  I also mixed the feta in with the pasta.  Tasty and unusual.  Would normally rate it a 4, taste-wise, but it was so easy to make I bumped the rating up.

Based on the reviews, and ingredients I had on hand a made a couple of simple changes, and the dish was fantastic!  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in a little olive oil, and used crushed tomatoes (not italian style, but added some italian seasoning).  I am not a big meat eater, though you could easily add chicken.  I made this a couple of days ago, and just writing this review is making me crave this dish-LOVE IT!

This recipe is a bit salty. I added garlic and onion in evoo. Next time, I'll dice and suate' fresh tomatoes in herbs with the garlic and onion. I think a handful of chopped carrots would add sweetness and cut the saltiness.

Delicious. Even better next day. Sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil, and added Tbsp. of Tasetefully Simple Dried Tomato and Garlic Pesto Mix. Cooked as directed and added frozen meatballs to the simmering pan. Tossed pasta in and topped with feta. Great one pot dish.

This was just okay.  I did like the combination of ingredients here. But it was just too salty for my taste.  And I'm a person known to be very heavy with the salt shaker!  But it only makes sense - canned veggies and beans are loaded with salt, as is feta cheese.  

I did not make any of the tweaks suggested by other users.  This recipe is quick and easy to prepare as written.  But I think it probably benefits a lot from some of these tweaks, even if they make the dish take a little longer.  Though even something as simple as using no-salt-added canned tomatoes could help.

On second thought, it didn't freeze & reheat right and turned out a bit soggy so my husband and I had to practically force ourselves to eat the rest of it. But freshly made, my husband loved it, and I thought it was okay just not my taste.

Pretty good. I added some basil, oregano, salt & pep, pepper flakes and garlic powder in. I think I will add in some garlic and onions the next time I make this. This works well as a cold lunch too (imo).

This was pretty good;  I made the following additions:  added fresh garlic, fresh oregano, juice of one lemon & sliced kalamata olives.  Was very easy, quite healthy (with whole wheat pasta) and relatively tasty.

I was worried this wouldn't have much flavor, but it's actually quite good.  I will definately be making it again, but with a little experimentation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a 5 star recipe without a doubt.  It was inexpensive, healthy, fast & delicious!  I substituted about 1 lb. fresh romas with 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil. I also used garlic & herb feta.  This was so good, I ate the left overs for lunch today.  I was concerned about not adding any salt, but with the feta, it balanced really well.

I used 1 pound of high protein pasta. I used a bag of fresh spinach that I wilted by pouring the hot pasta water over the spinach. I used fresh tomatoes in place of canned. In addition I poured basil balsamic good seasons salad dressing over the mixture. Awesome!

The recipe directions don't say to drain the Italian style tomatoes; therefore it ended up heavy in the tomato sauce but still good. If you want to make it more like the photos drain the tomatoes.

This was just ok. I would have preferred not to use the italian-style tomatoes and make my own concoction of onion, garlic & spices.  I do love feta but didn't think it worked well with the hot pasta.  I may try this again & use fresh parmesan.  It was very quick though & good for you!

This was very yummy!  Like others, I sauteed garlic in olive oil first before adding the tomatoes and beans.  I also added fresh basil and oregano.  I chose to sprinkle the feta on top as directed, and this gave it a good amount of tang whenever I took a bite with the just melted cheese - yum!  My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit watery, but it was nice to have a lighter sauce.  We served it with crusty bread.

This recipe was yummy, but I thought it made more than four servings.  The best thing about it was how easy it was.  The feta on top is delicious.

This is my second time making this recipe. The first time I made it I liked it but it didn't wow me. This time I sauteed a clove of garlic and 1/2 a yellow onion in evoo. Then I added in fresh button mushrooms. I cut the amount of beans called for in half to cut calories and decreased the amount of feta by half as well. I topped it with chicken and it was wonderful. It wowed our guests and I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This was really good.  I didn't really follow the recipe, but I really appreciated the idea.  I sauteed onions and 3 cloves minced garlic in some balsalmic vinegar.  I added half can of diced tomatoes and let simmer for a bit.  I thawed some spinach in the microwave and drained.  I added half can of navy beans to the tomato sauce and then the spinach.  I served over brown rice pasta and sprinkled feta on top.  Excellent easy satisfying vegetarian meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is really good. I did it with bow tie pasta because that is what I had, and added a little bit of garlic. Had French bread on the side smeared with pesto sauce. Great meal!

4 stars as written, 5 with the help of reviewers' comments.  Adding some chopped onion and minced garlic to the sauce is essential.  It is great hot or cold.  The one other modification I would make is to use a pasta besides penne, which I think is better suited to a creamy sauce.

Good easy recipe!  I like that it's made with canned tomatoes instead of fresh because it's often hard to find good fresh tomatoes.

This was nice.  Very pretty with all the different colors.  Like others, I sautéd some onion and garlic first, added some basil and oregano, and artichoke hearts and black olives at the end.

For our family it was just lacking a little "pizzaz".  But I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this, as our tastes are just maybe more accustomed to more intense flavors and spices.  I will make this again, and am going to try adding some lemon juice next time as I think that will help give it the zip we are looking for.

I have to say that I was really surprised by how good this was.  I made a few changes.  I used whole grain penne rigata, garbanzo beans instead of the white beans, and only 6 oz. of spinach.  It was absolutely perfect.

I substituted a six-cheese Italian blend for the feta cheese.  It was good, quick and healthy.  I'm sure we will make it again.  However, there wasn't a lot of flavor so I can't give it five stars.

This was a Great recipe! I don't usually cook so the fact that this got rave reviews is saying something.  Like others, I sautéed some garlic & onions in a little olive oil first.  I also used plain diced tomatoes and added fresh basil and some dried Italian spices to them.  Based on others' remarks, I also added sun-dried tomato turkey sausage and a bit of chopped calamata olives to the other ingredients. I only used half of the pkg of spinach (it seemed like too much) but it does wilt down so next time I’ll use the whole thing. The end result was absolutely flavorful and it will definitely be made again!

What a fabulous meal! I added some seasoning here and there but over all the dish is filling yet light and fresh tasting.Husband was skeptical since it did not have meat in it but he really enjoyed it.

Awesome recipe!  My wife went vegetarian a few months back.  She wanted nothing more than for me to prepare a candlelight dinner for Valentines Day.  I knew about this website and did a search for vegetarian main dishes.  This recipe caught my eye because it was quick and easy.  I used pinto and black beans and frozen spinach in my recipe.  My wife thought the dish was awesome and she was very surprised and impressed.  Thank you!

Loved it!!!! My family didn't like it too well, due to the fact that there was veggies in it....but I loved it!!!!  I added two cans of beans, which made the sauce a bit thicker.

This was an excellent recipe! It was easy and quick. I did make a few additions such as onion, mushrooms, basil and black olives after reading other reviews which added a depth to the dish. I made it a little bit healthier with whole wheat pasta and fat free feta...AWESOME Vegetarian dish that even meat eaters will love!

I really enjoyed this. I added some garlic salt, sugar, basil and parsley to my tomatoes because they were not flavored and tasted a bit too sour. I also used goat cheese instead of feta because I live in France, and feta is a little harder to find. It was fantastic though. Next time I may try to make it with fresh diced tomatoes. Great!

This really didn't thrill me at all.  It didn't seem like the spinach went with it very well and I just thought it tasted fairly bland.

This is a great recipe; it's simple, quick and delicious.  I like that fact that it easy to tweak it a little to add different ingredients such as olives and sun dried tomates and still have a great meal.

This is a refreshing pasta that is super quick and easy to make. I used plain tomatoes and added my own seasoning (garlic, onion, Italian). Other than that I followed the recipe. I'll be making this again.

This is a good recipe.  I added garlic, and black olives. I left out the beans as I wanted it very light for a luncheon. The bag of spinach I added was 6 oz. which was plenty. Came out great.  Served it on whole wheat pasta.

This was a very good recipe with a nice combination of flavors.  My only disappointment was the sauce...it was a bit runny; not as saucy and thick as I'd like.  Perhaps I should have drained the canned tomatoes first.  I will try again and if it's still runny next time, I'll add tomato paste because DH and I really enjoyed the flavors.

Quite good. Very easy. I used whole wheat pasta, small white beans and a little bit less feta cheese. I also added a dash of some spicy seasoning blend. Nice vegetarian meal. Thanks.

I loved this dish. I sauteed 3 cloves of fresh garlic in some olive oil, and added a few fresh mushrooms.  Very easy and so very good.

I really liked this recipe. I made a half recipe, and it made three healthy servings.  This is an extremely easy meal to make!
