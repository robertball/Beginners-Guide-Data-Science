So good, so simple, so colorful and pretty.   As I always do, I cooked the egg separately like a crepe,  then rolled it up like a cigar and sliced it into ribbons, chiffonade style.  I cooked  the rice and  carrots ahead of  time as well, the carrots nuked in a bit of water.  After cooking the rice I spread  it out on a cookie sheet and refrigerated it until it was good and cold (the best way of doing fried rice).  Once I was ready to put this together for supper, it was an absolute snap.  For really authentic and delicious flavor, I added a wee drizzle of toasted sesame oil.  Topped with saut√©ed shrimp and scallops, with some steamed asparagus on the side, this was a dinner I'll probably dream about  - or at least think about the next time I get hungry!

Very tasty and easy!  I recommend making your rice ahead of time and chilling or using leftover rice.  Start with cold rice (make sure it's broken apart -- don't throw any stuck-together hunks into the pan).   I increased the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon, used peanut oil instead of canola oil (personal preference when cooking Chinese dishes), added a little fresh grated ginger with the garlic, and added a tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds at the end before serving.  I omitted the frozen peas (don't really like them) and used shelled edamame instead.  Yummy dish that can easily be adapted to use what you have on hand.  I will be making again and again and will add meat and seafood to make it a quick and easy main dish.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This is a good recipe with the right proportions, but I think the instruction to scramble the eggs first is unnecessary. I made a well in the rice, added a small squirt of oil, poured the beaten egg into the well and scrambled it with my hoak. Then I added the soy sauce, salt & pepper, and tossed it all together. I only used 1 egg, but it was a Large one. 2 Medium eggs would be about right for 4 cups of rice. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but as written, it loses a star for the extra, unneeded step of scrambling the egg and removing it from the pan. I think scrambling it last keeps it tender, where letting it rest for 5 minutes may make it a little chewy. Otherwise, excellent recipe for straight up fried rice.

Excellent! However I must be lazier than some, I simply use frozen mixed vegetables, microwave them, and throw them in the mix with what ever leftover meat that I have.   I also am one to cook the egg, separately then add later. I like to keep the egg yellow as opposed to mixing the egg and soy sauce together which doesn't affect the taste just the color.

This is a simple and quick recipe. It is darn good. I added shrimp cuz I had some in the freezer, and I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots, which worked just fine. I spent more time looking for the recipe I used last time than it took to make this. I am underlining this recipe!

Very good.  I used fresh sugar snap peas, sliced diagonally instead of frozen peas just because I had them in the fridge and I love them.  Added a pinch of red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil.  Used basmati rice.  Will definitely make this again.

I didn't add the carrots or peas and I used the sesame oil.  It had an excellent flavour and I will definitely make it again.

Good basic recipe.  I doubled the soy sauce, and added 2 tsp. of sesame oil right before frying the rice. I also substituted for brown rice and sunflower oil.
