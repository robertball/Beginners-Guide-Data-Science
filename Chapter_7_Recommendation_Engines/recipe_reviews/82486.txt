My husband called this one of my best recipes yet! I made a few changes: Substituted 1/4 cup Italian dressing for the wine; substituted 2 tbsp tomato paste and 1/4 cup water for the ketchup; skipped the tarragon and vinegar. I served it over spaghetti, and it is definitely a family favorite!

This was really good. I did double the recipe for 4 people. They were really hungry! Will make this one again.
Tried this again w/o the shrimp and still a great recipe

Just passable for us.  Left out the vinegar and used a nice Tuscan seasoning blend for the rosemary and tarragon. The whole tomato/onion/mushroom/herbs thing was just too much going on for the mild and delicate shrimp and scallops, and they kind of got "lost in the show." Also, didn't care for the small, cooked shrimp. Would have liked to have seen larger, chunkier pieces. Served this with Sarah's Rice Pilaf but it was just a ho-hum meal.

Great recipe! I think next time i will have to add more colour (asparagus perhaps) and a little bit more spice. Other than that, this is a wonderfull tasty recipe!

Very good, I changed it up a bit and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and added italian seasoning mix. I served it with grilled zuchini and squash.

A great recipe - bookmarking for serving to guests. We didn't have access to sea scallops and had to use a smaller frozen variety, but it turned out fantastic anyway. (We did use larger shrimp to compensate).

Absolutely delecious! I used a higher end white blend wine that included Gewurztraminer. The sweetness of the Gewurz added a whole new level of flavor. I also used fresh basil instead of tarrogon (didn't have it!) and fresh rosemary.

This recipe essentially turns out to be a fancy Spaghetti/pasta sauce. Though I perfectly cooked the scallops, and they were tasty; overall it was just a bland tomato concoction.   It seems like a bunch of fantastic things together, but there's nothing to make this recipe really memorable. Maybe next time I'll try adding in yellow peppers, or spinach.

This was very good - but as everyone stated, only served 4 people.  I only made 3 small changes: Subbed tomato sauce for ketchup, omitted the tarragon/rosemary(don't like them), and I also evened out the scallop to shrimp ratio (.5lb each) because that was what I had. I made a bigger change in using uncooked frozen shrimp, which I browned after browning the scallops (instead of adding them later). Next time I will only brown for a few minutes each side and not cook through, as they both got a little dried out. But overall - delicious! I will make this again!!

This was excellent.  The only change I made was to use Herbes de Provence instead of tarragon and rosemary.  I served it over rice and it tasted quite gourmet.  A great way to cook scallops.

Wonderful flavor. This was a quick and easy dish to put together.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I did not add the vinegar with the shrimp.

Yum, yum, YUM!!!

Forgot the ketchup, didn't have the wine, but did have some fresh basil, so threw that in.  Absolutely fantastic!  Had it with a nice salad...I would say this feeds more of 3 people (4 if you're stretching it or have a lot of good sides!).

This was totally yummy!!!! Used olive oil instead of butter and tomatoe paste instead of ketchup. I added a full pound of larger shrimp and topped with parm. Yum... can't wait to make again. Oh, and leftovers were great over pasta.

This is excellent! I've made it several times now without any real changes to the recipe. I use larger shrimp because I usually have a bag of it frozen in the freezer. My kids even love it. It's also great as a leftover the next day.

Was quite a bit juicier than I'd anticipated, so I would have served it with a rice dish, but otherwise this was a hit with the entire family and tasted amazing!  I did use the smaller bay scallops, thawed and drained, instead and I used ghee (clarified butter) because of food allergies.  We had this as a side dish with steaks and fresh corn on the cob...was absolutely excellent!  Update:  makes even better leftovers with rice!

Not so sure about this one. Kind of vinegary and bland. I don't think I will make it again.

This didn't have a lot of flavor, but I still liked it because I like seafood, so I'll make it again.  I ate it over angel hair pasta.

It’s on the regular rotation. We used fire roasted stewed tomatoes instead of fresh and it add a great flavor and saves time. We also use tomato paste instead of ketchup because that just sounds gross.

I'm on weight watchers so used olive oil instead of butter.  Basically halved the recipe.  Used Pinot Grigio for the wine and just put in a couple of good sloshes.  I don't measure just estimate.  Used bay scallops since cheaper.  Absolutely super!  Will definitely make again.

This was good with the addition of zucchini slices and served over rice.  Otherwise, there is little substance.  Recommendation to double the wine & ketchup/tomato mixture because otherwise little is left after heating.  Not sure if the last 10 minutes in the oven was necessary. Can't you just warm everything in the already used skillet?

Excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as far as step 4 - I added the scallops to the pan, let it come to a bubble. By then everything is cooked - I couldn't see the point of a further 10 minutes in the oven. Served it with toasted buttered, homemade rolls to soak up the juices. It certainly turned out darker than the photo.  One commenter said it was too vinegary - 2 teaspoons?! I wonder if they used more than was called for, anyway, we found it a great balance of flavor and texture. I'll make it again, though with larger shrimp, and perhaps serve it over pasta or rice.

This is fantastic.  I did leave out the wine and it was perfect!  I made it with just scallops but it would be good with a combination of seafood or just one seafood of any type!!!

I omitted the shrimp.  At the end of the baking, I poured a small amount of cream and stirred it in.  GOOD!

This was absolutely delicious, even better than I thought it would be and I didn't even use all the spices!!!
