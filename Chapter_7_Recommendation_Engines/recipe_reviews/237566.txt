I made this with gravy instead of the mushroom sauce. The pastry was perfect! I even used the pastry recipe for sugar n cinnamon pastries for my niece n nephew. They loved it!

Came out fine, i made my pastry dough with Bisquick as a time saver. This dish would be far better with a simple homemade, Southern style country gravy and would do this dish more justice than canned soup gravy, my opinion of course. Good dish for something different.

This was kinda bland. Next time I will definitely add seasoning, the garlic. salt & pepper were not enough. Also, rather than mushroom soup, I think this would be better with country gravy or beef gravy with mushrooms

This was strange to me, but I thought I would give it a shot. I used a sheet of canned crescent roll and layered it with Munster cheese. I didn't let the meat mixture cool enough, so it melted the cheese and split the dough. I rolled it over and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, which helped. I had a hard time rolling it tight enough, so it kinda fell apart. I might try this again...maybe.

My mistake was not working the dough more and activating the glutton.  The dough had a tendency to tear when rolling, but it was easy to repair by  pinching it back together.  It was a little fancier version of beef & biscuit.
