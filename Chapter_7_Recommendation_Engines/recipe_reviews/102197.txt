So I have been making this for awhile now and after this thanksgiving had to give it a review. I was trying to use fresh green beans, and although the cream of mushroom came out fabulously well, the green beans never cooked all the way and it was watery. So this time I sweated some onions and garlic in a good amount of butter, then I added the green beans and sauteed until good and done. Think canned french cut as an example. This removed a lot of the liquid. I used tongs to move the green beans from my pan to the casserole dish so that there was no excess liquid. But don't throw it away! I used it in the cream of mushroom which I made with heavy cream instead, and used a corn starch/water mixture to thicken. It came out PERFECT! And was sooo good and got plenty of compliments. :)

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and thought it was very good. My only complaint was that the sauce was too sparse so I ended up incorporating some cream of mushroom soup at the last minute to make it saucier. Other than that, all enjoyed it.

Very tasty.  The bold flavor of the bacon added a kick to typically bland taste of the traditional version of green bean casserole.  Of course I covered the top with Frenches brand onion crisps as well in the last few minutes of baking (gotta hoave it!).

This recipe is great for people that have allergies to wheat. Instead of thickening the "soup" mixture I made the casserole the night before and put it in the fridge. When I baked it the next day I used a lower temp. and baked it longer. This seemed to solve the problem with it being runny.This was a huge hit and I am now asked to bring it to all pot-lucks!

This was the biggest hit at my table this year. Everyone loved it! I used heavy cream and added some grated parmesan to the sauce as it simmered. It thickened perfectly. I used about half of the bacon. Added the obligitory fried onions. Soooo good.

Two of my three sisters hate the regular green bean casserole so I decided to try this for Thanksgiving. I added 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce and a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. Was delicious and everyone enjoyed it.

Try mixing potato flakes into the mixture to thicken.  Added a can of Cream of Mushroom but it didn't do the trick.  Was way to "soupy"...

I made this dish for Thanksgiving also.  Loved the flavor of the fresh mushrooms.  I also added the French fried onion rings.  I had to add a little flour to get the sauce to thicken, and it was still a little runnier than I would have preferred.  Otherwise, it tasted very good, and everyone seemed to like it.

This recipe is wonderful with a few adjustment. I made a huge batch for 40 people and everyone loved it. It is however very thin as mentioned, I added a couple cans of cream of mushroom soup and some corn starch mixed with cold water to made it thicker. It turned out to be a huge hit.

This was fantastic! Made it for a post-Thanksgiving dinner with friends and it was a huge hit. 4 different types of green bean casserole and this one was the only one called out for how good it was specifically. Very proud :) I made some tiny variations but nothing that changed the integrity of the recipe. Subbed Turkey Bacon for the regular, fresh green beans for frozen, skim milk in a roux for the half-and-half, and used sliced baby portobellos. I forgot the parmesan cheese but didn't notice it. This was fantastic!

The flavor of this dish was great. The only problem is the sauce needs to be a little thicker. I sauteed chopped onions with the mushrooms. Next time once the mushrooms and onions are cooked I will mix in a little flour to try to thicken once I add the half and half. I used fresh beans. I steamed them in my pampered chef steamer to soften first which I will do again next time. The dish was beautiful without, but I put the french fried onions on for my hubby:) This was a practice run for thanksgiving. I'm confident it will be a hit.

I did not care for this recipe. I'm a cook, so I am picky, but my whole family wanted the mushroom soup green bean casserole so I had hoped this would be a good substitute.

This was gone in no time this evening. Everyone (adults, teens and kids) loved it and asked that we have it again for Thanksgiving in place of the traditional this year. I was sure I had half and half cream but when I reached in the fridge, all I could find was heavy cream so used that. I also used a very tiny amount of a cornstarch slurry to thicken a little more. Also, couldn't resist adding Durkee Onions on top. Delicious. Thanks for sharing!

For flavor I would give this five stars, however the casserole was very runny so I dropped it down to four stars. Maybe adding less half-and-half would help, or adding cornstarch to thicken it up. I will make it again but will need to play around with it so that it's not so runny next time. Flavor was great though!

Good Idea for GF and DF family.  Thicken the sauce with tapioca.  Better day after -- think next year will refrigerate the night before.  What's there not to like--bacon and mushrooms!

Anyone who says this isn't am amazing recipe is NUTS! Even my green-bean-casserole-hater-family-members LOVED this.  My 11yr old and I tried the sauce mixture alone and we almost cried it was so good.  I had GBCasserole duty to 2 thxgivings this and this is my BEST dish yet.  CHANGES: chopped onions instead of mushrooms, added a can of cream of mushroom to it, sauce seemed thin, added french fried onions on top.  FAB!  Muchas Gracias chocoholic1!

I'm so glad I came across this recipe as I have to plan for a non-dairy menu, and it was easy to substitute soy or rice products for the milk products, rather than have to make cream of mushroom soup from scratch! Thanks!!

I am very happy I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and will be making it again before the year is through.  Like the other reviewer had to add the french's onions (tradition), but I think this dish would actually be best just as the recipe stands.  Thanks for the keeper!

This was the best green bean casserole I've ever had.  I did make an adjustment or two based on feedback from other reviewers.  I used frozen cut green beans, thawed (2 10-oz bags), added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and 1/3 c. of the French's onions in the mix.  I left out the cheese altogether and topped with additional French's onions at the end.  I cooked a little longer than the recipe called for.
The fresh mushrooms and bacon made such a huge difference.  Green bean casserole has never been my favorite until now.

When I first put this together, I had my doubts. It turned out to be a hit on Christmas. I added just a half cup more of half-n-half, I used the traditional fried onions on top, and I cooked it in a crock pot. Excellent recipe

Green Beans must be thawed! I missed this note in the ingredient list and our casserole took a lot longer to cook, it was also more watery. It is much easier to serve if you use cut green beans rather than whole. 
We cooked chopped onion and garlic with the mushrooms instead of using the powdered version. Then we stirred in some cornstarch, before adding the milk, to thicken the sauce a bit. Used coconut milk in place of Half and Half, and left off the cheese to make it non-dairy. It turned out delicious! I would make this again!

Tried this out before I make it for thanksgiving and my husband and I really liked it. I did however add the french fried onions and I think I will add another 1/2 cup of the half and half and add a little more mushroom.  It never  hurts to add a bit more bacon either. I also think it would be better to make it the night before and and let it sit in the fridge overnight so the sauce will thicken.

This was a nice change from the regular green bean casserole and we all loved it. Like another reviewer mentioned, it did seem on the thin side, so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, used fat free half and half and some black pepper. I'll admit, I just couldn't tear myself away from the fried onions, so I did end up adding them to the mix. Excellent recipe chocoholic and thank you!!

I have been making this for four years it is a favorite in my family for thanksgiving.  The thought of the canned green bean casserole is sacrilegious in my house for thanksgiving thanks to this. nummy nummy

This recipe was a big hit at my family Christmas dinner.  I added some bacon to the recipe and it was so tasty.

This recipe was great! The bacon really added some needed flavor.  I made a double batch (fresh green beans make a real difference), so I ended up making more of the sauce by using twice the liquid - 1/2 half & half and 1/2 chicken stock. I also thickened it with cornstarch as others had suggested. Added french fried onions on top as a salute to the traditional style. Will make again..thanks for this recipe!

This is a great base recipe.  We can not eat mushrooms so I made celery soup (from this site). I only used 3 slices bacon and with the soup mixed it in the green beans. I did not add the cream as it was enough liquid in the bowl. I did put French onions on top. It was a great hit with everyone.

So the bacon was a definitely great addition, but something was definitely missing.  With just half and half added it was just that, hot half and half  that never thickened.  The parmeson cheese was on top so that didnt help.  Wont be making it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Like other reviewers I would agree that it needs more liquid. The taste was fine, but it didn't have that creamy texture that the standard soup can recipe has. It was a hit with some, but not all.

This was amazing! I did add some Worcestershire sauce to give it a little extra zing. Also put some extra French fried onions on the top! Yummy!
