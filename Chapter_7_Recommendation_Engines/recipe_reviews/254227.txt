When roasting check the squash blossoms after five minutes. Depending on the size of your blossoms they might not need a full 10 min in the oven.

These were great. I used rhubarb chard because that’s what  I was growing, plus by cutting off the stalks it shouldn’t make a difference. This might be great with spinach instead, which I will try next. The only change I made was to use feta cheese because that’s what I had available.  I put a little oil on the baking sheet incase they might stick, then drizzled a little oil over all. The whole process was not tedious at all as I was concerned it might become. They came out beautifully. No picture because we ate them too fast. Waiting on tomorrow’s blossoms to try this again.

The filling was flavorful. I used cream cheese and kale because that’s what I had on hand. I missed the crispness of fried blossoms, but these were delightful.
