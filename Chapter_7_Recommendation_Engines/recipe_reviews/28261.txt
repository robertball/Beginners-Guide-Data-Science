YUMMY!!  We cooked this on the grill and used Lawry's Perfect Blend Chicken Rub instead of Creole Seasoning, but it was REALLY good.  No leftovers.  Even my super picky son liked it.
Thanks Melissa!!

I used three boneless, skinless chicken breasts and reduced the serving size to three.  Instead of broiling it, I cooked the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  I served it with brown rice and fresh green beans.

Instead of peach perserves, I used caned peaches I had, and diced them. I also baked the chicken, and the recipe was still good

Pretty good.  I added garlic powder, a little salt and pepper.  Didn't use as much honey as called for and increased the mustard, and used Cajun seasoning instead of Creole.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I think next time I make this, it will be in the slow cooker as my chicken turned out a little tough.

I liked the balance of sweet and spice in this dish.  Added a little bit of cayenne pepper in the sauce to give it some extra heat.

Very tasty! I make this in a roasting bag to keep the chicken from drying out.

This was extremely easy to make and very flavourful. I decided to use boneless skinless chicken breasts, which I butterflied.  I served this w/ a vegetable blend and Couscous with Honeyed Almonds and Lemon (Allrecipes).  I think the peach preserves were a little too sweet, and I may use apricot preserves next time.

Absolutely delicious! Big hit with my picky hubby!  Didn't have Creole seasoning or preserves.  Used "Hot Shot" pepper blend & Lawry's Seasoned Salt and chopped/mashed canned peaches.  This will definitely be added to the rotation!  Thank you!!

After using up some very expensive ingredients - I just couldn't juse this sauce.  I think the Cajun seasoning should have been a teaspoon - not two tablespoons!  Sorry - I rarely give under 4 stars - but this one caused me to waste a lot of money!  Beware!

Super Yummy when broiled and brased. Made a little extra and heated it and poured over chicken after cooking!

This was okay. I had lots of overripe peaches I needed to use somehow, so I tried this. The chicken itself wasn't all that flavorful. I'd probably make this again, but alter the spices a bit to suite my family.

This was really good. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and a homemade cajun seasoning instead of creole, but I don't think that they are much different. I highly suggest peach preserves from the famous Loveless cafe in Tennessee. They are the best ever!

Made it the first time with guest watching!  They were impressed with the prep (but it was easy) and when they finished the meal they gave 5 stars!  I used skinless chicken breast. Side dishes were carrots and wild rice.

I love sweet and spicy foods so I couldn't wait to try this one. I used Siracha Hot Chili Sauce just cause of personal preference.  Not as sweet as I was looking for but I have a super sweet tooth.  For the most part it was good.

I really liked this dish, and will be making it again. It had very good flavoring, and it has become a dish I actually want to remember making without the recipe!

was so delicious i seared some sliced peaches in the spicy peach sauces and baked them with the chicken! i think next time i'll add honey or brown sugar to caramelize around the chicken. also try searing it and then baking it in the oven and letting it rest afterwards for at least 5 minutes. i noticed that it helps keep all the juices and and helps the chicken not come out so dry. i also flipped my chicken breast half way between cooking to get a good cook on both sides .

What a strange combination of ingredients, but SOOOO TASTY. I didn't use hot pepper or Creole seasoning, but the chicken turned out amazing! think next time ill use this and baste it for a few hours to let i soak in. I actually lost this recipe in the website for about 6 months till my fiance and i decided to take an hour or so and scan our browser history just to find it. If you haven't made it, then its a must try!

I was looking to make my own peach glazed chicken and mainly read this for cooking techniques. The broiler idea worked out well. I had the same idea for the sauce, though I used more preserves and honey, and added my house seasoning (garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and sea salt) added some cayenne pepper flakes to mine and used some soy sauce as well. Grilled some halved peaches on the grill for nice marks and served as a side to my chicken.
