I made this recipe because my boyfriend loves corn firtters and the night before I made homemade cream corn which i had some left over i wanted to use. So I used every thing it said then added my cream corn which included heavy cream and parmesan cheese. I think this made them ten times better. I also used strawberry preserve and cream cheese instead of the raspberry cuz its what I had and the boyfriend likes strawberry better. Having said that my whole family ate them up. Its a quick and very tasty treat. I really like the dip on the side never used a sweet dip with corn fritters before but I wont eat them any other way now.

Simple and delicious! I did sprinkle some salt on top after frying, but that was my personal preference. Also, I thought that amount of mayo would make too much sauce for us, so I used 3 tbsps. raspberry preserves and about 2/3 cup mayo (I just eyeballed it and mixed it together w/o heating it up)), and that was the perfect amount for us. These sort of reminded me of funnel cakes (but with corn, of course, lol) I could see maybe adding some sugar to the batter or just sprinkling them w/ some powdered sugar. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
