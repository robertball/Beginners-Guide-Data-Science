Seriously... So good!  I made this recipe as regular cookies and not in a skillet.  I made them for an office potluck because one of my co-workers eats gluten-free.  I was so worried they were going to turn out all nasty and healthy tasting, like diet food.  Definitely not the case here, I don't think I'll ever bake regular chocolate chip cookies again.  The carbs and fats in these are so much better for the body... And they really taste good!  So good!  I'll make these again and again.

We loved it.  I'm not sure how many servings the recipe is supposed to make but 5 of us ate less than half the pan, and we had large pieces.  I think it could easily serve 12.  I do think next time I make it I'll use a square pan so that I can cut the pieces smaller more easily.  It reminds me of a bar type cookie, very thick.

Like a stupid person,I forgot to put the chocolate chips in when I was mixing it.  So before I put it in the oven, I put the chocolate chips on top!! It still turned out great except that it was more like a giant cookie with chocolate poured on top!!

These turned out better than I expected.  They are a great Paleo treat! I used date sugar rather than coconut sugar as I don't care for the taste of coconut sugar. I also baked them as cookies. I'm going to play with temperature and time a bit. Lowering to 300° kept them from browning too much, but the interior texture was better at 350°.

These are really good, almost as good as the regular Toll House Chocolate Chip cookies you grew up with!  If you are GF but not dairy free, you will love these.  I baked it on a greased cookie tin in the oven as one of the other reviewers did for 15 to 20 minutes.

Amazing! I imagine this would also be considered gluten free!
