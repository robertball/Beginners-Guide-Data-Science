Very easy when baked in cupcake liners (sprayed) clean up is breeze.  I cut the recipe in half and got 6 egg muffins.  I would suggest adding a splash of milk to the eggs.  Also I wanted to make sure there was an equal amount of filling in each cup so I beat the eggs (with a little milk, salt and pepper) and divided it equally between the sprayed cupcake liners and then equally divided the bacon, tomatoes and green onions.  They baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  A good adaptable recipe for on the go families.

Some version of this egg mixture baked in muffins is one of my easiest and favorite breakfasts. Like others, I jazzed this up a bit adding chopped spinach and smoked sea salt and small chunks of cheddar cheese on top.

It is bland. Next time, I will sauté the onions and bell pepper (which I will add) first, then add to the eggs before baking. I also will add cheese and put the cherry tomatoes and more cheese on top when there is about 5 min. of baking time left. Also, the recipe doesn't call for salt, which really is needed.

It's good, but seems to lack something.  Next time I'll add a little shredded cheese.  The baked "muffins" are perfect for take-away.

Great recipe for those who only have time in the morning to grab a breakfast out of the frig and heat it up in the microwave. I decided to add some things I sally put in a quiche. 1/2(4 oz.) shredded cheese of your choice. Cheddar or Swiss is my favorite. 1/2 cup chopped broccoli, 1/2 cup canned mushrooms or precooked fresh mushrooms (drain away liquid), 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. I cut back on tomatoes and used 1/2 cup chopped Roma tomatoes instead of the cherry ones. Without these changes it may of tasted a little bland for me.

These were great! I added a splash of milk that other reviewers suggested and they fluffed right up. 10 eggs filled 12 cups, I would not double this for 12 servings unless you have extra large muffin tins! Because some family members like different fillings, I put the fillings in the muffin cups first then added the egg mixture before baking. I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top the last 5 minutes of cook time, perfect!

Easy and nice for brunch. We added some cheese and topped with hot peppers. Very versatile recipe. The kids have fun making up their own "muffins"with their favourite ingredients so everyone is happy and it keeps me from having to make 5 different omelets! :-) However, they came out a bit flat, maybe next time adding some milk to the mixture will make them fluffier. Thanks Maggie for the recipe.

These were well received when made like the recipe called for. I now call them fridge egg muffins. Anything left in the fridge is mixed with eggs and baked in muffin cups. Great little recipe for getting rid of left overs.

I've made this a few times now and my family loves them. They're great for school days when I'm rushing the kids out the door and I can make them on Sunday night for the next day or two. While I warm them in the microwave I'll toast an English muffin or a bagal to put the eggs on and if I don't use cheese in the egg I'll put a slice on the muffin then put the hot egg on the cheese. Melty goodness! The kids feel like they're getting McDonald's but I can control the ingredients and the portions. Plus I can make eggs with different ingredients to suit everyone and not slave away in the kitchen! And this recipe is both easy to beginner cooks and easy to switch up the veggies or add a little milk or different spices to up the flavor.

The idea is great and you can add just about any meat, vegetables, and your favorite cheese or combination of cheeses.  For vegetables, especially peppers and onions, sauté them in olive oil or butter with salt and pepper to help add flavor, so it is not bland.  I add milk to my eggs always and season the eggs with salt and pepper before adding them to the muffin pan.  Just be careful that you don't over salt your eggs or sautéed vegetables.  I also put my vegetables and cheese in the bottom of the muffin cup and then put the egg & milk mixture into a large liquid measuring cup so you can pour it into the muffin cups.  I fill the muffin cups almost full, about 3/4 full and they will puff up nicely and then can be kept warm in the oven until you are ready to eat.  You can also add fresh or dried herbs to your egg mixture to add more flavor to this.

I little bland, but I added broccoli as well.  Very quick and easy to do.
Try a little cheddar or feta cheese if you want to add more flavour.

I made it when we had our friends overnight.  It was so simple.  I set out the ingredients on the counter.  They picked what they wanted, and then after assembled, we popped them in the oven.  They were a hit, and will make them again when my brother and wife come for Thanksgiving.  Just have fun, and add different items that you like for variations.

What a innovative way to have bacon and egg! Just loved this recipe. I added some coriander leaves to it for enhanced flavor. My 4 year old loved it sooo much that he had 2 of these for lunch! Thanks

I made this using eggbeaters instead of eggs. I used low-fat cheese & ham, sauteed onions, green pepper and garlic. 4 tablespoons of chopped bacon. My recipe made 15 servings. I will be taking these to work as a quick breakfast.

These are great! Eating them as I type. I like to use diced onion (just 5 or 6 diced pieces each) instead of the green onion for a different flavor and some cheddar as well. Yum!

Very easy to make! I added a few extra goodies, garlic powder, celery salt, finely diced red pepper, hot sauce and topped with cheese. Only fill muffin tins 1/2 to 3/4 full as they do puff up in the oven and deflate when cooled. Used mini muffin tins for the kiddies. These are great! Will make a weekly batch.

I added salsa to the mix for flavor, used sausage chunks instead of bacon and sour cream to dip the muffin in. I also baked them for 30 minutes to make sure the eggs were completely cooked. Turned out better than anticipated! Great Saturday morning breakfast for the family.

Love  this recipe. It's very easy to make  and makes  a convenient breakfast on the go. I used  liners like the other reviewer suggested and I used  luncheon  meat (1 can), red onion (1/2), 2 roma tomatoes, and Kirkland organic no-salt seasoning  instead. Yielded 15 muffins for me.

I think the idea of making these into little cupcake-like individual servings is adorable! With the measurements listed, I had enough to make 11 muffins. As to said ingredients, I suggest adding less tomato and more onion to balance out the flavor profile. Otherwise tasty and simple!

I liked it. It was super easy to make. I used sausage, mushrooms, shallots, tomatoes and cheese. Easy from breakfast for people on the go or like me that get up way to early to go to work. Just put in the microwave for a minute and out the door I go with a nutritional breakfast.

Wonderful recipe. Easy & delicious. I put a bit of cheese and used one less egg. Other than that, I changed nothing. Next time might add some spinach & mushrooms.

I made this recipe with  all  the ingredients except the bacon.  I made the recipe for the first time and served it to my male friend who loved  the recipe.   The recipe came out perfectly delicious.  Even without the bacon.

I sauteed the onions, tomatoes and bell pepper before adding to the eggs. And I added in some cheese too. Turned out excellent! It's a complete meal in itself.

Simple,  doesn’t take long to whip up, easy to grab before work. I’m just starting the paleo diet and this works. I need to experiment with some ingredients for a little more flavor, that’s the reason for 4 stars not 5.

This recipe was easy and very tasty! I added sliced portobello mushrooms that I sauteed beforehand. I think this added a lot of flavor. Also I used veggie bacon as it's less calories and a lot easier to clean up.

I liked it, but the rest of the family thought it had too many tomatoes.

This is a good and convenient breakfast. They freeze well and reheat from the frozen state in 30 seconds.  It's low carb and gluten free. You can control salt. I add less than 1 slice of bacon directly to each muffin cup first before pouring the egg mixture.

Made it this morning for brunch,  I used breakfast sausage which I cooked first, then I wrapped the muffin cups with phyllo do, I also cooked the dough for 4 minutes first so as not to get soggy,it's a bit more work but they turned out beautiful, after all we eat with our eyes first. It took longer to bake, it took 25 minutes, maybe because of the pastry. Will do it again sometime.  I'm alone so,this will be more for  6 breakfasts or?

Such a great recipe. Super easy. I used Kirkland bacon crumbles instead of bacon strips and it's delish.

Absolutely delicious.  I added shredded chicken, green chiles in place of green onions, and substituted spinach for the tomatoes. Topped them with shredded cheese and a pinch of garlic powder.  Came out light, fluffy and very satisfying.  While family loves them.

I saute'd the green onion with some green bell pepper in olive oil, used Turkey Bacon, & Roma Tomatoes. Added some evaporated milk, garlic powder, salt & pepper to the eggs. I put the vegetables and bacon on the bottom, added the egg mixture then put sharp cheddar on top. They were very tasty.

Very good and super easy and fast!  I made these in a mini muffin pan and they were done in around 15 min..  I did add in some salt and also some shredded cheddar cheese.  Tasted just like a yummy omelet but in a muffin shape.  These would be good with spinach, ham, peppers, etc. any combo that you like.  I loved that you could mix them together, throw in the oven, and prepare the rest of your meal while they bake away in the oven.  Thank you for this simple, yet yummy recipe!

I tweaked by adding chopped spinach, garlic powder and 1/2 cup milk to twelve eggs. I also added a tsp.. of chives, 1c of cheddar cheese and substituted the green onion for a sweet onion. baked 30 mins. at 350 and I got 12-13 egg muffins. yum!

This is by no means a new recipe, and Maggies right ; you can add a varity of ingredients to suit your own taste. All in all this is an easy introduction to this lovely little breakfast item. Keep experimenting!

bacon is amazing but in this I had to change it for  grilled ham and add some cheddar, feels healthier and taste so much better to me.

Made these Christmas morning.  So easy and so delicious & we've made them since and added different stuff to them …. Sausage & Pepper Jack cheese are super yummy
