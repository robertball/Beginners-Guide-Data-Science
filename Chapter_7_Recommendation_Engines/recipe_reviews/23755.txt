Had all the ingredients at hand, so thought I'd try it.  Was quite good, BUT way too salty (and I like salty).  Might have been my bacon, but suggest you don't add any salt until you've tasted.  Think this would be better over refr. biscuits than cornbread.  Spicy and *very* filling - quite satisfying & a change from the standard egg dishes.  Recipe makes a huge batch.

The only thing I did differently was to sautee some diced habenero chiles in the bacon grease, and I also topped off the meal with some jarred jalapenos. Husband loved it. Thanks, Lynn!

This is such a yummy dish!  Breakfast is a big meal in our family and it was so nice to find something a little different.  I've made this several times and it really is excellent.

Was looking for a way to use up some spicy cornbread and this was it! Soooo good.  Definitely a comfort-type food.  I did leave out the cayenne (and salt) since I was using some spicy cornbread.  Would never have thought of doing this but definitely enjoyed it.

Awesome~ Sauteed a quarter pound of chorizo and a large chipotle pepper to add to the gravy. Added a diced jalapeno to the cornbread

Because i was concerned that the corn bread might be a bit too dry, I altered it to Pillsbury Grand Biscuits and it came out wonderful!

It is Not Gravy, it is a milk/ cream sauce or Egg Sauce, once egg is added.

I liked it but did not love it.  The other recipe in my recipe collection of Creamed Eggs I think is way better.  Easier also because you can just put it on toast.  This was also a little too spicy and heavy.
