Excellent!  We eat this all the time.  I made a few changes to make the recipe even easier to make.  I used 9 cups water with 3T chicken boullion granules, frozen sweet white corn and only 2 eggs.  This a favorite in our home!

I have been wanting to try a recipe like this one and finally did it tonight--so simple and delicious! I forgot to add the sesame oil but that was just fine. I also used soy sauce in place of the osyter sauce since I didn't have it on hand and I didn't put in fresh corn, only the can of creamed corn, which was perfect. I halved the recipe (thanks to Allrecipes for the conversion option!) and it made just enough for two. I will definitely will be making this again!

I used one teaspoon of soy sauce instead of oyster sauce because oyster sauce is very salty and is used more for flavoring stir fry foods. Other than that, it's a very good recipe.

Very comfortable, tasty soup.  Thank you.  Changes we made:  1)  didn't have oyster sauce, so used some soy - that tasted fine.  2)  Didn't add additional fresh or frozen corn, just the creamed corn we had been given and needed to use up (I've got an intolerance for corn, so though I eat some, I don't pile it on when I do), 3)  Sauteed an onion before making the soup, and included that in the soup...  4)  offered chopped, left over beef or pork. ...... yum!  Changes I might try next time:  a)  might use frozen corn instead of creamed corn, b)  might saute celery, garlic, and ginger with the onion, c)  might include chicken or fish.  //  My two youngest children ate this, and ate this, and ate this, until it was all gone.  Hubs enjoyed this, as did I.  Our second oldest son didn't care for one of our substitutions (the soy sauce).  I don't know if he'll enjoy this more with the oyster sauce called for in the recipe.  Will try to have some on hand for next time.  Thanks again! - well, 2nd son doesn't love the oyster sauce either.  We prefer the soy....??? go figure.... perhaps we just enjoyed that first meeting of this soup, and look forward to it just like that???  Thanks either way!

This turned out much thicker than i thought it would, but that's a good thing! I added a little bit of ground ginger, and I think next time I'll add a little more. Very yummy, corny, and quick to prepare!

My kids love corn and egg flower soup.  This is the best recipe I have found for it, and it is simple.  Thank you for offering it to us.

Made it as-is minus the white pepper because my wife doesn't like that.  I added the white pepper to my bowl and it tasted fabulous.

My kids REALLY wanted to make this dish after a recent trip to a Chinese restaurant. It's pretty tasty, but surprisingly spicy. Sadly, it was too spicy for my kids to enjoy. We'll make it again, but we'll leave out the vast majority of the white pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not add the corn because it just didnt seem tradtional to me. I also did not have white pepper so i used black and wow was that a mistake. This soup is only ok. It has a lot of room for improvement. It was very blan and not as thick as i would expect the soup to be. I am definately going to try something better.

The only things I did differently were to add a teeny pinch of ground ginger, plus I used canned corn kernels. I also only needed a really small amount of cornstarch/water to thicken. Not bad at all. Thanks!

I've made this many times. Each time I decorate my soup bowl with a wedge of lemon and chopped cilantro. I find the soup is too sweet for my Bangladeshi-American taste buds. I only have large eggs so I use two. Other than that it is excellent. My three years old loves corn. I made it in her honor today.

I choose this recipe to try out some new vegetarian oyster sauce and enjoyed the bit of sweetness and texture the creamed corn added, but I left out the extra whole kernals.
