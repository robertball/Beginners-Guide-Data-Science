Many professional chefs claim that one of the biggest mistakes home cooks make is to not heat their pans hot enough.  There is nothing dangerous about pre-heating a pan for 3 minutes to get it to the proper temperature.  I do it all the time......This was okay.  Nothing special.  I'm on South Beach and I couldn't find any whole wheat orecchiette so I used about 8 oz of whole wheat small elbows.  I added some chopped yellow summer squash and chopped tomatoes after the onions cooked for a bit.  I decreased the chicken stock to one cup and used some spicy V8 in place of the other cup.  I added some cayenne and Sazon to spice up the dish a little.  This was okay, a decent Tuesday night dinner, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.  There are better uses for a pound of shrimp.

As most of us do I changed this recipe a bit.  First off, putting anything into a pan that has been on high for 3 minutes can't be safe.  Used bag of fresh baby spinach instead of froz, didn't have right shaped pasta so used penne, used 1 can (14 1/2oz) of diced tomatoes and dropped the tom sauce altogether and cut the broth/stock to one cup.  Added 4oz. of sliced baby bellas with onion & garlic.  I added spinach when called to add sauce, should have waited and added w/shrimp.  Tuff to cook pan to dry as instructed so didn't.  This is really very good and would have given it 5 stars except for the dangerous first instruction.
