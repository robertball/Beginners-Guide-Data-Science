This is one of the first meals i served my french husband when we lived in Brighton. The only difference i make is to caramelise one onion and I also do half mashed sweet potato and normal potato with a little cheese through it. I've also introduced it to my Aussie friends and they love it too!

I found this a very good recipe for leftover corned beef.  I used a little over a pound sliced very thin, for the mashed potatoes I added some sour creamand a few minced cloves of garlic sauteed in a couple tablespoons of butter.  I had to leave casserole warming in the oven for about a half hour after baking it, and the cheese formed a very nice crust (I used a little over a cup so it covered the mashed potatoes completely).  Overall, a bit starchy, but fine for a cold weather meal, and very tasty with a bit of A1 Sauce on it.

Thought I had canned corn beef, but sadly....no.  Call me crazy, but used a can of Spam instead.   IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Will definitely try this as written though.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really loved this one! I made a few changes...used instant mashed potatoes and I used campbells pork and beans, and leftover corned beef from a brisket I made last week. It is a keeper for sure!

I've been eating corned beef hash for 55 years & tried this new recipe, OM Gosh, very disappointing. Let the Britts keep it over there, maybe American's put their own twist on this dish? It's a great dish but I don't recommend this version!

My mother (UK) has made this for years as did her mother (who lived in the US for a while and brought recipes back with her) only difference in this recipe being the bean layer. We saute a chopped onion, then mix with the corned beef (canned) with seasoning/dash of worcestershire sauce, top with the mash and cheese and bake. Always loved it but also love the extra option/dimension of the beans!
