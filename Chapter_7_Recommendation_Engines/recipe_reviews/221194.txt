This appetizer went over well at a recent casual birthday dinner party.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a pie pan and it still made plenty!  It was a touch on the oily and thin side, but has a nice smoky flavor.  I served w/crackers.  I like that it's made w/staples, so it's something I could easily quickly throw together as a snack for unexpected guests.  THANKS for the recipe, UCMOM!

I love this! I trade the type of protein out with what I have on hand. I've used chicken, bacon, turkey, canned ham, smoked fish etc. It is never too thin I make sure that I have enough cream cheese I increased it to 300 grams as that is the size of the container I buy. I avoid using really old cheddar as it makes the dip oily but medium, marble or Monterey Jack works just as well or better. As written this is a good dip add some of your own twists and it's great.

this recipe is sooooo good. Easy to make. if you have any leftover (good luck with that), it tastes good inside a baked potato! Bake your potato, heat up your leftover dip, cut open the potato, spoon it in an enjoy!

This easy to make dip is delicious and always a huge hit at all occasions! I was looking for a quick appetizer and this is my go to now! I do substitute onions for the green chiles because I don’t care for them. It’s still good even after it’s cooled down. I always serve it with ritz chips or pita bites. Definitely recommend this dish!

Looked just like the photo, but lacked taste.  Very bland.  I'm afraid I will not be making this again.
