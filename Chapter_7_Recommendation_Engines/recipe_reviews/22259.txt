i made this because i had yellow cake mix i wanted to get rid of.  for a cake that uses a mix as its base, this was not bad.  we don't drink, so i used 1/2 cup of caramel-flavored cappachino.

Good- Make sure you grease "and flour" bundt pan really well.  I only greased and the cake looked like it had exploded. Didn't look good but sure tasted great!

This was great.  My husband's not a cake eater and loved it.  My daughter doesn't like coffee and loved it.  Moist, and it lasted a long time.  I took some liberties with the icing and just mixed a bunch of melted chips and butter until it looked right.  Will definitely make again.  Only issue was that you couldn't taste much coffee in it so it was on the sweet side (not necessarily a bad thing!)

I this cake was awesome, moist and delicious.  I didn't taste any coffee flavor though so the name of the cake is misleading.

Loved it. I didn't have the half cup of coffee liquer so I just added a half cup of strong coffee and it turned out great, probably a little better for kids eating it, too.

Made it just as the recipe states and it turned out great. Next time I will double the amount of icing, though. Thanks for sharing!

Very Good cake.  We were out of sour cream, so we subbed the sour cream for 1 cup yogurt plus one tsp baking soda,.  We did want more of a mocha flavor in the glaze, so we added 1/2 cup strongly brewed coffee and 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar.

This was a good cake, everybody seemed to like it, but I thought it needed more coffee flavor.  Will probably make again and either add instant coffee to the Kahlua or use coffee extract that I found in an organic store.

This has become the households favorite cake recipe. It is so easy and soooo moist. We just got the recipe off the site  at the end of August and we have already made it three times. So delicious! (My family likes to eat it with coffee ice cream)

Excellent cake.  I made it twice this week.  Had many compliments the first time so I made it again.  Will make again and again.  My boys say it's the best cake I've ever made and I bake way too much.

This cake is so delicious!! A coworker declared it the best cake she has ever had. The taste of kahlua is just the right amount. Very moist. Love it.

This was good. Came out super moist and rich. But it's not a mocha cake. There was a *slight* taste off the coffee liqueur but it really reads like a vanilla cake. I would like to make this with a chocolate/devil's food mix instead of yellow, and add some instant coffee to the mix.  I added a bit of instant coffee to the glaze also a bit of salt, that was good.
