Excellent Steak salad. We enjoyed the unique dressing. Will be trying this with our favorite blue cheese dressing next time. We did use tenderloin steaks because that was what I had on hand. Delicious!

A really nice recipe for something different, with meat too. Would be nice with any other additions eg corn or fresh herbs.

This was a great steak salad, although I did not make the vinaigrette.  Loved the combination of other flavors in this and look forward to trying it with the berry vinaigrette!  Thanks, Dole!

Fabulous. Only changes were more tomatoes and feta as well as some spinach added to the romaine.  Next time I will add some grilled red potatoes to the mix. A perfect dinner.
