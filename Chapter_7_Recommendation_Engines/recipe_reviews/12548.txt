I really love this pie! The honey flavor isn't too strong and the calorie content in significantly lessened. My main warning is not to follow the directions too closely, adding eggs to boiling hot honey will cook your eggs, egg drop soup style. Let the honey cool a bit first. This pie comes out darker than its corn syrup cousin. Overall, if you like honey's taste, don't be afraid, this is a great pie.

I had a cookbook with this recipe that has since been lost. It is my family's favorite. We would NEVER eat a corn syrup pie after trying this. My recipe was called Kentucky Pecan Pie. It is SO delicious, not that overly sweet taste you get with corn syrup. SOOOO GOOD!

My co-worker and I both made this pie the same evening and neither one of us liked it.  The honey was over powered the pecans.  Would not recommend!

I love this recipe!  I made it twice for my Southern Pecan Pie loving Uncle, who never eats desserts anymore due to health concerns, but eats this one!  I don't eat sugar, so really don't know what a traditional pecan pie is like, so I can't compare.  I cook a lot with honey (my dad is a beekeeper), and I can tell you that the type of honey you use makes a big difference.  If you don't want an overpowering honey flavor, then use a light colored mild honey.  I use a clover honey which is dark and rich and gives it lots of body.  I don't like the store bought clover honey, but I'm guessing this would give it an entirely different taste.  I've also used palm sugar (2 cups, since honey is twice as sweet as other sugars), and is much more similar in flavor and texture to a brown sugar (without the high glycemic index.)  
For those that have dietary restrictions, or prefer a slightly healthier version, this recipe is great!  I made it with a gluten free crust so my mom could enjoy it too.  It was a hit this Thanksgiving.

Excellent!!! I make this recipe all the time, everyone loves it. I was searching for a pecan pie recipe made with honey due to my diet restrictions. It's soooo easy and it always comes out super sweet and delicious. I think the honey actually brings out and compliments the flavor of the pecans. This is my new favorite pecan pie, and I'm a southern girl, so that says alot!!! :)

I like honey and I like pecans. I thought the honey overpowered the pecans a bit. Had to make 1 1/2 batches to fill a 9" pie crust. Good pie if you love honey and don't mind not tasting the pecans very strongly.

i used this recipe with phyllo sheets instead of pie crust, and used a mini-muffin pan to make mini pecan tartlets. i also added a little ground clove.  I had leftover pecans i wanted to use, but was dreading the work, and this recipe made it simple! I also dusted the top of them with powdered sugar.  Thank you, Holly!!

This was good, but it lacked the depth of flavour that I enjoy in pecan pie, it was almost too sweet.

This really can go far if you use a honey you particularly like. It is milder than regular pecan pie and mine puffed up nice and thick. Very good and this has sold me on using honey instead of Karo syrup.

Incredible! I HATE pecan pie and I actually loved this recipe! It's a mellow flavor and I loved how the honey tasted with the pecans. I used a premade crust to save some time. I didn't think the honey overpowered it at all! The only thing I changed was letting the honey cool a few minutes before adding the eggs. Other than that, recipe was perfect!

Tasty version that we can make in a place where corn syrup is not available.  Seemed over-sweet to DH, but our Russian friends loved it!

I made this into 3 mini pies because my mother in law has my 2 pie pans. I followed the recipe for 11 servings, except for replacing the honey with butter flavor maple syrup. I used the French Pastry Pie Crust from this site & followed that recipe as 9 servings. I had to cook the 3 mini ones for waaay longer than 25 minutes, it was watery when I cut into it & I was really disappointed, I almost rated it off of that but I put it in the oven untill it was "set" for more like 1 hour 25 minutes, even though it made the crust darker than my liking. If I cooked it any longer like I wanted to the crust would have burnt. This pie is a big no no, I dont know what it is that could make it good. I just got done letting it cool down & bluucch. The pecans floated to the top & underneath was a nasty layer of eggs that wernt even sweet. I know I stirred the eggs correctly, Ive mastered that in cooking. What a big waste!

This is one of the best pecan pie recipes I've used. Due to the price of honey I usually use half honey and half corn syrup which I believe helps the overpowering honey flavor that the pie can have with 1 cup of honey. Just remember when mixing in the eggs to slowly add some of the syrup to beaten eggs to bring them up to temperature so the eggs don't cook in the syrup.

I only had about 3/5 of a cup of honey so I substituted corn syrup for the rest and it was really really good.

Love this recipe.  We have local honey producers here so I like to mix different honeys together to get the right flavors or add depth to the flavors.  I also use an almond, pecan, walnut, raisen and cranraisen trail mix instead of just pecans.  This helps add depth to the flavor of the honey(s).

This is now my go-to pecan pie recipe (at least, that's made without whiskey)! The flavor is so much more... everything. Easy recipe, it has become a staple for my family.

I've used this recipe before when making walnut pie. I've been asked to make it again this year. I find corn syrup has toxic effects on digestion and respiration and can't use it, or any other form of corn (maize).

I chose this recipe because of dietary restrictions and I love it!  I did adjust the recipe by adding a little more vanilla, I didn't add the nutmeg.  I also added a little maple syrup. Will definitely make it again.

Since I was out of corn syrup I thought I would give this recipe a try. The honey overpowered the taste of the pecans.If you are wanting a traditional Pecan Pie, this is not it. However, if you like super sweet and don't mind the strong taste of honey, you may like it. It was quick and easy to make. I would suggest trying it before presenting it to guests.

Oh my! This turned out great! Made just like the recipe said but I made a pretzel crust. So yummy!
