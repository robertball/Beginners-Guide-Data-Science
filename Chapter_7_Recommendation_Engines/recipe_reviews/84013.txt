This is my new favorite soup recipe!  Excellent flavor and easy to prepare.  I added a few things to make it even more filling.  First of all, I used two cans of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning, undrained, instead of whole tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes w/chilis.  Then I used lots more garlic, minced (four cloves - you can never have too much garlic!)  Then I added a cup of frozen corn and some leftover brown rice (probably 1 1/2 cups cooked).  Lastly, I used some fresh chopped cilantro.  I love rice in my soup, expecially since it absorbs the flavor and makes it hardier.

I make a similar soup, though try to pack a few more vegetables in mine -- small cubed zucchini, carrot, corn and celery.
Cilantro is a perfect bright accent to the soup, and I like to add small cubes of avocado as well - their buttery richness is a pleasant surprise!

This is similar to the famous "soup Nazi" Chicken Chili soup. I make a version of this regularly. A couple suggestions to make it easier. 1) Brown the chicken in the soup pot, cook through and shred while you cook the aromatics in the pot. 2) Add a can of cream style corn to the soup. This is really delicious!!

This tastes like tortilla soup - very spicy, which I like.  I didn't have tomatoes with jalapenios so i finely chopped some jalapenios from a jar.  I also didn't puree the soup but left the tomato chunks (so I used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones).  This tasted excellent and is a great South Beach Diet recipe as well.

OMGoodness! This is so good, I think I am going to use this recipe to win the chili cookoff at church this year. I did add a  whole jalapeno minced to the onions and the garlic. Oh, I am a cumin lover so I added a couple of tablespoons of that too, also a little paprika. YUMMY!

I fixed this dish for a pot luck dinner and everyone thought it was the best soup they have ever tasted. My family has been asking me every week to make the soup again. It's a little spicy but makes you feel warm inside.

I Loved this recipe. And I cannot cook ANYTHING! I used low soduim chicken broth, added a can of corn and some shredded carrots. Broiled the chicken in my toaster oven. No mess, one pot soup. Healthy and super delicious. The tomatoes with green chiles added the perfect amount of heat. And I liked that I didn't have to add a MSG or sodium packed packet of taco seasoning like most of the other mexican/tortilla soup recipes call for. This is definately a keeper. My first review because I loved this soup so much!

This was delicious.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole and fire roasted diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I did not puree it.  I also added finely diced carrot because I had some on hand that I needed to use up.  I also added a small amount of both ground cumin and coriander and I used ancho chili powder.  This was excellent and I will definitely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent soup!!!!  I did change a few things.  I used a 19oz can of diced tomatoes with spicey red peppers instead of the tomatoes with green chiles, chic peas instead of kidney beans and Thai Chili Sauce instead of cayenne pepper.  Will definately be making again.

Great soup for a cold rainy day! Instead of canned stock, I boiled down chicken bones, and used pickled chillies.  This goes really well with tortillia chips and sour cream. Definitely a keeper.

GREAT soup!! I didn't have chicken on hand so substituted with ground beef and YUM! I also had to make it non-spicy for the little guy (and he loved it too!) so omitted the cayenne and added dashes of tabasco with shredded cheese for the grown-ups when served. This is a definite keeper and next time will try it with the shredded chicken. Thanks Amy!!

I loosely made this tonight. I used ground beef instead of chicken, since I had it on hand. I used up some fresh and, on it's last leg, zucchini and corn. I added a bit of verde salsa for extra flavor and let it cook for over 2 hours without a top to reduce down a bit and concentrate the flavor. To serve, we squeezed a bit of fresh lime into it and added cheese and sour cream. YUM!

This was so good we even had seconds. I reduced it for two people. We loved the sour cream and cheddar.  I simplified it but skipping the blending step since we like our soup chunky anyway.  I added some fresh tomatoes and a little less canned ones.  I also added some frozen veggies and spiced it up a bit more since we like our food hot.  We'll definitely be having this again.  :-)

We loved this recipe! Instead of diced tomatoes w/green chile we used a can of plain diced tomatoes and a large can of diced green chiles. we also used ancho chile powder instead of regular chile powder and an extra can of kidney beans.  The chicken gets such a great flavor by simmering for so long. Perfect for a chilly evening!

I make this all the time and it is really good. I change it up a little with Chile Beans in place of the Black Beans only because my family do not care for Black Beans. I add avacado, cheese, fresh cilantro, diced fresh onions, and toritilla chips as on the side condiments to be served after soup has simmered to meld the spices. Don't be afraid to spice it up. Kind of like build your own soup bowl. My family loves it. It is the best Chicken soup I have every made.
