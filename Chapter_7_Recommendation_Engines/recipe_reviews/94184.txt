Super easy.  We liked the flavor, but baking them made the tortilla crispier than I like.  I think next time I will try heating up the ingredients and stuffing a warm tortilla instead.

These were definitely easy!!  The taste was pretty good, too.  This will be good recipe for me and the kids while my husband is gone.  It's nothing too special, but the easiness wins out!!
