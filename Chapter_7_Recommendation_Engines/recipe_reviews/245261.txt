If I were to say these were the best mashed potatoes I have ever had I would be lying. BUT, for having no cream or butter they were pretty darn good. I made as written but then blew the skinny part with my toppings.  I think these need a tad of butter if at all possible and you wouldn't miss the cream as much.  For being what these are though, I have no complaints.
