What a great low fat alternative to deep fried egg rolls and spring rolls!  I followed this exactly with great results.  Everybody loved them.  Instead of sprinkling  salt on the tops of the rolls I made a dipping sauce and dipped them in.  I used equal parts of low sodium soy sauce and rice wine vinegar, a splash of mirin and hosin sauce, and 1/2 tsp of sugar.  Turned out great!!!

I made these for New Years Eve (adding twice the amount of garlic).  Prepared the edamame mixture the day before and let it sit in the refrigerator so the flavors could "mingle".  They were GREAT!  A huge success with everyone. Even my husband who isn't a fan of edamame. Served the wontons with Chinese mustard, Hoisin and Ken's Asian Sesame dressing as dipping sauces.   I'll definitely make these again.

I've wanted to make wontons for awhile.  I found this recipe and had to give it a try.  While I'm not a vegetarian I like to cut meat out as much as possible.  I made the filling as suggested.  Added about a tablespoon of seasoned rice vinegar.  The filling ended up more flavorful than expected.  They are just so delish!  I like that they were baked too.  They did turn out crunchy.

I was so interested by the description of this recipe that I had to experiment! With the edamame filling, I added minced fresh ginger along with the green onion. Since I didn't have hoisin sauce on hand, I used oyster sauce instead. I blended about half the beans, and later combined the blended beans with the whole beans. Overall, it yielded a delicious result! Thanks for the recipe

Pretty good. Def. needed more flavor. The flavor seems to come more from the dipping sauces than anything else. I used regual soy and also sweet chili sauce.

I added some salt to the filling mixture as well as doubled the amount of garlic. Baked them instead of frying them.

This recipe is great!It is a favorite in our house and has been passed along to friends and family members. I've been mixing in some cream cheese to the stuffing mixture as well and tastes just as amazing!:)

I love edamame and wontons, so I was excited to try these. But they were really bad. I had to make a ton of adjustments to the filling just to make them edible. So disappointing.

I thought these were good but my husband, who likes edamame, didn't care for them. I brought them to work and got mixed reviews. I forgot to spray the first batch and they were kind of blah looking. The next batch with the spray looked as if they had been deep fried.

These were excellent!  I made them for my brother and he took the rest into work the next day and asks for them all the time.  I made up a bunch and froze them for him and he said they turned out great.

This was good, but I'm not sure it was worth the work.  Wontons are always a pain to make and I've have wontons recipes that I like better.  Also, I agree with some of the other reviews that they are a little dry in then oven so I think I will try pan frying or steaming the ones that I froze.

Great! Followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out very well. Served with Easy Asian Dipping Sauce from this site, which was a perfect compliment. Thanks! :)

This is a wonderful idea. I do think, however, that the sauce ingredients must be doubled for more flavor. It is also best served with an Asian dipping sauce.

I was unable to puree my edamame into a smooth paste.  I settled on a half pureed filling and it tasted great just the same!  These are a very unique appetizer!

These were pretty good.  I thought the filling could use a little more flavor, they definitely need to be served with a dipping sauce.  I used the oriental dipping sauce from this site.  Also I didn’t love them baked, they turned out a little dry, next time I’ll try pan frying or steaming them.

These were somewhere between a 3 and 4 as the recipe is...I think it could be moved up if they were steamed.  They would be delicious steamed and I definitely plan to make again this way.  The filling had great flavor, although I did add sesame seeds as someone else suggested.
