I thought this chili was pretty good. I like sweet chili. This is a recipe I will use again but next time I will omit the raisins. They didn't look very good and I don't think they added anything. Plus my dinner guests were a little freaked out by them. I served over egg noodles added a dash of ground cloves and sour cream hot sauce and cheddar cheese on the side.

As written we didn't care for this it was too liquid and too sweet for us. I cooked it down for several hours and it was still too liquid. After refrigerating overnight I adjusted by adding 2 tbs of tomato paste and 1 tbs Worstershire sauce and cooked it for another hour. It was better but still needs a bit more heat to temper the sweetness.
