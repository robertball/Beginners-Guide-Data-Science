This is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement. I really like the idea because it has the potential to be a flavorful yet healthy salad dressing (which can be hard to find). I would adjust the amount of thyme next time because I thought it was a bit overwhelming. I'd play with the other spices too - maybe try fresh herbs and add oregano or parsley, and also salt, pepper, garlic, and onion. I might play around with the vinegar too - maybe try balsamic. Sun dried tomatoes might be a good touch too. The options are endless!

I made a double batch.  This is very good.  I am always on the lookout for healthy dressings and vinaigrettes.  This qualifies!  I used a large tomato from my wife's garden and had to make a special trip to the store to get white wine vinegar, which is fine.  I was out of it anyway.  It was great warm.  I can't wait for it to cool and marinate for a couple of days!

I used red wine vinegar, 1 whole tomato, basil, ground mustard, dill, 1/8 tsp steak seasoning, salt and pepper to taste, and 1 clove of garlic. Sooo good!

We're about to have this with dinner.  I doubled it and added oil but I'm not too impressed.  It's a little bitter and I'm wondering which ingredient may have made that happen since my basil and tomatoes are fresh from my garden...maybe my dried mustard is bitter?

Looking for a lighter alternative to an oil-based vinaigrette so I tried the recipe as posted and it was a good 4 stars - if not a little bland, but I tweaked it up for the 2nd batch...2nd time around I used fresh thyme and basil (fresh herbs are not as potent as dried, so I doubled the amount of herbs). I also used Dijon instead of ground mustard and punched it up with some salt and pepper and 2 garlic cloves. Whirred it all up in the blender and DELISH!!!  Omit the vinegar and this could be poured over pasta!  In response to other posters stating this was a bit bitter...try removing the tomato seeds before blending. That may take care of the bitterness issue. You can also try a pinch of sugar. 
Thanks recipe poster. This one is a keeper!

I had an abundance of tomatoes from my garden to use, so my search for a recipe led me here.  This recipe reminded me of a salad dressing I used to adore, so of course they quit making it (UGH)...so I made this recipe exactly, but with the following additions- I added a clove of garlic because everyone knows garlic makes most things better, and I added some bacon bits because the discontinued dressing I loved had them, plus everyone knows bacon makes everything better.  Then I tossed this in a Ziplock bag with some boneless, skinless chicken breasts, let them marinate overnight and most of the day, and grilled them up.  Very, very fresh and tasty.  A lovely, flavorful healthy meal.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Jen!  I will surely make this again, as both a marinade and a salad dressing :)
