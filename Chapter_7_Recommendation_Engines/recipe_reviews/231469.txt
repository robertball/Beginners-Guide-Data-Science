This was awesome! I halved the recipe so that it would fit into my 2qt. slow cooker. I used a loaf of homemade Irish soda bread, and that worked out great! To the mix, I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I mixed all the wet ingredients in a bowl, then added the bread cubes to coat in the egg mixture, before putting it into my cooker. I may have left it on a bit longer than called for and then just put it on warm until I was ready to serve it. Very moist, and great flavor I think I would maybe add a bit more sugar if using plain bread, but since the Irish soad bread was already sweetened, it was fine...I can't believe this dessert came out of a crockpot, lol. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I knew I had to try this recipe, but I also knew I would make a few changes right off the bat. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, and I upped the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon. So, so good!!! I did use the raisins (a must for me in bread pudding!), but because this was going to be a dessert for us, I soaked the raisins in rum for about 1/2 hour before adding to the crock pot (SO good!). But next time I might also throw in some chopped apples just for variety. Anyway, this is a great recipe (that I tweaked to my personal preference, but I bet it is also great as written). Oh, and I also sprayed my crock pot with butter flavored non-stick spray prior to adding ingredients and cleanup was a breeze!

Mine is still cooking but I snuck a taste.  It is out of this world good.  Reminds me a lot of Raglan Road's (Disney World).  I cannot wait for it to be done.  I used Pepperidge Farm's hearty cut white and toasted it as suggested.  I added cinnamon and just a little more vanilla.  I only had skim milk so I used 1 cup skim and one cup half and half. Sooooo easy.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

WOW!  This turned out great! I used a 4 Qt. crockpot and increased the servings to 8.  I did toast my bread(a whole loaf of Pep. farm naturals honey oat).  I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 Tbsp. of real maple syrup.  I also switched the nutmeg to cinnamon, just because of personal preferance.   I also served additional maple syrup on the side.  I didn't need it as I felt is was sweet enough, but others added a bit.  I can't wait to make this again, and again, and again!!!  Next time I will spray the sides of the crockpot with cooking spray, especially if I plan to keep it on warm for any period of time.  Thanks for this awesome, and super easy recipe!!!

I made this recipe about a month ago and I used wheat bread instead of white. I also used golden raisins instead of the regular ones. My bread pudding tasted more like a healthy version of bread pudding instead of something more dessert-ish. Those who want a warm or cold breakfast with a more rustic and earthy appeal, try what I did. I should write this recipe out since it is different. Forgive me. Cheers!

This was so easy and quick to make.  I used panetone and added some dehydrated blueberries.  I butter the crockpot pan which made it easy to take out.  Oone more thing.... I used a spoon tp press the bread down to make sure all the egg mix was soaked up.  Love this and will make it again.

This is by far one of the best bread pudding recipes I have tried. I didn't have raisins but didn't miss them in this version of a southern favorite. I like things like this on the sweeter side so I added 3/4 cups of sugar. The bread I used was what I had on hand and it was Pepperidge Farm Honey Wheat. It came out fantastic and it is very easy and problem free to make. I only wish I doubled the recipe.. It was fantastic.. Thank You for sharing

This is the second time I made this recipe.  It was very good the 1st time, but I learned some tricks..  Be sure to spray your crock with non-stick butter spray before adding the bread.  I doubled the recipe because we loved it.  I would fill my crock pot with bread crumbs, add the some liquid  mixture, stir and add more bread until most of the liquid is adborbed.  I used 12 hamburger buns.  Also, top it off with warm caramel sauce a it is served.

I had made zucchini bread and forgot to add the salt and baking powder (duh!!!)... Anyway, this was the perfect fix for my problem (not so tasty zucchini bread). I added the salt that I forgot and used evaporated milk. I made whiskey sauce to pour over before serving it. My husband and I finished it off in 4 days, it was delicious !!! Thanks for sharing this fabulous easy recipe with us.

I've done this a few times and it turns out wonderfully.  I've doubled it every time, toasted the bread, and minorly tweaked the spice to my taste (half the nutmeg, added 1/2 t of cinnamon).  I do toss everything together before putting in the crockpot.

I was introduced to bread pudding only recently, and had not made it before trying out this recipe.  Well, I can say for certain that I have no desire to try any other bread pudding recipes - this one is a keeper!  I used day-old egg bread, and actually added 3 tablespoons of rum as it was the holiday season.  Yum!

A little bland, but this is a basic bread pudding.  It works well in the slow cooker, and you can easily adjust.  I meant to grease the cooker and forgot.  Oops.  If you make it, try to remember to grease it.  It really helps.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG    I can't stop eating it :)   I tried it this morning.   Halved it and then cut the half to 3/4 so that I could fit it into my  1.5 qt crock pot.   I didn't want to make a big batch first, just in case.   Boy, its good.  I happen to like the custardy type of bread pudding and that is how mine came out.  I didn't use raisins or nutmeg because I don't like them, and since I was low on white bread I added a couple of slices of leftover banana bread.  I can't wait to make the original recipe.  YUM !!!   Thank you for experimenting and sharing your good results.

This recipe is easy to make.  I had  some doughnuts that were a couple days old and instead of pitching them out I made this.  I added1/8 tsp of cinnamon and a 15oz can of peaches without the juice to turn it into a sort of peach cobbler. It came out great could barely wait for it to finish it smelled so good.I will definitely make this again.

WOW! I didn't expect it to taste as good as it does. I did add cinnamon along with nutmeg.  I followed cooks notes and used half and half  instead if milk. I also used  brown sugar in place of white and  i toasted the bread. 
We normally don't eat white bread but my grandson came to visit and that's all he eats. I didn't want to throw it out when he left so I used it for this bread pudding.  So glad i found this lovely recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

I am making this now.  Needs more liquids .  I added about 2 and a half cups milk and about 1/2 cup vanilla soy milk * I would have used milk but it is organic and for my daughter*
I also added about 1/4 cup more of brown sugar both light and dark 2 hours into the cooking with the soy milk.  I also like my bread pudding liquidy.  I tasted it so far so good.  This is a great base for a great recipe. Wish I had some amaretto left otherwise that would go in there too.  I used Ciabatta bread.

I will rate this as 4 stars. I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings since I have a 4 qt crock pot. I used 2 eggs but added more milk, at least another 1/3 cup. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top. The only thing that would make it better would have been some redi whip or cool whip on top. Otherwise a moist bread pudding to make :).

Used up leftover loaves of french bread. Took advice of commenter and added a pinch of cinnamon and an extra 1/8 cup of sugar. Served it with a homemade warm brown sugar caramel sauce. Delicious! Definitely will make again . Thank you for a great recipe.

Easy and good. I usually leave out the butter (when my grandmother made her bread pudding, she never put butter in if). I also, let the bread & milk & eggs & sugar, etc., sit & soak for a while before I turn the heat to it. But I love to have it done in the slow cooker--I never burn it that way! :D

Very good  way to use up excess bread. I used part  whole  wheat  bread, part  white sandwich bread- both  'day-old', no raisins, I used  dries tart  cheries. It' amazing. Cleanup after - even tho I greased well still have  a lot  stuck on - soak with  baking soda, comes right  out.  I can't wait to try with other  dried or fresh fruits.

This was a nice way to make bread pudding. It turned out well; just enough eggs, bread and milk. With this much bread, I knew it wouldn't have enough sugar and spices for me. I increased sugar to 1/2 c, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 t apple pie spice. I would use whole t of spice next time. Make sure you use cooking spray in your crock pot before you start or a liner. Mine cooked about 10 min over, and it stuck badly in some places, so make sure you take it out in time. Nice recipe Andie!

I have made this twice and it comes out wonderful. First time I used white bread, added the raisins, and Loved it. Then I used cinnamon raisin bread only added a 1/8 Cup raisins and the vanilla, this too was yum ! This is so much easier than the traditional oven method with a pan of water ! One of my all time favorite deserts and I had missed it for years because I was always too busy. With the slow cooker it is so easy to make, I will never have to only wish I had some.

I made it exactly as it says. Isn't sweet at all. I serve with ice cream and whip cream to help the salty flavor and it work. Next time I'll use brown sugar and more cinnamon...

This turned out rather tastless and not very sweet. Bread cubes on the top didn't become part of the pudding.  Definetly needs more liquid ingredients.  I will take the recipe and play with it.  I think it's a good foundation but I wouldn't serve it to my guests as is.

Excellent bread pudding! I toasted the bread (an Italian loaf) in the oven and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a full tsp vanilla. I sprayed my crockpot before adding the ingredients, which I mixed thoroughly beforehand. I also made the vanilla sauce from the best bread pudding recipe on this site, and it was the perfect compliment. Be sure to really beat the egg and milk mixture so avoid separating during cooking. This was hot and delicious all afternoon until it was gone!

I've made this a few times now and it has always turned out great. I tend to use 1 cup cream and 1 cup dairy.  I also peel and dice an apple and add 1/2 tsp cinnamon. The whole family loves it.

This was wonderful. The taste was great and the fixing it was easy. I did use apples instead of raisins as I don't care for raisings. My BH put some eggnog on his. He loved it.

def needs more sugar - i used old pastries and found it a little on the bland and less sweet side.  Smells better than it tastes.

Just made this for the first time.  Smelled yummy from the outset - but the finished product is disgustingly bland.  I used honey instead of sugar, and to make it palatable will top with homemade peach 'syrup'.  Very disappointed BUT will work on the recipe to make it better.

Served this delicious dish to my hubby on Father's Day. He was raised on bread pudding, but I had never tackled making it. This was easy and delicious. I took a whole loaf of cinnamon raisin bread, toasted it and cut in chunks. Then I added the liquid solution to it changing the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. Will definitely keep this recipe for future use. May even play around with it as the other reviewers suggested.

Delicious! However, I would highly recommend using one of those crock pot liners for this one.. pieces cooked to the bottom and took forever to clean off. So tasty with some vanilla ice cream.

I revisited this for a brunch. I used hard & stale  plain (glazed) donuts instead of bread and I cut down the sugar. OMG so good! Next I'll  try pound cake and chocolate chips and cut WAY back on the sugar...

Made this for a girls bunko and EVERYONE raved about it!  Few changes:  I used raisin bread and heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  Doubled the recipe, which fit perfectly in an oval slow cooker!  I also served it with whiskey cream sauce!

I made this with the following changes:
brown sugar vs white
dried cranberries, not raisins
1/2 tsp grated orange peel mixed into egg/milk mixture
this makes an orange/cranberry bread pudding.  Delicious warm or chilled

Delicious and oh so easy!  You can add just a little more of the liquid base if you want your pudding less dry but that is personal taste.  Be forewarned- this stuff leaves some vicious dried-on material in the crock pot liner.  It took a day of soaking in soap water before we could get it completely clean!

I added a couple of apples and reduced the liquid as suggested. It tuned out a little dry and apples were not cooked fully.  I'll make adjustments in the future. It tasted great however.

I made this with whole grain bread, a can of apple pie filling, and a little brown sugar, and cinnam,on, and it came out perfect !  This is an easy recipe, and can be adapted in so many ways. I do not like raisins, so I will always make it with other fruit. I  made another using  orange juice, and orange chunks, and it  too, came out great !

I followed the recipe and I liked the flavor, for my first time making bread pudding it was easy follow, next time I will make some changes I will use a cream instead of just milk because I would like a creamer bread pudding this one was a little squishy like mentioned in the other comments and I will bake it in a water bath and see how that goes! But in all I did like this recipe and will use it again.

It was ok, could be a bit sweeter. Kinda tasted just like soft bread. Paired well with vanilla ice cream. Won’t try this recipe again

I followed Sue's recommendation and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for the white sugar. I had more than 8 cups of stale bread so up the eggs and milk plus added a 1/2 cup of honey.
We like raisins and walnuts  so used about 1 1/2 cup of each.

This turned out really good. This is the first time I've used my slow cooker for something non-savory so I was iffy about it, but it was very tasty! The only thing I did different was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I toasted the bread first for a little more flavor.

I'll definitely be using this recipe again the next time we have leftover stale bread.

I made this with bakery rolls that were a little on the dry side, and they worked great in this recipe. I upped the sugar to 3/4 cup and also added some brown sugar. I didn't have enough whole milk on hand, so I used unsweetened almond milk. Instead of nutmeg, I put in a generous amount of cinnamon, and also more vanilla than the recipe called for, though I did not measure either the cinnamon or vanilla. I didn't have raisins and I don't care for them in recipes, so I didn't add any, but next time I might try an apple if I have any on hand.

I did what others have suggested and toasted the bread cubes and I added them to the large mixing bowl I was using before dumping them in the slow cooker, it was done in just under three hours, more like two hours and forty-five minutes.

The end result: A sweet but not too sweet tasting treat that was easy to make, I didn't use any topping, tasted good as is. Since I've never made bread pudding before, I am very pleased with the outcome.

One more note: I used a liner in my slow cooker, but if you don't have a liner I definitely recommend using cooking spray.

I didn't think it was going to be sweet enough because bread pudding should be sweet and I added more cinnamon because I like there to be more spice. The concept was good but I don't think we wouldn't have liked it as the recipe was written.

The length of time that is listed to cook the bread pudding is much too long and it came out dry and burnt on the edges.  I would also add a touch more vanilla and possibly a bit more sugar to add some flavor.  It was bland so I served it with either vanilla ice cream or maple syrup drizzled over it.

I will try it again, but will make adjustments for taste and cook time.

I found this recipe and only had stale donuts I could use so that's what I used. I also have only a 1 1/2 qt crock pot so I halved the recipe. It was delicious! My grandfather used to make his bread pudding with left-over biscuits and that is what I usually use, so next time I have biscuits left I'll be making this. Yum, yum.

This is a nice bread pudding considering it is made in a slow cooker. I have made this recipe exactly as written as well as various versions of this recipe,  and it has always turned out. If you like the convenience of throwing everything into a slow cooker, then this is definitely the recipe for you. It is not quite  as nice as an old fashion bread pudding baked in a water bath in the oven.

This was delicious.  The consistency was not like other bread pudding that I have had, some of the eggs cooked and separated from the bread.    Not sure if I did something wrong, but It was more like chunked french toast.  We loaded it with some cinnamon sugar and it was a huge hit with our entire family.  I will try again and see if I can get the consistency better

Really good, and I've never been a fan of bread pudding.  I used week-old toasted white and whole wheat bread and soaked the raisins in rum for 30 minutes.  I topped with rum sauce from this site but it was a bit overpowering, so I will leave that off or dilute the rum in the sauce next time I have bread that I'm about to toss out.

I had extra bread in the house and don't like to see food spoil. So, I decided to make this recipe. I've never really had bread pudding before, so I had to give it 5 stars. Since, I had nothing to compare it to and it tastes "fantastic"! Just after I started cooking, I went to read the reviews and wanted to add the cinnamon. Since, it was to late to mix in with the milk and egg mixture; I just lightly sprinkled some over the top. BTW, I used frozen bread loaf dough.

This recipe was easy to make and turned out great.

I saw another reviewer said they thought there were too many eggs, so I split the difference and used 3, which seemed to work well.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon (because we all love cinnamon), but otherwise duplicated the recipe as shown.  As I said, it turned out well and the whole family liked it.

Could use better instructions of the "2 cups cubed bread'.  Packed tight?  I assume so since I didn't and it took 4 hours to cook this to knife-clean doneness.  Meanwhile the sides and bottom burned.  While the aroma while it was cooking was terrific, in the eating it did not have quite enough sweetness to us.  I even used Hawaiian bread.

Will try again but 3 hrs was too long and mine burned.  I wasn't able to be there to check on it, but won't leave it next time.  Used Greenlee's Cinnamon Bread.  Used 1/2 & 1/2 Brown sugar and white for the 1/4 cup.  Due to the bread chosen, could have cut back more.  There's a Betty Crocker online recipe that is almost identical to this, but it uses 1 cup sugar -- that would be way too much.  Also want to experiment to have more custard in my next try at this, so may add more milk and egg.

Just made this today and it was a winner! I read through some other reviews and really the only thing different I did was along with the white sugar, I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, and used the pepperidge farm cinn bread ( toasted)

I  made the recipe exactly as is with toasted bread no optional items. Maybe I am not a fan of nutmeg, but I didn't like it. I have had better bread pudding on a cruise ship buffet. I did have a few family members who said they liked it, but I don't know if they were just being nice. Will not be making it again.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count. I use raisin bread each and every time. I top it with a homemade vanilla sauce. Absolutely out of this world and the many people who beg me to remake this thinks so too ;)

I love this recipe because it's so adaptable. Using plain soymilk for a batch, I simply added more flavorings to meet the plainer taste, and it's delicious (I did start with a soymilk that tasted good to drink anyway).  Thanks to all the other cooks who left awesome notes on your variations.  My next challenge is to find ways to make this vegan, tasty, and nutritious.

I set this up in the middle of the night while on heavy pain meds. Only had hamburger buns for bread, added cinnamon as others suggested, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it in the morning.
It was amazing! Can hardly wait to try it with the Hawaiian bread as I'd originally intended.

I made this bread pudding this morning. I used homemade white bread and think the pudding needs more liquid. A pudding should be creamy. 
I checked it at 2 1/2 hours and it wasn't done when tested. At 3 hours it was done, but did not hold together like a pudding. It tastes great, but next time I'm increasing the milk and eggs by half. So 3 cups of milk and 6 eggs. I though it was plenty sweet so I will probably leave the sugar as is. Also I like to use the crock pot to save money on heating the whole oven, but 3 hours even on low seems to defeat that.
