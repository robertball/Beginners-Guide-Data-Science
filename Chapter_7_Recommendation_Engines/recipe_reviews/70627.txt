I measured ingredients at first but found it needs twice as much  honey and mustard the recipe calls for. Overall it was good. I think i will thin it out with a lil lemon juice next time.

I absolutely love this honey mustard sauce! i made it to dip chicken tenders in and it was delicious. it tasted like the kind they use at ruby tuesdays (which i find to have the best honey mustard dipping sauce ever!) i will definately make it again. it was simple and easy and you can add more mustard or honey to your liking. instead of cayenne pepper that i did not have, i just added a squirt of hot sauce. PERFECT!

This was tasty and easy. I love it with cayenne, but to please my two year old I sometimes use black pepper instead. Also, I like it with much more mustard and honey.

this was pretty good... i found that ALFANN02 was right... you surely need to double the mustard and honey... i didnt have cayenne pepper so i used black pepper as someone recommended as well as some hot sauce... it indeed was great...

i didnt have cayenne so i added a teaspoon of sriacha sauce. i put this on pork chops that were cooking on the grill. i would cut the mayo back by at least half and up the mustard. it wasnt really mustardy at all. it was ok on the pork chops but i wouldnt dip into this sauce or put it on greens.

I cut this down to make 1 serving (1/4 cup).  You can play around with this one to make to your liking.  Used this in "Aaron's Missouri Burgers" from this site.  Great recipe.

This was a super-easy and great tasting dip!  We used it on shrimp and also on turkey meatballs.  I did substitute spicey brown mustard for the standard prepared mustard which kicked it up another notch and we really enjoyed it. Thanks for the great recipe!

OMGoodness!  this is an amazingly simple delicious honey mustard recipe:)  We like things a bit spicier, so I added some more cayenne pepper as well as some salt and pepper.

Delicious! I didn't actually measure anything...just eyeballed the proportions and then adjusted until it tasted right.
