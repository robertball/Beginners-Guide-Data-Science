Simply delicious!  I pre-cooked the carrots for 5 minutes in boiling water earlier in the day (rinced in cold water to stop the cooking process when done); then made the sauce. Put it altogether and let it sit in the frig until dinner time.  This gave the carrots and sauce some time to spend together!!!  When dinner time came - I just warmed the dish up in the microwave.  Simple with a great taste!

Made it with bagged baby carrots.  Should have added salt to the water carrots are cooked in in such a case, to help the salt permeate the carrots when cooking.  After tasting glaze I added a tad more ginger for a better balance.  Nonetheless,as the recipe stands it merits 5 stars, and it was a hit with our company.

This is a great variation on plain carrots.  We ended up with an enormous of oranges and I was looking for some recipes that called for more than just orange zest.  I used fresh orange juice but didn't have any parsley on hand.  My mother, who doesn't much care for carrots, ate two helpings at dinner.  A definite repeat recipe.

I don't like carrots, and this recipe was fantastic. I used freshly-squeezed oranges with pulp and it was quite nice. Two-thumbs up for non-carrot lovers.

These were great! Instead of nutmeg I used allspice and served them with ham and oven fries. I salted the boiling water for the carrots, not too much, just enough to bring out the flavour - maybe 1/4 tsp. Also, I found I had to whisk the corn starch into the orange juice to avoid lumps. Definitely added to the rotation! Thanks for the inspiration!

Quick and tasty. I used pineapple mango juice and would probably prefer orange but that's what I had on hand. Added peas as well, my 1 yr old loved this.

Good carrots! I took Debbie's advice and premade the recipe, putting the carrots and the sauce together in the fridge then reheating on the stove at dinner time. I also used fresh ginger, and more of it than called for, for extra bite. These were good carrots, but I probably won't make them again. The flavor was a bit too different for us on carrots. But fun to try!

I had these carrots on brown rice. The parsley helped to balance the sweetness of the sauce.

I love these! Great recipe. My husband didn't care for them (he doesn't like carrots much), and my three-year-old didn't care for the "sauce," but I thought they were excellent. I will make them again (for myself, that is). :) Thanks!

easy peasy - I wanted to use up some fresh ginger, so I used 1 tsp chopped instead of the powder - and don't know how, but I was out of brown sugar so I used white sugar instead AND I added a tbsp of maple syrup to the orange juice - what an amazing fragrance while cooking and super tasty.  The sweet tooth at the dinner table loved it!  Perhaps a bit too sweet for me, but I got over it!

I don't love cooked carrots, but I thought this recipe had a nice little zing. I used fresh ginger and fresh squeezed orange juice and it went nice with my curry chicken and rice.

Delicious!  I loved that the carrots still had texture and weren't mushy, and that the sauce was not overly sweet.  I paired this with mashed potatoes and ranch chicken fingers and everyone loved it!  Great recipe!

These were okay.  I kind of liked the taste, but my husband didn't really enjoy them.  He said they were a little tart.  Probably because of the orange juice.

This was good - went over well with the kids. I used frozen carrots and doubled the ginger and nutmeg.

Very sweet and very delicious! I, too, would use a bit more ginger the second time around. Wonderful and simple!
