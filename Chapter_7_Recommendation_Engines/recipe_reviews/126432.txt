I have been making cheesecakes for my husband's mens group for almost a year.  I made the Apple Spice Cheesecake for them and have been told this has been the BEST cheesecake I have ever made.  Then I made the Reese's cheesecake for my ladies' group (we need chocolate) and again they also thought it was the best.  I highly recommend and look forward to making more variations!  I did however change the crust to a more traditional graham cracker crust for the Apple Spice cheese cake by using 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, a stick of butter melted, and 1 cup of sugar.  For the Reese's Cheesecake I used the Famous Chocolate Wafers.  I used 2 cups crushed wafers and one stick of butter melted to make the crust.  I like the thicker crusts and could not see how 3 Tbsps. of crumbs could make a crust.

The Master Cheesecake recipe was very light and flavorful with a wonderful soft and featherweight texture.  I followed the recipe's directions exactly, struggling somewhat with configuring the foil around the springform pan, but finally got it right! Also, I used the Famous Chocolate Wafers to coat the sides and bottom of the pan...a very, very thin coating that really didn't leave a crust at all once the cheesecake came out of the oven.  Couple of suggestions: the Master Cheesecake recipe says forty minutes in the oven (in the bain marie).  My batch could have gone another 8-10 minutes (and my oven was calibrated at 325 degrees).  Then, as the recipe stated, I turned off the heat and left the oven door ajar for thirty minutes.  Also, I don't understand just using 3 tablespoons of crumbs to line the sides of the pan...not enough.  Should I have not lined the bottom of the pan?  I guess I am use to the traditional thick graham cracker crust.  Anyway, bottom-line here: excellent taste and texture and so light that you "almost" feel guiltless eating it!

I must say I am a cheesecake Connoisseur.  I have been looking for the perfect cheesecake recipe and after trying this one, I found it.  I love the creamy, light texture. I am not a fan of a thick, dense cheesecake.  I made the original recipe once and the second time swirled some blueberry topping in.  I was asked where I bought the cheesecake and my guests could not believe I made it.  It is absolutely wonderful!

STOP LOOKING!  You have found the best cheesecake recipe ever!  I made a traditional graham cracker crust (2 cups graham cracker crumbs , 1 stick of butter, 2 TBSP sugar) and baked an additional 20 minutes before turning the oven off and opening the oven door.  Topped with fresh strawberries and hot fudge.  Amazing!

I made this according to directions (but with a graham cracker crust), except I didn't use the water bath, but put a pan of boiling water under the cheesecake. It was an absolute hit with everyone - except the one son who doesn't like cheesecake at all; he said it was OK. The texture was perfect - not grainy or lumpy. Next time I might add a half teaspoon of lemon extract. This is definitely a keeper.

I make a lot of cheesecake but I usually make it "simple" no sour cream and no cream..but I decided to give this one a shot. It was really good! A lot creamier than those that I usually make! Since it was my first time making this one, I kept to the original version. I just topped it with blueberries and strawberries. Also, I made a more traditional crust. I can't wait to experiment with some variations...

My son wanted a "Plain" Cheesecake for his birthday.  Found this.  Since other people would be at the party and want some "Flavors"  I chose this recipe.  IT IS AWESOME.  I have made it three times since March.  I always make some toppings to go with it.  Chocolate syrup, peanut butter sauce, caramel sauce, fruit sauces, chopped Reese's peanut butter cups and mini choc. chips.  I just make regular graham cracker crust.  Also I usually bake for about 10 minutes longer, then proceed like normal.  Everyone that tries this either wants me to make it for them or they want the recipe.  Thank you for our "Families" cheesecake recipe!!!!!!

This cheesecake is great!! The sour cream and heavy cream really do make a difference!! So rich and creamy. I had never baked a cheesecake in a water bath like this before (guess I thought it was too much of a pain), but it makes a HUGE difference. I usually put a lot of toppings on my cheesecakes after they are done, but what bothered me is that the tops would always crack and then get hard...putting them in a pan of water like this really does stop this from happening! Cheesecake was nice, firm, and super creamy (I made the Snickers one)....the best one yet!! Will use this recipe from now on.

I made the Lemon version of this cheesecake for Easter and it was marvelous!  Very creamy and just the right ratio of tart/sweet.  I do not recommend the optional ladyfinger lining.  Next time I will make a crust of shortbread cookies.  Splurge on a good quality lemon curd.  It makes all the difference.  Thanks for this keeper!

this was wonderful. I wanted a pumpkin cheesecake so I added a can of pumpkin, 1 tsp. cinnimon 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. I baked it for 50 min and let it sit in oven for 30 after and it's done. Can't wait until it's cooled and it's time to eat! Tasted just a bit of it and it is creamy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  This will be my go to cheesecake recipe from now on.  It's so rich and creamy without being really dense.  I kept it simple, just made the master recipe, however I used a bourbon vanilla which gave it a nice edge.  I also made a walnut pecan crust since we are gluten free in our house.  

When baking, I used this never fail technique: wrap in foil and place in water bath, preheat oven to 350, put the cheesecake in and then turn the heat down to 250.  Bake for 1.5 hours and then shut off the oven.  Keep it in there for about 2 or three hours until the oven is cool, then remove and refrigerate.  No cracks!

This was yummy, but not incredible. Needs more cooking time.. I would suggest not turning off the oven and leaving it ajar.. Instead, leave it on that temperature for the full time. I toppped it with a strawberry glaze and mixed berries.

Absolutely delicious. As creamy as everyone has raved. I used a traditional graham crust as this recipe has no crust, just crumbs covering cake. I made individual cheesecakes, about standard cupcake size. I baked at 325 (no water bath) for about 18-20 mins, turned oven off left door ajar for about 12-15mins, and because I was worried about the jiggly center I left oven off and closed the door for another 15-17mins. They were perfectly cooked - no cracks in the top either. Great recipe.

I took the advice of many others who have made this recipe and used 2 cups of crumbs and a stick of melted butter for the crust. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust for a little extra kick (I love the flavor combination of vanilla and cinnamon) and I topped the cheesecake with drizzled chocolate and caramel. It was a hit! I was a little worried because the cake seemed to still be quite pudding-like in consistency in the middle and I wondered if it had needed to be baked for longer. But whether that was the case or not, the cake got rave reviews and there was not a single morsel of cake left on anyone's plate. Success!

This recipe is one of the best and I've tried several.  Be careful:  wrap your pan WELL for the water bath which made the world of difference if you don't want your cheesecakes to split.

I made this for my friend's birthday and it got RAVE reviews!  I'm living in Germany right now so I sort of had to improvise (used Quark instead of sour cream, Schlag Sahne instead of heavy cream), but it turned out amazing.  Also I made an Oreo crust.  My German, American, and Polish friends loved it.  Will absolutely make this again!

An Amazing Cheesecake!!! The texture, flavor, and presentation of the cake was awesome! I did change the recipe a little bit. I had to cook the cheesecake for an hour instead of 30 minutes. Also, I add 2 tsp cinnamon and for the crust used Vanilla Wafers (1 1/2 van waf., 6 tablespoons melted butter, and a 1/2 cup of sugar). Love it!!!

The cheesecake had a wonderful taste and a creamy texture, however it was very soft, almost like whipped topping.  I tend to prefer my cheesecake a little more firm.  It was very difficult to move it from a spring form pan to a pretty cake plate for serving, without tearing it to pieces.  I do plan to use the footnotes on an old standby cheesecake recipe that my mother gave me from the  Southern Living Year Book 1983.

OMG this is the best!! So creamy and delicious.  I even poured hot water over the batter by accident while trying to put it in the pan below.  I just closed the oven and crossed my fingers.  It turned out great.  The water must have evaporated. This is a keeper for sure.  I will make again (without the hot water poured on top)

The recipe was very creamy just the way I like a cheesecake.  My husband loved it as well.  I had to add additional baking time.  I added 20 minutes more and will probably add an additional 5 to 10 minutes next time.  I followed directions exactly but the cooking time was incorrect for my 325 degree oven.  Even though, the taste was superb. I am trying to replicate the nuns of New Skeete's cheesecakes and this is the closest yet.  And if you have never had one of their cheesecakes then you have never had the best cheesecake in the world... they are heavenly and worth every penny (in case you look them up on line and order one!).

This recipe makes a light and creamy cheesecake. My family got impatient, however, and wanted to try it shortly after I removed it from the oven. Advice - allow to thoroughly chill before serving. It was excellent!

this came out great the first time I made it...no cracks, creamy texture! I used the Master recipe then customized it using the Lemon recipe. I used crushed gingersnaps, 1 1/4 cups plus 3 Tbsp butter for the crust. I made my own lemon curd for the topping for the first time and it was perfect, you just have to be patient and whisk constantly over a double broiler. Also only use fresh lemon juice and not the bottled stuff. The contrast between the sweet and tart flavors are amazing. Definitely a keeper!

Amazing cheesecake!  I honestly think this is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever eaten.  I made it for my friend's family and they had 3rds!  They said it was better than cheesecake factory (and they make a pretty yummy cheesecake).  It is incredibly fluffy and tasty.  I made a graham cracker crust for it too like other's suggested.  I also cooked it a little longer.  Perfection!

Nice and creamy, not dry.  Sweet enough but next time I will reduce some of the sugar for healths sake.  I did have to cook it longer than stated since it wasn't even fully hot in the middle.  I did substitute the sour cream and heavy cream with 1/2 cup of plain yogurt.  Also substituted some brown sugar for the white(this made the batter slightly brown)   Made it an Almond cheesecake and since we are Gluten Free in our home I created my own Gluten Free coconut/almond crust.  Not only is it gluten free but lower carbs & high fiber and the coconut oil is good for you, recipe below.  Gluten Free Coconut/Almond crust (measurements are aprox.) -1/2 cup coconut flour -1 cup chopped roasted almonds -3 tbsp Honey -enough melted coconut oil to make a crumbly mixture.  Almond Swirl  -reserved aprox. 1/2 cup of the batter and mixed in 1/2 cup unsweetened almond butter and 2 tbsps honey and dolloped onto the top of the cheesecake, then run a knife in swirls.  Frosted the top of the cooled cheesecake with cool whip and sprinkled toasted almonds.  This one is a keeper!  with so many possibilities.

Made this cheesecake with the traditional graham cracker/walnut crust and loved it. I will definitely add this to my file.

How to avoid cracks then? Be sure to mix your cheesecake batter well, eliminating all possible lumps in the cream cheese BEFORE you add the eggs. It is the eggs that will hold air in the batter, so add them last, and mix as little as possible once they are in the mix.

Just made the Reeses Peanut Butter cup version of this cheesecake and it was delicious!  This cheesecake is creamier than any other cheesecake I've ever made and it was extremely simple to make.  I added a peanut butter chocolate sauce to the top, and instead of using whole Reeses I used the mini ones.  Everyone in my household loved it!

Excellent. I made the chesecake for Easter dinner exactly as described and it was honestly one of the best we've ever eaten, and quite simple. Everyone raved.
I changed the crust (used recipe from Pumpkin Cheesecake II - 3/4 c graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c finely chopped pecans, 2 tbsp granulated sugar, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 c melted butter) which has a great flavor and no need for ladyfingers/heavy foil. Thanks for sharing.

I agree-this is the absolute BEST cheesecake recipe I have ever tried-and everyone who tastes it says the same thing! I like plain cheesecake, so that is how I made it: nice and simple. I have made it 2 weeks in a row now, and need to make 2 next week for Christmas. They both turned out beautiful! Flavor is wonderful, texture is smooth and creamy, very light tasting. I will not be looking for another recipe again! Thank you so much for sharing!

Mmmmmmm, first time I've ever made cheesecake and it turned out flawless!!! So creamy and not too rich. My husbands favorite dessert and I decided to be brave and try to make it, instant classic in our house now! Can't wait to make it again :) One tip, use the extra long foil to wrap springform pan in for the water bath. I used the two strips method and water leaked in the bottom, not a big deal but a little annoying!

WOW! This is now my new standard cheesecake recipe.  Just made a Blueberry version.  Swirled in a few spoonfuls of Blueberry Preserves into the cheesecake batter before baking. Then, after cooling, spread blueberry topping from "White Chocolate Blueberry Cheesecake" on top(Fresh blueberries, water, sugar, corn starch or minute tapioca, and lemon juice).

I made the tiramisu cheesecake.  It was pretty good.  The texture was definitely light and fluffy.  And it actually tasted better the next day. Not an earth shattering recipe, though it won an award on USA Weekend...

"Best Cheesecake Ever!!!"  Everyone who has tried this has said those exact words.  I made almost exactly as the recipe said.  I did leave it in for an extra ten minutes or so because I didn't think i was quite ready.  I also changed water level used in the baine-marie since I didn't have a deep enough pan that my spring-form pan could fit in.  The water was only an 1 inch or so deep but I didn't have any cracks and it baked perfectly.  I also used a pie crust recipe due to personal preference.  Soo yummy, I want to try a chocolate one next!

This is the BEST cheesecake I have ever had!  It is so creamy and fluffy and light and..........pure Heaven.  I did make the lemon one and it is perfect.  I didn't use the ladyfingers; I used animal crackers.  I can't wait to try all the others!  Thanks for a perfect cheesecake recipe.

I made the Reeses cup version and it was good, but not great! I used 1 cup of gluten free cookies for the crust and based off another review, used 1/2 cup plain non fat yogurt instead of the sour cream & heavy whipping cream, which cut almost 100 calories. The base cheesecake was great but I didn't love the peanut butter cups mixed w/the cheesecake (and I love Reeses them on their own). I didn't use a water bath this time but let my eggs & cream cheese sit out much longer than usual & this was my first cheesecake that has not cracked, hooray :) I did cook it for an hour & then left the oven door closed w/the oven off for 10 minutes, then cracked the door for an extra 10 minutes prior to removing the cheesecake

It's in the oven now and looks great. I did not have a big enough roasting pan to create a water bath. So I did what another reviewer suggested and put hot water in a 13 by 9 dish under the cake. crossing my fingers and hoping it does not crack!! I'll update later.

Just shut oven off after about 50min. and the cake is starting to crack. Hopefully the taste will make up for appearance!

Creamier than expected, but very good! The water bath SEEMS more difficult than it actually is and the results are well worth the 2 minutes of preparation. There were NO cracks in my cake. I like that there are fewer ingredients than some recipes and it tastes like the real deal, not like a fluffy cake. Very versatile and could be made with any variety of crusts and toppings. Big hit in my house and I will be making this again!

i made this for Christmas Eve @ my daughter's.  It was a huge hit with all ages!  SO creamy and delish.    The only variation I made was I used graham crackers on the bottom and lady fingers around the outside.  (I couldn't decide which so I did both!)

very creamy and smooth.  I just don't know why I always get cracks in my cheesecakes even though I do a water bath and crack the door open while the cheesecake cools.  Oh, well it tastes awesome! Can't wait to try some of the other variations.

I make cheesecake all the time and I think this is a great base recipe.  My boyfriend wanted a Butterfinger and Reeses cheesecake for his birthday so I used this recipe as a foundation.  For the crust I used the instructions for the crust of the Irish Cream Chocolate Cheesecake that is also found on this website.  You mix 1 1/2 c of chocolate cookie crumbs, 1/3 c of powdered sugar and 1/3 c of coco powder together then stir in 1/4 c melted butter.  Bake for 10 min.  Then I always give mine plenty of time to cool before adding the cheesecake filling.  I use this crust a lot and everyone always raves about it.  For the filling in crushed 5 fun size Butterfinger and cut up 5 Reeses cups.  The cheesecake turned out awesome and my boyfriend said it was the best one yet!

This was my first time ever making cheesecake, and this was delicious!  I made the basic recipe and drizzled chocolate and caramel sauce over it.  I did make a bit more crust.  The only thing is it does need to bake just a little longer.  My husband requested this again for father's day, so I'll try to add an additional 10 minutes to the baking.

This was my first homemade cheesecake. The reese version was awesome.  My guests loved it, and there wasn't a piece left at the end of the party. I did everything per the recipe, but I had to leave it in the oven for an extra 5 minutes b/f I turned the oven off.I also subbed in 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and no one could tell.  Actually, everyone said that it was the creamy-est cheesecake they had ever had.  Next time I will make it with a regular crust.  This recipe pretty much doesn't have a crust.

I have been searching for a cheesecake recipe with this consistency for a long time. I've been trying different recipes and tweaking, etc. Made some good ones but never succeeded in the consistency department. This recipe is absolutely perfectly fantastic. I followed the recipe for plain but omitted a crust because the request in my house has been a no crust, creamy light consistency cheesecake.  I gave this a shot and I will most probably never make another recipe for cheesecake again. This is it for me forever!! I baked as directed in the water bath but left it in the oven after baking for 30 minutes. Perfect! The taste is devine and the consistency is to die for. Exactly what I was looking for. Try this recipe. You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to try the different variations now that I know what the plain cheesecake is like. Thanks for a truly superb recipe. It's a total keeper.

This would have gotten 5 stars if it had been perfect as is. I am going to make a real graham cracker crust with it next time. I will also cook it for a little bit longer. It was still a little... almost pudding-y in consistency. It tasted amazing, though. I'd absolutely give it four-and-a-half stars if I could. We're going to try the Snicker's version for my sister's birthday.

I made this recipe for a party and although it took a bit more time than other cheesecake recipes I've made, it was well worth it.  Every person who tasted it said it was phenomenal! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and cooked it an additional 10-15 minutes.  I also made a graham cracker crust (from scratch, not store bought). To do this I melted a stick of butter, added 32 crushed graham crackers (2.5x 2.5 squares) which I had ground up in my Vitamix, and 3 T white sugar. I then pressed the crust into my 10" springform pan. I baked the crust for about 10 minutes, then let it cool a little before filling it. My only addition to the recipe was to add 1/8 t. lemon extract. I will never bother with another cheesecake recipe again.

Amazing recipe!!! I follow it exactly and it is the cheesecake everyone asks me to make for every occasion. My first couple of trys weren't perfet until I realized how important it is to really get the batter smooth, don't be afraid to mix for a long time it makes all the difference.
Update:
My son asked for. Banana strawberry cheesecake for his birthday so I added 3 mashed bananas and 1 cup sliced fresh strawberries to the batter, it's amazing

This turned out AWESOME!!  My husband is a bit of a cheesecake snob and he said it was the best he had ever tasted.  I did make some adjustments.  I made a thicker crust ( 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1 cup butter and some sugar).  I also baked it for 1 hour...40 minutes was not even close to long enough.  ENJOY!!

I did the lemon variation with ricotta in place of the cream and sour cream. I also added some raspberries to the lemon curd on top. It was great, not too heavy and just sweet enough.

HOLY...this was awesome.  Lovely and creamy, feels lighter than the one I usually make (it ISN'T, at least calorie wise, but we can dream, can't we...?;-)).  I like graham crust so I did a real one, added a teaspoon or two of lemon zest to the batter because...well, lemon...and I neglected to take off its aluminum foil pants before I refrigerated so a bit of water got in and made the crust a tad goopy - won't do that again.  Oops.  I think I might cut the sugar just a bit next time, maybe try 3/4 c, but I topped with sweet strawberries so that may have been what put the sugar hit over the top.  All in all, a FABULOUS, not too fussy, non cracking so really-pretty, super creamy cheesecake - lovely!!

I will make this again.  I did change two things and next time I'll follow the directions for here for one of them.  I used 4 packages of cream cheese. I was going to make a different recipe but changed to this one and the other called for 4 packages.  The second thing that I won't change is that my pan does not fit inside other pans for a water bath so I filled a cast iron pan with about an inch of water and set it on the bottom of the oven.  This worked perfectly for me but YMMV.

Used a crustless version of this recipe to place between 2 layers of carrot cake. It turned out well! I froze the cheesecake till ready to assemble it all. Not a problem.

We loved this cake.  We do like more crust so I used my go to 1 sleeve of gram crackers with 6 tbl of melted unsalted butter and a bit of cinnamon. We made the cake as instructed but used a deep 9 inch cake pan instead of the spring pan.  Pulled some strawberries I had put in the freezer last summer to make the topping and it was all a perfect combo.  Looking forward to making another as soon as freash strawberries are in season with a bit of cream cheese frosting to sit the berries on.  No matter what you like with your cheese cake this is the best cheese cake we ever made.

The cheesecake itself is delicious but don't bother following the crust recipe if you want a graham cracker crust.  I made one from a different recipe and then followed the directions for the cheesecake itself and it came out perfectly. No cracks! It's light and fluffy so if you're looking for dense New York style, this isn't the one.  I'll definitely be making this in the future.

Excellent  base recipe with tremendous possibilities for variations. 

Here's a tip to keep the bottom of your cheesecake nice and dry with no aluminum foil needed for water-bath... 
Just put a couple clean kitchen  towels in the bottom pan and pour hot water on the towels so they become saturated. 
Plenty of moisture for cheese cake but with no water leaking in below. :-)

I've made this several times now and it is delicious. It is great without toppings and even better with. The only thing I do different is that I buy a graham cracker crust instead of making the crust. I usually wind up with batter left that way and I just pour it into a baking dish and eat it without the crust-- it is that good.

So yummy! this is my new go-to cheesecake recipe. Creamy and smooth. I made mine with a pecan crust and topped with fresh blueberries.  I don't know if I am just crazy but I really wanna try some of the variations mentioned in the other reviews and can't find anything....guess I'll just have to wing it

This is my go-to cheesecake recipe. I've made it several times with great success each time. I made it for Valentine's Day this year, adding a 1/4 tsp of strawberry extract and topping it with halves strawberries that looked like little hearts all over the top. The beautiful presentation was nothing compared to the outstanding flavor. i'd give it 20 stars if I could.

This is a great simple cheesecake. I made the basic recipe and it is very creamy, easy, and a perfect base for whatever topping you would like to make- I chose a blueberry sauce. The only change in the filling I made was to add the eggs last (as I do in all cheesecake recipes), to avoid overbeating air into it-causing it to rise and deflate while baking. I did bake it an extra 10 minutes as others have mentioned. The simple taste was sublime and it set up and cut beautifully. It is not very tall, not very tangy, and a bit sweeter than I normally like- but I made it twice in a week (which is saying a lot because I make 28 different kinds of cheesecake), adding some pure almond extract, which my family loves in cheesecakes and making a homemade cherry sauce this time (the canned stuff is so gross). Next time I might try adding a tablespoon or two less sugar so the tangy-ness of the cream cheese can really come through. Finally, I did make a graham cracker crust for it  and am glad I did (11 graham cracker sheets and 3 tablespoons sugar run through the food processor, then 5 tablespoons melted butter drizzled through the feeding tube, scraping it down once-so easy this way. I also prefer crust recipes that tell you how many crackers to use- rather than measurements so nothing is wasted- hate to use boxed pre-ground crackers because they do not taste nearly as good). Thanks- this simple base will be fun to experiment with.

This recipe is Cheesecake Perfection.  Tonight I only had two blocks of cream cheese so adjusted the recipe amounts and baked 42 min in a 7" springform.   Success.

definitely the creamiest, best ever. I used (Kroger) greek yogurt cream cheese and it was loved by all. May even try the addition of a bit of goat cheese next time.

I made the cheesecake portion of this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out really good! It was very creamy, moist and didn't crack.  For the crust, I made a regular recipe of graham cracker crust which is 1 package of graham crackers, finely ground, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter. Mix all 3 together and put in bottom of buttered pan.

I used greek yogurt because I was out of sour cream.  Added lemon zest and swirled in raspberry puree. Absolutely wonderful!

The taste of this recipe is 5 stars.  However, I had to make adjustments.  The crust was too small and I needed to increase my crumb and butter mixture to have a true crust.  The recipe cook time was not long enough, and I had to add an additional 20 minutes.

I did reduce the sugar in 1/2 and added 1/2 cup lemon curd to get the lemon flavor not just on-top-of but also into the cheesecake. I would use this recipe again with these few modifications.

Made this over a dozen times, different flavor every time.  I don't bother with the water in broiler pan step, has never cracked for me yet.  smore was a favourite, used marshmallow sundae topping instead of sour cream, stirred in bits of graham crackers and mini chocolate chips.

I am an experienced cook but not a baker. This is the first time I've ever made cheesecake. I was referred to this recipe by a friend. 

I have eaten very little cheesecake in my life, but I can tell that this is the real thing!!! It is incredible. Creamy, rich, and with all the components that cheesecake should have.

I used a store-bought graham cracker crust (sorry!) and adjusted the recipe so that I only made 2/3 of it. It was full, but not overflowing, when I put the contents into the crust. After baking, the contents flattened (evenly) a bit so that it was perfect. 

I did not do the water bath but did leave the cheesecake in the oven after shutting the oven off, with the door ajar to cool. It took a bit over 40 minutes to cook before the outside was set and the inside only "jiggled" - that is when I shut the oven off. It worked perfectly. 

Four stars instead of five only because there is not enough crust in the original recipe.

The best cheesecake I ever had (until this one) was made by a friend who is sworn to secrecy about the recipe - so I got curious and did various google searches involving ingredients and came up with this recipe. My very first attempt and it came out just perfect, did everything exactly as the recipe states. FAmily now asking for eggnong cheesecake so I will have to figure that out...

This is only the second homemade cheesecake that I have made and since I couldn't remember the other one I decided to try this one cause of all the great comments it received.  It is as easy as everyone says and also WONDERFUL.  My husband usually likes fruit topping on his but since it was the first time making it I wanted to just do the original.  He loved it even without the toppings.  I suggest this to everyone.  Great cheesecake. Thanks  Monessa

This was yummy but I followed the cooking time and my cake was not done in the middle. I will definitely make this again but will look to the reviews for cooking time/temp tips!

This was my first time making cheesecake, and thank God all that effort turned out to be worth it. I used 8 crushed Oreos to make the crust, and everyone agreed it was not enough crust for their taste. I'll try 16 Oreos next time. The cheesecake itself was delicious. I made it plain this time but will try a variation next time.

I did not have a springform pan so I used a 9 inch cake round. I used wax paper cut to fit the bottom and froze the finished cake after cooling to help turn it out of the pan.

It was a really, really yummy cheesecake! I tried the plain variation. It was not too sweet which I really liked and very soft. Not overpowering at all. My only complaint is that the middle was not quite cooked all the way. Not quite firm. I left it in for a little longer in both instances (cooking with stove door closed, and opened, for a total of an extra 10 mins or so.). Next time I will be sure to leave it in for a little longer still. Other than that, perfect. And I love that there are recipes for flavour variations!

I usually don't cook except for the holidays.  My husband loves cheesecake.  About a year ago I decided to use this recipe and make him a cheesecake.  OMG!  It turned out perfect!  I read the comments and adjusted the graham crust and cook time.  Now I make this cheesecake for all occasions.  Thank you.

I'm super impatient with baking, so I bought the keebler ready made pie crust from Ralphs. I bought the 10 inch instead of the 9 since they are not as deep as a springfoam pan. The only changes I made was adding 1/2 ts salt and subtracted 1 ts of vanilla extract. I hate it when you can catch that vanilla extract bitterness if you add to much. Any one know what I'm talking about? I also didnt wait til anything was at room temprature, and just threw everything in at the same time and started to blend it all together. Yea... I'm that impatient. There were tiny chunks of cream cheese in the batter still when I threw it in the oven, but after 50 minutes at 325 degrees the cheese cake came out perfect with no crack. I also didnt do the water bath but did leave the door ajar for 20 minutes before throwing it in the fridge. This is the second time I'm making this reciepe, and love that its so simple and not sensitive. I top it off with Smuckers strawberry jam. My husband loves it, and he thinks eating is a chore.

Excellent cheesecake--I followed everything exactly, including the lack of crust, and it turned out amazing.  Not entirely smooth, but that was my fault as an inexperienced baker.  Regardless, my husband ate half of the entire cake in one night!  Delicious!

This is absolutely the best cheesecake ever! My husband practically OD's on it. I want to try some of the variations but he won't let me, he thinks the cheesecake is best in its pure form. It does come out better with Philadelphia Cream Cheese but when I'm short on cash I use 2 generic and one brand name. I use a regular graham cracker crust, if you use that you don't need the spring form pan. Any way you fix it the filling is wonderful. Baking it in the water bath is very important to get the cheesecake baked evenly.

I am just in the process of making a version of this recipe.  I omitted the crust, and substituted the lemon zest for the vanilla flavor.  I was not sure what temperature to bake it, so I did 325 on convention.  I love the creaminess factor and it sounds like it would not be "too sweet".  Looking forward to tasting it.  If some knows the temp, please let me know!

It's been years since I have made a cheesecake and was a bit nervous to even attempt it but this recipe came out absolutely perfect!  It set firm on the outside with no cracks and was a very rich, creamy center. I used a basic graham cracker crust instead of lady fingers and then made the recipe for Perfect Lemon Curd to use as a topping for our son's birthday and everyone loved it.  I already am anxious to make it again and try some of the flavor variations.
