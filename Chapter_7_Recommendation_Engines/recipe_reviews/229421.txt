I made this into an adult cocktail by adding a healthy jigger of Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. Very good.

Well, this is a simple recipe, but a delicious one nonetheless.  And, really, I wasn't even thinking of using a candy bar when I was looking for a hot chocolate recipe, so I thought it was a great idea.  I used 3 fun sized Hershey bars to make it extra chocolately.  Also, I just heated it up in the microwave to avoid washing more dishes.  I just heated, stirred and repeated until hot.  Topped with marshmallows.  Perfect for a chilly Fall day :)

Quick recipe with very little measuring. Even with a 1.45 oz Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds Bar it came out good (removed the almonds). It would of course taste better with quality chocolate, but this is a good way to use up the nasty Hershey's chocolate that my family won't eat.

Rich and creamy. I used part dark and part milk chocolate bar. Topped with whipped cream. Tastes special and is easy to make in the microwave. Whisk frequently.

I wanted some luscious hot chocolate (not the instant stuff), but all I had on hand was a Hershey's chocolate bar. Oh my! That was good! Will do again :)

I had to make this because it was different the typical hot chocolate recipe. I used some beligian milk chocolate from Trader Joe's and after it was melted and mixed, I frothed the hot chocolate with my espresso machine. I would make this again!

We received dark chocolate bars as a Christmas gift, and no one in our family liked them because they were very bitter. I found this recipe and chopped the bars up. I added milk chocolate chips and whisked with the milk as described. Wow! It was really easy and tasted rich and creamy.

Pretty great, and really fast, and easy. Would've been better if I had used better chocolate. Add an extra bar of chocolate if you like your hot chocolate to be extra thick.

Very rich and delicious. I do like the pinch of cinnamon.  I used Lindt milk chocolate and it was smooth!
