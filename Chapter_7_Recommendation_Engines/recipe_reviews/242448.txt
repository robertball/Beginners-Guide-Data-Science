I liked this as was something I had not thought to make before. I love one pot dishes. I am not a big fan of eggplant and just could not bring myself to put eggplant in at all. It may have changed the overall dish/taste but it suited me and the family better.

I make this in my Instant Pot cooking for 10 minutes on high pressure after sautéing all vegetables and garlic in sauté mode. I used basil and garlic pasta sauce with the addition of sliced olives and a splash of sherry. I had no fresh basil but used fresh thyme and oregano.
