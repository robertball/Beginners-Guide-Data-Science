I added chopped zucchini and one less red pepper; and a can of diced tomato, along with some seasoning. Sprinkled with cheese upon serving. Quick easy dish, a little dry even with the extra tomato. Used Dreamfield Pasta to lower carbs.

This dish is great for a simple weeknight meal. I only ended up using 1 16-ounce box of pasta and it was plenty.

This is delicious -- WITH the addition of a can of diced tomatoes with seasoning, as this is very dry.  I made this with about 1/3 of the penne pasta, but followed the recipe for everything else and it was still dry.  I put generous parmesan cheese on top.  YUM!!

Yummy!  Used whole wheat penne, then added white wine and parmesan, based on Ann's recommendation.  Also added some italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes at the end (my husband loves spicy foods), to add some zest!  Would be great paired with a green salad.  Easy and inexpensvie weeknight meal.

Easy and tastes great! I did change it up a little. 

I used bow tie pasta, added small zucchini,  small can minced tomatoes and small tomato sauce so it would be a little more moist. 

Have made many times as it is now a favorite in this house.

Great combination of flavors and we all enjoyed it!  I think that it needs a little bit more sauce.

This was a big hit with the family,  especially the kids.  Nice light meal for something a little different but flavorful.  The reviews all mentioned the pasta being dry so the only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the last few minutes of the simmer.  Worked perfectly and not dry at all.  I used a box of bowties because that was what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again.

I really liked this!  Yes, the recipe as posted makes 24 servings so some adjustments were needed. I used 3 peppers (orange, red, yellow) just to make it prettier.  I used a whole box of pasta but it was probably a little too much.  I also used a whole package of sausage. LOVED the sausage! I wasn't too sure about it since I had never heard of it before finding this recipe, But it was AMAZING. I do agree the final dish seemed a little dry, not sure what to add to fix that, but maybe with a little less pasta, the juices that are created while cooking will be enough.

Made this after searching for "chicken apple sausage" as a way to use it. I halved the recipe due to having only one red bell pepper.  I added a splash of white wine during cooking and topped with grated parmesan. I don't have any "Mrs. Dash" type seasonings, so threw in some thyme, parsley, a little oregano and paprika. I used closer to 3 tbs. grapeseed oil (3x what is called for in olive oil for half recipe) but there wasn't enough sauce. Pasta was dry half way through eating. Overall, the dish flavor was good. Very easy and different. Would make again.

came out alright. was browsing and found this recipe for a low sodium meal. all the chicken apple sausages I found in stores were crazy high in sodium so I had to sub in chicken breast chopped up and seasoned. outside of that it was a decent recipe though.

this was a great weeknight recipe I use macaroni noodles because that's what I had. I also did the can of diced tomatoes and I added a can of mushrooms I left the water from the mushrooms go in as well as tomatoes because I could tell that this was going to be a drive-in and then I looked at some of the reviews and they mentioned that it was going to be a dry dish I added a lot of Parmesan cheese and it's great

Who in their right mind would use 3 boxes of pasta? I used 8oz and that was plenty. No one in my house was thrilled with it. A little bland.

Meh. This really needed some different spices ( the garlic Mrs Dash doesn't really work) and it really needs a sauce . Something with enough body to stick to the noodles . It's a good start but it needs a lot of work.

I thought that the noodles were bland. They didn't catch the flavour from the meat because there was no sauce. I might try cooking it with apple sauce as a little extra sauce flavor. It might go well with the apple sausage.

It is very simple to make, but even with only (2) 16oz packages of penne, it was very dry so I added some homemade pesto which I keep in the freezer.  Would not make again unless I added some artichoke hearts.  Could not possibly get all that pasta in a skillet so I had to use the pasta pot.
