These Churros are really good when you do them right but unfortunately, you can't considering the measurings for the mix are wrong. These need to be changed but its easy to tell whether the batter is "uniform" enough if you just add some more mix. Overall though, these tasty deserts are very delicious.

If you follow this recipe it will not turn out & you will have wasted your time & the ingredients. The measurement of water is way too much. I would probably try 1/4 c of water...and then add as I need to. I was really excited about this recipe too bad it didn't work.

If you just follow the way how to coook these this will totally help, what you do is you buy pillsbury crescent rolls, and you take 2 little rolls and you roll then together and twist them out to a long twisty form. then you set it in the oil and cook it and take it out and set it in the mix and it comes out much better. i did this in my high school spanish class

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did think that there was too much water, so I added more baking mix to get a doughy mixture. They tasted great though.

Sorry I hate giving bad reviews but this was terrible. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a mess. It was too wet and when I tried to put them into the oil the dough basically dissolved in it. I ended up giving up on this recipe and found another on here that worked perfectly!

The churros turn out to hard. All recipes I have used before have egg in the recipe. I added and egg and the result was much more pleasant.
