I tried this recipe because I was curious - the banana bread I have made nearly exclusively for decades is much like this recipe, except for the amounts of butter and sour cream being turned around - in other words, in this recipe there is much more sour cream than butter.  That's the only thing I can think of that would account for why this bread just seemed flat to me and didn't have the buttery richness, moistness or depth of flavor I'm accustomed to. Also, this has a more cake-like crumb rather than the more dense crumb normally associated with banana breads.  This is an ordinary, average banana bread that would certainly do in a pinch, but as long as there are better recipes around (like the one I've been using for over 40 years) that won't be necessary.

I cut the sugar by half, I used equal amounts of baking powder and baking soda and I omitted the nuts only because I do not have any right now. I made no other changes. I made muffins out of this recipe. I got 18 muffins out of one recipe. 350* for 20 minutes was just right. In my opinion, the sour cream overpowers the rest of the ingredients. I think this would be better if you cut the sour cream back by a half cup and add another half cup of mashed banana. We liked this okay--it wasn't our favorite but it wasn't terrible, either. I'll try this again with the adjusted sour cream/banana amounts and then update my review.

Would like to know if anyone else had a problem with baking the bread?    Was to much for 9x5 loaf pan and went over and would not bake in the middle. Taste was great.

This is very good.  I made small loaves and then I made one large loaf.  Either way, moist and delicious.

I also had trouble getting this bread to bake in the middle.  It ended up very dark and tough and still did not bake in the middle.

I made this because I have found other recipes just too heavy for me. It turned out so moist and delicious. Everyone I know who has tried thought it was so delicious. 

I left out the nuts and added an extra 1/4 cup of sour cream because I thought it needed more moisture and that only helped! I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Definitely add the sugar/cinnamon mixture to the pan and on top of the bread, it is fabulous. 

I won't be using any other recipe other than this for banana bread it is so fantastic!

I got six loaves of bread out of this recipe!  Four small 3X5 pans and 2 8X4 pans.  Have not tasted it yet but it sure smells good!  Great recipe for gift giving. I did have to bake it much longer than the original recipe called for.  Total time about 1 1/2 hours...small pans about 45 min. at 300 degrees.

This was a pretty good recipe. I usually don't make banana bread with any sour cream, but I decided to try something new. I thought there was a little too much batter for just 1-9x5 pan, so I made 6 muffins with the extra batter. Not the same 'butteriness' I usually enjoy in banana breatd, but the taste was still good!
