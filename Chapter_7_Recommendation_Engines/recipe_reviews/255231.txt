I just made these and my kids are already planning for the next batch! I'm not an adventurous cook so I did the buttermilk substitution (1 1/4 cup) and, since I used a regular sized muffin tin, doubled the cook time (16 min).  I also threw in diced strawberries since they're in season right now.

As poppers, they didn't turn out well (They didn't rise). Maybe because I put a baking sheet under the mini muffin pans.
I had so much batter left over, I made pancakes. They turned out excellent, and I will probably use this recipe as my go to for pancakes.

These are great! So fast and easy, I used buttermilk powder. I made different kinds by adding blueberries, raspberries, mini chocolate chips. I used both mini and regular size muffin tins. My kids ate these right up! We will make these again soon. Thank you

Perfect! I was looking for a recipe to replace buying frozen pancakes and I think these will freeze and be easy to use for the kids breakfast.

Added ghiradelli mini chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed. Needed 9mins to fully bake. Kids loved them but said without chocolate chips they may not be as delicious. ?? These do come out a bit crumbly so next time I’ll try butter vs. oil and more vanilla.

I used  butter milk and thought these were really delicious. When I make them again I think I’d add meat or fruit.

Made with some lemon to supplement lack of full 1/4 vinegar. And mostly whole grain flour. Only rose to mostly done at 8 min. The centers needed more time, more like muffins do. Pancakes were good, though!
