For special occasions I will certainly make this again. Note you should not take this to a gathering with recovering alcoholics. My family loved it and kept the leftovers so i don't know how the fruit kept overnight. We did drain the leftovers though. I did not have fresh peaches so I used canned. They were fine. I also bought a cheaper Orange liqueur because the brand mentioned was too expensive. Thank you for this recipe. It is a keeper.

This is a lovely indulgence for a dieter. The triple sec (Cointreau generic) is subtle but delicious. I used fresh pineapple chunks mango cantaloupe strawberries blueberries a pear a kiwi and canned mandarin oranges to give this dessert a beautiful spring color array.

I really like the "punch" of Cointreau in this dressing. It adds a certain "something" that really takes this fruit salad out of the ordinary. I didn't have kiwis and they would be a beautiful addition for the next time. We love fruit salad so I'm happy to have another way to serve it. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for our 4th of July gathering and called it Adult fruit salad! Everyone loved it! Everyone's bowl was drained and in fact several guests asked if they could have straws to put in the fruit salad dish to suck out the juice! This will be my go-to recipe for special occasion fruit from now on.
