I made this recipe for a potluck at work, and it was a hit.  A few things I tweeked with this recipe:  I made the vinaigrette the night before, using a hand blender to really get things combined. I used a combination of white wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar.  I used Splenda instead of sugar (1-2 packets).  I also added 1 t. of grated parmesan cheese to the vinaigrette.  The next day I roasted 3 oz. of pine nuts.  I combined the tomatoes and vinaigrette about 2 hours before serving, letting it sit out at room temperature.  Just before serving, I added the roasted pine nuts and some shredded parmesan cheese.  It looked really pretty in a white casserole dish.  I’m making it again tonight, for my family and guests.  It’s a great way to enjoy (and use up!) those cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden.

This is a delicious recipe.  I have made it many times and served it to many people and they all wanted the recipe.  I would not change one ingredient from the original recipe.

I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and brown sugar instead of white sugar. Pretty good. The longer it sits, the better it is. This would make a great bruschetta. Next time, I might try this with balsamic instead of cider vinegar--I think I might like that a little better.

Even though my husband has a slight allergy to tomatoes, he still enjoys them from time to time.  I did make a few changes to this recipe but in my opinion, it only enhanced the flavor.  I only used about 1 cup of tomatoes and about 3 Tbls of olive oil rather than vegetable oil. I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider and left out the sugar.  Finally, right before I served this, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese over and mixed it well.  This gave it an outstanding flavor and I will certainly make it again with these changes.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good tomato salad that makes a quick and easy side dish.  I cut it down to two servings and added a little minced garlic to the mix along with a bit more sugar.

Sorry, but this just didn't really do it for me.  I've had much better marinated tomatoes.  And if I tweaked it to the degree many people did, I'd say they just changed it into one of those better recipes I've made.

A little too tart for the kids.  Perhaps try a sweeter vinegar next time - - like balsamic?

I cut recipe in half and was too vinegary tasting. Next time i will try omitting the sugar and using basalmic vinegar instead.  But a great idea for a quick and easy side dish.

This is a wonderful receipe for tha abundance of cherry tomatoes that are around at this time of year.  I used olive oil and added shredded parmesan cheese at the end. Everyone thought it was great

This was pretty good - it was a great way to use up some cherry tomatoes from the garden.  Next time, I think I'll use olive oil and a different favored vinegar just for something different.

I didn't find a recipe like I wanted so I modified this one a lot.  I used 2 medium vine ripe tomatoes, half an English cucumber, half a green bell pepper and a quarter while onion (wish I'd had red).  I used the same amount of herbs, a little less salt and sugar.  I only used half the vinegar and oil called for.  This was just what I was looking for.  I cut the veggies a little too small I think (about 1/2 dice) because they lost a lot of their crunch.  But I've eaten it all and want to get more veggie to do it again.

Made this recipe for my husband since he is the "tomato eater" of the family.  He didn't seem to like it very well..had to throw out just about all of it.  I think the vinegar might have made it too "strong".

A nice flavorful salad. I used regular tomatoes. Use olive oil rather than vegetable - it adds great flavor.

I used olive oil (instead of vegetable oil, and balsamic vinegar (in place of cider vinegar). I like to poke my fork tines in the tomatoes first to make sure the marinade gets inside. Marinated 4 hours in tight cover plastic bowl. Everytime I opened the fridge, I flipped to coat the other side. Adding feta before serving is the finishing touch. I also serve this for company (something different instead of salad). Yummy!

I was looking for something fresh and light tasting this evening for a side dish. The kids came back from the garden with a TON of fresh tomatoes (cherry, grape, heirloom, etc..) to use up. This is the recipe that we picked to use all of those tomatoes and everyone was very pleased. The combination of herbs/flavors is perfect. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe.  I make it a lot though I usually double the recipe (my family eats it quickly though I eat most of it).  I recommended this to one of my friends and she liked it.

Good marinade.  I used 2T apple cider vinegar and 1T balsamic because that's what I had on hand and it worked well.  Put these over Italian Sausage, Peppers and Onion recipe from this site (with crusty french rolls from here too) and whole family LOVED it!

I used more tomatoes than four cups,olive oil, and used fresh herbs to taste which turned out to be quit a bit. I'm making it a second time this week for a potluck. Skipped the sugar as well as I thought it didn't seem right with fresh sweet garden tomatoes.

This was excellent and very easy.  I did add pea sized fresh mozarella to the tomatoes and it was an excellent addition as it countered all the sweetness of the tomatoes.  I will definitely make it again.

I used half vegetable oil and half extra virgin olive oil.  I tried it the original way, and it just tastes better after this change.

Also, I had both cherry and roma tomatoes from my garden to use up, so I put roma slices in with the cherry halves.  It worked superbly.

I can also imagine using this salad as a bruschetta starter.

This is a very easy and tasty salad.  Flavor is not too strong or sweet and doesn't detract from the tomatos natural flavor.

Simple recipe with a million variations. I use fresh herbs from my garden and that right there makes a world of difference in a recipe. I also only use a drizzle of oil and usually balsamic vinegar. But thats the great thing is you can use whatever kind of vinegar you have a taste for at that time. One thing I ALWAYS add though is Feta cheese. It is such a light and tasty salad and is a perfect use for my many cherry tomatoes!

After reading the reviews I did sub a few ingred. and it turned out very well;. balsamac vinegar instead of cider, olive oil instead of vegt oil. I  let the salad sit for a long time and stirred gently. I believe the longer it sits the better. We loved it!

I agree about switching the vinegar for balsamic, I only used 2 T. Also, I added fresh mozarella (cherry tomato size) and it turned out great. A slightly sweet but delicious caprese salad.

Yum! I went a little easy on the oil used fresh parsley, and added lots of black pepper. The vinegar taste is strong at first but really mellows as the salad sits and blends. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a small party I was coordinating and it was very good. I ended up making it at home for my husband. I used extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar instead. And fresh mozzerella cubed. Also when I made it at home I added some cut up cucumbers. It was great and just added a good crunch.

I also swapped balsamic for regular vinegar and olive oil for vegetable oil.  I added a little dijon mustard as well.  I wasn't a fan of all the dried herbs, but the dressing with yellow and red tomatoes was tasty!

I love this recipe!  I doubled it and brought it to a pot-luck lunch and it disappeared.  I will make it again for sure.  I think it might be nice to mix it as is with cooked pasta to make pasta salad that is a little different from the traditional mayonnaise version.  Anyway, thanks for the great recipe!

I enjoyed eating this for a summer lunch but why compromise for dried herbs? This salad would taste much better with fresh basil and oregano! I'd also cut back on oil: 1 tbsp seems more than enough.

Excellent and easy- I've made this salad quite a few times.  After marinating the tomatoes, I like to serve it on a platter of romaine leaves and sprinkle with grated parm. Everyone loves it and it's healthy!

Refreshing. I used red wine vinegar & balsamic vinegar instead as I don't have cider vinegar and olive oil instead. Easy to whip up and a good use of an abundance if cherry tomatoes!

Very good! I actually found that I liked it better room temperature, just after preparing, than I did after it had marinated and chilled. Great way to use up all those buggers from the garden. Thanks! :)

Every time I've made this, I swear it's better!  Discovered this recipe months ago and my hubby and I have had it at least once a week since.  SO good!!  I tried it once using fresh herbs - not nearly as good.  I do like to use seasoned rice vinegar, though.

I omitted the parsley, used olive oil and fresh basil. It was good but I liked it better the second time when I made it with white balsamic vinegar. Served with romaine and a sprinkle of Parmesan.

I served this at our Labor Day cookout and got rave reviews. I used fresh heritage cherry tomatoes from our garden, finely diced red onion, fresh basil, dried oregano and parsley, extra virgin olive oil in less than the amount called for, cider vinegar, salt, a little sugar and the black and green olives from another tomato salad recipe on this site. So simple, but tasty and healthy!

I've made this twice already because the neighbor brings over homemade cherry tomatoes all of the time. The first time I used the cider, and we just didn't like it. The 2nd time, I decided to take advice, and use red wine vinegar, which made this taste a whole lot better! I'll make again, but use the red wine vinegar instead. Sorry!

Great use of cherry tomatoes.  The one change I made with this recipe was to use olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  I made this up in the morning and stirred it several times during the day.  By dinner time the tomatoes were well marinated and delicious.  I will be making this again when my homegrown tomatoes are ready.

Good, but it's "great" with a few tweaks. Like a lot of folks, I used extra virgin olive oil (use as good of an EVOO as you can afford, because a good quality EVOO really brings out the lovely summer flavors in this salad). I also used balsamic vinegar instead of cider (I used a white balsamic vinegar). I used heirloom tomatoes, so I had yellow, orange and red, which was really pretty. I didn't use the dried herbs, but used fresh basil, and did not add any sugar because of the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar. It was outstanding!

I just don't really like the dry herbs and the vinegar. It just overwhelmed the tomatoes. Plus I used EVOO so maybe that was it? Just didnt do it for me.

I love this recipe.  Simple and great for the summer months.  It has just a hint of sweetness and bite.  You have to let it marinate.  I use both red and yellow cherry tomatoes grown from my garden.

This is not only a delicious way to use tomatoes, but also a good way to make use of fresh herbs from the garden.  I used fresh parsley and also fresh dill.  Served the tomatoes and extra dressing over a bed of leaf lettuce.

I like this recipe as written, but I like the marinade even better as a salad dressing on a fresh green salad. It's a hit with my family and friends and really easy to make.

We really didn't like this at all. It was too oily and the dried herbs made for a bad consistency. I won't try it again.

I made this tonight, with some modifications. I didn't have enough cherry tomatoes, so I thinly sliced some romas and added them. I used a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and about a tablespoon and a half of the apple cider vinegar. I also added some small chunks of blue cheese. It was really good, and my husband liked it a lot.

Pretty as a picture, and delicious too!  The marinade adds just the right touch of zing without overpowering the tomatoes.  This was a perfect way to use up the abundance of cherry tomatoes I have growing in my garden right now.  I followed the recipe to a tee, but used extra-virgin olive oil & added a few turns of fresh cracked black pepper.  Yum.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! This one of my favorites now.  I used grape tomatoes in stead of cherry and added a clove of garlic, 1 tlb. of parmesan cheese and used rice wine vinegar.

Very Yummy and simple!! I used red wine vingear bec thats all I had. This is really the perfect blend of spices for tomatos and I think the sugar helped out a whole bunch. Cant wait to make this when my tomatoes come. Yay!

I had some really pretty little heirloom tomatoes that I needed to use and this was perfect. Only changes I made were that I used olive oil and balsamic vinegar, oh and fresh parsley. Turned out very nice and really pretty.

This deserves 5 stars!  The only changes I made was to sub fresh herbs for the dried as well as halved the salt.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T!  This was so fresh a flavorful - I could eat this all summer long.  Great side dish and super snack.  Also I was a little leary about adding the sugar b/c cherry tomatoes tend to sweet on their own but I'm glad that I did!  It was sweet tart and salty all at the same time.  Super recipe!

I made this for company that came over and it was fabulous! I cut tiny mozzarella squares to it as well which made it even better. I taste tested it when I finished it, put it in the fridge for 2 hours then tasted it again....marinated it makes all the difference!I also changed the sugar to splenda, used apple cider vinegar (cause I was out of the cider vinegar and a touch of black pepper.Worked out very well.

Quick, easy and from what I hear...yummy! (I hate tomatoes) I had an abundance of Juliet tomatoes (grape/roma hybrid) and a potluck to go to. I quadrupled the recipe, used olive oil and red wine vinegar. It was a very pretty, summery dish! Thanks.

Yes we will make this again. I did change to suit our eating habit. First I replaced vegetable oil with EVO, add two cloves of minced garlic, finely diced red onion and served with sliced cucumber. Had this as a side with pizza last nite. It was five star all the way.

followed directions from Anne Cassens

(She made this recipe for a potluck at work.)  A few things she changed with the recipe... She made the vinaigrette the night before, using a hand blender to really get things combined. Then used a combination of white wine vinegar & balsamic vinegar. Used Splenda instead of sugar (1-2 packets). Also added 1 tsp. of grated Parmesan cheese to the vinaigrette. The next day she roasted 3 oz. of pine nuts. Combined the tomatoes & vinaigrette @2 hours before serving, letting it sit out at room temperature. Just before serving, she added the roasted pine nuts & some shredded Parmesan cheese. It looked really "pretty" in a white casserole dish.

I made a few changes.... #1- I roasted on a grill the tomatoes in aluminum foil with the mentioned herbs for 15 to 18 minutes. #2- Substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil. The taste was very pleasurable and intense and my guest where surprised. I had some Romano cheese in a bowl if  anyone wanted to add to the tomatoes. I also included some garlic bread which was an extra add-on as a side dish. Very spicy and delicious.......

Added chopped Italian parsley, used olive oil and white wine vinegar, then served over some torn leaf lettuce for a light and lovely little salad. Served with scrambled eggs made with parmesan cheese for a light Sunday lunch. Tasty.

This is so good, it got my 3 year old to eat tomatoes.  I have tried it with the apple cider vinegar and balsamic.  When I use balsamic I don't add sugar. It's good with both though. And besides substituting balsamic I follow the recipe exactly.

This is better than just plain sliced cherry tomatoes but it isn't so special I would make it again.

This was really a nice way to use up an overabundance of cherry tomatoes I found myself with this year.  I’m going to use fresh herbs next time and also add mini mozzarella balls for a nice marinated Caprese salad.  Thanks for sharing.

Very Good!  I used Beefsteak tomatoes cubed (that's all I had), olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and rice vinegar (did't have the cider vinegar).  I also left out the sugar, as the rice vinegar is sweet.  Great summer salad, but would be good any time you can get GOOD tomatoes.

Did not have dried parsley but used fresh from the garden and subbed olive oil, other than that did not change anything. This was a fantastic salad and oh so simple, enjoyed very much.

This salad was just ok. It might be my fault, I used supermarket tomatoes instead of home grown ones. I added a couple of sliced cukes to jazz it up a bit but the dressing just isn't very flavorful.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe on this website - this recipe is so simple and so wonderful.  Such a perfect use for all our garden tomatoes this summer.  I adjusted a bit (half red wine vinegar/half balsamic), no oregano, and salt and ground pepper to taste.  Such a hit - will make this again and again!

This was VERY good.  I used raw organic apple cider vinegar, about 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil and kept everything else the same.  We loved it!  My husband who has heartburn and doesn't go for a second helping of tomatoes went for thirds!  Thanks!

Really delicious..

I followed some suggestions by others here. I subbed balsamic vinegar and left out the sugar. I added a clove of garlic.

Will definitely make again.

I just use equal amounts of apple cider vinegar, sugar, and vegetable oil  and it's delicious!  Adding in fresh ribbons of sweet basil, garlic salt and ground pepper gives it an extra boost.  Crumbled feta cheese is the cherry on top!

Excellen! I did not chill because I find tomatoes lose their flavour once chilled but I did let it marinate room temperature.  My husband keeps asking me to make more.

I made this exactly as written except I used balsamic vinegar IPO cider vinegar and used fresh basil and fresh parsley IPO dried.  It was very good and a good way to use up a lot of tomatoes at once.

Tastes great, and so simple. Awesome way to use up all of those extra cherry tomatoes, the only change I made was balsamic vinegar.

I made this but used fresh herbs since they are in my garden right now: 3 tablespoons chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil. I don't grow oregano so I used the teaspoon listed in the recipe.

I substituted fresh parsley and fresh basil for the dried herbs.  So good!  It is fresh, aromatic, and makes a great summer salad.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did different was use dried  oregano because I didn't have fresh on hand. I let the tomatoes marinate for about an hour and a half and they were delicious! Totally refreshing and super quick and easy.

I made this as a side dish to go with stuffed chicken and roasted potatoes. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I made it exactly as written. Next time I may add in some cheese though as others have done.

I made this with a few tweeks such as adding minced garlic and shallots. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I served it for the girls night out with some bread rounds and some cheese to make mini bruschetta. Everyone loved them and I certainly will be making this again!

Made this and served with scallops and angel hair pasta. Flavors get happier with time....day 2 was even better.  Used organIc cherry tomatoes, cider vinegar and EVOO. Did not put in fridge.....tomatoes are best left out.

A little heavy on oregano for me and I would reduce the oil a touch.  I My girls lvoed it.  I added half a cucumber diced to it.
