I over baked it but still delicious.  May not need additional sugar.  Really Sweet.

I happened to have all the ingredients in my pantry and I'm so glad that I made this recipe. It took no time and it was so simple to make. My partner and I ate more than half of it when we pulled it out of the fridge. I'm sure rest will be gone by tomorrow so I will have to make it again!
