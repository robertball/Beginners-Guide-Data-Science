I have made this recipe for 3 years now and everyone loves them.  I've always used vanilla extract instead of the brandy and have used 3/4 a cup of cranberries when I didn't have a cup and they still were delicious and looked nice.  I look forward to making them again for this years office cookie exchange.

I bought some fresh cranberries on sale before thanksgiving.  I didn't want to make cranberry sauce (boring) and I found this recipe.  It calls for dried cranberries, I used the fresh, I rinsed them and put them in a glass dish on 250 degrees for 5-10 mins to soften them up.  Then I folded them carefully into the dough right at the end!!  I took them for thankgsgiving, they were gone before anyone even sat down to dinner.  The cranberries popped open in your mouth.  Absolutely the best cookie I've ever made or eaten!!!

One of my favorite cookies!  Only a few alterations and comments:  You must use brandy or other alternative (Capt Morgan would be good too, as one reviewer suggested). It makes it special.  I always double to recipe and decrease the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup of both white and brown sugars.  I also use margerine (I Can't Believe its Not Butter)and add a box of Cheesecake flavored pudding.  Cook as Diane suggested, just until barely brown and leave on the cookie tray (I use stoneware) for 3-5 minutes.  They will be scrumptious!  I cannot tell you if they are dry the next day, as some suggest b/c ours never last that long!  BTW, the dough freezes beautifully.  I just drop it onto a cookie sheet with my "scoop" and freeze it.  When baking the frozen ones, put them on the cookie sheet when you preheat the oven and they will be ready to bake when the oven is ready.

Wonderful Christmas cookies with just a few modifications.  Since I hate it when cookies spread too thin (I feeled like I've failed somehow), I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening - still delicious! Used just a little less sugar - 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and did not grease the cookie sheets which keeps them from spreading too much. I ended up with beautifully rounded, chunky cookies chock-full of crunchy, chewy, creamy bits - yum. 8 minutes baking and no more.

I formatted this recipe for cookies in a jar for Christmas.  They looked so pretty being that 2 of the ingred. were red and white.  I layered the jar as follows: 1/2 c. brown sugar (well packed & pressed down into the jar), 1/2 c. sugar, 1-1/2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 3/4 c. white choc. chips, & 1 c. dried cranberries.  As long as you are consistant using the exact ingred. and slightly pounding the bottom of the jar on the counter, all the ingred. fit perfect into a quart size jar. Also, I found that using a hand made funnel out of paper helped a lot.  I added a pretty Christmas fabric to the top and made a little recipe card that I tied to the outside of the jar: 1.	Empty cookie mix into large mixing bowl.  Use your hands to thoroughly blend mix. 2.Add:  ½ cup butter, very soft; 1 egg, slightly beaten; 1 Tbsp. brandy.
3. Mix until completely blended.  You will need to finish mixing with your hands. 4. Shape into walnut sized balls.  Place 2” apart on sprayed baking sheet. 5. Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 mins. in preheated oven.  Remove to racks to cool. Makes 2 dozen.
I enjoyed putting these together and giving them as gifts.  I received such wonderful responses from the receivers and the ones that have made the cookies.

These cookies taste great!! Not too sweet, but not bland at all. The white chocolate gave it sweetness but not too much. I did make the following changes though: (1)Added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white (2)I rolled the dough into balls and flattened them a bit before baking, if you don't flatten them they will keep their shape and turn cake-like and (3)I baked them at 350 degrees for 9 minutes. These cookies came out perfect and they were SO easy to make!

These were delicious!!!!  Loved at both work and home.  I had a hard time keeping away from them.  The recipe doesn't make too many so I'd advise at least doubling or tripling the recipe.  Also, I found that they held together better by pressing into balls before putting them on the cookie sheet.  Simply doing a dropped spoonful made them too loose after baking.

These are a yummy treat which we all loved.  I used vanilla instead of brandy and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  I also doubled the recipe as others had suggested and I'm very glad I did.  These will have to be hidden if I want to keep them until Christmas!

What can I say?  I've now found a family tradition that I will make for Thanksgiving and Christmas forever!  This recipe is delicious.  Like others, I used vanilla extract instead of the brandy and the cookies are heavenly.  My whole family and my whole extended family couldn't get enough of these cookies.  I was so proud of them, I made up cookie gifts for my neighbors :)  I truly believe this cookie is one fo the best cookies I ever tasted.  I used dried sweetened cranberries.  I couldn't find any dried cranberries that weren't sweetned (don't really know for sure if there is such a thing anyway),  but I will make sure I get the same kind of cranberries next time as well. I don't want to change a thing.  
Thank you, for this recipe.  I can't give enough praises for it..

I found this recipe by accident, and I am so glad that I did.  It's a wonderfully unique holiday cookie!  Nice twist on a traditional cookie dough recipe!  I used vanilla instead of brandy, and used dark brown sugar.  I would also recommend using a good white chocolate chip, like Ghirardelli, and Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries). My son ate a half dozen as soon as I got them out of the oven!

These cookies are really delicious! They are my go-to recipe when I want to make cookies. My favorite combination is to cut down the dried cranberries to 1/2 a cup or 3/4 of a cup, and then to add 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts. They are so delicious. I also use this basic recipe to make chocolate chip cookies, or to add basically anything I want.  A note about this cookie: The first time I made them, they were very cakey... I really like them, and thought they were delicious. They will turn out this way if you let your butter sit out at room temperature and get soft. The second time I made them, I didn't have time to let the butter sit out and soften, so I heated it in the microwave and it was partially melted when I put it into the batter. These cookies spread a lot more, and were much thinner and less cakey. If you prefer your cookies like this, I would melt the butter before making the cookies to get a thinner, less cake-like cookie. If you like cakey cookies, then make sure that you let your butter get to room temperature and don't let it melt!

Scrumptious cookies - perfect for the holidays. I made the dough the night before, the flavors develop while it sits in the fridge. I doubled the recipe, and used half vanilla and half brandy. I also added a pinch of baking powder and  based on the overly sweet feedback I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and about 1/4 cup white sugar per batch. I used a scoop and ended up with nicely shaped slightly rounded cookies that were not flat. The outside texture is lightly crispy and the inside is creamy, smooth. They are like a more adult version of the old chocolate chip classic!

Everybody seemed to like these cookies, but my overall impression was that the after-taste was too sweet.  I used vanilla instead of Brandy because thats what I had on hand. Brandy may have added too the overall flavor of the cookie.  There was nothing bad about the cookie, and they are extremely easy to prepare but consider adding less sugar or fewer cranberries to soften the after-taste.  -----  I am back.  I have made a second batch and they were significatly better.  I used rum, and a tsp of salt and they are perfect.  The sweet after-taste is gone and the cookies are too!

awesome!  followed recipe exactly, except used spiced rum instead of brandy.  YUM! *update*  These were a bit too dry the next day, crumbly. I would not give them as gifts, but they were awesome right out of the oven.

This was a really good recipe.  What made it 5 star for me was the addition of a little orange zest in the second batch.  It really sets off the cranberries.

I made 8 dozen for a cookie exchange, tried drizzling a little melted almond bark on top to dress them up. Added a few chopped pecans I happened to have.
they cooked up harder than I thought they would be and was a little disappointed in the flavor.
BUT:
The ones that stayed home were put in a tin. In a few days they softened some and the flavor came alive, one of the best tasing cookies I've had!

I knew from the get-go that this would not be my kind of cookie, so I waited until Hubs could try them before I reviewed them.  He enjoyed these immensely, remarking on their wonderful collage of flavors; the dried mixed berries I used in place of the cranberries contrasting deliciously with the white chocolate.  For those who like their cookies soft, moist and sweet, this is it.

This recipe is really good! I made it first exactly the way it's written and I did find it was too sweet. THEN I made it following some of the other reviews and LOVED it. 

Only use 1/4 cup of the white sugar. It's still really sweet
AND this is my favorite
I also tried making it with fresh cranberry's and it was divine. The tartness of the fesh berries counters the sweetness and makes it so good. 
I did what another reviewer said and put the cranberries in a baking dish at 250 degrees for 15 mintues to get them soft first. Then I just stuck about 5 or 6 berries in each ball of dough. 

SOOOOO good! Everyone who eat these will love them. Happy Christmas!

These were great! I subbed whiskey and a splash of vanilla for the brandy. I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening to allow for a chewier, less flat cookie.

We followed the recipe exactly and it came out chewy and tasty. Very nice. The next time we made it we added a little too much flour and the cookies did not work. Therefore the morale of the story is follow the directions right down to a tee.

The cookies were very easy to make and they tasted delicious!!! The only thing I did different was to use Vanilla extract instead of brandy as I didn't have it at home.

Yummy.  I cut the white sugar in half, but next time I'll cut it out completely because the dried cranberries and white chocolate are already really sweet.  I also substituted half of the butter with shortening and refrigerated the dough for an hour before baking so that the cookies didn't come out flat.  I rolled the dough into balls and pressed it down a little.  Great texture. After cooling for an hour, they were slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

I made these twice with yogurt butter, vanilla and added chopped walnuts.  The butter I was using made the cookies turn out cake like which isn't a preference of mine for a cookie, but everyone at work (including myself) still loved them.   The 3rd time I made these, I switched to regular butter and used orange extract instead of the brandy/vanilla.  They blew everyone’s socks off!!!  I can’t wait to make these for Thanksgiving.

My husband, children and I stayed in a nice hotel in N.H that served these cookies in the lobby. It was the time I'd ever had a cookie like this and I loved it. The first thing I did when we got back home was to look up a recipe for them on All Recipes. I actually have made these twice. The first time I made them I took the advice of taking them out while still doughy. Unfortunately they were too doughy and didn't transfer without breaking. I also only had whole fresh cranberries that I softened for a few minutes in the oven. Others liked them but I thought they were too tart and too big to be put in a cookie. I just made these again today to use up the left over cranberries. This time I cut the cranberries up, softened in the oven for a bit, added nuts to the cookie mix, and oh my...heaven! Only down side is we can't stop eating them and will surely gain 50 pounds!

This is the second year I made these cookies and it has become and will remain a favorite for us. I did take some of the suggestions of others, I use craisins instead of cranberries, I also use Amaretto (Disaronno) instead of Brandy, and I make a batch with and one without Macadamia nuts. When I add nuts I reduce the craisins to  cup and use  cup of nuts and reduce the chocolate chips to  cup.  I also add the extra tablsp. of milk and I do reduce the white sugar to 1.3 cup.  This year I tried to sub the white sugar with Splenda and they turned out just as great. I use all baking stones, so I take them out of the oven after 10 minutes and let them sit for about 5 minutes before I move them to a cooling rack. Like another reviewer I use a Pampered Chef Medium Scoop which is about 2 tablespoons perfect size.  I make a double batch at a time.
My Family absolutely loves them, I made them for work and everyone raved about it.

My oven hasn't cooled yet and I had to write in..my husband took a 24 or so cookies
I made from this batch and said "Is that all? I suppose we'll have to quadruple the batch
next time." (what does he mean "we"!?) I thought these cookies were very easy an quick
to make. I don't like things too sweet and didn't find them overly sweet at all. I saw all the
reviews and thought this was worth a try. I don't quite understand the handful of negative
reviews..I guess it's a matter of taste. I might try an oatmeal cookie version of this as I got
the craving for a cranberry white chip cookie after having one from that famous lady's cookie
shop at the mall (you all know her name!) I will definitely make these again and the recipe is
a keeper! The variation ideas are great, that is what makes great cooks and recipes. I tested
one cookie on my stoneware baking sheet as they take a time or two to warm up, I don't get
discouraged if they are doughy at first, that is why you always test one cookie out first, that way
you still have the whole bowl left to work with and you don't waste by throwing them out. If it doesn't
work perfect the first time, try it again! Great cookie!!!  :-) Jodie from ND

These were a nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies.  If you substitute 1/4 cup cocoa powder for 1/4 cup of the flour, you end up with a dark chocolate cookie with the red and white of the berries and chocolate showing.  Really yummy!

i altered this a little, I substituted pecans for the white chocolate, used orange liquer for the brandy, added a little orange zest and then melted the white chocolate and drizzled it over the cookies. Yum. I tried the original recipe and was pleased with it, i just tweaked it a little the 2nd time I made it

Diane, thank you for this fabulous recipe. It is now my favorite and I have tried many variations. My favorite is with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, using hazelnet or amaretto liqueur instead of brandy. Even with milk chocolate chips and vanilla, it beats the Toll House recipe.

375 degrees was way too hot! I burned most of the batch and the top was still uncooked, but I turned the temp down and the next batch was better. Next time I will lower to 325. A great cookie for the holidays! I did as other did and used vanilla in lieu of the brandy and they tasted AMAZING!! Thanks for a great recipe... a definite keeper (as long as the oven isn't at 375 for me).

So yummy!  I didn't have brandy, so I did you almond extract ... still delicious!  And I also didn't have white chocolate chips, so I chopped up 4 one ounce Baker's White Chocolate melting squares.

I've never had a white chocolate / cranberry cookie I've really loved, but  I wanted to make something different for Thanksgiving.  Made a trial run of these for Thanksgiving and ...DELICIOUS!  The next time, I will use less white chocolate chips (1/2 c instead 3/4 c as others have suggested) because I too felt it was just TOO sweet.  The craisins got completely lost in all that white chocolate.  Don't even think about omitting the cognac - it REALLY does "make" the recipe!  An awesome alternative to the thousands of pies and fudges around during the holidays and I like the idea of gifting the ingredients in the jars as one reviewer has done.

Very tasty cookies but I think the oven temp of 375 is too high. My cookies were burnt on the edges and still a little raw inside. I added less white choc chips then called for (1/2 cup). But will definitely make again in 350 degree oven.

I am ADDICTED to these cookies!!! Never use brandy, sub vanilla extract and add about a cup each of white chips and cranberries.  Have used almond extract as well with great results.  Chilling the dough for awhile helps with the speading, as well as making them easier to work with.  EXCELLENT cookies!!!

I love this cookie.  I don't use brandy because I don't have it on hand but substitute vanilla instead.  I also add about 1/2 cup of coconut flakes which I think goes great with white chocolate and dried cranberries.  Very yummy!

I tried this for the first time and followed the exact recipe except I used vanilla extract and not brandy. The cookies were excellent.  I baked for exactly 6 minutes.  They were great fresh out the oven but next day seemed a bit dry but still tasty.  I would make these again!! and again.. ;)

Yummy these were good. I'd make them again. Doubled the recipe, used a pampered chef cookie scoop, baked on parchment about 10-11min, really soft and tender. Didnt have brandy used same amount vanilla. Whole bag white chips( alittle more than recipe calls for) used 1 bag of craisins(a little less than recipe cals for).

These cookies tasted great!  I got many compliments on them.  I cut down the white sugar to 1/4 C. as suggested by someone else and substituted vanilla for the brandy.  My dough turned out quite crumbly though, and I had a hard time even getting the spoonfuls to stick together.  Not sure what I did wrong, but they still tasted great!

I planned on trying this recipe for a holiday cookie exchange, and wanted to do a trial run beforehand. I brought them into work and they were gone within an hour and I had several requests for the recipe! Made a few changes based on previous reviews: reduced white sugar to 1/3 c., used Ghirardelli white chocolate bar chopped up, reduced white chocolate to 1/2 c., reduced cranberries to 3/4 c. and added 1/2 c. chopped macadamia nuts. Cooked for exactly 8 min. and they turned out perfect! Will definitely be making these for my cookie exchange, and will probably add them to my cookie collection every year…may try fresh cranberries next time. Thanks-

Absolutely excellent.  I made 5 dozen of these for a cookie exchange at work.  I used Madagascar Vanilla instead of Brandy, it costs a little more but well worth it.  It makes all the difference when making cookies.  Madagascar Vanilla can be found at William-Sonoma or at Cost Plus Imports.  I have lots of ingrediants left over to make more in the next few weeks.

These are great!  I soaked craisins in orange juice (microwaved the mixture to get it hot) while I was mixing the other ingredients, used a teaspoon of vanilla, left out the brandy, and used one tablespoon of hazelnut syrup, the kind you would put in a coffee drink.  Took 9 minutes in my oven.  AWESOME!  Liked them much better than the Selma's cookie of the same type that I have tasted.  Also, I liked that the recipe was only for 2 dozen cookies.  That way, I don't have too many left for myself to gorge on, and also didn't lose my attention span while making them because the process was quick.  Thank you for the recipe!

Mmmmm....  This is a great cookie when looking for a non-chocolate variety.  Everyone loved it!  I used vanilla instead of brandy only because I didn't have brandy on hand.  Note: definately double the recipe... they went very fast!

I was given a recipe similar to this one that called for oats.  I didn't have oats so I made this one instead.  YUM!  My husband and kids LOVE them!   We added macadamia nuts too.  Will be making this recipe again in years to come for the holidays!

Really great. The only change I made was to pour boiling water on the dried cranberries and let them sit for about 5 minutes then drained them thouroughly. No problem with dry cookie dough at all.

I absolutely LOVE these cookies. I've used orange extract instead of brandy. I lessen the sugar as i'm not really fond of sickly sweet cookies. I also added some chopped walnut. My family & neighbors just couldn't get enough of these pretty & yummy cookies. Thank you so much for submitting this.

I gave 5 stars b/c this is a good basic recipe, and I added my own tweak. I have a recipe for Cranberry Bliss bars and REALLY love the candied ginger and orange zest in those. So - I added about 1 TB of minced finely candied ginger (probably could have gone up to 2 TB) and about 1/4 tsp orange zest. I used a good brandy and also added 1/2 tsp vanilla for added depth.  To get thick cookies (I don't like thin ones) I refrigerated for a few hours. Meanwhile, that helped ALL the flavors to develop. The dough tasted richer.  I used a cookie scoop to make a mound, then flattened slightly. Took 10min to bake from being cold dough.  Hint: bake 2 "test cookies" before doing a whole batch so you know how they spread and if they need to be flattened.

Great recipe! I did cut back on the sugar as recommended I doubled the recipe and used 3/4 c brown and 3/4 c white sugar rather than the full 2 cups. I also used fresh cranberries that I put in the oven at 250 degrees for 10 minutes as another reviewer suggested because that is what I had on hand. I also substituted vanilla for the brandy and used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets for easy clean-up. Will definitely make these often. They were a nice soft chewy cookie that looked great too.

I love these cookies. Although I soak the cranberries in cherry brandy overnight, get them good and drunk! ;-)

A new favorite!  The only thing is they were very flat.  The cooking time took some figuring out.  The first batch was brown on the edges and doughy in the middle but even after they cooled they turned out a little under done.  I found the 10 min time worked better.  I used vanilla instead of brandy.  Very sweet cookie.  Next time I will reduce the white chocolate chips and add extra craisins.  Like others suggested there are many variations I would like to try with this recipe including substituting dried cherries for cranberries and making an oatmeal version.  A very unique cookie that I am glad I found.
UPDATE - I JUST MADE THESE FOR CHRISTMAS AS A OATMEAL COOKIE AND THEY ARE MUCH BETTER THIS WAY!

I just made 9 dozen of these for a Christmas cookie exchange and they came out beautifully!  I used 1 pkg of Craisins (which I pre-soaked in warm water to soften) and 1 pkg of white chocolate chips. The only changes I made were that I reduced the amount of white sugar by half and added some salt (I personally like the salty/sweet combo in my baked goods) The cookies came out perfectly! Very tasty..and I am not a big fan of cranberries.  This one is a keeper!

I've made this recipe half a dozen times during this holiday season and they're always a hit. I always get the curious and then satisfied yummy look because it's not a typical cookie flavor combination. I've tweaked it to my liking -- added 1/2 tsp salt (to bring out flavors), 3 tbsp butter (for richness), and 1 tsp vanilla (in addition to the brandy). I chill the dough before I scoop it onto the pans, which I line with parchment paper so they never stick. These are definitely a staple in my Christmas cookie rotation from now on. Thanks!
Update: I didn't have orange zest so instead of brandy I used bacardi O. Orange zest is better, but you still get the hint with the bacardi.

These cookies have an excellent flavor. I followed the recipe to a tee other than reducing the white sugar to 1/4 cup as suggested by other reviewers and adding 1/2tsp almond extract and 1/2tsp vanilla extract instead of the brandy. There turned out perfect. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This cookie is amazing!  My husband told me to leave out the cranberries - which I didn't! - and he thought they were fantastic.  Definitely going into my recipe box!!  (I substituted 1 tsp vanilla for the brandy.)

WOW! 5 stars arent enough for this cookie!! I made 6 dozen of these to take to work for a special lunch and they all disappeared within an hour! I made them again(10 dozen this time) a few days later and passed them out in little care packages for a party, EVERYBODY who eats them demands the recipe for them. A great cookie for special occasions,as they are a bit costly to make.I also replaced dried cherries instead of cranberries for a switch and threw in some almonds in some of them and the flavor was just as good. I used paul mason cognac since it has great flavor instead of the cheaper kinds.

This is probably one of the best cookie recipes out there!  Who knew that a simple recipe of your basic cookie dough plus white chocolate chips and dried cranberries would be this good?  The contrast in flavors and textures was perfect!  Not too sweet, not too tart.  Not too crunchy, not too soft.  Just right.  Definitely something to try when you're bored of making chocolate chip cookies!  I didn't have any brandy on hand, but the vanilla worked fine.  Make sure not to overbake...take them out when it's still kind of doughy like the recipe says.  Everyone that tried my cookies LOVED them!  A warning though...they are surprisingly rich!  It's okay, they'll still disappear lightning quick!  :)

I made this recipe (using vanilla) for a cookie exchange and it was the hit of the party - everyone loved it.  I then made more to pass out at Christmas and I had several people call to tell me they had no intention of sharing with their families - they were keeping them all for themselves. This will definitely be one of my families favorite cookie recipes in the future.

Wasn't sure if I would like these since I'm not a big fan of fruits in cookies or cakes.  But thought I'd try this recipe after the high rating.  And the raters don't lie!  These cookies are great!  I put a little bit of vanilla extract in the mixture as well.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  If you plop these down, the cookies will come out kind of stubby (chewier), but if you want, you can press down on them before baking so that they are a little flatter (a little crispier).  Either way, these are great!

So I just made these cookies and I must say they are fantastic.  My husband and three year old daughter love them and ate 3 as soon as they came out of the oven.  I followed the recipe to a t...except I added a small box of instant French vanilla pudding (but that's because I usually put pudding in my cookies) and I also used vanilla extract since I don't have any brandy on hand.  I also reduced the temp to 350 and used nonstick cookie sheets to avoid having to grease the pans. Yummy! :)  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent twist on chip cookies. Very festive for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Great for anyone who loves cranberries. It would also taste great if you used other chips or other fruit, based on your favs. Next time I am using dark chocolate chips!!

These cookies are really good!!....and VERY sweet!!  

The only substitution I made was vanilla instead of brandy since I didn't have any brandy on hand..and unsalted butter instead of softened butter (my kitchenaid mixer does all the hard work for me!)

I also rolled the dough into balls rather than putting down heaping spoonfuls.

They are delish!

I made these for assorted Christmas cookie bags for my co-workers. My husband says this is his new favorite cookie and he doesn't want me to put these in the bags. I did add extra chips and craisins brand sweetened cranberries. This is a new holiday traditional cookie. Thanks for sharing Diane.

Out of the 9 different cookies I made this Christmas season, these were the biggest hit.  I couldn't get them out of my brother-in-laws hands!! I used the cherry flavored Cranraisins and also vanilla extract instead of rum.  Wow!!

Very tasty and unusual cookie.  These are a good choice when the same old same old gets boring.  The tartness of the cranberries marries very well with the super rich and sweet taste of the white chocolate chips.  Makes a very crunchy cookie which I don't usually like but the texture works very well in this combination.  Also, very pretty to serve to guests.

These were absolutely delicious! I only made a few small changes. I used 1/4 cup unsalted butter and 1/4 cup butter flavored Crisco because I like my cookies a little thicker. I also added 1/8 teaspoon of salt. I also added some chopped pecans and used vanilla instead of brandy. PERFECTION!

These were quite good.  My first batch came out a little on the flat and greasy side, so I stirred a little more flour into the dough and we were good to go!  As a personal preference, I like the oatmeal variety better, but if you do not want oatmeal in yours, this recipe is the one for you!

We are diehard chocolate chip cookie fans in this house. . . I made these cookies and my husband said, "I think these are my favorite cookies you have made!"  I subbed vanilla extract for brandy. Sometimes I sub SmartBalance baking sticks for the butter.  Either way, these are delicious!!  I have made these several times.  I am not sure you can go wrong with the craisin/white chocolate combo.  Thanks!

These are oh-my-goodness delicious!  I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, light margarine, and Appleton rum because I did not have brandy on hand.  I had no issues with spreading, but I rarely do when I use whole wheat flour.

Solid recipe. I really enjoyed the flavors. I followed directions exactly, except substituted vanilla for brandy (used 1tsp). I think next time I might add some coconut or some pecans to give it a bit of texture. I really like this though.

Made these with vanilla instead of brandy. They were ok. I think it's the brown sugar to white sugar ratio that's off. I know that it's not the ingredients I used because I used a high quality white chocolate and craisins which I love. I also agree with another reviewer that they didn't taste that great the first day but was a little better the next day. Maybe tomorrow they'll be GREAT!

Would not make this again--this is the only cookie I have ever made that my husband said "they are OK but not that great."  We have been married 39 years and that is a lot of cookie baking. Something is lacking in the basic dough. Marina Abbott Oshawa ON

Great for a cookie exchange.  I took others suggestions: cut down on sugar, chips, and cranberries.  I also added a pinch of salt and subbed vanilla for brandy.  These will be made again for sure.

These cookies are awesome! But I did tweek it a little becaue of other reviews. First let me say I doubled the recipe (still it only made 35ish cookies rather than 48, but I made them somewhat big...read on...). I only used 3/4 cup of white sugar, 1 and 1/3 cup of cranberries (one bag worth), 1 and 1/4 cup white chocolate chips, instead of 1 cup butter, 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. I also used coconut rum instead of brandy.   I could have managed to add more cranberries and chocolate chips, but didn't want to risk it being too sweet and overfilled. They are still great! I also used wax paper instead of spraying the cookie sheet. Cooked at 375 for 11 minutes (my oven is weird).  Overall, great hit with me!! And hopefully others!

These were delicious!  Very buttery and the cranberries added a nice balance to the white chocolate.  I used Craisins and they were perfect!  This will become staple in my house!

i had never heard of this kind of cookie before my friend told me they were his favorite. when i made them for him from this recipe, i was convinced— i think they're my favorite now, too! i used a packet of vanilla pudding in place of some of the flour and used some vanilla extract in place of some of the brandy (as per the suggestion of others). also, make sure you UNDERBAKE THEM that makes them soft and the softest ones are the best!

we found these cookies were delicious. soft, nice holiday-ish fruity taste, strong chocolate flavor which is rounded out by the brandy. We think that the better the brandy, the better the cookie, since there is a slight hint of brandy overtone in these cookies. If you get Walgrenns brandy, you can expect a Walgreens cookie, so we recommend breaking out the top-shelf liquor when preparing these treats. 

One problem we did encounter, however, was the cooking time. The suggested cooking time of 8-10 minutes wasn't even close. Our cookies turned out oily and half-baked (it should be noted that our pre-cooked volume of dough for each cookie was enough to fill a small shot glass). We recommend a cook time of 14-16 minutes at 375 F. When the cookies browned around the edges and small "dimples" appeared at the top of the cookie, it was time to take them out of the oven. These cookies still retained their soft, chewy texture after this length of time in the oven. 

Overall, a fun and simple recipe which suits the holiday season nicely.

These cookies are amazing!  I used splenda in place of the sugar and used the splenda brown sugar mix for the brown sugar.  They turn out great every time and they never make it past a day or two in this house.

These were excellent just per recipe, I made them once using less sugar and second time using sugar per recipe and both were just as good.  I then tried a twist because I had other stuff on hand, using semi-sweet dark chocolate chips in lieu of the white, 2 tbsp orange juice in lieu of the brandy, the zest of 1 orange and 1/2 cup candied peels in lieu of the cranberries.  Straight out of the oven though, they were a bit of a disappointment, but 12 hours later, OMG these were just amazing.  Both versions freeze very well too!

The only substitute I made was orange extract for the brandy as someone suggested in a previous review. Next time I bake these, I will reduce the white chocolate chips to 1/2 c (as someone else suggested). Very good recipe!

Yummilicious! My hubby is not a big fan of cookies, but he actually liked them and wanted more! But find it too sweet, thus cut the white sugar like some did - reduced from 1/2 to 1/4 cup.

This recipe is exactly the same as the one my American friend gave me a couple of years ago, only it uses some more interesting ingredients. It might be the easiest and, who knows, best recipe for choc chip cookies I found so far. I used only 1/4 cup white sugar with good results, as white choc is quite sweet on it's own. The combination of white chocolate and cranberries is wonderful!

I followed the recipe's recommendation of brandy(actually I made a double batch).  I would definitely recommend the brandy, although it does not add a liquor flavor in the slightest.  Don't shy away from it.  Everyone who tasted the cookies thought they were moist, chewy and great for the holidays.  I will make it again.  Easy to prepare.

I omitted the brand and added vanilla as many suggested.  I thought the cookies were good, but not outstanding.  I thought 1 cup of cranberries was too much for the recipe so I had to half the amount and still thought it was too many.

This is a delicious cookie. I took them to a cookie exchange and the feedback was that it was the tastiest cookie there! I don't think it is the prettiest cookie, however. It is thin and so next time I will try using half of the butter and use shortenting for the other half of the missing butter. Also, I found that I needed to reduce the heat to 350 and cook it a few extra minutes  to get them done in the middle without burning the edges. I had the best success when I baked them on my pizza stone. I added macadamia nuts and they were so yummy!

Awesome cookies!  I made them with and without the brandy and I think the brandy makes them so much better.  They are good without it but awesome with it.

This is one of the best cookie recipes on this site. While I favor chocolate chip cookies with nuts, this cookie makes a festive, original gift and I especially like the cranberry-white chocolate chip combination; it's chewey and delicious. I wrapped a dozen of these cookies up in red cellofane paper and tied the top with a gold bow. It's a pretty, fun, and inexpensive way to let someone know you're thinking of them at Christmas time.

Everyone loved these cookies, which I made with the following changes: -omitted the brandy, but added about 1.5 tsps of vanilla -only used one-third cup of white sugar -added about one-fourth tsp of salt (to cut the sweetness) -added between one-eighth to one-fourth tsp of ginger powder (next time I will add a full one-fourth tsp) -soaked the dried cranberries in boiling hot water for 5-10 mins to plump them up - then drain well pat dry..... I baked them only 8 mins and then took them out while they were still white-ish. They really did firm up a lot while cooling.

This recipe is wonderful and so yummy!  The only change I made was using butter flavor crisco instead of butter, I use that for all of my cookies so they aren't flat.  This is now my absolute favorite cookie; I love the contrast of the sour and sweet.  I made these this past weekend to hand out to fellow co-workers at work, and I have gotten tons of compliments.  I am bringing these cookies with me on Christmas Day...I know they will be a hit.  Thanks Diane for the great recipe!!!

Oh my God, these are good! My hubby usually only eats chocolate chip cookies, but he absolutely loved these, and so did everybody else! I didn't have brandy, so I used Drambuie - I think any liqeur would work great! Take them out before they're real brown and they'll stay chewy for days - YUM.

Do not wait for the holidays to make these cookies.  They are delicious.  My kids even liked them although not as much as the adults I shared them with.  What a wonderful twist to a traditional cookie recipe.

Wow, these were so good! Everyone at my office loved them, as did my mother, my boyfriend, and all my friends! When I made the second batch, I couldn't find dried cranberries, so I used dried cherries, which were just as delicious! GREAT recipe for any time of year! Thanks a bunch!!

These cookies are good.  I used vanilla instead of brandy.  I scooped these with a 1 1/2"-1 3/4" diameter ice cream scoop, baking a dozen of them for 15 minutes on a regular (not air bake) cookie sheet.  Cookies turned out crispy, the way I like them.  I also made some cookies using a smaller scooper, baking for 10 minutes, but I think the larger ones turned out better (harder).  In Hawaii, we prefer our cookies hard  and crunchy rather than chewy.

Love, love, love. However, I double this recipe and add about 3/4 a cup of flour, and 1/2 a tsp. more baking soda than the recipe calls for, just to make them a tad more thick, soft and chewy rather than thin, soft and chewy and a little too crumbly.

The cookie wasn't packed enough for me. Otherwise, the taste is real YUM. I am a BIG white choc FAN. Followed the recipe exactly except for swapping a teaspoon of vanilla extract for the tablespoon of brandy to make it kid-friendly. Baked for 10 minutes at 180*C after preheating at 200*C - my oven doesn't have a 190*C setting! At 10 min, they are browned at the edges and cakey when they are just out of the oven. After cooling 5 minutes on the pan, they settle and show the shape of the choc and cranberry chunks. However, I felt that they spread abit too much for my liking. Next time I will add 1/4 cup more cranberries and choc chips each. I would use whole or half cranberries to make the cookie chunky and use chunky chopped white choc instead of chips. Some other reviewers add nuts, but I'm not a big fan of nuts, so just more of the toppings would suffice for me. 
I'm also considering adding abit of cinnamon or a pinch of nutmeg to add to the christmassy feel. I think it would be great! Oh, I have to confess, I use 1/2 light brown and 1/2 dark brown sugar to get that depth of taste, but with the mix of brown sugars, I could probably use less total sugar.
I'm still on the look out for a good crispy choc chip or any no-nut cookie recipe, if you have one, please let me know!

I didn't have white chips or brandy, so I used 1 tsp of orange extract to make cranberry-orange cookies. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt. They are delicious but I will definitely reduce the sugars to 3/4 cup next time as they are too sweet for me.

Wow, these are very good! Why didn't I make these during the holidays. The only change I made was to use vanilla extract instead of brandy. I can't wait to try it with pecans! Update: As much as we love pecans, it wasn't a tasty combo. Also, I have tried the 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and my husband was not happy to bring them to work...a sweet tooth, I say lol!

I have made these three years in a row.  Using vanilla the cookies are very good, but I've used spiced rum as suggested by a previous reviewer and it takes them up two notches. Definitely try it with a dark liquor such as bourbon or rum if you don't have brandy before you stick with vanilla.

Yum! I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup of each brown and white and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (1 cup white flour). Otherwise, I kept the recipe the same. The cookies are delicious, but I think I will decrease the sugars to 1/4 cup each  next time -- they are almost too sweet!

My cookies didn't come out looking very pretty, but they taste amazing.  I think next time instead of dropping by the spoonful onto the tray, I will roll the dough into little balls and that will probably help them look a little nicer.  But taste-wise, these are wonderful; they are a little chewy and a little crispy in a way that should satisfy both sides of the "how I like my cookies" spectrum.

I made these for my church, and they disappeared so fast! I got a lot of compliments on these chewy, delicious cookies. I substituted the brandy for vanilla extract. I baked the cookies for only 8 minutes (the edges were browning, and there was light browning on top), took them out, then let them sit on the hot cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring. I docked off a star because I thought they were just way too sweet! Maybe instead of 1/2 of a cup of each sugar, only 1/3 of a cup? Maybe I packed the brown sugar too tight? I don't know. Oh, and I was surprised to see no salt in the recipe! I always put salt in my cookie dough, so I did add 1/2 t. of salt. One more thing: I'll be sprinkling in extra cranberries next time. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I doubled the recipe and substituted fresh cranberries for dried as previous reviewers suggested.  They came out slightly greasy, but tasted fantastic!  I will definitely make them again and just not grease the pan next time.

Love these cookies! I brought some into work for a bake sale & they were a big hit. The only things I did differently was to substitute 1 tsp vanilla extract ( I doubled the recipe ) for the 4 Tbls of brandy- only because I didn't happen to have any brandy at the time- and I used fresh cranberries instead of dried. I followed another reviews suggestion to put the cranberries in the oven ( I did mine with a good bit of water in the pan too) at 225-250 for about 15 minutes to soften them up before I chopped them. I think I'll make these part of my holiday cookie assortment this year, Thanks!

What a yummy cookie!  I did cut back slightly on the sugar the second time I made them.  I want to try them with nuts and a sprinkle of orange zest.  Terrific, easy recipe.

A great and easy recipe! I'll be making these again soon. Right now they're sitting in my freezer - away from my husband's sight lines. He'd eat these up in a snap and I need to save them for a party on Friday.

We loved this cookie recipe and couldn't stop eating them! I used whole wheat flour and couldn't taste a difference. I didn't have the brandy on hand but substituted orange extract instead. We didn't find them to overy sweet. They were a delightfully light tasting cookie.

These cookies are really tasty and pretty.  They were easy to make too.  The only thing I did differently was use 1 Tbs vanilla extract in place of the Brandy since I didn't have any.  I will be making these again.

Taste is a 5 but they were not puffy.  The cookies ended up flat, hence the rating of a 4.  I think if making these again I would increase the baking soda or add salt hoping to make them rise more.

These cookies are amazing! the brandy is a great twist. Although, i did reduce the white chocolate chips to 1/2 cup and the cranberries to 3/4 cup. i found the cookies' sweetness overbearing with the original amt. also, soften the butter, but not to room temperature(unless you want to chill the batter while the oven comes to temp.) it will help in the long run- the cookie batter will be less sticky- and will prevent the cookie from spreading too much during baking.

These were amazing! I only made half a batch, to try it out and my sister, my nephew, and I loved them. Now I'm doubling it to take to my family reunion this weekend  and I cannot wait! We didn't have any brandy in the house, and I'm too young to buy any (and didn't feel like answering the questions that would've arisen had i asked someone else to buy it for me), so I used vanilla extract instead.

These were very good! I too substituted the brandy for vanilla. (I think they would be more suited with brandy over the Christmas holiday!) I also omitted the ½ cup white sugar and added a full cup of brown sugar. This step helps the cookies stay chewier longer. 

Minor tweaks, but still a pretty nice cookie!

I'll start by saying that my wife told me that these were the "Best Cookies that I've ever eaten in my ENTIRE life!" Now, I won't tell you how old she is but I will say that she's had time to eat more than a few cookies...enough said. LOL Ok, so this is what I did; I doubled the recipe, cut the sugar by a 1/4 cup each, added 1 1/2 cups of dried cranberries and about a cup of my special honey roasted and salted walnuts (chopped), and added a large box of vanilla pudding mix to the dry mix. I also used a TBSP of vanilla to sub for the brandy. Baked them for 9 minutes at 350 in small batches of small cookies and...(according to my wife) I made the best cookies ever! And, I will make them again, and again, and ... you get the idea. (As a side note, I did everything else that the recipe called for in the doubling.)

Made cookies as written except didn't have brandy so used vanilla. They were awesome! They also looked great. I rolled them into balls and then flattened them slightly with a spoon when I put them into the oven as another reviewer suggested. These will definitely go on our favorites list! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this because I was craving something with white chocolate and cranberries and they turned out great. Even those in my family that don't like cranberries found these delicious! AND my friend's husband requests them to be remade all the time!

Very good recipe! I left out the maple extract, as I do not have any. Substituted with vanilla.  People were right when they said double the recipe! I think next time I will add more cranberries though.

This is a great recipe. I made these for a Christmas family gathering and everyone loved them. However, I made one adjustment (not intentionally). The store was out of white chocolate chips, so I substituted butterscotch chips. It turned out to be a successful experiment (whew!) I took another's advice and baked them for 9 minutes at 350 degrees... Perfect!

Positively delightful!  I substituted vanilla for brandy and added a pinch of salt.  8 minutes on 375 yielded golden brown edges and a gooey center.  Will definitely make again!

These were great! I used kirschwasser brandy, as it's all I had, and it gave a great flavor. They were a hit with friends.

Great tasting cookie.  I threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips just for another added flavor, and they were wonderful.  I used vanilla instead of the brandy (because I don't have brandy).  Great alternative to your typical chocolate chip cookie - love the chewiness that the cranberries add.

Cookies came out perfect! didn't have brandy so substituted with vanilla (wonderful suggestion by other reviewers). substituted butter for shortening and it turned out wonderful! crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, just the way my family likes it.   thank you for this awesome recipe. :D

I don't know what all the hype about this recipe is about. It's not a bad cookie by any means - any homemade cookie is still far better than store bought - but I didn't get the depth of flavor from this recipe that I expected. It is definitely too heavy on the white chocolate, I would cut it down to 1/2 cup next time. Mainly, I think the chocolate chip cookie dough did not work with the rest of the ingredients. Along with the white chocolate, there was altogether too much raw sugar taste. So, is this cookie edible? Certainly. But it's not one that I am dying to have seconds of.

An extremely sweet cookie. It is tasty though. I needed at least 10 min. if not more. I like a little brown on the edges.

these cookies are fantastic! I made them for my family during thanksgiving and they disappeared in less than five minutes. I decided to use 1 tsp of vanilla extract instead of brandy, and it came out perfectly. I will definitely make these again in the future.

I did 1/2 cup cranberries & 1/2 cup walnuts.  Just realized I forgot the brandy (or vanilla for that matter) luckily they were still yum.

Very tasty, the cranberry adds most of the sweetness! The key is to take out the cookies when still doughy vs brown.  I added a handful of macadania nuts to make them even more fancy and it added some extra texture. I bet it would be great with pecans too!

VERY good cookie.  Easy to make.  Lots of variety can be incorporated!!!!  I added more chips and cranberries and also tossed in some sliced almonds.  Be careful NOT to overbake these, take them out and allow to finish cooking a min or two on the cookie sheet.  These were moist and very flavorful.  They are sweet...but not overly that you could not eat them.  I recommend this recipe!

These are sooo yummy!!!  I didn't have any brandy, so I used some triple sec.. though the orange flavor might be a nice addition...and it was!  I am using these in a cookie exchange, and know that they are going to be a hit!  Thanks for a great twist on an old recipe!!

Very good! I doubled this recipe and added 1 c. chopped pecans but I made no other changes. The brandy was a wonderful addition to these cookies. I thought that I might add orange zest to these cookies next time, I think it would be a nice addition. Even my husband remarked how good these were, and he's a professed cookie snob.

Simply the best cookie recipe. I use this every time and they come out perfectly. You can sub the ingredients for normal choc chip cookies and I use vanilla instead of brandy.

I doubled the recipe and added a 3.4oz box of instant cheesecake pudding and used macadamia nuts.  I also used orange flavored cranberries.  I softened the butter and dropped the baking temp to 350 degress and baked longer. These were perfect.  Not cakey at all.  A chewy and soft cookie.  They were not flat at all.  Now keep in mind I ALWAYS do one cookie first to "test" the dough and I hold back about 1/2 cup of flour when ever doing cookies.  The amount of flour I need for cookies fluctuates depending on the moisture of the environment.  It's always easier to add then to take away.  I also added the full 2 cups of cranberries a whole bag of white choc chips.  My family loved this cookie!

The worst cookies I have ever had. Look for a better cookie recipe. To many cranberries, no need to grease the cookie sheets, and the white choc didn't melt the slightest bit  and the bottom of the cookies burned while the tops were well under-done, leading me to believe that the baking temp is also off. Find a better cookie recipe and then add your desired white choc & cranberries. Sure to be better!

These were really good!!  I come from a large family of cranberry growers - and for a dried cranberry I must say I give this recipe props!!  Cooking tip:  I kept my drops of dough "tight" to keep the cookies thick and chewy!!  Also, take them out a tad bit early, let them rest on the cookie sheet and then move to the cooling rack!!  Yummy!!

I made a batch of these as written and it was a disaster.  They ran all over the place and the cooking temp./time was way off.  For the next batch, I wiped the oil off the sheet, added a little baking powder and then baked at 350 for ten or eleven minutes.  They were much better this way, but still too sweet.  I would halve the number of white chips in the next batch.  This recipe needed far too many modifications.

I make these during xmas and everyone loves them! For my mom I make a modification of reducing the white chocolate by 1/2 and substituting macadamia nuts instead since she doesnt like sugar that much but loves nuts. Instead of butter I used margarine. I didnt have brandy so I used vanilla and it turns out great every time!

My husband and I liked these. I used smart balance instead of the butter, cut back slightly on both of the sugars, and used a mixture of orange juice and vanilla extract instead of the brandy.  The consistency was great and they taste really good too!

UPDATE: I just made these again using real butter, and vanilla instead of the brandy, and they are absolutely the best cookies I have ever tasted. AMAZING!!!

I am not sure what happened with this recipe. I followed it with the only exception being vanilla for the brandy. The first set I cooked for 9 minutes like some others said and they ended up thin and crispy. The next set, I only cooked for 6 1/2 minutes like someone said they were too gooey. I love white chocolate and cranberry cookies but these just did not turn out good for me at all. I will keep looking for a great cookie recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I'm usually not one to cheer for the obvious favorite, more of an underdog kind of gal, but sometimes one has to admit their is a reason the favorite is a favorite.  I used spiced rum instead of brandy, semi-sweet chocolate because my boyfriend is allergic to milk, added walnuts...heavenly.  That tiny bit of rum/brandy really gives the cookies a distinct flavor that stands out. I also highly recommend 1/4 cup of walnuts if you're a walnut fan. I mistakenly made these at breakfast time on a Saturday and haven't eaten any "real" food and can't stop eating these cookies.  I mean seriously, what do you follow up cookies for breakfast with?  Cake for lunch it is!

I rated this a 5 for the final product turned out well and people really loved them. I made 10 dozen of these for a cookie swap right before Christmas. At first, coming out of the oven for some reason mine looked very greasy and dark - although not really overbaked. I was a little worried that they weren't turning out well but I had bought the ingredients and wasn't turning back. I made all 10 dozen and after leaving them sit in tupperware overnight, the greasiness was gone and the flavor was awesome! They went over so well and people complimented them quite a bit afterwards.

Very, very good. Made these as part of a holiday cookie tray and they were awesome. I made them a little smaller so they were more bite-sized (with so many cookies to sample I thought it would be good to be a smaller size). They were a hit and I am craving them now. 

I didn't have brandy so I used 1/2 tablespoon vanilla and 1/2 orange juice. 

This will be a new favorite recipe.

I LOVE this recipie.  I've already made it twice and the cookie were moist, chewy, and a HUGE hit with people.  Like other reviewers said, I replaced the Brandy with vanilla.

I also like this recipie because it's simple and you can put ANYTHING in there and the cookies will work.  My son and I are going to make dark chocolate chip cookies with this recipie later today.

DEFINATE keeper.

Great recipe.  I doubled it to make cookies to give as Christmas gifts.  I didn't have any brandy on hand, so I used a dark rum (Myers).  Like other reviewers, I thought it came out too sweet.  I'll definitely repeat this recipe, but next time I'll cut the sugar.

Delicious and easy.  At the suggestion of some other reviewers, I made the following modifications: 1) Cut out the white sugar entirely (they were still perfectly sweet), 2) used rum instead of brandy, 3) used shortening in place of a quarter of the butter to enhance the texture, 4) chilled the dough for an hour before rolling into round balls, and 5) squished the balls down slighly for perfectly shaped cookies.

Next time, I think I'll try adding macadamia nuts.  Mmmm.

I did not like this cookie at all. It had more of a cake rather than a cookie consistency. I reduced the sugar as many of the recipes suggested, because I don't like very sweet cookies. I wish I did not. Anyway, the consistency was more of an issue for me than the sweetness of the cookie. I fixed that with powder sugar. Anyway, I will not be making this again.

One of my favorite cookie recipes. I have made them once with brandy (borrowed from my in-laws), and the other times I use vanilla or rum, seems to work fine.

pretty good!!! I used vanilla in place of the brandy and baked them for about 9 mins, they were very chewy and pretty much were gobbled all up at a family picnic.

These cookies are very good. I didn't have any brandy so i substituded a combination of vanilla and orange extract.  As i always tend to burn my first batch of cookies and i make them a little on the small side, i dropped the cooking temp. to 365 and watched them closely.  They were perfectly done after 6 1/2 minutes.  I will cut back on the sugar a bit next time.

I made these the first time per the recipe and found them to be too sweet as many others did and the cookies spread out too much. Second time around I love them with these changes: add 1/2 t baking soda, reduce white chocolate chips to 1/2 cup, soaked cranberries over night in brandy, add 1 t vanilla, 1/8 t salt. Also from what I played with do NOT try to make these super sized cookies, they won't bake all the way through without spreading out, but two bite sized cookies turn out perfect!

These are now a staple Christmas cookie at our house each year. I have to make a double batch. The only thing I change is that I sub Amaretto for the Brandy.

What a great recipe! I happened to have white chocolate chips and craisins leftover from other recipes and I was going to just use them in the classic tollhouse chocolate chip cookie recipe, but this one worked great! I also added a few touches of my own. I added about 1/4 cup chopped pecans, it was a nice touch! Then after the cookies were done baking I  melted some semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled it over top. It made the cookies look amazing and everyone thought they were store bought!

I didn't think I would like these cookies just because I am not a cranberry fan.  My niece wanted me to bake these so I found this recipe and tried it the other day.  Let's just say that this cookie and recipe will be in my repetoire from now on.  And I would say that this is my new second best favorite cookie.  The taste is very good and the combo of the white chocolate and the cranberry is excellent.  Will definitely make time and time again.  Did not use brandy in my recipe as I do not like alcohol and substituted it for vanilla.  Otherwise I followed the instructions to a T.  Great and thanks for sharing.

These cookies are awesome!! I doubled the recipe, so I added the whole bag of white choc. chips.(About 2 cups)...I would cut down on the cranberries tho, and only had about 3/4 cup per recipe. Overall, great recipe!!!

I use dried cherries or cranberries depedning on my mood (cherries go great in this) Use splenda in place of sugar....I use almond extract instead of brandy, since I would never use the Brandy for anything else. They disappear everytime!

These are absolutely delicious!!  I used Craisins, which are sweetened, so I cut both the sugar amounts in half.  The first time I didn't and they turned out WAY too sweet!  But with this adjustment they were perfect!

Best cookies ever! I made as the recipe called for for Christmas and friends loved them! The real treat came when I subbed in chocolate chips for the white choc. and cran. My husband is a chocolate chip cookie and fanatic and this is the only recipe he wants now. I'm a military spouse and you wouldn't believe how many wives have asked me for this recipe! I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible! The brandy is the key!!

These are great! I subbed almond extract for the brandy. I made two batches. One I cooked for less time, they seemed doughy, and the others I cooked a little longer, until they browned around the edges. the doughy looking ones were better.

I made these vegan style and they were delicious!!! I previously made a batch as the recipe called for and then made a batch with the vegan substitutions and hubby had no idea...he loved them! The only change I made was to use almond extract instead of the brandy. These will definitely be a part of my holiday cookie tins each year. These are soo easy to make and sooo scrumptious that I am sure we will be making them throughout the year!

Very good taste.  The only concern I have is that they stuck here and there.  I do alot of baking and don't know exactly what would have made the cookies do that.  The whole cookie bottom did not stick, weird??

This recipe is perfect as is.  I found that substituting vanilla  makes them too sweet, if you must, cut back on the sugar or the chips. I make these often and they disappear every time.

So good.  I needed more cookies (but not too many), so I changed the servings to 36.  I cut the white sugar back by 1/4 cup, and should have cut back the brown sugar as well, since they are pretty sweet, but so good anyway.  I used part whole wheat pastry flour, and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract- the almond flavor goes very well with white chocolate.  I also threw in 1/2 cup of slivered almonds.  The dough was very thick with the add-ins but not too difficult to handle.  Taking them to a Christmas party tonight so I hope they go over well!

I've made this recipe twice and it has turned out very well both times.  The first I followed the reciple almost exactly, but didn't have any brandy so I used vanilla extract instead.  The second batch I made with chopped pecans instead of white chocolate chips.  If the white chocolate/cranberry combination is a little too sweet for you, this might be a good alternative.

These recipe is another of my favorites on this site. During last Christmas, I made these 3 or 4 times. People are requesting them again for this year, and luckily, I still have some of the brandy I bought! These are a definate 5 star recipe and on my Christmas cookie list. Thanks for the post!

Great recipe, I've made several times. I didn't have brandy so used a combination of amber rum and vanilla, which turned out great. I used white chocoltae chunks. I know "chunks" taste the same as "chips," but I like the look of chunks so they somehow taste better to me!

Answer to wendiwb below regarding your question about flat cookies: don't cream your butter and sugar for too long and make sure your butter is soft, but not melted. Hope that helps.

The first time I made them I used vanilla extract and they were fantastic. The second time I used brandy and added macadamia nuts and they were AMAZING. The different flavors and textures work so well in these cookies. They're my new favorites!!

I had originally intended to drizzle white chocolate over these, but they were VERY sweet.  I chickened out and used vanilla instead of brandy but it still had a great flavor.

These are quite yummy and perfect for the holidays.  I agree with the other reviewers about using less sugar. I made a double batch and cut  back the white sugar by half. I also added salt (1/2 tsp) and wound up using salted butter, since that was all I had on hand. I think this rounded out the taste so they weren't too sweet. I make cookies to give as gifts to a few friends every year, and I think I'm going to have to make a second batch of these because I suspect we're going to eat them all ourselves! Oh yes, I also used brandy and I have to say that added a nice flavor to them. These are definitely a keeper.

These are wonderful!  I used half brandy extract and half vanilla, because I wasn't sure of the conversion and the brandy extract smelled REALLY strong, and they were terrific!

I modified the recipe slightly by adding 1/4 Cup more flour, 1/4 tsp more salt, decreasing the white chocolate chips to 1/2 Cup and increasing the cranberries to 2 Cups; bake 12 minutes.  Very delicious.

These are REALLY good.  I don't normally like white chocolate or dried cranberries, but decided to make it anyway because it had so many great reviews.  I'm glad I did.  This will go into my permanent recipe box.  I used vanilla instead of brandy, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and scaled back the white chocolate to 1/2 cup and it was still plenty sweet.  I used Trader Joes cranberries and it was very good - I didn't even have to plump them up with boiling water as some suggested.  I baked it for 9 minutes.  PERFECT!

Amazing!!!  I doubled the recipe for a party and came home with nothing, except compliments.  I chopped 1 1/2 bars of ghiradelli white chocolate, because I perfer chunks to chips.  I also added 6 oz. chopped Macadamia nuts.  I didn't have brandy; so I used rum like other reviewers suggested.  Thank you Diane for sharing an incredible cookie recipe - my new FAVORITE.

These are awesome! I used a bag of dried cranberries, cherries and blueberries. This combination would make great 4th of July cookies. My supermarket sells tiny bottles of liquor, so now I have enough brandy on hand to make a few more batches. Thanks, Diane, for the great recipe. It's a keeper!!!

I believe this is my favorite cookie. I made five or six batches and passed out in tins to my coworkers and got rave reviews. i also made a couple more batches for christmas eve, we ran out so my neice and i quick made some more, its very simple and quick to make. I used brandy extract instead of the brandy because i had never had brandy before and wasnt sure what to buy. the cookies tasted excellent but this year might try brandy or the rum sounds yummy too.
recommend anyone tries once, youll make again,PROMISE!

I'm in the minority here, we thought these were just average.  The cookie is overly sweet, bland and I found they dried out quickly.

I found this recipe 3 years ago and have made it every christmas since!  Very tasty cookie, with good texture, and the different flavors really blend well together (the tangy cranberry and the white chocolate especially).  I'm making it again this year.

WOW!!! These could quite possibly be the best cookies I've ever tasted. What's better is that they couldn't be easier! I as well made some changes by using 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, 1/2 cup macadamia nuts and 3/4 cup dried cranberries. One thing I would NOT change is substituting vanilla and almond extract for the brandy. In my opinion, the brandy is what makes these special. Great flavor. If I could rate this with 10 stars, I would.

I thought they were quite good, only don't overbake them! Take them out when they are still very white and soggy-looking, they harden up quite a bit when they cool. The 1st batch I made ended up being too crisp, the 2nd one was better. I didn't have any brandy and just used vanilla, although I bet the brandy would have given them a much nicer flavour. Try to purchase very tart cranberries, the ones I used were sweetened and I would have loved to have a bit more of a tart taste to the cookie. But overall very nice.

Took some of the advice from other reviews.  Still found cookies good but not fabulous.  2nd time I would rate them a five.  My alterations:  I used vanilla instead of brandy.  Added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of pecan pieces.  Also pour boiling water on cranberries to plump them up.  Let them sit for five minutes, drain well and pat dry with a paper towel.  Decadent!!

Honestly, this was a last minute decision to make these because I was doing all my baking last night and realized I had a bag of craisons and the white chocolate needed so decided to give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did!!!!  These were the best cookies I think I have recently tried!  My new favorite.  I didn't have any brandy so used a mix of vanilla and cooking sherry instead.  Will add this to my favorites for years to come!  Thanks for a winner!!!!!

I thought these cookies had a good flavor.  They were a little on the sweet side, remember Brandy is pretty sweet and so is white chocolate.  They were good none the less.  I will definately make them again.  I doubled the recipe and used the Pampered Chef Medium Scoop which is about 2 tablespoons I believe, and I got I believe about 60 good size cookies.  My husband said they looked like they were store bought.

Loved this recipe. I like my cookies crisp, so I bakes them a little longer (12-13 minutes), and they came out terrific, just the way we like them. This one is definately a recipe I will make over and over again!

These have an excellent flavor. I chopped up white chocolate bars and added a brandy that I'd had in the cupboard that is a mixture of rum and brandy; otherwise followed the recipe as stated. They kept really well for up to 1 week and had a chewy consistency. The only disappointment was my husband said you expect to bite into a cookie like this and have chocolate...but he didn't complain much as he finished off 2 more! Good addition for the holiday cookie trays.

These cookies are phenominal.  So delicious and so easy to make.  I substituted amaretto for the brandy to give it a slight nuttiness and it was fantastic, also i only bake them for about 7 minutes (so they stay chewy) i've made these twice now and they don't last through the day!!

I made these cookies for my annual Christmas party and they were fantastic! The cranberries and white chocolate taste amazing together. I didn't use the brandy (just because I didn't have any on hand) and substituted vanilla instead. These cookies are my new holiday favorites!

These were okay.  Don't think that I will add them to my Christmas cookie list (unless someone requests them).  I read all of the comments and used the popular recommendations.  My 1st batch ended up a little doughy (even after they cooled).  So, i extended the baking time...still didn't help.  Should I decide to make them again, i think that i will add salt.

I made these for Christmas & they were WAY too sweet for everyone! I ended up throwing most of them out. I added a teas. of salt, as some had suggested, but still, they were too sweet. In all fairness though, I couldn't find the unsweetened cranberries & used the ones that were already sweetened. Any suggestions from anyone as to where the unsweetened ones can be found? I can see where you would certainly need the tartness of those to balance out the flavor.

I made these wonderful cookies after reading how simple it sounded! I have to say they were so easy to make and so delicious! I only used 1/4 c white chocholate chips as I know they tend to be really sweet, and I used 1/2 tb ameretto and 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the brandy.  I also chilled the dough for an hour as cookies tend to come out more uniform if they are chilled slightly. Everyone loved these wonderful treats and I think they are such an easy cookie to experiment with..ie.. adding different ingredients.

These were so so so good!  Totally gourmet and different, with perfect texture.  They are really rich, so one or two with a glass of milk or coffee are definitely enough, but a wonderful cookie!

This cookie is delicious!  I used Craisins in place of the Cranberry's (Craisins are dried, sweetened cranberrys).  I soaked the Craisins in the brandy.  I was also surprised that there was no salt, I added 1/2 tsp. salt.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla.  Awesome, awesome!

A family favourite! Made this tonight, just added a half tbsp of OJ, and vanilla extract in place of brandy. These came out perfect! A beautiful golden crust outer and deliciously moist inside. I did very loosely form the cookies into ‘balls’ but I’m a bit of a nut and wanted to make sure they looked pretty too ;)

My favorite cookie! One change made: use slightly less than 1/2 tbsp orange extract instead of brandy. Gives the cookies that orange cranberry flavor that send them over the top. Love these!

Good cookies! I doubled the recipe, used 3/4 cup each of white and brown sugars, used lower sugar dried cranberries, a whole bag of white chocolate chips, and some roughly chopped pecans. Thank you!

I made them today and they turned out great. My family loved them. I will definitely keep this as a favorite. I didn't have brandy so I used vanilla and I also added 1/2 tsp of salt. They came out soft and still had a mild crisp. I was able to get 3 dz cookies from this recipe.

Not happy with this dough, it was too crumbly and my cookies didn't spread at all.  My guess is there was too much flour, and not enough wet ingredients. Tasted good and got eaten, just less than ideal dough to work with.

WOW....was this a great cookie!!!  Will definitely make again and again.  I didn't have brandy so I used vanilla (as some reviewers said); cookie was still excellent!!  I love chewy cookies so I baked it for only 8 minutes and let it set for a couple of minutes before moving it from the cookie sheet.  The cookies look much better when you roll them into a ball and press them down a tiny bit when you put it on the cookie sheet (I did use butter in the recipe and no greasing of the cookie sheet and it was just fine). May try it with macadamia nuts next time as that may add 'even more' to this great cookie!

Way too sweet as written. If you are going to make this I would advise reducing sugar by half. I read the reviews where some people reduced the sugar down to 3/4 cup but I've found on other  Nothing special.

I made these cookies yesterday. Instead of 1 cup cranberry, I did 1/2 cup cranberry and 1/2 chopped pecans. I also mixed white chocolate with semi sweet milk chocolate. I took away 1 star bc they don't need 10 mins baking time, 7 mins is perfect.

Because the recipe doesn't specify with exactly what type of "spoonful" to drop the batter, I assumed it was a teaspoon and, thusly, got a bit more than 2 dozen cookies (about 32).  I substituted vanilla extract for the brandy because I didn't have any, decreased the amount of cranberries to 3/4 cup, and increased the amount of white chocolate chips to 1 1/4 cups.  They baked for about 13 minutes.  Delicious cookies!  This recipe is a keeper.

YUM!  A big hit in this house! Used just over 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract instead of brandy and let rest for a couple of hours in the fridge before baking, otherwise followed recipe as posted.  Definitely a keeper.

These were very good.  I also used vanilla because I didnt have brandy. I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper. No need to grease them that way. Will make them again!

My son was scrounging through my cabinet and came across a bag of caramel bits and asked if I could bake them in cookies, so I found this recipe and decided to use it as my base.  I did not have the brandy so I used Kahlua, thinking it would go well with caramel.  They turned out great!  The caramel bits are chewy (as caramel tends to be), but good in the cookie.

After winning MasterChef last year I decided to celebrate with the family by backing some delicious biscuits. I came upon this recipe and, having seen many terrific reviews, decided to try it out. However, this recipe is too complicated for anyone who is below michelin star standard baker. I followed the step by step guide, but found words such as 'cream together' very confusing and unclear. 5 minutes after placing in the oven I returned to see the most beautiful and unique looking cookie in the world. However, the texture, flavour and everything else was appalling...I'm extremely disappointed.
I would have added a picture but it failed several times and so I gave up, but you can imagine it's black, gloopy beauty.

I made these cookies on Saturday and they are a winner!  I did use vanilla instead of brandy but that is the only change I made.  Make nice soft cookies and everyone loved them.  I think next time I may put a little lemon zest in them and see but they are great on their own too.

Excellent taste and texture! Crispy on the outside, chewy in the center. Leaving them on the sheet for a minute or two after baking seems to help them be perfectly cooked. I used Vanilla instead of Brandy.

These cookies are simply amazing! I made them for Xmas and they were a hit with everyone, I did end up following some direction that I found in the comments  like doubling the recipe but reducing both brown and white sugars to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. I did end up having some left over and I stored them in a simple ziplock bag and they were perfectly fine the second day.

I made about 6 different types of cookies this year for my wife and this one was the first one that she really loved. They tasted a little less sweet then I would have liked but very good.

I didn't have brandy on hand so I substituted the brandy for 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  

I also didn't add the white sugar so instead of 1/2 cup of brown sugar, I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  If I was making it for just myself I'd only put in 1/2 cup of brown sugar and no white sugar. 

This cookie is a crowd pleaser.

These cookies are delicious, or the way I prepared them. I made a couple of changes: I was out of brown sugar, so I used the half cup of white sugar (called for) plus a couple tablespoons extra, and added about 4 tablespoons molasses and a quarter cup or so of pancake syrup (I used a half cup measurer, and added the other sugars until it filled to the half cup). I subbed Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur) for the brandy, and added a half teaspoon of vanilla as well. I didn't have white chocolate chips either, so I used peanut butter chips, and my craisins were cherry-flavored. Also I used butter-flavored Crisco shortening instead of butter. I took the cookies, still warm, up to my boyfriend's restaurant/bar, and served them to all the customers and they raved at how phenomenal they were! Thanks so much! Great recipe, can't wait to try it the regular way too!

These cookies are absolutely delicious and so easy. I didn't have brandy so I used Captain Morgan instead and I took another reviewers advice and did not grease the pam, so the cookies did not spread at all. A great recipe I will keep on hand as a go to!

Yummy, but a little too sweet for my taste buds. I cut back the white sugar, but next time I'll only add 1/4 cup.  I did also replace 1/2 c flour with a 1/2 c oats to make it a bit healthier.

The gentle crisp around the edges and chewy middles of these cookies were amazing! I followed the recipe mostly. I used Cointreau, an orange liqueur, in place of the brandy since I didn't have that on-hand and used a Baker's bar of white chocolate instead of chips. They were absolutely delicious and so simple! I will be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe and only had one cup of cranberries at home so I just threw in more chips.  These are excellent - my husband can't stop eating them.  I think it is important to take them out of the oven when they are still soft.  Oh, I also used vanilla.  Anyone would love these.

These cookies came out really good!  I changed the servings to 52 and used vanilla instead of brandy.  Other than that, followed exactly as written.  My cookies only took 7-8 minutes.  I made the first two dozen just as chocolate chip because I wasn't sure how the cranberries ones would turn out.  I added a half a cup of fresh cranberries to the remaining batter.  The cranberry cookies were definitely better!  They tasted so good with the chocolate chips, but they had a nice light, fluffy taste.  This is going in my recipe box!

I made these cookies for my mini Independence Day celebration and they were so good and so easy to make! I followed the recipe except I subbed 1 TBSP vanilla extract for the brandy. I used a Pampered Chef medium cookie scoop, baked for 9 minutes, and ended up with 31 perfect cookies. Each cookie is 101 calories and sooo worth it. Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I'm going to use Spenda brown sugar blend and maybe 1/4 c of white sugar to lower the calories. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!!

Love these cookies!   I did modify the recipe though.  The changes I made were only using 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla instead of brandy, and I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.   I baked them 8 minutes at 375 degrees.

This was my first time trying white chocolate and cranberry cookies and let me say they were delicious. My boyfriend is obsessed with them. This recipe will definitely be going in my recipe book! I didn't have any brandy so I made mine without and they still came out so good.

This recipe is great! It is, as other reviews have mentioned, almost too dry to mix in the chocolate and cranberries after you add the flour - however, just a teaspoon of water does the trick to loosen it back up! Also, don't wait until these cookies are "golden" on top - taking them out just before the top turns is a great way to make sure they stay nice and chewy on the inside!

Just a warning: this makes for a pretty small batch of cookies. I made about two sheets (4x4) and was a few short on the second one. But besides that, these cookies are great! I used chocolate chips instead of white, black gosling rum instead of brandy, and I added a bunch of orange zest just because. These baked up wonderfully- they aren't the prettiest cookie (at least with choco chips), but they sure do smell/taste great. Thanks for sharing! (I cooked min 7 min, left on sheet for a minute.)

great cookies! i made a double batch.  took the other reviewers' advice and added pudding (sugar free dulce de leche), and a sprinkle of cinnamon. next time i think i'll put some orange or lemon zest in...
had to bake it for 15-20 min since my oven is quite weak; but as the other say, once the edges brown a little, it's best to take it out then. will def be making these soon!

SO simple and SO good. I made these with rum instead of brandy (because it's what I had on hand, and I like rum), and these cookies are delicious!!

OMG...that's what everyone was saying when my cousin brought these to Thanksgiving. Then I brought them to Christmas and it was the first thing everyone reached for at the dessert table! These are so tasty and don't need any modifications. I'll be making these again!

delish - wish I had read the reviews that suggested making a double (but it might be better for my waistline to not have that many cookies in the house). I used Captain Morgan rum (didn't have brandy) and the hint of coconut is really nice. I also used a half cup of almonds and a half cup of cranberries and that seems yummy, too.

These are one of my favorite cookies, but DO NOT leave out the brandy!  I use brandy flavored extract and it is the little difference that makes this cookie!

Huge hit!  Great cookie but not too sweet to eat more than one!  I used non-sweetened dried cranberries which I preferred because white chocolate is so sweet!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved these and my husband did too and he isn't a dessert person. He ate about 6 of them. I would cut the cranberries in half, it over powers the cookie. But I still give it 5 stars.

Definitely on the sweet side.  But, it's such an easy cookie to make and very pretty for the holidays.  I brought them to work today, it's 10:30 and I've already received several good reviews.  I'm thinking if you cut down on the chips it might not be as sweet.  I might try that next time.

These were just as I expected they would be. They're yummy and the cranberries add a nice zing to the flavor. I recommend chopping the chips and cranberries up though for a smoother distribution of flavor.

I thought that the consistency was amazing. They were absolutely beautiful! I, too, used vanilla instead of the brandy but I hope to (in the future) try it with the brandy. I can't imagine these cookies being any better!

I didn't have brandy so I used Gran Marnier, which gave them a nice orangey flavor. I feel like it needed something though. Will try again with spiced rum next time (as a reviewer suggested), see how that goes.

This is a wonderful recipe. I followed someone's advice about using fresh cranberries. I put them in the oven in water for about 10 minutes at 375 degrees to soften them before putting them in the batter. I wish I would have put them in a few minutes less b/c they get really soft and smooshy fast. The cookies were still AMAZING. The fresh cranberries are extra flavorful. Because I soaked them a tad too long they were just hard to mix into the dough without smooshing them. You've gotta try them with fresh cranberries!!

These are very nice and moist, and for someone who likes a rich cookie, these are perfect. However, keep in mind that these are VERY rich. But the flavor combination is lovely and mine came out exactly as they look in the picture. NOTE: I did not have brandy, so I used about half the amount of vanilla, and I added a 1/4 tsp of salt, so my review may not actually be accurate. Though given the ingredients, i cannot imagine them not being extremely rich.

A friend of mine had a similar recipe that had some nuts and oatmeal in it.  Since I had enough white chocolate and cranberries, I made both recipes and had a taste test.  The result was that both were equally delicious, some preferred this recipe and others preferred the other one.  Either way you have a winner.  But I think I'll try to combine the two to create THE awesome cookie.  I love the brandy aspect, but I also like having a little more texture to my cookies, so I'll play around with some nuts and oatmeal.  The one thing I did do for both recipes is use whole cranberries.  I had them in my freezer and I figured why use dried up ones when I could go for fresh?  We loved the little cranberry explosion in our mouth!

I love this recipe! I first used it last christmas and followed the directions as written, I brought them to a cookie exchange they were by far the favorite. Since then I have used this basic recipe for chocolate chip pecan and macadamia nut. It truly is a great versatile recipe so many options. Thank you Diane!

Subbed vanilla for brandy and added about a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Wonderful. Big hit with friends and co-workers.Asked to make them for a friend for her church group.

I love cranberry and white chocolate but I just didn't love the taste of these. I had much higher expectations. They are an easy cookie to make and turned out looking great. I still gave them 4 stars because several others who tried them did like the taste very much.

Great texture and appearance - though I made some mistakes.  First I used dark brown sugar and would have preferred a lighter-colored cookie.  Second, I thought Cointreau would be a good substitue for brandy but it made it way to sweet - this is a sweet cookie anyway.  I soaked the cranberries and it was great for the moisture level.  I will bake this again and am sure I'll love it.  I recommend 7:30 baking time.

Pretty good.  I actually thought they had a pretty mild flavor, I thought you could taste the cookie more than you could taste the add-ins, and I even added some chopped pecans.  I'm curious to see what these would taste like if I used fresh cranberries instead of dried.

This is one of my favorite cookies ever but i add a little something extra. When making these cookie i add an additional 1/2 cup of dried Blueberries. This has been a traditional cookie of Red, White and Blue served at football games to the marching band members to refuel this after an amazing half-time performances.  So if you every want to add the blueberries they are amazing.

I subbed whiskey for brandy and it turned out fine.  You could probably use vanilla instead, but the brandy/whiskey gives it a fantastic flavor.

Made a double batch of these so I'd have enough for family and a school event.  Very moist, tasty, and easy to make.  I used 2 cookie sheets to speed up the process; one greased and one with parchment paper.  Both worked well.  I didn't have brandy on hand, so I used 1 T of amaretta instead.  Very yummy.  Didn't and won't change anything else.  Thanks for recipe.

I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce to cut the fat.  The texture was moist and delicious.  I also prefer semi-sweet chocolate chips and I tossed in about 3/4 cup of pecans.  I also added a few Tblsps. more flour.  They were VERY good!

These are yummy. I used vanilla extract instead of brandy, though I wished I'd had some on hand! I also threw in about a half cup of walnuts. Also used frozen cranberries I microwaved for a few minutes. Yum yum yum!

I got SO many compliments from family and friends.  I also brought them to a friend at work, and her customers were asking me how I made them.  Only made a few slight changes...used crisco butter flavored sticks rather than butter, used whiskey and a little amaretto in the second batch and they were EVEN better than with just brandy.  I baked about 8-9 minutes so they'd be soft.  GREAT recipe for EASY cookies that are delicious during the holidays, or anytime!

Dear Diane,  I'm not a big fan of writing reviews just to write one, so when I say that these cookies are heavenly, I mean they are pure HEAVEN.  They are my all time favorite cookie.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!

Although the cookies were delicious, the dough was very dry and crumbly, I had to roll them. They came out cake like (they did not flatten out).

Incredible!  Especially good w/ dark chocolate instead of white.  Although the dough smelled very strongly of brandy (I used a bit less than a tsp. of brandy extract instead of the brandy), I didn't taste it in the baked cookies, and that's actually perfectly fine with me.  In fact, I think I'll use vanilla extract instead next time.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. We love dried cranberries and are always looking for a good recipe that uses them. This one is perfect. Thanks!

These were fantastic Christmas cookies.  Not too sweet or too heavy.  Great addition to my Christmas cookie baskets this year.

I have been making these every year at xmas since I found the recipe here.  They are amazing!  Everyone loves them.  I would have to say DO NOT substitute vanilla, the result will be a totally different cookie.  Go to the liquor store and just get a tiny airplane bottle of brandy for $1.  It's well worth the trip.  Also, these have a shelf life of about 2 days and then they get dry.  Don't make them too far in advance unless you are going to freeze them right away.

I loved these cookies ! These are flavourfull and addicting to eat. I triple the batch when I make them. I take them out of the oven and let them sit for a couple of minutes before transfering them on to a wire rack. I made nestle toll house cookies and added in cranberrys. They tasted really buttery. This recipe seem that everything tastes just perfect and so is the texture. Two thumbs up !!

This is my new favorite cookie recipe.  I used frozen cranberries that were slightly thawed so I could cut into fourths.  I used vanilla since I had in stock.

I didn't have brandy so I had to use vanilla extract but they were still tasty! A little on the sweet side for me, though. I'll cut the sugar a bit next time and maybe replace some of the butter but I love the cranberries.

I made these cookies exactly how the recipe said, except I used vanilla instead of brandy, and they tasted really bland. I never met a cookie I didn't like but these could put me to sleep. The cranberry and chocolate parts were good but the dough was boring and almost tasteless. I melted the butter before mixing it with the sugar and the cookies spread really well so I didn't have a problem with lumpy cookies. I love the cranberry/white chocolate combo but I'm going to look for another recipe as this one didn't do anything for me.

These cookies are yummy.  Next time I will probably add a little more cranberries just because I love cranberries.  I will definitely make these again.

Based on the opinion of many others (I personally did not get to try any because they were all gone!), these are "da bomb"! I made as directed only adding grated orange zest and walnuts (I've got to have some kind of nuts in my cookies). Hubby said that they were the first to disappear off the cookie tray. Great recipe, easy to make, chewy, and (as I have been told) scrumptious. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are fantastic! They're a good alternative to traditional chocolate chip but still appeal to everyone. They're so good that when I asked my boyfriend what kind of cake he wanted for his birthday (always cheesecake) he said, "Don't make one, make those cookies!"

Not sure what went wrong, but these cookies didn't come out right at all.  They started running as soon as we put them into the oven and baked FLAT.  Won't make again.

I know it's not Christmas time but I had to try this recipe when I found it.  The cookie was ok, but I thought they were a bit dry.  I think because of the dried cranberries.  But of course, it could have been because it was my first attempt at making homemade cookies and I probably made them too big and left them in the oven a little too long.  Either way, if I choose to try this recipe again, I will make them smaller and opt to take them out sooner than I did last time.

good cookies!  Too sweet for my tastes, but that's easily adjusted.  9 minutes turned out to be the best bake time for me on these--I tried 10, then 8, then 9; 10 was too brown, 8 too light, 9 just right.  Sounds like Goldilocks, doesn't it?  They were still delicious either way, just the best at 9.  We don't have any brandy in the house, but we do have coconut rum so I used that instead of brandy.  I think I'll add some salt next time as well to counteract a bit of the sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! I've made these several times with different variations, and they always turn out well. I do add a pinch of salt every time, and sometimes have added oatmeal, almonds, or different types of dried fruit.

I made these cookies for my neighbors on Christmas eve this past year. Everyone loved them and asked me for the recipe.  I used Vanilla instead of Brandy and made sure that each cookie did not have too many chocolate chips before baking to avoid burned bottoms. (The cookies, not my bottom...lol) These are my favorite cookies I have made thus far. YUM!

I followed the recipe for these cookies exactly.  I think next time I'll try some of the variations as described by other commenters.  These cookies were okay. I would have preferred them to be a bigger fluffier cookie so next time I may add pudding mix.  Also, there seemed to be a little too much cranberry compared to the amount of dough.

A great hit! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup all purpose, added chopped roasted walnuts.  It made 18 cookies, and it was fun to watch my BF go back and forth btwn the bed room and the kitchen as he finished half of them that were still cooling. Would go great with green tea, fruit tea, or a glass of milk! I might cut down on the oil next time and bake for 12 min. since I use a microwave oven, and it turned out slightly greasy. You have to try the WHOLE WHEAT!!!

So good! I used vanilla instead of brandy and they still turned out great.  Once they cool, I store my cookies in a closed container with a slice of bread.  The bread keeps the cookies moist for days.

**WARNING**  If you are on a diet, stay away from this recipe...  WOW!  These cookies are amazing!  I baked them for my hubby to take to work the tomorrow and I hate to say it, but I don't know that there are enough for him to still take...  Oops!  Very Good!  I didn't change anything, and I will definitely bake again!

These are nummy yummy! Made these for Christmas cookies and everyone raved! The brandy is a must, gives it that extra something. Next time I'll try maybe adding a little cinnamon and perhaps a different liquor, like the rum I got from Barbados. Definatley, do not overcook these, best left to be a lil' chewy.

It is -14 degrees outside and we decided to bake cookies. This  is a very good recipe. I used 1 cup of fresh cranberries softened at 250Deg F for 10 min. I used 1 tsp vanilla instead of the brandy.
Yummy cookies!

SUPER-DUPER-WAY-MONDO 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!  We used bread flour (keeps the cookies 'plumper') and doubled the recipe and used Grand Marnier instead of brandy- orange flavored craisins.........YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!  Cooked the cookies for 12 minutes- and they were perfect.  I used the small pampered chef 'ice cream scoop' (1 inch?-ish) SOOOOOOOO GOOD!  Thank you!

These were absolutely wonderful! My husband declared them "his cookies". That's saying a lot seeing as how he doesn't care for white chocolate or cranberries all that much. I would recommend making a double batch, as a single batch doesn't make all that many cookies. This will definitely be added to my Christmas cookie list.

5 stars is the highest rating option,but in my opinion it takes 10 stars easily! I made these cookies for our 14th annual Christmas party. What a big hit! It took all but prying the platter (two batches) away from one of my girl friends just so my other guests may have a taste too! By the way,she has renamed these "Criminal Cookies", in which I totally agree!I hope you don't mind the name change,but it absolutely,positively fits. Thankyou so much for sharing:)

Awesome cookie recipe!  I love cranberry and white chocolate and was looking for a staple cookie recipe - this will now be my go-to recipe.  I will say that I followed others advice and didn't "flatten" the cookies - I added them in a rounded ball to the cookie sheet.  They seemed to come out better.  I did need to bake mine a little longer to get them "browned" on top.

These cookies are very good! Instead of brandy I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.(The hint of almond extract really made the cookies taste good.)  If you use unsalted butter be sure to add a pinch of salt.

These cookies are excellent!  They are now tied with my chocolate chip for my favorite.  The mixture of white chocolate and cranberry is the perfect amount of sweet and chewy texture.  I highly recommend.

These turned out great and the reviews were very helpful. I used fresh cranberries so tart and fresh perfect with the sweet white chocolate! I took the advice of the reviewers and pre-cooked the fresh cranberries for a few minutes at 250 and they bursted perfectly in the cookie. I also added almond extract about a tsp. per batch of 24 and vanilla instead of brandy. Do not fore go the greesing on this cookie and must be pulled out a little under cooked slightly light brown. I left a batch in a little to long just cooked all the way through and I through them out, not working! Great holiday treat and best way to use left over thanksgivng cranberries ever!

These were really good.  I patted them down with my fingers before baking, as suggested by another reviewer, and baked until just BARELY starting to brown - still looking doughy in the center. Came out looking beautiful and tasting great. Almost exactly  4 dzn cookies.

so good! changes i made: used vanilla instead of brandy and fresh cranberries instead of dried. someone suggested throwing the fresh cranberries in the oven at 250 for 10 minutes or so to soften them up. worked great. i baked the cookies at 375 for 9 minutes. the cookies came out flat and at first i was disappointed but they are awesome! I will definitely make these again and repeat exactly what i did this first time. thanks!

I always love white chocolate and cranberry cookies however I have had better.  Don't know if it was my cooking or the recipe that didn't make these taste as good as past years.  You can pretty much take any chocolate chip recipe and make these from it.

I've made this recipe several times.  Everyone loves them!!  I never take any home back with me.  ha!  I like to add some shaved almonds to mine to add a little extra.  I do use less white chocolate also then what the recipe calls, because I find it to be a little too sweet...Just a personal opinion b/c I never got a complaint when made with that much anyway.

I made a couple of changes, i thought these would be way too sweet for our taste. Omitted the white sugar since the white chocolate and brown sugar give enough sweetness to the cookies. Used rum instead of brandy, 'cause that's what i had on hand. Also added chopped pecans. Thank u!

I thought these were really good cookies but they were not "awesomely delicious" cookies. Now, I did make them with vanilla instead of Brandy so I am going to make them again and see if there is a significant difference in flavoring. 

I would definitely make them again but they would not make it in my top 10 fave cookies list.

I've used this recipe many times now and the cookies always come out wonderful each time.  Great texture, taste and very easy to make.  I had played with the recipe a few times and have tried it with decreasing the sugar by a half cup (1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white) and adding pecans. It still turns out very good and works better for my daughters palate.  Tried it once with smart balance instead of butter but it changed the texture too much making it almost too cakey.

These are phenomenal.  I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla instead of brandy, and added a splash of canola oil (because the dough was extremely dry).  I was not expecting these to come out well, but they are amazing.  The flavor is just perfect.  Thanks!

I made several of the top-reviewed cookies from this site for Christmas, and this was the one that was most popular. I used brown chocolate chips instead of white and raisins instead of cranberries. (Both weren't on hand at the moment.) Didn't seem to be a problem at all.

I wish these had a better base to them. I  love the combo of cranberry and white chocolate but the cookie batter was not very good. Mine came out crispy and flat.

These were good and I'll probably make them again, but not the BEST cookie. I thought they could use more moisture but they certainly still disappeared fast.

These are good cookies, but they really had me frustrated by the end of the day! I made these this morning and had a heck of a time trying to get them cooked through without the outsides turning brown. I was bound and determined to have some pretty ones to put in my cookie trays, so I tried them again this afternoon. The best batches I got were when I scooped out small amounts of batter and then flattened them out on the cookie sheet. They still aren't gorgeous, but they are cooked through, unburnt, and very tasty.

I have made these several times and they are always a hit. I have used Disarrono liquor, Grand Marnier, or vanilla instead of the brandy. I always cut the white sugar in half.

I loved these!  My oven was a little too hot so I had to decrease the temp to 345. I also found that if I used my cookie scoop, it was took thick so the inside didn't get done before the edges were crispy.  I just flattened them a little and that was just perfect.  I also used half vanilla and half orange extract instead of brandy - it was AWESOME.

I saw this recipe and knew that we'd love it.  I basically doubled it....just used the Tollhouse recipe and subbed white chocolate chips and used a 6oz package of dried cranberries, which was all that I had on hand.  I will use double the cranberries next time, or try fresh cranberries as another reviewer suggested.  Delicious!!  Thanks for the great idea....a very festive Christmas cookie : )

Yum. Wow. Everyone loved these - I stuck to the recipe and they were perfect! Excellent recipe loved by me and all my coworkers!! A great way to switch up from a choco-chip cookie.
**Didn't realize I had previously made these! Need to save to my recipe box this time... =) They were -again-wonderful! Made just as written...lovely, tasty treats!

Yum!  We used almond extract because we had no brandy, and cut down just a bit on the white chips.  Still a wee bit sweet, but they are good and the cranberries look festive!

I wish I could give this recipe 6 stars.  I made it a few years ago, and it became my signature cookie.  I made it again for a charity bake sale last week, and I won 2nd place! I followed the recipe exactly.

Maybe this just isn't my taste, but these cookies weren't very good.  I used fresh cranberries instead of dried, but I baked them first to make them soft.  Anyway, the cookie dough tastes amazing, but even after adding pecans these lacked flavor.  The texture was kind of bread-like.

I used these for my Christmas cookie exchange this year.  I slighty underbaked them so they would stay soft since most exhange cookies get hard.  I added toasted slivered almonds and almond extract instead of the brandy. Yum

Yummy recipe.  Substitued blended oatmeal for half the flour. The result has been a hit amoung family, freinds, and co-workers.  Would be interested to know how to lower the sugar quantity without sacrificing the great taste and texture.

This recipe is fabulous!  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  It is my husband's favorite cookie.  He said these are better than his mom's chocolate chip cookies, and believe me, that is a compliment!  I have always used vanilla in place of the brandy just because I never have any brandy on hand, though I am sure it would taste fabulous as well.  Also, I only put in 1/2 cup of the dried cranberries.  Try this recipe, it is a true winner.

I wasn't impressed with these cookies.  I thought that the dough needed salt.  I will try adding salt next time.  I LOVE the idea of combining dried cranberries and white chocolate.  I think next time I will just take my fav choc chip cookie recipe and add it to that dough.  Or I may try a sugar cookie dough.

These are great-they don't flatten out, don't break easily and are very colorful.  I accidentally bought the dried "cherry flavored" cranberries and they were still very good.  I used Capt Morgan instead of the brandy and really couldn't taste much of the rum after they were baked.  I'm making alot of cookie trays and these look nice with lemon bars and chocolate cookies.

My personal favorite cookie.  I almost always make it first at Christmas.  1/2 teaspoon of orange extract goes in mine, which is a double batch.

These were really good... and the red craisins and white chocolate look so pretty together :) They are very sweet, so if you're not into that maybe consider reducing the amount of chocolate. (it was not a problem for me though!)

I made these for a function and it was the first thing to be gone. People kept asking who made it and asked for the recipe. I used vanilla instead of Brandy. Excellent variation of the traditional chocolate chip cookie.

I have been making this recipe for years and love it, but the last two times the cookies have turned out flat and greasy. What am I doing wrong? My baking soda is fresh. Maybe more flour is needed? Any advice would be appreciated!

By Far one of the best cookie recipes I've made and tasted in years and the ONLY one my husband requests now! They bake up just lovely with the most perfect "made at the bakery" look and the texture is so soft and delicate, YUM!. If you switch the cranraisins for macadamia nuts, they'll taste just like those expensive gourmet Macadamia and White Chocolate cookies that all of your friends will want the recipe for. I did change two things though, I used 1 & 1/2 T vanilla and 1/2 T anise which created the most delightful back ground flavore for the orange cranraisins. Thank you so much Diane for one keeper of a cookie!

I don't think the problem is too much butter, but not enough flour. My first batch was greasy and flat, but once I added about a half a cup more flour, the cookies turned out a little more formed. The flavor was good, but the crumbling, greasy nature ruined it.

These cookies turned out great with a few minor changes.  I substituted vanilla extract in place of the brandy and used a bar of white chocolate chopped coarsely instead of the chips.  I also added about 1/2 cup coarsley chopped macadamia nuts.  These are a nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies but the dough is very similar.  I will make these again for sure!

Everyone raved about these cookies and I receive such a positive response that I make them several times a year.  People don't just ask me to for the recipe - they ask me to make them more cookies!  I use vanilla extract instead of brandy since I don't keep the brandy on hand and they come out fine.

These cookies are amazing. This was the first time I baked cookies from scratch and I was told by my guests that they were so good I could sell them! I will definately make them again before next Christmas.

Excellent cookie, very pretty and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and when the first batch worked so well I added dried cherries to the next batch.  Both were good but the tartness of the cranberries really adds something.  This is a new holiday favorite.

These were great - like a chocolate chip cookie, but different.  I used spiced rum in place of brandy, and wish I could have tasted it!  Next time I might try a little rum extract and a few pecans.

I used vanilla instead of brandy and used "cherry" flavored dried cranberries. They were a big hit at two Christmas parties that I took them too. A great spin on a classic.

Excellent cookies!  My dh and I both love them, and I will certainly make them again.  I used vanilla instead of the brandy like many others and added 1/4 tsp salt.  I also reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup.  The cranberries look so festive too!

Used vanilla chips rather than white chocolate chips and it was a huge hit!  A lot of people wanted the recipe b/c it wasn't too sweet.  Will make these again and again!

These cookies missed it; maybe they are missing salt. I used Cherrylands' Best Dried Cherry Berry Mix (cherries, cranberries,and blueberries.) $10 for 2 pounds.  I would use the tried and true Nestle Toll House recipe on the bag and sub white chocolate and dried fruit for the chocolate chips.

Wow...these were even better than I thought they would be.  I was curious to see how the white chocolate and cranberries would work together but what a great combo!  Cookies came out perfect!  I have made them a few times already for different Christmas events.

These need more than five stars.  They are awesome.  I made a double batch and used vanilla instead of the brandy.  After the few holiday parties I have taken them too so far, they have been the most demanded.  Everyone is talking about them and asking for the recipe.  I am going to have to make another double batch before the holidays are over!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Good cookies, I thought they needed something extra, so I'll probably add a pinch of cinnamon next time. My guests loved the, though. I used white rum because that's all I had, and next time I'd use brandy or spiced rum. I had to bake them for about 12 minutes to get them done, but still chewy.

Wonderful cookies!  I followed some of the other suggestions and added 1/2 chopped walnuts and decreased the white chocolate chips and dried cranberries to 1/2 each also.  Instead of brandy I used dark rum.  This will be my cookie exchange for the year!  Thanks!

Loved these cookies!  After reading reviews, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening to prevent the cookies from spreading.  I used vanilla since I didn't have brandy and will probably not even try them with brandy, they had a nice flavor with the vanilla.  Watch them closely so they don't burn.  Great recipe!

I'd been looking for a recipe that called for white chocolate chips since I bought a ton of them, and this recipe put them to good use. The cookies were tasty and flattened out nicely, and had really good taste. I did, however, just use vanilla instead of the brandy and liked them quite a bit.

I made 4 batches for Christmas and everyone loved them! I tried my first couple batches with fresh cranberries - I sliced them up into 4 pieces; they were good but a bit tart. I will be making these not only again at Christmas, but probably througout the year!

I was ready to give up as all of my cookies were just not coming out as anything special.  And then I tried these - which are by far the most delicious and different cookies that I ever tasted......its hard to keep away from them!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of the white chocolate chips......it just made then even yummier!  OUTSTANDING!

my expectations were really high after reading all these reviews - maybe that explains why i wasn't too thrilled. what may also explain it is that i used vanilla instead of brandy, and accidentally picked up orange-flavored craisins; it didn't taste as cranberry-ish as regular craisins. overall, pretty average.

I didn't originally think this would be tasty, because the idea of fruit and white chocolate just didn't sit well with me, but I wanted to make things that I thought were different. Well, this was totally different than I imagined, and this cookie was fantastic! I highly recommend adding it to your christmas cookie list!

This cookie dough was so great, I think I'm going to use it as a base for all my chocolate chip cookies. They were crisp, chewy, sweet and spread out a lot when they were baking - they looked like mini pancakes! I don't know if they spread out more than usual because I used margarine instead of butter but I would make them like that again. I cut the recipe in half and made six large cookies but next time I would follow the recipe directions and make double that - they were too big once they started baking. As much as we enjoyed these I think I would substitute the cranberries for macadamia nuts next time, just because we like the nuts better.

Little effort for such great results!  These cookies are very easy and delicious. To change things up a bit, I used dried blueberries in place of cranberries.  Sweet and chewy if you're careful enough to take them out right at 9 minutes.  Definitely try this recipe today!

I made these last year and rated them a 4.  I just made a double batch, and with a slight modification in the recipe, they now rate a 5.  I replaced half the brandy with vanilla, as I thought the full amount of brandy left a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Using half vanilla/half brandy resulted in a fabulous cookie.  I brought them to work today and people went nuts!

These were great. I made them for a cookie swap and they were a big hit! I also changed the recipe to include macadamia nuts. I used 3/4 cup dried cranberries and a 1/2 cup each of the macadamia nuts and white chips. These were even more delicious than the first.

One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made!  I followed the directions exactly and had to make another batch to give to family members because I practically ate the whole 2 dozen myself!

I used Ocean Spray sweetened dried cranberries - they are very tasty and not too tart. 

Thank you so much
!

I made one batch but it tasted kind of bland so the second batch I made I added a pinch of salt and cranberry oil extract to flavor. I also used 1/2 brandy & 1/2 vanilla extract because the brandy alone didn't flavor it enough.

fabulous cookie. I doubled the recipe and added 1 teaspoon salt to the DOUBLED recipe. I used 1 Tablespoon vanilla instead of brandy. I used a #20 scoop (equals 1/4 cup). The cookies were uniform in size, large, chewy and impressive . Baked at 350 for 16-18 minutes. Makes about 30 big and pretty cookies!

This recipe ROCKS!
I used the vanilla instead of brandy, and added a tiny pinch of salt... when all was said and done I had a really hard time mixing it..it seemed very very dry..looked like ROLL cookies..so I added 1tblsp of milk and mixed then added the cranberries and white choc. It improved the texture and tasted GREAT!
The funny thing is I used 2 diff cookie sheets..an Airbake and an reg old well seasoned one (prob older than I am)...the air baked cookies spread more and LOOKED more like the tollhouse choc chip cookie in size/shape...and the reg sheet stayed very rounded..like little mounds...I had one of each...the only difference in taste was the crispness of the edges of the one that spread...both were AWESOME!
Definitely a staple at my house..
quick and easy...that's my motto!

I made these and they smelt sooo yummy!  They are a nice twist to Chocolate Chip cookies, to make them more festive. I bundled them up in a pretty cellophane bags and gave them as small hostess gifts! All enjoyed! I was asked for the recipe several times!  Easy to make as well!  TRY THEM!

These are wonderful!  I added 1 C dried blueberries.  What a great combination.  I did not have brandy, so I used vanilla.  They were still good.  Do not know if brandy would change the flavor much.  Will try brandy next time.  You will not go wrong with these cookies.

These are great, a nice change from the same old chocolate chip cookie. The store was out of white chocolate chips so I used milk choc. instead. I also used 1t vanilla instead of the brandy, plus a little splash of milk to compensate for the liquid. My dough was still a little stiff, but they baked up well. Good stuff!

This recipe is delicious.  The white chocolate and cranberries in the cookie make a unique yet tasty treat.  If you are looking for a recipe that is a little different than the usual holiday recipes you may want to consider trying this one.

good cookies. i made the following changes after reading the other recipe reviews: 1) used orange-flavored craisins soaked in warm water for 10 min to plump,  2) used a little less white sugar, and 3) added 1/4 tsp salt. they were a little cake-like, but that's probably something i did. i took them out exactly after 8 minutes so i would have softer cookies. it was very quick and easy to make, but i don't know if i'd make them again. they were good, but i can't help comparing them to the otis spunkmeyer cookies that have cranberries and blueberries (soooooo good!). maybe if brandy AND vanilla were added?

This is just a variation to the standard chocolate chip cookie. I am glad I reduced the sugar in this recipe by half as even with this reduction they were extremly sweet (must be the white chocolate) My family thought they were okay but didn't rave about them and ask me to make them again.

These cookies were excellent.  Even people who didn't like cranberries thought these cookies were yummy!  I used cranberries that came from Giant Eagle grocery store (like how they package walnuts and pecans) which looked better than ocean spray or cranraisins.  I will definitely make these again!

I agree with others on doubling the recipe and cutting back on the white chocolate.  Next time I am going to substitute the brandy for either vanilla or almond extract for a change.  Very nice cookie recipe especially for the holidays.

Silly me! I don't care for cranberries. Too tart. But somehow I thought the sweetness of the white chocolate would balance it out enough for me. Well, it didn't. But for those who like cranberries, I understand why these would be a favorite. By the way... I added a cup of chopped walnuts and renamed the cookies "SNOWBERRY CRUNCH!"

These were very tasty ... a nice little variation on a traditional favorite (tho' I stuck with vanilla instead of brandy).  Very quick & easy to throw together .. I will probably make them again next Christmas.

WOW!  I had to bake a second batch before Christmas since the originals
went so quickly.  I also used vanilla instead of brandy and the results were great!

These cookies didn't come out as extraordinary as I expected based on previous reviews.  I used vanilla rather than brandy, and maybe that was the difference.
A good cookie, but won't be on my "top ten" list.

I really like the Christmas version of the cookie. My only complaint is that it's a little too rich for me. Too much butter. Does anyone have a suggestion for cutting back on butter?
Everyone I gave them to, loved them!

I was disappointed with these cookies. For the price of ingredients, I think basic chocolate chips taste better and are a better value.

I knew these were going to be good, but wow are they GREAT! Don’t waste your time, just make these already! I did use brandy and the only change I made was to cut down the white sugar down to 1/4 cup, like other users suggested. I made a few batches to figure out what’s best, especially because my oven isn’t consistent across the board. I had to bake for at least 10 minutes. They are soooo moist, delicious, and perfect for Christmas!

I liked these but didn't love them.  I baked them for 10 minutes.  They didn't spread too much.  (Using a thin baking sheet will cause them to spread.)  They were very soft, too soft for me, especially the next day.  I did soak my craisins in orange juice so maybe that added too much moisture to the dough.

Absolutely delicious..  everyone loved it.  I did not use the brandy.  I used vanilla instead.  And I accidentally picked up Ghirardelli white chocolate melting chips.  I broke into halves or thirds.  Perfect.  A new family favorite.

An excellent cookie! Like other reviewers I used a butter/shortening mix (to save money). Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It made 36 mini cookies (using a rounded teaspoon each). I can't wait to share these. Thanks!

I made these for an office Thanksgiving party and they were a huge hit! I used vanilla extract though because I did not have brandy. In addition, I used the reduced sugar craisins. I even made a second batch just for my kids but made 1/2 without the craisins and they loved those, but I definitely prefer the recipe with them!

Definitely bake these on the middle rack of your oven! I used a coconut oil-based non-stick spray but perhaps butter would have worked better (1st batch had scorched bottoms.)

I made this cookie exactly as instructed.  At 375 degrees, the cookie burned before the center was cooked.  I turned the temperature down to 350 degrees and subsequent batches turned out better.  Made with butter, the cookies really spread and flattened, but the white chocolate chips never melted leaving pronounced lumps in the center.  I recommend using at least some shortening in lieu of the butter.  The cookies did not look appetizing, but I liked the combination of white chocolate and dried cranberries.  Going forward, I will use my trusty Toll House cookie dough recipe, but modify it for the brandy, white chocolate and cranberries for the holidays.

I really liked this recipe for its simplicity. Like others, I substituted vanilla extract for brandy. I also made the cookies the size of heaping TABLESPOONS and BAKED THEM LONGER than the recipe says. I left them in for 15 minutes.

these are great cookies.  I added some almond pieces  and a bit more brandy the second time I made them and they were good too.

I never write reviews but this cookie recipe was AWESOME! My son who is  a  soldier overseas asked special for these for his birthday, they are that good! I used a small melon ball scoop which kept the cookie from spreading too much and I recommend parchment paper

I used just under half  the amount of sugar listed as along with the dried cranberries and white chocolate I thought it would be overly sweet.  My friend loved them.

Cookies had a good taste but spread all over the pan. May try again but will chill and bake at 350 degrees. Added 1/2 cup walnuts.

I doubled the recipe and cut the amount of the sugars (3/4 cup of each instead of one cup) and they were still slightly too sweet for my tastes. Used reduced sugar dried cranberries. Next time I’ll cut down to a half cup of each sugar, I just don’t think you need that much sugar when baking with white chocolate. I liked the texture of the cookies and the fact that they didn’t spread much while baking.

I made these several times over the holidays and they were always a big hit. Like others, I used vanilla extract Instead of brandy. Also I melted white chocolate and drizzled it over the cookies in a zig zag pattern.

Great! Used 1 tbsp. of vanilla instead of brandy. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. I  would reduce the total amount of sugar to just half a cup.

I definitely will be making these again.  However, your picture doesn't do justice to how much the cookies will spread, or if they will spread much, at all.  I dropped more than a heaping spoonful on the pan, spread them out some, and when they were done, I had 3 and a half inch round, thin cookies!  Just the way I like them!  I also lined the pan with parchment paper.  I'm not much of a cookie baking pro, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the way they spread.  The flavor was wonderful!  Not too sweet for my taste.  I did, however, add a TB of spiced rum, as advised from other reviewers, but it really didn't make much of a difference in the flavor.  This recipe is a winner!

My husband and I were both craving something sweet.  I found this recipe but didn’t have white chocolate chips.  I used chocolate chocolate chips instead.  I used a 1.5 tbsp scoop and was able to yield 29 cookies from this recipe.  Yummy!

The perfect cookie.  We received all the rave reviews on this cookie at our Christmas gathering.  The Brandy is the secret to making the flavors pop.  I added a little extra just for the holidays and now I wouldn't use less than double what the recipe calls for.

I made these last week for our neighbors for Christmas and they are so delicious! I used vanilla instead of brandy and the cranberries I bought just happened to be orange flavored which gave them a little zing! Everybody loved them! This will definitely be on my baking list next year!

I followed the recipe exactly and these are wonderful.  A tip that I would like to pass along is if you have the time to let the dough sit overnight refrigerated, the flour does absorb the butter more evenly (IMHO). Also to the person who said make these walnut size  and flatten, excellent suggestion. I baked mine on the 3rd shelf, natural gas oven on parchment for 12 minutes. Perfection.

I made these exactly as is.  They are pretty sweet - a bit too sweet for me as both the cranberries and the chocolate chips are very sweet, but my husband LOVED them.  I had three kids taste them - none of them were fans, maybe they taste the brandy??  Who knows, I will make them again because they were very good if you are OK with super sweet cookies!

This is a great little cookie!  I made them exactly as written.  (Used craisens). They’re fast and easy.....and don’t hesitate to use the brandy.  It adds a good flavor....(and it doesn’t taste boozy). Thanks for the recipe.

Really disappointed with this recipe. Flavor of the cookie is bland and texture neither chewy or crispy. Something in between. Very boring. I also noticed that there was no salt in this recipe. Only alteration I made was a pinch of salt..Probably needed more to balance flavors.

These came out great and I have to make another batch. My big mistake with the first batch was adding vanilla. When mixed with chocolate chips, it turned the cookies grey. However, nobody seemed to care. Next time I'll skip the vanilla.

These are delicious and I consider myself a cookie expert. :)  (Well, I am an expert at eating them!) I put frozen cranberries  in them and they were fantastic. I used vanilla instead of the brandy, and added about 1/4 ts salt and 1/2 ts of baking powder. They will be pretty for Christmas. Would be great with green chips if you ever come across any.

Awesome and addicting (with a few changes). 
I used salted butter and only 1/4 cup of white sugar since other reviewers commented about the cookies being too sweet. Also, I only used 1/2 cup each of dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. Instead of brandy, I used 1 teaspoon of orange extract. Finally, I baked the cookies at 350*F instead of 375*F (still for 8-10 minutes).
The result was amazing! The cookies were golden brown and crispy on the edges and soft in the center. The ratio of cranberries and chips to dough was perfect (in my opinion). And the orange extract was a delicious complement to the cranberries. The white chocolate kept the cookies sweet but not too sweet. 
I'll be making these again for sure!

These cookies are great.  A nice combination of white chocolate (which I generally do not care for) and just the right tartness from the dried cranberries make this cookie outstanding.  I didn't change anything, it looked like a good recipe and it is!  Thanks for sharing.  Everyone asked me for the recipes.  I made both the regular toll house chocolate chip cookies and these and we all liked these the best.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I made a few changes simply due to what was in my pantry.   I used dark chocolate chips instead of white, and rum in place of the brandy.  They were great.

The flavor was good but they fall extremely flat and thin, even when baked while cold. Possibly needs more flour.

This is a delicious cookie but a  little too sweet. So I cut down on the white sugar by 1/4 cup without repercussions. Made them twice !! It’s a keeper!!

Praline liqueur made all the difference when I didn't have brandy.  This made such a great cookie that my generous husband refused to share them with ANYONE.  However I managed to sneak a batch out for the church bake sale and they didn't even make the table ... they sold out from my hands.

These are fantastic!  The cranberries are perfect with the white chocolate.  They help cut the sweet of the white chocolate and add a perfect "chew" to the cookie.  YUM!!!

I made these for the first time this year at Christmas and it certainly won’t be the last.  Just the right ratio of chips to cranberries to batter.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Delicious!

Amazing! I used 3/4 of a cup of fresh cranberries and baked them in the oven for 5-10 min at 250F before adding them to the batter. Instead of brandy I used vanilla extract. And I tripled the recipe ! Will make again !

A crowd favorite!! A perfect blend of sweet and tangy. Ill kick it up a notch and make a cream cheese frosting for it. With the frosting, It comes close to a well known coffee shops holiday cranberry bar. ;-)

These cookies are so easy. The first batch I made exactly as stated. The second , I added less cranberries and added a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  They turned out really good.

The same day I made them the first time, I had to make more as they were disappearing so quickly. My family loved them.

This cookie is a crowd favorite, and I get asked for the recipe every time I bring it.  It is moist, and the cranberry and white chocolate make a very tasty flavor combination.  The only change I make is I substitute vanilla extract for the brandy.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, only reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup, and used dark chocolate chips since I did not have white chocolate chips.  I also softened the butter in the microwave (45 seconds).  I got 13 cookies using an ice cream scoop and flattened them a bit before baking.  Baked half for 8 minutes and the rest 10 minutes.  We liked the ones baked 8 min better, Thanks!

Made one batch to test as Christmas cookie. I used med scoop  from Pampered Chef, came out great size.Made 3 doz. Froze couple to see how they keep. Good thing I did because 2 adults had gone in 2 days. I used vanilla but next batch will defiantly get the rum. Also what to try some  chopped sliver almonds.

Used this recipe a chocolate chip raisin cookie. For some reason mine came out dough-y. I used margarine instead of butter. First batch I didn't flatten and they came out in the same ball shape they went in as. Second batch I flattened and turned out a bit more cookie shaped but still not right.

Great simple, delicious recipe! My husband just loves these. Definitely a keeper. Only thing I did differently was switch brandy for vanilla. Mmm!!

Used apricot brandy as that's what I had. Amazing! Had to freeze some to keep them from all disappearing too quickly.

Omg! These are so good - the brandy MAKES these cookies. I made a couple adjustments based on other reviews saying they were too cakey or too sweet.

These were really good - like a chocolate chip cookie with tart cranberries and white chocolate chips.  You need good quality white chocolate if you can find it - it makes a huge difference.  After the first batch came out I thought, these are really good, but they're lacking something -- I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of the next tray - now they're amazing!  The dough was a little bit too dry - it could have used a splash of milk maybe?  at any rate these are quite good. :)

Great cookies! However...they really didn't spread too much. I greased the sheets plenty, but for the most part, I had to press them down slightly to get the diameter I wanted. Also spreading them made them cook more evenly. Again, could have been user error, but I've never had to press my cookie dough before baking.

I made these cookies a few days ago and they are still super soft and are delicious! I had fresh cranberries to use up so I used them instead of dried cranberries. Also, I didn't have any brandy in the house so I used Disorono instead but only put in 1.5 teaspoons since it's a strong liquor. I'll definitely be making these cookies again!!

This recipe is so quick and simple and tastes amazing. They stayed soft, i baked at 375 for 8 min only. I sub'd the brandy/vanilla extract with Grand Marnier and added the zest of one orange and it made them simply delicious. Cranberry and Orange are so good together, throw in a hint of booze.....and a slice of heaven it is!

These turned out very well, and while a lot like the normal chocolate chip type of cookie, the dried cranberries with the white chocolate turned out with an interesting taste which people seem to love. I used almond extract instead of the brandy, and dropped the cookies onto parchment paper, and clean up was very easy. These are quite sweet, and found that cooking them for 11 minutes in my oven seemed to make them where they were stiff enough to take off the cookie sheet after letting them set for a few minutes. I think anyone with a sweet tooth will enjoy these cookies.

Excellent cookie! I did not change any of the listed ingredients but did add macadamia nuts. It would have been just as wonderful a cookie without the nuts but they did add crunch and an extra flavor. I made these with my large scoop and baked them about 15 minutes. These are a winner, do not hesitate to make them and share!

Everyone loved this! I did one variation where instead of cranberries I used butterfinger crumbs! It was delicious! However, the butterfinger crumbs made the cookie a bit softer than when I made it with the cranberries (really need to cool them so they don't fall apart)

Very simple to prepare, but I would leave the Brandy out and possibly use vanilla extract.   The Brandy, in my opinion, added an after taste.  Would make again with this adjustment.

I made this cookie recipe as written with the exception of substituting dry sherry for brandy. I baked them for 8 minutes. I had to stand guard to keep my wife and grandkids out of the cookies while they cooled. Everyone thought they tasted very good. Looks like I will need to make another batch soon.

Made these as written aside from using closer to 1 cup white chocolate chip (to finish off the bag I had) and substituting sherry for the brandy.  These are super sweet!  I'm a fan of sweets, but these were at the upper limit of my sweetness tolerance.  I cooked them for 8 minutes, and they came out with toasted bottoms and very slightly browned tops.  The inside was soft and chewy, and outer edges had a little crispness to them.  If I make these again I'll probably cut back on some of the sugar (maybe to 1/3 cup each?) and balance it out with a little more flour.  I'm no expert with baking, though, so I'm not sure if that would mess up the final product.

I took many of the reviewers advice and used vanilla extract instead of brandy... Worked out really well. I did have to bake a few minutes longer than suggested though

This makes a nice simple tasty cookie. I made it with semi-sweet chocolate chips since that is what I had. I did find it odd the recipe did not call for salt, so I added 1/2 teas. and glad I did.

These cookies are fantastic!  I didn't have brandy so I used vanilla.  The recipe made 2 dozen medium sized cookies.  The next time I make them I will double the recipe and add chopped pecans for even more flavor and crunch.

These were pretty good, though I found the dough a little sticky and there wasn't enough of it compared to the amount of filling ingredients. I only made 18 cookies rather than the 24 it was meant to make so next time I would increase the dough ingredients. I made half with white choc chip and half with normal, and I preferred the white. I think there was a bit much cranberries compared to chocolate, so would probably decrease these next time, or maybe exchange some for walnuts. I will enjoy playing around with this one a bit to get a 5 star cookie.

These are a family favorite! You can swap the white chocolate chips and cranberries for anything- it's a great cookie base! I use chocolate chips and walnuts and make different varieties with the same base. They're sooo good!

Loved 'em.  Used walnuts instead, vanilla not brandy, and will add some orange zest next time.  Will definitely be a 'next time'.

every time I make this recipe, without fail, I get asked for the recipe! I always forward it along with my one equal substitution - peppermint oil for the brandy. The first time I made it, I didn't have any brandy and thought that peppermint might bring a nice balance to the white chocolate chips and craisins, so I gave it a try. I got such rave reviews the first and every other time that I made it that I've never even tried it with the brandy!

I've been making these for the last five years at Xmas and everyone loves them. I subbed vanilla for the brandy (1 tsp) and it works great if you don't have brandy on hand, but I do think they are heightened in flavor with the brandy.  A friend who doesn't like white chocolate said she'd eat these any day.  Great chewy, tasty cookie!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great cookies. I followed the recipe almost exactly but used spiced rum instead of brandy. I think next time I might add nuts and would make an effort to look for unsweetened dried cranberries for a touch of contrast.

I have used fresh cranberries as someone else mentioned. I have been doing these for two years now and they are perfect to give away as well. If taken out while doughy they are moist and stay  fresh for many days. My favorite cookies for Christmas!

After reading reviews that the cookie was very dry the next day, I added an additional egg.  Also used only 1 tsp of vanilla and no brandy.  with these changes, this is a great cookie that I'm saving in my recipe box to make again.

Very tasty!  My recipe twist included using equal amounts of butter and shortening (1/2 c) Substituting 1 1/2 tsp. Of Chambord and 1 tsp. vanilla in luieu of the brandy.  I used 1 cup white chocolate chips  and 1 cup dried cranberries - roughly chopped.  Also added a healthy pinch of sea salt.  
Will definitely make again for the holidays.  Thanks!  ??

These were great and very easy to make!  Very tasty - I made them for a cookie swap for work, and I did find the 1 batch barely made 24 cookies.  I had doubled it and was short 7 cookies for my 4 dozen required.  Nice part of making an extra batch, had lots leftover for home now! Excellent cookies.

I have made this twice now,  the second time just last pm& both times it was noteworthy- but this last time, I can honestly say the little changes I made SHOCKED my husband (who is dismissive and passive at best, even when the food in question has his favorite ingredients- which this does NOT{ick!! Fruit??!}) and everyone else who took note of my excitement and tried one...  The rec. itself IS just a cute twist on a regular chip cookie. The booze vs vanilla issue is barely discernable once it's cooked off- so I added nearly double of BOTH(I'm at 7,000ft so I HAVE to add more fluids:)) 
The changes that made this cookie the best cookie, seasonal or not, I have EVER made are as follows(PLEASE NOTE- altitude will vary the results, use your  location equation& your preferrences to  dictate how much of what u choose to include: 
I doubled the rec., when initiating the dry ingred mix- I began with a little >1/2C ground flax seed. Then I used just 1/2C white.   I already mentioned that in early doubled the reccomended amt of booze/vanilla extract. 

Finally, Mix- ins.... I remembered how well my tangerine cranberry relish had gone over at TG, I decided to zest an entire mandarin orange & add it to the dough. I added a bit more berry than indicated, but the addition of nuts & the zest, in tandem with the natural nutty body of the quinoa flour and the flax seed/almond meal- plus the light touch of spices really blew me away. It's a medley I reccomend anyone who has any desire to excit

Very yummy, but a bit sweet for me. I'll cut down the sugar a bit next time. I used vanilla instead of brandy and also added some orange zest. Would also be good with nuts, as others have done.

Nice chewy cookies. Very tasty. I think if you add some walnuts it would be even better. You can use dried cherry too but I think the cranberry is a winner. My family loved it. Use a small ice cream scoop to get even cookies.

Great recipe! Make sure you buy regular dried cranberries because the larger size adds to the texture. I used vanilla extract instead of brandy. My cookies needed to bake for closer to 13 minutes. They still looked slightly undone in the center but continued to cook on the pan and then were perfect!

Soft, chewy cookies.  I used a small scoop and then took a fork to slightly press them down.  Definitely cut back on the sugar (as other suggested and I always do).  Worked well to bake for 9 minutes at 375.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar as others suggested. I also used only butter and they were delicious. I scooped them with a tiny scooper and flattened them before baking. Bringing them to a cookie exchange and I'm sure they'll be a hit.  I doubled the recipe and it made quite a bit. Thanks for sharing.

I made this. Stuck to the general recipe. Used spiced rum (kraken) instead and added a few shakes or nutmeg and cinnamon.

I didn't change the dough, but I added slightly less cranberries and white chocolate chips, but also added chopped walnuts and corn flakes. Really, REALLY good!

Very good! I did replace the brandy with rum and added 1 tsp of salt to enhance the flavor. I have added a handful of toffee pieces on another occasion and have also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.

These are UNBELIEVABLE. I made them tonight exactly as was written, and I wanted to cry they were so good xD. I went to the gym earlier, but it looks like these will be canceling out my efforts.

Really good cookie! Per other suggestions, I use 1/2 cups of brown sugar and 1/4 cups of white sugar. 
If made the way the recipe states, the cookie turns out entirely too sweet.

These cookies were a big hit. Delicious.  I used white chocolate squares  which I chopped into small chunks. I still have lots of dried cranberries so I will be making these again soon. I also used Spiced Rum instead of Brandy!

I tried this recipe, but I used less brown sugar simply because my eldest child has braces and brown sugar can make cookies extra chewy. She said these were the best cookies ever.

delicious! used sherry instead of brandy, and cooked for 12 minutes. 12 was a little too much for some near the edge, so I'll try 10-11 next time.

These cookies are great, but too sweet for my taste, will reduce sugar next time so they're perfect for me. Thanks for the recipe. 12 /2/2017    Made today as  a donation for a cookie sale, must have been good since there were none left when I was able to shop.    7/12/18 these cookies are still the best

I tried this recipe for a cookie exchange.  I doubled the ingredients and had about 46 cookies.  They were TO DIE FOR.  The brandy was a lovely substitute.  Quick and easy to make.  Tasted amazing.  Try this one!!

Very good cookies!  Won a cookie contest at work with these.  Initially I thought they were undercooked...too gooey, but when they cooled they were perfect.  I used vanilla flavoring instead of Brandy.

oh my goodness! these are amazing! I followed the recipe. Ended up quadruple it due me reading the recipe wring and making a batch of toll house right before I tried these. I am so glad I messed up! I am going to have 30ish people here for Christmas and these will not last. I had my grandma try them and she instantly told me that I had better get her the recipe. the brandy adds a nice flavor that is so subtle and mixed with the white chocolate  and cranraisans it is just a perfect combination!

I followed this recipe except for the brandy. I substituted 1 tsp vanilla instead. After I had started the cookies I discovered that I didn't have white chocolate chips but I did have lemon flavoured chocolate chips. Wow this was excellent. I baked them for 10 minutes at 375 which was just right. I love cookies that are a change from the choc chip, raisin cookie so thiis will go into my fav file. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an amazing cookie! Followed the recipe to the T (apart from the brandy which I substituted for vanilla extract) and they turn out great every time! I lowered the oven temperature to 350 and baked them about 12 minutes, because at 375 they came out just a bit too dark for my liking (but were delicious nonetheless). Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Baked these about an hour ago! Great recipe!!! I substituted vanilla and a hint of maple for the brandy. As long as you dont overcook them,(which I did with the second batch but only by a bit) they are an amazing cookie!! will certainly be using this frequently!!

The batter is delicious. I used vanilla instead of brandy. I broke up white chocolate bark I had which made some small pieces so may have limited the white chocolate flavor - so will def use white chocolate chips next time. I made some chocolate and butterscotch chip cookies out of the batter too but didn't love it.

Wonderful recipe! I did it exactly as written, with the brandy, and the cookies are fabulous with that nice hint of brandy, the sweet chocolate and the bit of tart from the dried cranberry.
So Yummy!

I loved this recipe!! They had great flavor and were hard not to eat!! I used vanilla instead of the Brandy and they still tasted great! Taking them out when they were cooked but a little doughy was a good decision! I will make these again for sure!

This recipe is too sweet! I decided to go with the recipe as is as I noticed many said the sugar amounts were still OK. I should have gone with other's reviews that actually modified the amount of sugar to less. My advice will be not only follow the modifications in sugar amounts other suggest and add your full 2 cups or flour. You will notice the difference!

This was a hit. I only had kirsch (cherry brandy) on hand, and it definitely gave the cookies that something special. We usually avoid white "chocolate," but this recipe (the brandy is essential, folks) is just too delicious!

So delicious. The dough comes out very soft and the combined flavors of the white chocolate and cranberry are so delicious! Prep is a snap. Will start using this cookie dough base for my basic chocolate chip cookies instead of my grandma's recipe :)

since i didn't have them, i swapped the white chocolate and brandy for mini milk chocolate chips and vanilla extract. i also cut the cranberries down to 3/4 cup and the white sugar to 1/4 cup based on other reviews, and the cookies turned out great! great consistency, and everyone loved them. if you end up using vanilla extract, though, i recommend using only half a tablespoon since there was a very strong vanilla presence.

I've been making this recipe for about 5 years now and get requests - no - DEMANDS for it every year.  My only modification is to sub about 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla and 1 tsp of orange extract for the brandy.  I also add about 1/2 tsp of salt to the recipe as it is a VERY sweet cookie.  I find the salt and the orange give it the perfect amount of punch to balance out the sweetness.  It really is the perfect Christmas cookie.

Everyone loved these cookies!  They are a very sweet cookie, though.  I substituted vanilla extract for the brandy and I also used margarine because that was what I had on hand.  Also, I used walnuts.  I will make these again soon!

I adapted this recipe to gluten free. Substituted my regular GF flour mix for the flour. Used 1 tsp baking soda. Add 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. And used 2 tsp vanilla in place of the brandy. (Oh, I also used 1/2 cup coconut sugar in place of the white sugar.) 
I used heaping teaspoons and ended up with 3 1/2 dozen small cookies, perfect size for pot luck.
Delicious!

I made with vanilla extract instead of the brandy.  Still incredibly tasty-everyone has loved them!  I pulled them out of the oven when they were still a little doughy, and they've remained soft for several days.

Loved this recipe.  I made these last year and the only change I made was that I used dark chocolate chips instead of white chocolate.  Everyone raved about these cookies and they are asking me this year when I am going to make those cranberry-dark chocolate cookies.

This is my 1st time trying it. I compared the recipe and technique to other recipes and they were the same. I used 1 tablespoon of peach brandy and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. The cookies I found were too sweet. For the 2nd batch, I sprinkled salt in it to minimize the sweetness. Well see if its better.

This is a great go-to recipe.  I have made many variations of this and they are always good.
The only change I make every time is I increase the chips to 1 cup.
I often double the recipe too.

The variation that I got the most complements on is when I substituted amaretto for the brandy and dried apricots (cut up) for the dried cranberries.  My favorite variation too!  :)

This recipe is sooo yummy!  My kids love it!  Don't get me wrong, I eat my fair share as well.
When I make it, I use 3/8 cup of white sugar (which I measure out as 1/4 cup plus half of a 1/4 cup), 3/8 cup brown sugar, a box of cheesecake pudding (just the powder so there aren't any questions), 2 tbs orange liqueur (I'll use Cointreau from the liquor store), 1 cup of white chocolate, 3/4 cup craisins (I like more white chocolate than cranberries).
I make them into 2 - 3 inch balls, mash them down a bit with a fork, and cook them at 350 for 12 minutes or until golden brown.  I, also, cook them on tin foil on a cookie sheet for easy clean up and so I don't have to use additional grease on a cookie sheet.
Anyone that I have made these for LOVE them and they will be in my Christmas baskets for family this year!

I made these cookies with over 1 1/2 cups of whole cranberries as suggested by another reviewer.  I also used vanilla instead of brandy.  They came out wonderfully!  I will definitely make them again using whole cranberries- they give the cookies a wonderful tart flavor.

This cookie was WAY to sweet.  I'm not big on salt but this cookie needed salt and a little baking powder.  Next time I will use orange zest too see if I can cut the sweet.  Great idea but just too sweet.

Made this recipe using Gran Marnier (orange liqueur) instead of the brandy, with added grated orange zest and a little bit of orange juice. I also reduced the white sugar somewhat. Since I was in a hurry, I pressed the dough into a lightly greased 11" X 17" jelly roll pan and baked it at 375F for 30 minutes or so. (I doubled the recipe to make 4 dozen cookies--regular recipe might fit in a 9" X 13" baking dish.) Cut the cookies into squares as soon as I took them out of the oven, but left them in the pan to cool. They were very good--a nice orange flavor to balance out the very sweet dough and the white chips.

As many of others, I don't have Brandy, so I used Vanilla extract or sometimes vanilla sugar, and I used only dark chocolate...they came out really good.

What a wonderful cookie, followed the recipe with the exception of the amounts of sugar, used a previous reviewer's suggestion that called for three quarters of a cup of brown, one quarter white. I find white chocolate chips very sweet and thought this idea would enhance the cookie's flavor. Great idea, and I highly recommend Trader Joe's organic brown sugar, for taste and ease of use. Didn't have enough of the called-for amount of white chips so I also used milk chocolate. So easy to put together in the stand mixer and baked up beautifully. I took them out before fully done and let them sit on the cookies sheet two minutes before removing. I think adding coconut would amp these up even more. Also, the brandy was a lovely compliment to the dried berries. Make these, they're a winner!

These are THE BEST cranberry cookies I have ever had!!! Definitely on the top of my list for best cookie recipe. Cranberries and white chocolate taste so good together, and it seems like the cranberries pop in your mouth! I only added 1/4 cup white sugar and it was the perfect amount. I also used 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of brandy. No nuts but they would probably taste good if you are a nut-lover. Bake them for 8 minutes - no longer or they might burn! I will definitely be using this cookie recipe for years to come!

Way too sweet for my taste and the brandy was lost, however the recipe made a lot of cookies and my family enjoyed them.  If I were to make this up again I'd use the brandy to make up a drizzle glaze for the cookies.

made them last night. Found that even while oven was pre-heated for 20 mins, after the 1st 10 mins in oven, I found that they needed more time in. Did another 10 mins, and found them to be better in color and texture.  Looking forward to making more.

I put an extra stick of butter in by mistake, and they turned into a gloopy delicious mess. Five stars nonetheless!

Sweet, so next time I'm going to try 1/3c white sugar, 1/2 white choc chips & more cranberries.  I did use vanilla instead of brandy so hope to get some brandy flavoring so I can try that also. Will make again.

These cookies are not only wonderfully tasty, but they bake up beautifully!  They are fluffy, doughy and soft.  These cookies do NOT flatten out, as many recipes do after baking.  I will use the basic dough to make chocolate chip cookies in the future as my chocolate chip cookie recipes all tend to come out flat.  These are fantastic and beautiful!

Fabulous!  I love the contrasting favors and textures of cranberry and white chocolate.  I used fresh cranberries, chopped them just a bit, then put them in a 250 degree oven for about 7 minutes. I tried a batch with whole cranberries but I liked chopped better.

I make these every Christmas. This year I gave them out and everyone loved them. Sometimes I use brandy, sometimes vanilla extract. They are a great texture and hold their shape well.

The flavor was okay, but I think I cooked them too long.  They were VERY hard.  But they weren't burned or even dark brown.  Don't care for a hard cookie.

Pretty good recipe, remember to stick the dough in the fridge for a bit to avoid spreading and add a pinch of salt to the dough (I add a tiny bit of salt to all my baked goods). 10 minutes in my oven was perfect, but all ovens vary so keep an eye on them. These are quite sweet so next time I think I'll cut out a 1/2 cup of the white sugar, but that's a matter of personal preference. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Received rave reviews from MANY people.  Then, because I don't like white chocolate, I made a batch with semi-sweet chips and they are yummalicious.  I think I like this cookie base better than the one I've been using for years.

Made it in 2012 and 2015; The second time, I cut sugar back to 3/4 cup, cut craisins back to 3/4 cup, and added ~1/3 cup chopped almonds. I also used vanilla and rum in place of the brandy. FYI, this cookie didn't spread AT ALL, so I could have placed many more on the same cookie sheet. I also had to flatten the cookies w a spatula about ~75% through cooking time since it was still little balls of dough.

This recipe is absolutely awesome! I used half of the amount of white sugar and 1/2 tablespoon of baking powder (instead of baking soda). The cookies are so tasty!

Thought these were great, the only change I made was I added an extra egg, the dough seemed really dry.  After the additional egg they turned out great.

I made these tonight and, like others, I didn't have brandy so I used vanilla extract. I also added a bit of orange zest to the mix. They were VERY good. I'd definitely cut back on the sugar some since they were a little too sweet for my taste. But, overall, they were a hit and I'll definitely be making them again.

This recipe was yummy. I think next time I would use chunks of white chocolate as opposed to white chocolate chips. I prefer a more prominent white chocolate flavour! And I don't think I could taste the brandy, but the cookies still tasted delicious.

Amazing recipe!  I also doubled the recipe as a previous suggestion and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup each.  I also added dark rum and vanilla pudding mix.  To add a little more, I drizzled a white chocolate rum glaze to the top of the cookies.  Yummy!!! :)

Every Christmas I try different cookie recipes but none ever really stuck, until now! This will be part of my Christmas cookie list every year! Easy to make, bake beautifully, and smell & taste divine! The dough alone tastes good and you could easily use this as a base for any number of cookies. I used 2 tsp of vanilla in place of the brandy. This is supposed to yield 2 dozen cookies but you can adjust the size to get more or less. If you are making these to giveaway, definitely make a double or triple batch. I got a little more because the first sheet were kind of small but I am giving these away at work so I will need to make more. I used parchment paper because the dough seemed very thick & sticky. They baked up golden brown at 8 minutes. I didn't find them to be too sweet but for those that do, I believe it's the chips that do it. If you go exactly as the recipe calls, these cookies are loaded with chips & cranberries. So you can easily reduce the amount of chips & cranberries to cut down on the sweetness. I just used Craisins & they turned out great! So happy I found this recipe.

I wanted to make white chocolate raspberry cookies but I couldn't find a recipe for what I wanted, so I found this recipe for white chocolate cranberry and followed it, except I substituted fresh raspberries for the cranberries and they came out great.

I used Chambord instead of Brandy.  I also doubled the dough recipe and used a 12 oz. bag of white chocolate chips and a 6 oz. pack of dried cranberries.

My family and I could not keep our hands off these cookies!  Had to make another batch to freeze for Christmas.  Easy to make, doesn't take a lot of time and they taste delicious.

After all of the rave reviews, I thought this would be the perfect cookie for our cookie exchange.  I decreased the white sugar by 1/3 but I thought the cookies were much too sweet! I even added 1 cup of shelled pistachios thinking the salted nuts would cut some of the sugar.    If I ever make them again, I would use 1/3 of the sugar recommended.  I've have much better cookies than this.

very nice cookies.  I modified by adding irish whiskey instead of brandy, two shots of espresso, 1 cup of chips, no cranberry, and a teaspoon of vanilla.  turned out amazing.

These were good the first day or two, but quickly got dry and crumbly after that.  The fact that they were still around for days let me know my family didn't love them.  Okay, but not amazing.

I LOVE these cookies!!  Some people change out the brandy with vanilla but I think it's the brandy that makes them special.  I have these on my Christmas cookie trays.  Be warned they will dry out pretty quick (it may have been my fault) but if that happens, very good with coffee or hot tea.

These turned out great!  I was in a hurry and didn't have brandy, so I substituted vanilla as many others did, and I just don't like white chocolate, so I used bittersweet chips.  And I accidentally added more molasses to one batch than I meant to (subbing for brown sugar with white sugar and molasses) and liked the result.  Soooooo yummy!  I'll definitely try to get brandy next time -  it sounds interesting!

These cookies were not what I expected.  I was surprised that most of the 650 reviews were 5 stars!  These looked great, and I was so excited, but I just didn't like the texture or flavor.  I do like the idea of adding brandy though, which we substituted for spiced rum.  Next time, I will make sand cookies, and simply add white chocolate, cranberries, and substitute the vanilla for rum.

These were awesome!!! I am a horrible cook, but these were very easy to make.  I also substituted vanilla for brandy and doubled the recipe.  I'll definitely make these again.  Would be great with milk chocolate or semi-sweet in place of (or in addition to) white chcolate.

Definitely use real cranberries, not dried! Spread frozen cranberries in a glass baking dish and put in oven, then turn the oven on to 250 degrees. Once oven is up to temp, set the timer for 8 minutes. The once frozen cranberries will come out soft and will then break open when they are baked in the cookies, spreading the cranberry goodness around inside the cookie. Makes about 30-35 small scoop cookies, but between the two of us the first batch was half gone before the second came out of the oven! I'm for sure freezing some dough next time!

Wonderfully good.  The first time the mixture was kind of dry so they didn't spread out while cooking.  The second time I doubled the batch (since the first time they were gone so quick) and the texture of the batter was perfect (not sure what I did the first time).  I used brandy and not vanilla like others suggested only because I had brandy.  My oven is pretty right on for cookies but I had to cook them for about 13 minutes.  Will make again and again!

I have used this recipe for years - it is a favorite and most requested.  I have always used cognac because it's what I had on hand the first time I made them.  The only alteration I make is to use 3/4 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup chips.

These cookies are melt in your mouth delicious! I took another's recommendation and used spiced rum instead of brandy. I also added just a few more cranberries than the recipe called for. I am excited to include a couple of batches in our Christmas cookie exchange at work.

Wonderful cookie.  The 2nd time we made them we added some walnuts and cut back a little on the white chocolate chips.  We need to double the recipe next time as they don't stay around long enough to have any for the next day.

Great new recipe to add to the fall baking collection!  So good...everyone that tried them loved them.  Only different thing I did was use vanilla instead of brandy simply because I didn't have any brandy on hand.  Enjoy!

Every other year or so I delay my preparation of these at Christmas time, and every time I do my family asks when we're going to have the "cranberry cookies".  It's become a holiday tradition!

Made them just as the recipe states and gosh are they good - for the brandy I used 2 Tablespoons of Grand Marnier, which is perfect for these (a bit of an orange flavor).  I will reduce the sugar next time though, a bit on the sweet side.  My new favorite cookie recipe!  I did have to cook for the full 10 minutes.

I'd give this 4.5 stars.  I've made these cookies several times.  I reduce the sugar.  They are very sweet cookies.  I use parchment paper so they stay fluffy and soft.

WATCH THESE COOKIES!! They taste great... IF you manage to get them out while they are still a bit raw in the middle, and then leave them to cool on the baking trays for a few minutes.. If you leave them cook even a minute or two longer than they need, you'll have hard, brittle cookies.. not the soft gooey scrummy things you want!

This cookie is pretty good. I didn't have brandy so used vanilla instead. I didn't think they were too sweet like many others said. What do people expect? Cookies are usually sweet. The cookie part seemed kind of plain to me so I played around with this recipe a bit as well after making it as written (with the exception of the brandy) by adding butter, changing the brown/white sugar proportions and adding oatmeal. I liked the cookie better with the changes. Experiment a bit to determine what you like best.

These cookies were really good...however I found them a bit too sweet, so I rolled them in finely chopped pecans and they turned out perfect! I also soaked the cranberries in the brandy and really think that the brandy made these cookies...they didn't last two days!

These were ok, how bad can a cookie be. I followed recipe except did not have any brandy so used vanilla instead.  They were very sweet so I should have cut back on the sugar like others said.  I love cranberry's and white chocolate but will probally try a different recipe next time.

This is a great recipe! I have made it multiple times with great results. You really have to take it out of the oven after 10mins though for the best results! Try this recipe - your friends will love it!

I substituted raisins and rum for cranberries and brandy since I didn't have any. I soaked the raisins in hot water for 10 min and then in a little amount of rum. I baked them in 10 mins, then 9 mins, then 8 as the oven got hotter. These cookies are dangerous. They get better over time. I can't stop eating them.

I get great feedback when making these cookies! The only thing I do different is I use Almond extract instead of the brandy. I also use real butter. They are always good!

Yummy! And they couldn't be easier to bake, and I don't even like to bake.  LOL! The brandy really makes these extra-special, but I bet you do other liquers with great reslts.  Amaretto would be delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made these for every cookie swap I've participated in for the last few years.  I have always received rave reviews and will gladly continue sharing them with friends, family, and business associates.  The best part...they're soooo easy to prepare!  Now, that's my kind of cookie!  :)  Thanks for sharing, Diane!  I look forward to many more years of treating my loved ones to these delicious desserts.

I made these for my openhouse and my friends thought they were Otis Spunkmeyer cookies! 
Instead of brandy I used vanilla, and instead of dried cranberries I used Craisins.

Yum!  so good & different.
I used amaretto instead of the brandy & cranraisins instead of the dried cranberries & they were excellent.  I'm always looking for something out of the ordinary & plan to take these to a cookie exchange this weekend.  Great recipe!!!

These cookies are wonderful! I baked them for a reception for a board member at work and everyone loved them! I will be baking for Christmas gifts and sending them. I think they will ship well. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and subbed. vanilla for brandy. I have thought of using orange rum that we brought back from Bahamas. Orange goes great with cranberry. I double the recipe. This is a forever keeper! Thanks!

These cookies were so delicious.  I have people begging me for the recipe.  I used the vanilla extract instead of the brandy and they turned out perfect.  One little suggestion that I have is to use a cookie scoop.  The cookies turned out soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Thank you very much for the recipe.

so good! i used vanilla instead of brandy as i didn't have any brandy on hand... then added about a half a cup of walnuts. oh, and reduced the white sugar. they are still super sweet so really glad i did that. very yummy and so easy and quick!

I honestly thought when I was making the dough that I would rate these 3 stars. As the dough turned out a little dry and instead of dropping them onto the cookie sheet I had to sort of squash them on. But this may well have been something I did. However the proof of the cookie is in the eating and these were delicious, crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. A definite 5 star recipe that I wiil be making to take into work on Christmas Eve without a doubt. Thankyou Diane.

I did not have brandy so I used amaretto instead, but did not taste it in the finished product. Perhaps the brandy would have been better. I cut down on the sugar as others suggested.

A little too sweet for my family's taste. I'd reduce the sugar next time. However, the cranberries and the white chocolate were a great combination!

yup this is definately one of the nicest cookies i've ever tasted! however, if you are using pre-sliced cranberries(the hard kinds), be sure to soak them for awhile or it'll be hard and a little difficult to chew when eating them! i'll try using half melted butter and half softened butter next time, and see whether i get the chewy-cookies type.

The recipe was fabulous and the cookies are delicious, but I think next time I will use 1/2 c. of white chocolate chips instead of 3/4 c. to take the sweet edge off.

I used amaretto instead of brandy and added a tsp of almond extract. They're good but some say they are overstuffed? I liked them. You can play around with the flavors. Definately halve the sugars, I did and it was plenty sweet.

Very delicious if you like sweet cookies (which I do!)!  I followed others' suggestions and used less sugar, added half a teaspoon of both vanilla and almond extract, and added a half teaspoon salt.  Dried cranberries worked out just fine for me, and I think the brandy did add a special flavor to the cookies.  One mistake I made was putting the batter in the refrigerator for a little bit (since I got busy and started doing something else), and I think that caused the cookies to not expand as much (they kept the round ball shape too well).

Mmm!

These cookies tasted really good, but I would actually decrease the white chocolate chips to 3/4 cup (it was a little sweet) and replace the 1/4 cup with more cranberries. I agree with another reviewer that fresh cranberries are way better.

These are nice and chewy the way I like them (used butter-flavored Crisco), but I think the recipe could call for a little salt.

Yummy...everyone loves when I bring these to parties.  I use half marg/shortening in place of the butter.  In place of the brandy I use 1 tsp. Almond Extract.  I also, add pecans or walnuts to the mixture at the end.  I do not grease the cookie sheets and I bake at 350 F instead of 375.  These are just my personal preferences.

Appearance: Very good. When held, it was weak that it broke cos I used the wrong baking temp. (175C instead of 190C). MUST REDUCE SUGAR BY 1/4 OF THE USUAL AMT AT LEAST. But I didn't know the cookies would turn out to be chewy thought they would be like Famous Amos's. Sad. I rebaked the old cookies @ 190 C THE NEXT MORNING and it became HARDER but still chewy. GREAT FOR THOSE WHO LOVE CHEWY COOKIES. GREAT SMELL.

Very sweet.  My boys loved them, so I just adjusted the sugar by half.  I also made them again with the splenda sugars and they turned out great- the amount produced was decreased.

These turned out too sweet and flat. I will try them again to see if I did something wrong but for now it gets a 3.

Yum, Yum and YUM!!!  Don't make unless you plan on eating them all by yourself!  I used vanilla because we didn't have Brandy and used thawed cranberries from the freezer instead of the craisins.  This is excellent and will definately be making again.  My new favorite cookie recipe!

Good cookies I used cherry cranberries and vanilla although brandy would be good I didnt have any also almond extract would be nice. Great holiday cookie too. And it made just enough cookies.

I made these for a niece's December college graduation and everyone loved them. I made a triple batch and had to keep refilling the platter. They are easy to make; I followed the recipe and wouldn't make any changes. They are pretty and so tasty!

These cookies are awesome!  I made them for a party and everyone wanted the recipe.
Just be sure to mix them in a large bowl. Once I started adding all the "add ins", the bowl I usually use for cookies was too small.

Am I the only one that found these cookies to have WAY too much butter in them? Maybe I made them wrong, but next time I will use like half the butter. I did like the taste of the white chocolate and the cranberries though.

These were very good.  I followed some of the other responses by adding vanilla instead of brandy.  Thanks for a keeper.  I like that I have a different cookie recipe to make instead of the usual chocolate chip or oatmeal ones.

Really good.  I add Captain Morgan's spiced rum instead of brandy.  The flavor really comes out the next day.  I think they are a little sweet because of the white chocolate.  I add less chips and that helps.

I made these cookies for a function at church and they were a huge hit!  The only changes I made was to use vanilla instead of brandy and I increased the chips to 1 cup.

These are incredible cookies!  I made them this weekend after a trip to the natural food grocery store where I bought the dried cranberries.  Took some to a party we went to and everyone loved them.  Nice sweet flavor.  I did add chopped walnuts.

These are wonderful. The addition of 1/2 teaspoon of salt really brings the flavors out. I chopped the dried cranberries into small pieces and lined the baking sheet with parchment, and was very happy with the result. The brandy was a different and lovely addition. Exactly 8 minutes was the perfect baking time for us. Highly recommend!

These cookies are every bit as delicious as everyone who reviewed them said. I'm not fond of white chocolate, and no one in my family cares for cranberries, but everyone *loves* these cookies. And they really do turn out picture perfect for gift giving. These cookies will become a permanent part of my Holiday baking tradition!

I think if I made these again, I would add a little more brandy. I could hardly taste it. The one thing I wasn't particularly fond of with these cookies was that they weren't very soft. I may try them again, only cooking them for a little less time.

Great recipe, although both times I made it I used semisweet choco chips instead of white, and everyone thought they were great. I brought them to a party and received a lot of compliments. I used brandy once and vanilla once and it came out great both time, but I think I like it with the brandy better.

chocolate cut into chunks rather than chips and decreased the white chocolate to a half cup, then added 1/2 cup coarsely chopped macadamia nuts.

Excellent cookie recipe...the only change i made was I added orange cognac instead of brandy.  Next time I will double the orange cognac!

These cookies were fabulous.  I didn't have any brandy, so I used vanilla.   They were very rich and my family loved them!

These are excellent!!!  The white chocolate gives it a smooth sweet taste while the cranberries give it a tangy zing.  Will definitely make them again.

These are wonderful!  Some reviews said they were too sweet.  I doubled the recipe and used approx 3/4 cup of each sugar.  I added 1/4 tsp salt, and used 2 tsp vanilla instead of the 2TBS brandy.  I split the dough in half and made half white chocolate/cranberry and the other half regular chocolate chip.  This is my new favorite!  I made them fairly small, they didn't spread much at all and came out high and soft, with golden edges.  They're very pretty.

I made these using ginger brandy and they were excellent!  Like others said, a great alternative to regular chocolate chip cookies.  I was afraid that 1 cup of cranberries would be too much, but it's not!  These will probably become one of my 'regular' Christmas cookies.

I really liked these cookies (I got a taste when a co-worker made them this week for Christmas). When I made them tonight, I doubled the recipe, but used 1 cup white sugar, and 3/4 cup dark brown; also added 1/2 tsp salt.  Instead of doubling the white chips, I used 1 cup, and added 3/4 cup chopped macadamia nuts, and then used 2 cups Craisins (already sweetened - got a huge bag at Costco). Used a cookie scooper that measures 1 1/4 inch in diameter and pressed lightly down on the balls when I placed them on my Silpat mat (no greasing needed!).  Very yummy! A tad sweeter and saltier than I would like, probably due to my salted butter, salted nuts and the added salt.  NExt time (which may be tomorrow!), I will omit the salt, reduce brown sugar to 1/2 cup for a double recipe, use light brown sugar instead and I think the results will be perfect!  I enjoyed making these - was getting tired of the usual chocolate chip cookies.

Presentation wise, they came out great.  They were a little on the sweet side, so if I make them again I may use some of the additions suggested in the reviews.  Overall, a tasty cookie!

My parents absolutely LOVE the cookies! I halved the sugar, replaced brandy with whisky and had some cashew nuts instead of choc chips. They were wonderful and I'm definitely making them in my christmas party next week.

these coookies are okay, but you really need to add more flour, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup.  they also needed a little salt.  my first batch i made exactly as the recipe said and they cookies were completely flat and greasy thin!  oh, and i think it helps to chill the dough before baking!

These were SO delicious. I used the vanilla plus 1/2 tsp of salt. I also used fresh cranberries, chopped coarsly in the food processor. The tart cranberries were so good in the sweet cookie, and the bright red looks really festive.

I took in all reviews.  I doubled batch and used 2 sticks butter, 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1Tbs vanilla(didn't have brandy), 2 1/2 cup flour, 1tsp baking soda, 1tsp salt, 1 bag white chocolate chips, and 1 very heaping cup of cranberries.  I tried to keep the dough close to my favorite choc chip cookie recipe.  And they came out great.  They make a nice accent in my cookie tins.

Wow, these were great! I had planned on making a batch of cookies for my best friend's christmas present this year and wasn't sure what kind to make, so I decided on these since I recently bought a huge bag of dried cranberries at Costco. I don't usually like white chocolate but these surprised me.

I hope these can make it to the christmas giveaway trays for friends!  These are absolutely scrumptious!  Such a different take on a chip cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly *except I doubled the recipe* and they came out like a picture.  They are rich but are balanced by the tartness of the cranberry.  I used the bourbon and had to go out and buy a bottle but that is okay, I intend on using it in the recipe on here for bourbon chicken!  (which also gets rave reviews).  I think I will use the rest of the cranberries and white chips in some downeast Maine pumpkin bread(also a great recipe on here).  Nothing will go to the back of the cupboard with these leftover ingredients.

Wonderful!  I made these exactly as described and they went quickly.  I made them for a friend's Christmas party and had to hide them to avoid showing up empty handed.  The only thing I would do differently is make a double batch next time. Thank you!

Great cookie!  I brought some of these to work and they were a hit.  Some even said they were the best cookie ever!  This is a great christmas cookie - the combination of the white chocolate and the cranberries is appropriate for the season.  I doubled the batch, used both shortening and butter and used vanilla instead of brandy because I had none on hand.  They turned out very soft - even days later.  I'll make this every Christmas!

Personally I didn't care for these cookies, but in all fairness I don't like white chocolate.  My dh gives them 4 stars, though - and has been munching on them for the last couple of nights.  I don't think this will be one I'll make again, however.

Watch out if you are on a diet  - these were so good i ate nearly half the batch straight away .I used lowfat "butter"  because its all I had. I used about 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the brandy because some people i share these with at work have alcohol allergies, and i used only about 3/4 cup sugar total (as some reviews suggested). These were just FABULOUS.  Maybe I WONT bring them in to work...

Ooooooh man these are good!  I followed the recipe exactly and took them out of the oven while they were doughy and that's perfect.  I used pastry flour and all organic ingredients. Very pure tasting!  A definite keeper!

I made a double batch of these cookies, and added 1/2tsp salt and used rum instead of brandy.  They are tasty!  If I had read the reviews before I made the recipe I probably would have used a bit less sugar, since they are pretty sweet.  I don't know if they are special enough to be giving as presents, but they are good.  Mine stayed nice and plump, did not spread out at all.  I baked them at 350 (I have dark pans) for 10 minutes, and they are still nice and chewy.  It is nice to have a drop cookie option for christmas cookies!

This recipe is great!  If you use vanilla instead of the brandy they will be very sweet so I suggest using un-sweetened cranberries.  I also cut the cranberries to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup slivered almonds.  They were a big hit at my cookie exchange last year and I get a lot of calls for the recipe!  Good Luck & happy eating!

I took these to a cookie exchange last night and everyone LOVED them! They smell so good. The only change I made was adding less cranberries and white chocolate, as I didn't want them to be overloaded. It took a while for the dough to come together, but it did eventually! (and tasted great, too)

These were excellent.  Even better than I thought they would be.  I used exactly what is in the recipe and I used real butter.  YUMMMMM... they are going on my Christmas plates for all my co-workers.  Can't wait to get their reaction.

After all the great reviews for this recipe, I was thoroughly disappointed.  I was looking for something to make for a cookie exchange.  Now I have to look for something else.  I won't be making this again.

This was a very good cookie. I actually added 1 cup of walnuts to the recipe and it turned out very tasty, but maybe it was a bit much as in that there wasnt that much cookie dough around all these extras, so next time I will still add walnuts but probably not as many and also put less chocolate chips and cranberries. Also, I would like to try this with Vanilla instead of Brandy. My husband loved them and so did my dad!!

These are great!!! very simple. I adjusted the recipe to make them in a pan instead of drop cookies. They were a big hit with my family. I considered adding some oats, but didnt, but i do think this may add to the overall cookie..So simple to make I will have plenty of time to make more before christmas! Happy holiday!:)

These are a nice alternative to plain choc chip.  They would make a great addition to a holiday goodies basket for families with nut allergies.  I used craisins as others had suggested and found they were a little sweet so next time will reduce the sugars by half to compensate for the added sweetness of the craisins.

I made this recipe yesterday as my husband and son were getting home from work.  They LOVED them!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did not have any brandy on hand. I used 1/2 teaspoon of brandy extract.  Found out after almost 30 yrs of marriage that my husband really likes white chocolate.  Will make again soon!

This cookie was ok. I expected it to be great. I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand and personal preference. I used semisweet chocolate chips( hate white) and captain morgans rum. It was ok nothing I'd be craving to make again but a nice change from the same old choc. chip. Thanks

I was hesitant to make these cookies because at first there didn't seem much to it.  But that's the best part.  I was soooo impressed how much flavor there was in these and how delcious they were.  A definate recommendation!!  Easy to make, which is good cause you'll have to make more after you make them once.  :)

This cookie was ok.    I guess I am not a big fan of white chocolate, but I may make the dough and just  use chocolate chips and macadamia nuts instead.

This cookie is by far the best and easiest cookie I have tasted in a long time.  I added it to my cookie trays this year and it was the first cookie to disappear!

I used vanilla instead of brandy. I thought the cookie was ok - nothing too special but good enough.

I made this recipe as it was written except I used brandy extract.  They turned out perfect.  Two days later the cookies are still soft and flavorful.  I would recommend this recipe to everyone!

These are excellent! I altered it the recipe a bit. I used vanilla instead of brandy and I added 1/2 cup of zante currants and 1/4 (or so) cup of toasted pecans. 

I had my family/friends try them before I revealed the recipe and ingredients. They were surprised how much they liked these cookies!

I, too, had really high expectations of this recipe.  The flavor was really good, but my cookies spread out too thin and looked little like the picture.  They were so thin that about 1/3 of them broke as I tried to take them from the pan to the wire racks.  I used all margarine...could that be a problem?  Not sure if I'll try this one again.

Wonderful flavor.  I used half butter and half margarine.  Would maybe use all margarine to prevent spreading next time.  Didn't have brandy so used 2 t of brandy extract and they were delicious.

These cookies are amazing. I used imitation rum extract instead of brandy and used cherry craisins. They came out moist and delicious and I can barely keep my hands out of the cookie jar. I will be making more tonight to give out in my Christmas cookie boxes. They are a new favourite.

This was just ok. Nothing spectacular. I used vanilla instead of Brandy and used Craisins for the cranberries. I was looking for a different taste then what I got. But, everyone else seemed to enjoy them so far. So, for their sake, I will make again.

I made this recipe last night and the cookies were simply delicious!  I had a few people taste test them when they were done and everyone was raving about them! I do not bake alot and was pleasantly surprised about how easy these cookies were to make.  My mother claimed that they were the best cookie she has ever eaten! I may add some chopped macadamia nuts to the next batch.  Thank you for such a great recipe.  I plan on making them for the holidays and for a cookie exchange party.

I made these for a cookie exchange & they were wonderful.  I added chopped macadamia nuts to this also.  WONDERFUL!  I left the sugar amounts alone and only added the nuts - and they were fabulous.  TAKE out before they get to brown.  The soft chewy cookie is better than a drier one.

Oh My Tummy Thanks you!  I made this for our Brownie troop outing to carol at Senior Centers.  They loved them very much and so did I.  I was worried I wasn't going to have 12 to take by the time I was done tasting them to see if they were right.  he he :)

I tried this as a trial run for Christmas.  This will be added to what I make.  The only change is that I  used the Award Winning Chocolate Chip Cookie dough as it makes a nice and soft cookie dough.  I used 1 1/2 teas. vanilla extract but I might try brandy with the next round.  They will make a good gift as well!

Very good, almost too intimidating for my family.  For some reason the cranberry/white chocolate combo just put them off.  I think these would be great for a ladies tea, but not so much for a kids birthday party.

This cookie is very good!  Not being a fan of white chocolate, I was pleasantly surprised that the combination of the white chocolate and cranberries went together so well!  Bake them for 8 minutes as the recipe states (taking them out while they're still doughy) for yummiest!  Instead of buying a bottle of brandy, I substituted brandy extract (1 1/2 tsp.)!  The brandy flavor is wonderful in this holiday keeper!

Oh. Wow. I planned on making these for Christmas presents, but they didn't last. I had no brandy, substituted with cherry flavoring. I had fresh cranberries, followed another reviewers advice for putting them in the oven to soften them. My husband wouldn't let me give these away. I managed to sneak some for my son's teachers, and they both loved them. Now I need to get more cranberries so I can make these again!

This recipe is great!  I made these before Thanksgiving and baked 1/4 of the dough for part of my dessert tray then froze the rest of the dough.  I made the remaining dough for Christmas and both times they were a huge hit.  This is a keeper!

These cookies were pretty good. I didn't have the problem of them not spreading. They spread on their own. Everyone seemed to like these. I think a little bit of orange zest would've made these even yummier. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought that these were pretty good, but a little too sweet to be a staple in my home.  Next time I would use 1/2 cup of white chips instead.  I did substitute 1 tbsp of vanilla for the brandy - maybe that was too much and added to the ultra-sweetness?

These are the BEST cookies - I made them for Christmas and my husband ate so many before the holiday, I had to make more! I didn't have brandy, so I used amaretto instead and they came out great!

These were wonderful.  I made quite a lot of cookies ( I made them smaller) and gave them away as gifts at Christmas.  These are great for people who have had enough of chocolate chip cookies and are looking for something other than oatmeal.

I made these cookies today for a christmas cookie tray.  They are super!  I love them!  One of my favorite cookies ever.  I didn't have brandy so I used vanilla extract also.  They are the best cookies on the tray!!  Enjoy!

The perfect cookie for holidays loaded with chocolate, this has a beautiful blend of tart and sweet, as well as a nice semi-crunchy semi-chewy texture. Excellent.

This was a great holiday cookie for me- I sent little tins of them out across the country, and people loved them!  I think adding nuts would really create a wonderful cookie, and I plan to do that next time.

Simply delicious!  Definitely double these, as everyone really loved them!  I have used vanilla & rum, but still not brandy.  I can't wait b/c they're already great, but probably even better w/ the brandy!  Easy, look good & a huge hit!  A definite keeper to my X-Mas collection!

This was a fantastic cookie.  Delicious and festive looking.  I used cherry flavored craisins and they were terrific.  I also drizzled some melted milk chocolate over them to dress them up.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks.

Nice cookie, I used vanilla also, the real stuff not extract, they turned out very well.  Next time I may use a more expensive flavorful chocolate, as the cranberry taste is so strong, you can't really taste the chocolate.

Pretty good; the white chocolate & cranberry combo worked out better than when I'd previously tried something like this with dried blueberries (which everyone assumed were raisins. Expensive raisins!). I subbed Grand Marnier for the brandy, & the haunting orange flavor worked well with them. I am considering soaking the cranberries in it before mixing (to plump) for a bit next time.

Fabulous recipe for the holidays.  Very easy and well-liked by everyone.  Even people who do not like cranberries liked these.  Awesome!

These are amazing!!! I made them for my family for Christmas and they beat out every other cookie on the table.  I also used the same recipe with Chocolate Chips and vanilla and they were the best Chocolate Chip cookies I have ever tasted.

These cookies were a "HIT" at Christmastime and fantastic with egg nog.  I will definitely add this recipe to the annual Christmas cookie-baking.
