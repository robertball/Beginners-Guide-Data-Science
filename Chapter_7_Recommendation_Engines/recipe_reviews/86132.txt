Great recipe with a cute name! I served over crushed ice as it really knocks you back...

Loved it...followed the advice of the other reviewers and added "malibu rum" and some pinapple juice.  Thanks for a delicious and refreshing drink. (Now one of my favorites.)

This is a great recipe - but you HAVE to add a splash of pineapple juice to the top!  My husband requested this from the bar at our wedding reception.  The bartender had never heard of it, but by the end of the night, I'm sure he'll never forget the recipe - everyone wanted one!  But you HAVE to add the pineapple juice!  This woo-woo will make you scream, "Woo-hoo!"

I order this drink every time I go out! It's so much fun to sip, and all my friends who try it ask for the recipe (even the guys). The only thing I add is a marachino cherry.

I have never measured this, but it's fantastic.  I use much more cranberry juice in the ratio.

This is pretty good, but it's very strong. Next time I will shake equal amounts of everything with ice in a cocktail shaker and serve it as a martini.

I have just tried this cocktail, and I must say its tasty...AND strong!! Adding Pineapple juice does improve it. A drink which is best suited on a warm, sunny day relaxing with friends.

We made this in a pitcher by mixing 1 bottle of each the peach schnapps and vodka and 2 bottles of the cranberry at a friends Christmas party - it was a hit! Very tastey and it went fast. will be making this a lot more in the future.

Really yummy with the splash of pineapple juice others recommended.  Tasty buzz. I love the name!

I used peach brandy & I agree the pineapple juice is a must! (I added about an oz) I tried it first before adding it & I don't know that I would have been able to get this drink down if I hadn't. I garnished w/ a frozen peach slice on a pretty cocktail stick...can't wait until I can nibble on it. I was planning on trying it w/ coconut rum on the second one but I think I'll stop at one...these are potent!

This was just okay, even though I love all the ingredients that go into it.  I think it was not enough cranberry juice for my liking.

Oh, these go down easy! I followed the recipe almost exactly (2 jiggers of cranberry and 1 of pineapple juice) and went HEAVY on the juice- simply because I wanted more than one.  YUM!  High praise from me and my mom!  I may take these to our girls night next week for the girls to sample.  ;-)  Thanks!!

YUMMY!!! We made these tonight and I agree with the previous reviewer who suggested pineapple juice, and we also added coconut rum. Slurp! :)
