I absolutely loved this recipe!  Very tasty and surprisingly sweet due to the corn and peas.  The first time I made it I accidentally left out the tomatoes.  The next time I made it I made sure to add them, but decided I liked the salad better without the tomatoes.  Maybe fresh tomatoes would be nice, but the flavor of the canned tomatoes was just too strong for me.  Overall, excellent low fat, high fiber salad with great taste!

Loved this after a few changes. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used fresh plum tomatoes, diced, & I added a can of black beans. It got rave reviews at a recent party. I think I'll try a balsamic dressing next time. This is an excellent recipe, & it makes lots!

Wonderful tasting salad!  I did not use the canned tomatoes, I used fresh tomatoes from my garden and added some italian seasoning.  I also had some banana peppers from the garden, so I chopped one and  tossed a 1/4 cup so so of into the bowl.  One other change, I added just a pinch of sugar to the dressing  because I like a sweet vinegar dressing.
Very good recipe.

Yummy-yummy-yummy!  I made this while helping our daughter move in TX, mid-July.  All enjoyed it, even the young men!  Makes a huge bowl.  Would be great for a picnic.  It will become one of my "keepers."

I was really looking forward to this recipe since I am trying to increase my families fiber.  I didn't care for the flavors in this at all.  I will not be making this again.  It was really bland and even marinating overnight didn't help.

I have never in my life liked bean salad... until THIS RECIPE!
I used 1/2 tsp crushed garlic, and omitted the onions.  I substituted the 1/2 cup of green pepper for 2 full cups of red and yellow pepper.  
I can't rave enough about it.  This salad is delicious - I can't wait to share it with my family!!!  ;-)

Wasn't really popular at the dinner where I served it.  A couple of people loved it but they were big fans of beans.  Most passed it up or left it on their plate.

It is so easy to make & very tasty. I did make a couple of changes. 1. Used yellow bell pepper... that was what I had. 2. Added some dried sweet basil. It was so good! Thanks!

I'm not sure why, but I just really didn't like this salad.  I think it may have been the canned tomatoes - cold canned tomatoes aren't my thing.  Plus, this recipe makes a LOT, so we were eating leftovers for days.  If I make it again, I'd cut it in half at least, and probably use fresh cherry tomatoes.

Excellent low-fat salad! When I made it again recently, I made the following changes: no tomato, used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar...and then I added in two cups of rice.  Chilled it for a day and it was amazing.

I made this with our dinner tonight and it was very good.  I doubled the dressing (I used red wine vinegar) and I had to substitute white kidney beans (also called Cannelli beans) as that was all I had.  I used a sweet onion (Valdelia) and I also substituted red bell pepper and was very pleased - I think that it how I will make this again.  The peas add a little sweetness to balance the tart flavor of the dressing.  During the summer, I believe the addition of some fresh basil would be very nice.

This is a keeper for me and will be added to my picnic file as well.

Tastes really good- nice change from the usual salad.  Makes ALOT!  I also added some feta cheese on top right before serving and used raspberry vinegarette dressing to cut down on the tart-ness.

A very healthy salad with lots of veggies.  I didn't like the garlic after-taste in the salad otherwise it is ok.

The most palatable of bean salads that I have made.This was quite good. None left at the end. I did not have time to chill it for 4 hours. Just mixed it up and ate, still pretty good. Thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious. I took it to a party and everyone who tried it raved about it. People seemed to like eating with chips like a dip. This is perfect for parties since it makes so much. After a while I tossed in some feta cheese which added an extra kick. I may also try it with balsalmic vinegar which I think will add more flavor but I am definitely going to make this again.

This was ok. It definitely made a ton. There was little dressing taste so I would add more red wine vinegar next time. I would like to try it with fresh tomatoes as well. I am also going to make rice and mix this in. I would make again in a pinch but 2 stellar salad's are Edie's Potatosalata and Bodacious broccoli salad.

This recipe makes a lot of bean salad. I would recommend it for picnics and BBQ's. It's a nice change from the standard mac and potato salads. The only downfall is that if you eat it for leftovers you have to stif it everytime because the liquids all fall to the bottom. Doesn't take much to fill up on it either.

good recipe....nice change from the greek-style salads i usually eat....the apple cider vinegar gave it a really unique taste....i think that is the key ingredient that metamorphises this dish from an ok recipe to a recipe with some snap to it....also very healthy....healthy and tasty - count me in!

I thought this was a delicious, easy recipe.  It went great with grilled chicken!  I made a little extra dressing for the salad, and also increased the amount of vinegar, because I like a nice kick!  Needed a bit more salt than called for, too.  Otherwise, a fantastic salad that I will make again!

This is wonderful!  I have been looking for tasty high-fiber salads and I love this one!  I couldn't find garbanzo beans in a can, so I used the white canelli beans instead and it is scrumptious!

Easy, tasty, and healthy. Would not change a thing.
