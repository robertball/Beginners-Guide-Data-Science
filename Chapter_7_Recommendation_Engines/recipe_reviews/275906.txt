10.27.19  I baked in three mini-loaf pans for 35 minutes at 350ºF, and probably should have checked for doneness at 32 minutes, as they turned out just a bit dry.  But that’s my fault, not the recipe’s. Really didn’t get the tang from the apple cider, that I was looking for, but I did like the sweetness of the cranberries and the walnuts enhanced the texture.  The distinctive flavor is the cranberries, and honestly, in the end, this doesn’t taste that much different than other quick breads that I’ve made with nuts and dried cranberries.  I had a couple very ripe bananas on hand, and I think the addition of one of them may have added some moistness to the texture, and that’s not meant to be a negative because this is good bread!  Enjoyed, and thanks for sharing our recipe.
