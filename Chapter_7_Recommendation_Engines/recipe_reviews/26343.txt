This recipe was no doubt quick and easy; however, it was simply disappointing (where is the orange coloring typical of etoufee recipes) and, if I had not edited the ingredients, would have been completely inedible (i.e., used 1/4 cup of garlic powder instead of the full 1 cup that the recipe indicated).  Considering the expense of seafood, I would choose to use mine differently next time.

We have decreased the amount of garlic powder in this recipe to 1 tablespoon. We believe the 1 cup was a mistakenly typed in by the submitter.

I have no idea why this recipe has not been rated more often but it's one of the best that i have come across and I'm from Louisiana! I have also prepared this using shrimp and scallops and it works really well with both. The BEST!

This was delicious! Didnâ€™t have mushrooms but used fresh garlic, added yellow onions and threw in spinach. Used a pound of frozen pre cooked crawfish so I needed to thicken sauce a little with corn starch.  Will definitely make this again!

I can't get fresh crawfish where I live and frozen are $5.00 each so I went with large shrimp and scallops. I cut the portions back to three and served it over linguini. I looked everywhere but there was no creole seasoning so I used cajun.  I rarely made the same recipe twice but this will be a repeat! Thanks for sharing
