Well, now, I'm surprised. This just didn't sound like it would work-and all that thyme!! Well, it did! I reduced the clam juice to a little over three cups and it improved the overall texture, making it less runny. I did not drain the clams, so that added still a little more liquid. I was very pleased with the result upon first cooking it and enjoyed it for lunch for several days after. It reheats well. I originally served it with garlic read, and then added saome cut-up bread to the soup bowl befroe reheating. That was fun too.
