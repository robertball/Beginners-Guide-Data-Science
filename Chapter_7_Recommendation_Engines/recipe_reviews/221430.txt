This recipe turned out great.  My husband is from Brazil and has been wanting me to try making these, forever.  We used this recipe, and he said it was very similar to what he eats when he's home.  Follow the recipe as is.  I cooked them for the full 20 minutes.

Loved this recipe!   Gluten free, a carb we can eat AND it makes a delightful & handy little bread.    I've already made a 2nd batch and rolled out tennis-ball-sized pizza shells.   Baked them until starting to brown, added toppings and WOW.   The BEST gluten free pizza EVER - crispy and definitely able to handle tomato sauce, piles of cheese and pepperoni. THANK YOU.

After trying a similar roll at a Whole Foods sample day, I pleased to find this GF recipe. Used coconut milk instead of dairy, next time will try dairy. Cooked full 20 minutes, made closer to 30 rolls.

You can also use butter, and even leave out the cheese, if you want. Very good basic recipe.

The consistency is not the same as the Brazilian version. The proportions of ingredients are not correct. Too much butter, not enough tapioca...the rolls are suppose to grow. It still tasted good, but this is not the correct recipe!

I loved this recipe! Rather than doing just parmesan cheese I did half Cheddar, half parmesan. I also did 1/3 cup of oil because 1/2 cup was too much the first time 'round.

The key for my success was whisking up 2 large eggs but I only used 1+ (one attempt using 2 eggs, the dough was too wet and didn't hold its shape when rolled and we ended up with cheese coins). I used butter instead of oil and baked in a convection oven for 15-20 minutes, watching them the last 5ish minutes to avoid browning the bottoms too much. The tapioca flour firms up with time so the 15 minutes rest is a very important step. My Brazilian friend said these were perfect.

These turned out wonderfully, just like at the Brazilian steakhouse I went to once.  I can't get over how easy they were to make--the results were delicious!  No changes made to the recipe.

I made these as an appetizer. We all liked them, including kids. The texture is nice--if you've had bubble tea with tapioca pearls, or Japanese mochi, it's very similar. Except these are crunchy on the outside, and savoury. Nice at room temp, but super-delish fresh out of the oven. I was a little hasty when rolling them so they aren't as smooth as some of the other pics, but I am sure that made no impact on taste! Would definitely make again. BTW, I halved the recipe and made 12 rolls.  And HINT: if you can't find tapioca flour/starch (same thing), try the international/ethnic, especially East Asian, section in the market.

This was loved by my gluten free husband and all of my non-gluten free family members. I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was using melted butter because I did not have vegetable oil.

This was delicious...thank you for sharing.  The only change I made was to use Farmers Cheese instead of Parmesan.  I still used 6 ounces of cheese which is slightly more than 2/3 cup. My batter yielded 28 rolls (without measuring) as stated in the recipe.  I baked for exactly 20 minutes, cooled on a rack for 5 minutes and the rolls were perfectly cooked inside and out. Not much effort to make using a stand mixer.  Thanks again!

My family loves these things. I made them like this once and now I add diced green chilies when mixing in the cheese and egg. So easy and delicious!
