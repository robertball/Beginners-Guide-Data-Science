This recipe is cool and refreshing...great on a summer afternoon. The only thing I did different is I beat the cream cheese lemon dill salt and garlic powder together and then hand mixed in the cucumber and cheese. Its so good and I received many compliments on this dip. Thanks Kyle you rock!

Nice mild flavor with this dip. We used it for veggies and bagel thins. I added salt to the peeled cucumber to sweat out the extra water so that the dip would not get runny. It work. This dip held up nicely for the few days it took us to finish it.

I snuck a bite before putting this in the fridge and it's so good! I can't wait for it to be super cold. I followed the recipe exactly. I used small spiny cucumbers so I wouldn't have to deal with seeds. I'll be serving this with Melba toast. Next time I might add some diced jalapenos from the garden since just like the cucumbers we have a bunch. Edited to add: I have made this many times. I love adding jalapeno it gives it a nice kick! I also throw in extra garlic and some cayenne.

This was pretty good but could use some tweaking with the lack of flavor. Needs a little spice kick. This was much easier to serve as a dip than making individual cucumber sandwiches on rye. I would make this again with some added seasoning.
