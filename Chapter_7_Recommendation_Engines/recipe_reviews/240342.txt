This was really good. I did use 1/2 the amount of buffalo sauce. I suggest doing the taste test and adding after each addition of the buffalo sauce. The first batch was so spicy we could not taste the ranch or cheese at all. The second time by reducing the buffalo was a success!  We will be making this again.

I added a can of water chestnuts (drained) to give it a little crunch. It was delicious! My friends asked for the recipe.

A huge hit. I double the recipe and it didn't last very long. I will definitely make it again.

I made this yummy dip for the first time last night, it was a big hit-- the bowl was wiped clean.  Followed the directions exactly, no substitutions.  I did end up baking it a little longer than 20 minutes tho.   I will definitely use this recipe again.

Love this!!! Very addictive. I started w 1/2 of the recommended wing sauce as per another reviewer. And ended up adding about 2/3 of what was called for in the recipe. Turned out great!

Made exactly as written. Fairly good but a bit one dimensional. Will probably try again and modify a little.

Love this recipe! I made it for a holiday party and doubled the recipe. It did take about 45 minutes to bake. I was hoping to bring leftovers home, but the partygoers ate it all. Some of them requested me to bring it to future parties!

Really yummy! I will make it again for sure, but this recipe didn’t have near enough buffalo sauce. All I could taste was ranch, so I doubled it. Taste it after you mix it, and adjust. I used Frank’s buffalo sauce.
