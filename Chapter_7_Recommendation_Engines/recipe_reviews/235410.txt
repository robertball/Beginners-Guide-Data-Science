This was very good.  Bit too much pepper, but I can always tone that down next time.  My fiance said it was good as well but it reminded him of tomato bisque.  Our son said "Mmmmm," and then asked for more.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have any canned diced tomatoes, so used crushed tomatoes instead, which also meant I didn't have to bother with the blender. Wonderful flavor, I'll never buy the canned stuff again.

This soup is easy and fast to make .  It was a bit bland, so I added a second can of tomato paste. That did the trick.  Instead of 3 cups of half and half, I used a cup and a half, then made up the difference with 2% milk to make it less rich and less fattening.  I don't think garlic belongs in tomato soup, so next time I'm leaving it out or greatly minimizing it. With my modifications it turned out quitry tasty.  I'll be making it again for sure.

This soup was so good even my most picky of eaters loved it. My friend who hates tomatoes was even able to eat a bowl full. Thanks for sharing the recipe, I can't wait to make it for a holiday party or a nice dinner party.

Great recipe!  I omitted the garlic, added some sea salt, and added a little less than a teaspoon of the onion powder and white pepper.  I think it's on par with the canned tomato soup (highly preferred by my kids) and actually fed it to them without letting them know it was homemade (I'm a terrible mom).  And guess what.  They liked it! Hey Mikey...

I've made this soup many, many times for a quick dinner. I quick saute some onion and garlic in some wine, and throw that in the blender with the tomatoes and puree that before I cook it; instead of pouring hot liquid into the blender after it's cooked. I also cook the tomato paste for a few minutes so it will caramelize slightly. Then I pour in the broth, pureed tomatoes, 2 cups milk, 1 cup half-and-half, Worcestershire sauce; and let that come up to temp. Then I add in a little soy sauce, molasses (instead of white sugar), garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, oregano, and a little paprika. I serve it with fresh greens, boiled eggs, olives, chick peas, and whatever else I have in the fridge; as kind of a tomato-soup-bar for dinner lol. I've made this recipe as written as well, and it's good on it's own too.

Intending to make homemade cream of tomato soup, I had already begun a roux with butter, cornstarch and flour when I decided to look up a tomato soup recipe for spice combinations and ratios. I stuck with my roux, but used the rest of the recipe as written, and it's now part of my collections: great balance of flavors. Thank you!

I did not use the sugar, pepper and half and half (I used 10% lactose free coffee cream).   Even with the changes, the soup was amazing.  I am now going to try using it to make my cabbage rolls.  Will let you know how they turned out.
