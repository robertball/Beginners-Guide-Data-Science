Very good, I squeezed lime juice on the chicken between brushing with the marinade.  I am going to try marinating the chicken for a few hours next time, in hopes of the flavor going deeper.

I think when I baked the chicken instead of grilling the whole time, I took out some of the flavor this dish promises. Could be my fault because the marinade smells great.

We really liked this!  We used chicken tenders, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the flavor was a little more fruity and less savory than we like.  Next time we plan to use less zest and more curry and garlic to get a better balance.
