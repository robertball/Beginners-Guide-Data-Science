Unlike almost every other reviewer so far, I made these muffins exactly as specified.
I appreciated that they were quick and easy to make, and they made a small batch (I ate all twelve by myself over 5 days).
They were also nice and light and fluffy. However, I thought the cinnamon taste was pretty much indiscernible, and the body of the muffins didn't taste very apple-y (the apple pieces were very good though). So I can see why so many others added lots more cinnamon and apples. If you want nice, mild-tasting and not heavy muffins, these are very good. If you're looking for a hearty, strong-flavored apple muffin, this recipe won't do.

All I can say about these is.....Oh my God! They were amazing. Not too sweet and I even added a few tablespoons of brown sugar too. I do have a standard topping that I use with any fruit muffin and added to these muffins...and they were incredible! To make it...use...1 cup instant oats, 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda and 1/2 cup melted butter and mix together until crumbly. Sprinkle this (there will be well more than enough) so...add lots..to the top of these muffins. As an added and amazing touch...I melted carmels with a little cream and did a drizzle of that on top of the crumb topping after they were cooled. Everyone that has had them today...are in sheer heaven!

I've tried many apple muffin and bread recipes, and this one was absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! It may have been the apple juice in the recipe, but the muffin tasted so apple-y...I was in heaven because I love everything apple! I made a few changes in the recipe: I used 1 tablespoon of canola oil in place of the egg and used 1/3 cup of milk instead of the 1/3 cup of oil. I also left the skin on the apples; you can't tell the difference once the muffins are baked anyway. The end result was a soft, moist and fruity muffin.  This one is going in the favorite recipe drawer. I'll defintely make this one again...5 stars. Thanks SO much for posting!

These were very good. However, I suggest you use between 2-2 1/2 cups apples to get them to really taste like apple muffins. I would also double the cinnamon. I did use a mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar to sprinkle on top as someone else suggested. They turned out great!!

These muffins were really good! I took the advice of others and doubled the cinnamon as well as the chopped apples, and sprinkled brown sugar on the tops. Also, to lower the fat content I substituted 1/3 cup of strained prunes babyfood for the oil. (*Using the prunes does not effect the taste, or final product, but is much healthier! Its great for using in cakes and cupcakes as well!*)The muffins baked perfectly after 20 minutes, they weren't too sweet but still full of flavour and were a big success with my family! Thanks

My 5 year old son and I just made these todayand had a great time together.  My husband and son loved these. There aren't any left.  But I did add about 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinn. together and sprinkled on top-it was a great touch.

Tasty and moist.  I made the muffins even more irresistible by topping the batter with a mixture of 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon before baking.  I also increased the amount of chopped apples a bit.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I substituted the egg for 1/2 banana and 1 tsp baking powder (my son is allergic) and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top as someone else suggested.  Thumbs up!  These were so quick easy and kid friendly that I even made these with my son's preschool class with apples from our orchard!

I've made these muffins twice now and I'm rating the recipe as written. The first time I made the recipe as written and I found it to be quite bland. So I made them again and changed it up a bit. I used 1c all purpose flour & 1c whole wheat flour. I used the 1/2c white sugar but added 1/4c brown sugar (3/4c total). I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil and I used 1tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon (was going to use apple pie spice, but my husband used it all up and didn't tell me!) I also used 1 1/2c apples (2 medium sized apples diced). I found these changes made the muffins really made the apple flavor stand out. My husband thought these were some of the best muffins I've ever made and my daughter gobbled hers up!

So, to make it taste more dessert-y, I melted the sugar with  1/4 cup of the apple juice and two tbsp of butter and brought it to a simmer. Then I let that cool and added it into the recipe at the end and baked as directed. It makes a crunchy crust on top. Mmmmmm. Without that, it probably would have been just as delicious, so all in all, this was a good recipe :]

Excellent.  Will definitely make again.  Doubled the cinnamon as suggested.  Used 1 1/2 cups of apples (2 seemed like a little too much). Substituted Egg Beaters (1/4 cup) for the egg to cut down on calories and cholestrol. Was concerned that there was too much batter in each muffin cup, but they turned out large and delicious.

Absolutely delicious! They deserve 5 stars for sure! I doubled the recipe and it turned out perfect, soft, the right amount of spice and delicious chunks of apples throughout! Wonderful!

These muffins were absolutely delicious!  I did tweak the recipe a bit and I think it was for the better.  I used milk instead of apple juice and used 2 cups of apples and 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp each of nutmeg and cloves.  And I sprinkled brown sugar on top of them before baking.  They ended up tasting sorta like mcdonalds apple pie.  Totally delicious!

Excellent recipe and I took the advice of other users to "apple" up the taste more....so I used apple cider instead of juice and reduced the oil by about 3 tablespoons and added in about 1/4 cup of applesauce. I also reduced the sugar by about 3 tablespoons and they were soooo delicious, my toddler was very happy.

I doubled the apples and cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers and they turned out great!  I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top before baking and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour substituted for 1/2 cup white flour.  I only had white grape juice on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  A keeper!

These aren't bad, they got a little dry on the top for me. I don't know if it was something I did or not though as I am not a baker. They do taste good but, I'd like them a bit sweeter.

I made the recipe as directed.  It was very good and best of all, very affordable.  They were wonderful right out of the oven.  I think I might add a touch more cinnamon next time and maybe sprinkle some sugar on top as they come out of the oven.

These were delicious!  

I'm a college student, and I don't have a lot of baking ingredients around my cabinets to save on space, but I did improvise with what I did have.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, added a packet of instant oatmeal (cinnamon), I used apple cider instead of apple juice, (from the packet, prepared and same measurements), and instead of oil, I used a half cup of apple sauce and a tablespoon of honey.  They were delicious and moist and very flavorful.  Definitely a repeat for me!

Very good.  I took the advice of others and used 2 cups of apples and 2 T of cinnamon.  Before going into the oven I spinkled some brown sugar on top.  They were so good.  I made them a bit smaller so I could have a larger amount.  Thank you!

I am not much of a baker, but this recipe was very easy to do and the muffins turned out great. I used 1 Tbls of cinnamon and 2 cups of apples since others had suggested doubling both. My husband has eaten almost all of them. Will definitely make these again.

I think these muffins are quite good, but they are traditional muffins. Nowadays we're used to the supersweet "cake" muffins at the grocery store, so we want to add sugar and/or toppings. Don't expect these to taste like grocery store muffins, think more like the homemade ones your great-grandma made... I really liked them when my grandma made them, and I like them now.  I didn't modify these too much, but I did use whole wheat white flour which bakes up slightly heavier than white all-purpose. For that reason and due to the fact that my batter was mixing on the dry side (flour can be drier or moister depending on the humidity in the air) I added about 1/2 cup of applesauce. As a rule I use grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil for almost everything these days as it is better for you and tastes great in just about every application I have tried. I also followed the advice of several other reviewers and doubled the apple ratio (I used Michigan Ida Reds) and "spiced it up" though I used 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and only about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I did NOT add more sugar, and I did not add a topping. I did add nuts to the second batch and walnuts taste totally yummy in these, if you like walnuts of course.

These are AWESOME! The only changes I made was to double the amount of apples and cinnamon, halfed the amount of white sugar and added brown sugar and substituted the oil for applesauce for a wham-apple-flavor-filled muffin!

these were O.K... THey lack texture and flavor....I had to triple the cinnamon just to give it a flavor worth eating. Also, the muffins stick BAD to the muffin tins and the liners. This could be better with alittle work

Wonderful!  I was very skeptical because they were so thick and gooey (barely spoonable) going into the muffin tin, but they came out great!  I wish I had read the reviews before making, because I would have doubled the cinnamon.  Will do it next time!  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks a lot for this recipe! Following earlier reviews, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 banana and 1 tsp of vanilla. The juice I made turned out to be 1 cup so I have used it all. At the end, I sprinkled a lil dermerara sugar on top of the muffins and they have turned out great. Crispy on top coz of the sugar and light, soft and fluffy inside. Thanks once again. Oh, by the way, it cooks too fast. Got done in 13 mts.

Fairly decent.  I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the apples
(2 cups = 1.5 apples) and cinnamon.  The tiny chunks of apple and dusting
of cinnamon gave the interior of these a nice appearance.  Leftovers were
milder and drier, needing sizable quantities of butter.

Was okay, but will not make again.  Muffins are a little to thick and massive for my taste.  Not fluffy enough, although my husband liked them.  Will use the Peach & Blueberry recipe next time and simply add apples.

I've been baking for 25 years and these are one of the best muffin recipes I've found.  I doubled and diced the apples and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  Terrific!

This recipe is rated FAR too highly.  First of all, I want to say that the product does not come out like a muffin.  That's the most important aspect of my review.  THIS MUFFIN IS NOT MUFFIN-LIKE.  It's bready and bland.  I made the recipe EXACTLY as printed, two times, with two different brands of all purpose flour, and there was a huge problem with the batter not having enough liquid.  It was barely wet enough to make a dough, much less muffin batter, so I had to add liquid both times.  I only added enough apple juice to make the stuff come together loosely.  And even with that, I had to add at least 1/2 cup more juice.  This recipe comes up far too short on liquid to chalk the issue up to different rates of absorbancy in different flours.  Additionally, in my professional opinion (I am a professional pastry chef), I had a sneaky suspicion that the quantity of oil was far, far too low.  You know what?  It is.  These are just barely moist.  One single IOTA less oil, and they would be BONE DRY.  You could DOUBLE the oil, and it would probably not hurt the final product.  In fact, it would probably be really good.  I'm going to try that later.  All that said, the recipe was still edible, but it IS NOT A MUFFIN, DOES NOT RESEMBLE A MUFFIN, IS BLAND, AND DOES NOT IMPRESS.  Even if I were coming at this recipe from a layman's perspective, if I had wanted a fluffy, cakey apple, I would have been disappointed in this.  It should be called apple quick bread, at the best.

These were great! Now that it's fall (even though it's still 77 degrees outside-ugh) I am in the mood to bake, so something apple-y would hit the spot. I know some people don't like changing ingredients, and yes, I changed some (used half brown sugar & half white sugar; half wheat flour, half unbleached white, added some ground flax seeds) I am still giving it 5 stars becuase I would never known the proportions, or to use apple juice (I used Simply Apple--so good)! I say there's nothing wrong with playing around with the ingredients a little....see what works for you! If it wasnt for this recipe, I would ended up with apple hockey pucks, no doubt!

I made this to take to a tea party, and they were so good my hosts thought that I had bought them!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I used 2 cups of apples instead of one (just cos I LOVE apples) and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead (just cos I also LOVE cinnamon!). This definitely goes into my permanent muffin recipe collection!

My family and I love these muffins! I also double the cinnamon and apples and they are very flavorful and moist. They are also very fast and easy to make. This last time I made them I used 1 cup of white flour and 3/4 c of whole wheat flour and 1/4 c of ground flax seed and they turned out awesome!

This was an awesome recipe. I used some other suggestions that I saw. I doubled the cinnamon and the amount of apples. They smelled and were amazing. I am more of a cinnamon person so next time I might use more. My boys ate 2 muffins a piece.

very tasty... I didn't make it with the additional topping as many others suggested -- maybe the next batch... I used half oil / half apple sauce and I doubled the cinnamon... there seemed to be enough apples for my taste... will definitely make again if they freeze well...

Great recipe.  The only thing I added was a cinnamon/sugar crumb topping.  I also used green apples which balanced the tart apple well with the sweet batter.

These were pretty good.  The batter looked a little dry so we added more apple juice. I think I will replace oil with applesauce next time.  I hope that will make them a little more moist and apple tasting.  Overall they weren't too bad.  Definitely a good place for someone like me, who doesn't bake often, to start and a just adjust to personal taste.

I doubled the apples and cinnamon and still felt like these could have more apple taste.  Next time, I will add 1/3 cup of applesauce and use at the very least 2.5 cups of apples.  I also used half ww half all-purpose flour since my family can't tell the difference and added an extra 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I tried a half recipe of donnainnc's topping on these muffins and, though I thank her for suggesting the topping, it was not for us.  It made the muffins taste very dry.  When I knocked the topping off, I could tell there was a moist muffin under it, but next time I will just use a little brown sugar, oats, and butter.

I LOVE this recipe. This was a huge hit, in 10 minutes all 12 where gone. I diced the apples, but not too small just to have more of the apple taste. You don't need to add more unless you want to. 
This would have been even better with some apple butter or some jelly, but by them selves where just fine on their own.
Thanks for this recipe.

Pretty Good!  I used red delicious apples, because they were all I had, and they still turned out great!  The batter was nice and thick to support the weight of the apples.  I also added a topping.  I will make these again!

This is a really great starter recipe! I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground ginger. I didn't have any apple juice so I used apple sauce and an extra 1/4 cup of water because the batter was so thick. I wanted cake, so I put mine in a bundt pan and topped it with a crunch topping (Butter, Flour, Brown Sugar, and Oats) and cooked it for 40 minutes at 350. Came out perfectly!

These were quite tasty, but came out so tiny, if I would have filled the muffin tins 2/3 full like the recipe said I would have had a pan cake. I topped the muffin with sugar and cinn &some carmel topping. so the taste was great but they didn't rise for some reason.

I made these following the advice of others and I changed the cinnamon to 2 tsp. & I added 2 1/2 cups of apples.  I also sprinkled the tops with dark brown sugar & cinnamon. They came out excellent after exactly 18 minutes.  I will make these again, they were SUPER easy!

These were hands down the best muffins I have ever made! They were moist and delicious and everyone loved them. I tweaked the recipe a bit by doubling the apples, adding 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2  tsp. vanilla, a crumb topping, and a caramel topping drizzled over everything. Yum!

these were great. i altered slightly with an addition of 1/3 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. left over homemade apple sauce. only complaint is that they were alittle crumbly. i also added the otas crumbly topping that another use suggested. if you do that, make only half of the recipe. i had way too much left over.

Fabulous! Like a lot of reviewers, I upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and put in 2 apples. I also subbed the apple juice (which I didn't have) with an  applesauce-water mixture. Delicious! Will be making them again.

This recipe is AWESOME!  tastes like apple pie!  Thanks for the recommendation to double the cinnamon.  I added about 2.5x more than the recipe.  Also used approx 3 Granny Smith Apples.  HUGE success!  Even my 9 year old asked for more (and he is not a muffin or apple fan!)  GREAT RECIPE

I made these for a school function and were a GREAT hit.  I substituted apple cider for juice and then I made a crumb topping.  They tasted like french apple pie.  They were just awesome!!!  I will definitely make these again.

Absolute Heaven!!!! Made this recipe because my boyfriend LOVES anything apple and this one was a definite winner!!!! The only change I made was to increase the amount of cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons in the batter. I then also increased the apples to 2 cups and sprinkled some cinnamon on them before incorporating into the batter. Finally before putting in the oven I made a small crumb topping consisting of flour, brown sugar, cold margarine and of course more cinnamon. The kitchen smelled like apple pie..MMMMM so good!

These were excellent muffins. I used half white flour and half whole wheat and used carrot juice instead of apple juice (added extra juice to account for the thicker juice and whole wheat flour.) Because of the carrot juice, these came out looking and tasting more like an apple-pumpkin muffin with great flavor and texture.

I love the idea of using diced apples in a muffin. However, these muffins were a little too oily despite having used only half of what the recipe called for. As suggested by other reviewers, I will replace the oil with applesauce the next time I attempt these.  I will also add a touch of nutmeg. Muffins with potential!

These were good. Although I did add 1 TSP VANILLA, and my cup of apples was a little overflowing. But ya they were good and I will be making them again :) Definately dont be afraid to try this one, might even be good with some nuts or bananas.

As suggested, I doubled the apple and cinnamon, added 1/2 cup walnuts, and then sprinkled the tops with a brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. These muffins were horrible right out of the oven- too heavy, fell apart, tasted doughy.

The next day, having them cold out of the refridgerator they were AMAZING. Just the right sweetness, great flavor, and very moist. Would have been a 4 or 5 star if it hadn't been for the fisco before they cooled.

My 3 year old and I had a lot of fun making these.  She loves them, and so do I.  They are very tasty, and make a wonderful morning snack for my daughter.  I did add a little brown sugar to the batter to give it a little extra sweetness, and they turned out beautifully.

Way too sweet! The topping recipe had to be adjusted by adding oats to make it a good consistency and was unnecessary anyway.

I took others' advice and changed a few things.  I doubled the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons and the apples to 2 cups.  I did not have apple juice but I did have applesauce so I used 6.4 oz of that plus 1/4 cup water.  The muffins turned out great and my nanny family ate all of them in 2 days.  Delicious and moist!! Yummy!

These muffins were delicious and so easy to make!!  The only changes I made were to double the amount of apples and cinnamon, as previous reviewers suggested.  I also used 1/4 brown sugar & 1/4 white sugar.  I used golden delicious apples.  Everyone loved them!!  I will definitely make them again.

20 min on 375 was perfect for me using whole wheat flour and double the apples. You can just fill the muffin cups and they won't make a mess with this recipe. Good muffins. :)

I used freshly juiced apples. I would recommend adding 2-3x the cinnamon. Would make again and suggest to others for sure.

I doubled the amount of cinnamon and apples, just like what other folks suggested, and it turned out good.  I didn't have apple juice so I substituted 8oz of apple sauce. I added walnuts too.

My co-workers and friends loved these muffins! They were moist and not too sweet; though I did follow the recommendations of other reviewers and also doubled the amount of cinnamon and apples. I didn't dice the apples as finely as I probably should of, but people seemed to really like the bigger apple pieces. I will definitely make this again.

I also tried out DONNAINNC's muffin topping but it came out a bit too dry for me. It was still delicious, but broke off too easily. Maybe I left it in the oven for too long...?

Easy to make, delicious to eat. Added more apple as suggested. Makes a great lunch box treat for the kids. Freeze well. Tried a batch with whole wheat flour but decided I prefered the original ingredients.

Yummy!  I added a cup more apples and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and then added brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  Next time I may add brown sugar to the actual recipe too.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!! I made these as a surprise for my family, and they were GONE!!!! I was actually surprised that I liked the because I usually dislike apples in my muffins. Not this time! I doubled the recipe, and instead of using 4 cups of white flour, I used 2 cups of white flour, and about 3/4 cup of whole wheat. I also added 1 TBS of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. They were a huge hit!!! Not too sweet, and not bland at all! I will be making these many times over!

The cinnamon-y smell of these delicious muffins fill the air as I type.  I just sampled one and they came out great!  I did make a few substitutions/additions.  First I used 1 cup brown rice flour, 1/2 cup regular unbleached flour & 1/2 cup wheat flour (we prefer whole grains, but I used 1/2 cup reg. flour so they weren't too heavy, for my husband.  I would have used all brown rice flour if I had enough on hand).  I used a half cup pure maple syrup & a few table spoons of organic agave nectar in stead of the regular sugar for which the recipe calls.  I didn't view the reviews before making this recipe, but I too added more cinnamon than the recipe called for (2.5 tblsp) & more diced apples as well.  I refuse to peel my fruit (thus removing lots of nutrients) and baked the apple diced with skin in tact and still ended up with a great end product.  I have added this recipe to my recipe box and will make these again!

I did the recipe exactly as it stated, I cooked them for 19 minutes and they almost overcooked. They were bland, tasted like they had too much flour. Like others stated, the muffins really did not rise at all either. My husband wouldn't even touch them, so I trashed them. I will not be trying this recipe again, there are much better apple recipes out there.

LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE MUFFINS! and i like that it didnt call for butter the oil did the trick. The first time i made them i ate just about the whole pan myself. they're better served warm. I also doubled the apple and topped the muffins with a drizzle of melted caramel, Delicious as a warm dessert for the cooler nights.

I made this recipe to the exact specifications. And it came out alright...I was just in a hurry and didn't read the comments. They where good, just not as apple-y as I would have preferred. Though this is so easy the next time my nephew comes over I'll defiantly make it with him! He loves apples. And I will double the cinnamon and apples in it as well!

I feel like I used this recipe as a base since I modified it rather a lot, but it ended up so delicious! I used 1c ap flour, 3/4c whole wheat flour, and 1/4c flax seed instead of just ap flour, brown sugar instead of white (apples just mean brown sugar, I think), apple cider instead of juice, since that's what I had, 1tbs of cinnamon (based on other reviews and knowing my family loves cinnamon), applesauce instead of oil, and 1 huge Sonya apple that was probably more than 1 cup (and I didn't bother with peeling it). I baked it in a mini muffin pan for about 11 minutes and they came out moist and apple-y and delicious!

these muffins were very good.  They were very dense.  I made 6 muffins and a small loaf.  the loaf took longer to cook.  My husband ate half of the loaf, he loved it.  I added about 2 1/2 cups finely  chopped apples & doubled the cinnamon.  I also added 1/2 a tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I used white grape juice instead of apple b/c thats all i had- i think i added closer to a cup of white grape juice though.  I will definitely make this again, next time i might put a crumble on top like some other ppl suggested.

The only things that kept me from giving these 5 stars was the fact that I had to add extra water, and that they stuck to the muffin cups even though I sprayed them-- not sure what to do to remedy the latter, but these were a hit. I did double the amount of apples in these (per others suggestions),and the end product was an extremely good, light, and well bodied muffin. I topped with cinnamon-sugered walnuts and they were so tastey! This was a great recipe. I think next time I will try to incorporate some oats in there somewhere. Thanks!!!

These are great..but i did do something different...not because i didn't think they would be good..just cause i have never done it and wanted too. I made the muffins exactly except for the apples...i made my own apple sauce and put one spoon of batter in the bottom of the liner and then put a spoonful of the apple sauce ..and then i filled it to the rim with more batter..and i topped it with walnuts and baked it at 375F for 25 min...they turned out amazing

My muffins turned out really dry.  I followed the recipe although I substituted white flour for whole wheat to try and make them a little healthier.  Maybe this is what made them dry. I was unfortunately disappointed.  The apples and texture were very good though.

Great tasting muffins and easy to make, too! I doubled the cinnamon and added a mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar for a crumbly topping. Also added more than 1 cup of apples (closer to 2 cups). Lovely!

These were fantastic. The only thing I altered was adding 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar in the recipe and then prior to putting them in the oven I sprinkled a little more brown sugar on top of them. They were perfect little apple pie-like muffins!!

perfect - no alterations - think the apple juice is the secret ingredient here.  Oh yeah, put some walnuts on top too.

The recipe as-is is pretty good...but I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a topping (1 c. oats, 1 c. flour, 1 c. br. sugar, 1/4 tsp. baking powder and baking soda, 1/2 c. melted butter) to them and THEN they were sensational.  Also melted caramel with a little heavy whipping cream and drizzled over the top and WOW!  These were sooooo good, I couldn't stop eating them!  The recipe without these additions wouldn't have been anything spectacular, but thanks to the previous reviewers suggestions I will make these again and again.  YUM!!

Kind of chewy, kind of bland. I doubled the cinnamon and still couldn't taste it. But they're good - I will tweak the recipe and try them again.

I made these yesterday for a new mother as a breakfast treat.  I did take advice from other users and doubled the cinnamon, but I think after adding the topping, that it was a bit much.  Next time maybe 1 1/2 t, not 2.  I did use 2 apples that were finely diced in the food processor, and added raisins.  Also, subbed apple sauce for the oil, which I use in most breads/muffins.  These came out making about 20 muffins for me.  They are very very filling, and moist.  Definately recommed this recipe.

Great recipe! Thank you for sharing! The muffins are light and tasty. I did use twice the cinnamon and I added pecans on top with sugar. But it was delicious and easy to make. My husband loved it. I did too.

For a person who doesn't cook, these turned out wonderful and were very easy! However, I didn't have apple juice on me, so I just used water and I don't feel it took away from the flavor at all!

I took other reviewers' suggestions and added more apples and made the substitutions to make it healthier (replaced the oil with applesauce). They were not the greatest apple muffins I've ever had, but they were very easy to make and did in a pinch. If you're looking for a hearty apple muffin recipe with the cinnamon swirls and brown sugar crust, this is not it. But if you're looking for something quick and easy to make that still tastes pretty darn good, give this recipe a try!

I would suggest cutting the apples into chunks and then a cup would be fine, but I used 2 cups of finely diced apples.  I also did not have an egg once I started making these and I substituted 2 tbsp. of applesauce and the muffins still turned out great.  They are moist, but I don't like mine dry.

I was disappointed with these. I followed others suggestions of doubling the cinnamon and apples and I also substituted applesauce for the oil. Mine came out dry and half of the muffin stuck to the paper liner. I think if I try them again I will bake at 350.

I used one large Granny Smith apple peeled and grated. I added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cloves and 1/4 tsp of ginger. I also did the sugar topping but after baking. Mine only needed 18 minutes at 375. Each muffin was exactly 1/4 cup of batter and the yield was 12. Next time I will add some diced apple along with the grated for a stronger apple flavour.UPDATE: I made these again today with the addition of another apple diced and with the strudel topping suggested by another reviewer. They were very good. Excellent, really!

With the brown sugar cinnamon topping this was a nice breakfast muffin.  I used 2 apples and one small pear plus twice the cinnamon.  I'll make these again.  Very moist.

I loved these muffins!  They were all eaten in record time too, so I suppose everyone else felt the same.  I doubled the amount of apples and cinnamon and thought the muffins came out perfectly that way.  Thank so much for the great recipe!  I will be making these often.

This was pretty good. I added an extra table spoon of Cinamon and and extra cup of apples.  For a little bit of a different flavour I added brown sugar and walnuts on the top of some. Next time I would use 4 times the ammount of chopped apple for a good strong apple taste

These were really good. My son had objections to the size of the apple chunks (he's four) but both my sons did eat them. I LOVED them. Next time I will dice the apples finer to suit my boys, and will probably replace the oil with applesauce for some added apple flavor (and health!).

AMAZING is the word! I picked apples yesterday so was looking for a good muffin recipe. I also used more apple and cinnamon than called for and sprinkled tops with cinnamon/sugar mix before baking. I added apple cider instead of apple juice becaue I got fresh cider at the orchard yesterday. I also added chopped dates. Very very moist and delicious. Great with coffee :)

great muffins - not too sweet. I used mostly whole wheat flour with some oat bran to make up the 2 cups. I didn't have apple juice so substituted apple sauce plus 1 extra egg. I put a struessal topping on some of them ( oats brown sugar and a little butter) - which was good too.

Great recipe! I did alter it a bit though...added 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and a pinch of allspice. I also used others' suggestions, and topped them with a little brown sugar and cinnamon mix before baking. Very flavorful and moist.

This recipe was very tasty although I made some alterations based on other members comments. I put in 2 cups of apples, two teaspoons of cinnamon, one teaspoon of vanilla essence and 3/4 cup of sultanas. I also used self-raising flour with a little extra baking powder. They turned out great - my husband loves them.

These were pretty good.  I added a brown sugar-cinnamon streusel topping.  I'm glad I did, because they would have been a bit bland without it.  My kids (4 1/2 & 16 mos) both like them.  Thanks for  the recipe!

Needed a quick recipe when youngest stepdaughter announced it was her turn to bring snack tomorrow. I made a triple batch (enough for class, plus a few for home to "test"). Increased apples and cinnamon, per other reviewers recommendation, and added the brown sugar/cinnamon topping. Wonderful! In my oven, they cooked fast-- 14-15 minutes per batch. Absolutely Yummy!!!

This was a great basic recipe that I modified to meet our allergy needs and pantry shortcomings!  First of all, we doubled the apples after reading other suggestions.  We were out of apple juice, so I substituted water and some brown sugar to compensate.  I also used flax seed to replace the egg and doubled the cinnamon.  I used half white flour, half wheat, and add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to give a little more flavor.  The result was a moist, tasty little muffin that turned out great!  I also reduced the oven temperature to 375 degrees, which seemed to work well.

This is a very good recipe - I just recommend cooking the muffins at a slightly lower temperature, as 400 seemed to make mine a bit too crispy/dry.  Also, I always add the topping of brown sugar and cinnamon, and we eat these up in less than 24 hours!  :o)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this muffins for my daughter's kindergarten "apple fest."  They were a hit!  I doubled the cinnamon and apples and made them as mini-muffins.  I also added a brown sugar/cinnamon topping.  The kids loved them!

These were very good.  I added some streudel to the top (brown sugar, flour, melted butter mixed together) and it seemed to add a little to it.

The muffins aren't as apple tasting as I thought they would be, they kind of taste to much like flour.

I just made these with my very finiky kids (aged 3 and 4) and WE LOVE THEM...not too sweet...we increased the amount of apple to 1/1/2 c.,made them with 1/2 granny smith and 1/2 red delicious, added a little brown sugar like some of the other suggestions and it wasn't too sweet also added some dried cherries...we even made the oatmeal topping as suggested by another reviewer...FABULOUS!!!...The only thing we didn't do was add the caramel drizzle..I just wonder..if anyone else has made the topping, what do you do with the extra topping, how do you store it?

Tasty, but could use a little extra flavor. Next time I make them, I'm thinking of adding some lemon zest or using some lemonade instead of apple juice. Also maybe a little bit of nutmeg would be nice.

Okay muffins, but I would have liked them a bit sweeter. They also could have used more apples.

I made this per the recipe then sprinkled chopped pecans and brown sugar which was delicious. Next time I would add a splash of lemon juice to balance out the sweetness and add some brihhtness. to the flavor.

This was so easy and my grand daughters loved making it. You can substitute any fruit in this and make any combination of muffin. We have used orange and cranberry and blueberry, its always fabulous. This is a kid friendly recipe and we make it all the  time.

This recipe is great! The only thing I did differently was instead of apple juice I use Evan Williams Apple Orchard seasonal liqueur and baked in a loaf pan. The flavor was sooooooo good! The intense flavor of the liqueur took this recipe to the next level!

I was actually looking for a cranberry sauce-apple muffin recipe, so I adjusted this recipe accordingly. I used one large Granny Smith apple and didn't peel it (I never peel apples). I doubled the cinnamon as others had suggested and added enough apple juice to get what I thought was the right consistency considering how much moisture was going to be added with the cranberry sauce.  I added about 1-1/2 cups cranberry orange pecan relish when I added the chopped apple. They came out great!

Made these for breakfast today and they turned out pretty good. Adjustments I made were I substituted milk for the Apple juice and ended up using about a cup and half total to make the batter the desired consistency, added 1/2 cup of brown sugar as well, and doubled the apples and cinnamon per other reviewers suggestion. Topped with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking and they were done at about 22 minutes and tasted good. I'd say success for my first time making muffins from scratch and will probably use this recipe again in the future.

I have been looking for muffins that will entice my 2 little ones to eat breakfast at daycare and this may just hit the spot for them!!  The muffins turned out moist with just enough apple chunks and cinnamon to taste like a mini cake to them. Yummy! in my kids words :).

Great starter recipe!  I experimented and found that my optimal adjustments were 1 1/2 cups apple, 1 cup apple juice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon.  The first time, I made them exactly as written, and they were a bit bland for my taste.  Then, I tried 2 cups apple juice and 2 tsp cinnamon.  It was a little too much, and the muffins were not moist enough for my taste.  Next time I plan to add some raisins and walnuts.

Really good! I would definitely make them again. The apples made them really moist. I substituted apple sauce for the oil (yes that's really a thing!). I also added some nutmeg. I think it was a great addition! My only issue was that it was a tad bland. I might add extra cinnamon next time.

I halved the recipe and replaced the egg with canola oil and the oil with soy milk since i am e lactose intolerant. It turned out okay because it wasnt sweet enough and you really only get the apple taste from the diced apple. I will try these again and add more sugar or probably some honey.

I thought these were okay. I did like that they were not too sweet. My only change was subbing 1/2 the flour with white whole wheat. I think these might be better with some walnuts.

Absolutely love these! Made a few adjustments to health them up a bit: 

subbed 1c. WW flour / 1c. quick oats instead of white flour
subbed apple sauce for the oil
doubled cinnamon and apples
didn't have apple juice, so used fruit punch
added handful of chopped walnuts

Results were super tasty, moist and just a hint of sweetness. Whole family loves them. Thanks for a great recipe - these are definitely going into the rotation!

Very disappointing. Yes, they're quick and easy, but they're not very good, very dense muffins....taste like apple pancakes.

This recipe is great, but to make it special. Add 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips and you will have a recipe, that people will remember and want.  The chips do add something special.

I made these muffins last night and I can't say they were my favorite. The batter was very dry, almost like bread dough...I had to add about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup more liquid just to get the batter to a consistency that could be added to the muffin tins. I did add some apple pie spice, extra cinnamon, and an extra cup of apples. I also made a streusel topping so the taste was decent but they came out very dense, more like apple bread than muffins. I think maybe with some tinkering these could be very good. But as is I probably would not make them again.

OH WOW! This was a good one, it’s so quick to make and very light and tasty. I’m not a fan of muffins though cause they’re so dry usually but I loved it at my first try however I put more apple than mentioned.

I followed everybody else's recommendation and made these with double the apple and double cinnamon, for a friend's birthday.  They turned out great and were very tasty.  My only complaint was that they didn't rise as much as I expected, so they looked a little small in their cases.  I guess next time, I will just have to put more mixture in!  Otherwise, these are keepers.

Yummy for kids & adults. Had some apples lying around that no one was eating, gave this recipe a try. I doubled the cinnamon, and the recipe was a hit. Second time I added milk to make the muffins fluffier, and brown sugar & cinnamon on top.

I made this recipe this evening for my children, a 2 year old & a 3 year old & the only thing I did differently was bake it in a cake pan instead of a muffin tin & I sprinkled the top with a tiny bit of sugar & cinnamon. They gobbled it up & asked for more! I will be making this again, I thought it very yummy.

Very good! The only tweak I made was adding more apples as others suggested and a crumble topping, but the base recipe is solid. 

Remember, apple anything is only as good as the apples you put in it. Make sure your apples have plenty of flavor and are well-suited for baking. You won't get away with using a mealy, bland Red "Delicious" here!

This recipe is way over rated. I used 1/4c oil and 1/4c apple sauce to try and enhance the apple flavor. Otherwise the recipe was the exact same. These were not very flavorful and a good chunk was just stuck to the muffin paper. Definitely looking for a better muffin recipe.

These muffins were really good. The flavors complement each other nicely. I was able to double the recipe without any problem. My family and I really enjoyed them. I used a topping from another muffin recipe and I think it was a nice touch. These also bake very quickly, which is very helpful.

Very moist muffin, I added double the apples and cinnamon!  Yummy!
This recipe is now going to be a regular.  I also freeze them individually and take them in our lunches or outings.

Tried this today....took advice of former reviewers and doubled the cinnamon and doubled the apples.  I also used a topping posted by another reviewer with 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, 1/4 packed brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I didn't fill them more than a half so they cooked in 15 minutes.  They were really moist and yummy....thanks for the suggestion of doubling the apples.  I will definitely be making this again.  My husband said WOW at the first bite !!

It's nice, but it definitely needs at least double the amount of apples because it doesn't taste apple-like...otherwise,the dough is really nice.

I took the suggestions of others and doubled the apples and cinnamon.  These were fantastic! I was looking for a nice light snack that would fill me up in between meals and this hits the spot.  Definitely double the apples and cinnamon.

Good recipe. I used brown sugar instead of white, added plain yogurt and cut down on the amount of oil. I also added a topping before baking made of oats, brown sugar, melted butter and cinnamon. Next time I will also try adding apple sauce.

Fabulous recipe that the whole family loved. I read all the reviews and incorporated several into my muffins. I used two cups shredded apples, added one tsp of apple pie spice (as well as the cinnamon), increased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and added Donnainnc's crumbled topping she adds to all fruit muffins. Of course this increased the baking time but these muffins were so good that I didn't mind the kitchen cleanup. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious! My sons loved them, even my picky 3 year old! Doubled the cinnamon but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely be making again=)

Yummy but a little dry. I agree that more apple would help. I added a struesel topping of brown sugar, flour and butter cut together. It added a little more color to the top and a nice "bite" when eating. Great with coffee.

Keeper! I've tried it just as written and with apple cider subbed for the juice. Both are really good. Tried with some whole grain flour too. These are not super sweet which is good if you ask me. The kids love them! Oh, and I leave the peel on the apple and no one notices.

With all the negative reviews I was in a panic. Should I make them? I don't want waste things. So I had the strength to do it. It turned out great!!!!!! Love it! Thanks for the great recipe! It was just perfect. Not bland at all. Will make again!

I made these exactly as written and was very disappointed.  Didn't brown up well, didn't have a nice muffin texture.  I make muffins about once a week so not sure what didn't work with these.  Disappointed...

If you follow this recipe just like this. It would taste more like flour. To me that's how it taste. Next time I will add more cinnamon and more apples. or you can even eat this with some caramel. But if you want to try them like this. serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. :) and some caramel on top.

Very nice muffins! I use nutmeg instead of cinnimon as I'm allergic, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out moist and soft and very tastey. I'll definitely make again.

I substituted apple sauce for the oil and added about 1/2 cup more apple juice to make them moist.  Did not peel the apples.  Doubled the cinnamon.

My husband liked these more than I did. They were o.k., but nothing awesome to brag about. Here are the changes I made:  2 cups wheat flour, no sugar, 1/2 cup of apple sauce, 2 teasp ground cinnamon
2 cups of dices apples with skin on, 3/4 brown sugar, & 1/2 cup of walnuts. All of these changes gave me about 1 & 1/2 muffin pans worth. 

Also, they were on the verge of being overdone by 18 minutes so watch the time! 

I suggest greasing the entire muffin cup instead of just the bottom. I did this as recommended the first time and they stuck on the sides with only greasing the bottom. I did like that they weren't very sweet since they go good with coffee.

These are so good!  I only added more cinnamon and the whole chopped apple which equaled to about 1 1/4 cup, also I did not peel the apple, left the skins on.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly. Delicious  =)

Thank you for the great recipe!!!....I changed it up just a bit, instead of 1/2 cup of sugar, I used 2/3 cup and spinkled brown sugar on top before baking! I just like it a little more sweet:) Delicious muffin for breakfast with coffee or an after school snack!!

Very tasty but a little lacking on the apple umph I wanted.  I will do as several reviewers suggest next time and double the apple amount and I think a crumb top would be nice also.

I thought these would be delicious just by reading the reviews. However I used spiced apple cider in place of apple juice and added dried cranberries and walnuts! And of course a topping of brown sugar butter and graham crackers crumbed. Yummy right out of the oven or zapped in the microwave for 20 seconds! Its fun to experiment, go ahead and make the recipe your own!

We love muffins in our family-and this one is now a favorite.  I substituted half whole wheat flour for the all-purpose and added a touch of vanilla.  DELICIOUS!!!

Fantastic!!!  This is my new staple recipe.  Love that it is not too sweet and really lets the apple flavor be most present.  Very moist and sturdy muffins. I did follow suggestions and use almost 3 cups of apples.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added ground nutmeg and allspice.  Also, the Oatmeal topping in the comments makes them even better.

These are pretty good muffins.  Nice, light and not too sweet.  I actually preferred them cool instead of warm as suggested.  I tried to top mine with a crumb topping, and it is a nice tase, but I have deep muffin pans so the topping melted down the sides of the muffin and caramelized.  Not what I was going for, but it was still tastey and sweet.

Great recipe! Muffins were light and yummy. I only sprinkled a bit of cinnamon/brown sugar mixture on top, and that's just because I had some leftover from another recipe. My kids loved the muffins and demanded them for breakfasts and school snacks.

Tasty! Following the advice of many other reviewers, I used more cinnamon and sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the muffins before baking. They turned out really well, moist and not too sweet.

These muffins came out okay.  They are not very sweet so I would serve more as a dinner bread than I would a breakfast muffin.  I did use applesauce instead of oil so it gave them more of the apple flavor other reviewers said was lacking.  Overall I will eat them but not quite what I was looking for.

YUM! This recipe is perfect for an autumn treat and the batch isn't overwhelming in that you will have 12 muffins (not 20). I took the advice of some others and doubled the cinnamon; the muffins turned out wonderfully. Oh, I also added walnuts :)

This is a fantastic apple muffin recipe. Mine were scrummylicious!  I did tweak it slightly by using almost double the apple. I'd also recommend doubling the cinnamon too or adding the same amount in nutmeg. I kept some of the larger apple pieces back and placed them on the top with a sprinkle of brown sugar, which gave a good finish without changing the recipe too much. How ever you decide to tweak them, enjoy!

I used this recipe and substituted pears, which I needed to use asap.  They turned out wonderfully, and I added just a touch of nutmeg in the batter, and sprinkled the tops with brown sugar. The parents have a pear tree now so this will be used frequently!

These muffins are awesome!!! I added a little more apple than the recipe called for and also used cinnimon applesauce instead of oil (olny b/c i was out of oil) and they were perfect!  So...I just kept making them that way and they were great, and good for u too!

I had to substitute apple cider for apple juice because I had none, but the muffin is YUMMY. the apple flavor is not too strong, and neither is the cinnamon flavor. I wish I cut my apple pieces smaller, but still- very good. not too dry to me!

Yummy flavor and loved the light, fluffy texture.  Like most others I doubled the apples and a bit more cinnamon.  I also substituted water and a bit of lemonade for the apple juice.

I made these muffins yesterday and took the other reviewers' advice about increasing the amount of cinnamon.  I also added some vanilla, fresh ground nutmeg, and a bit of ginger.  I tripled the batch, increasing the volume of apples to 4 cups, and substituted 3/4 of a cup of almond meal for part of the flour.  I also didn't have apple juice, so I used some of my toddler's pear juice instead.  I baked these in large popover pans and the result was fantastic.  I would definitely make them again.

I thought these muffins quite tasty and rather simple to make (which is nice for beginners like me)! I did sprinkle some cinnamon on top of each muffin prior to baking but I do believe that they would be just fine without that as well!

So easy to make and very yummy. My 4 year old has been "sneak" eating these all day :) I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled the apples and cinnamon. Also added a topping of brown sugar and cinnamon.

I too, thought these muffins were great and very moist, but needed something extra.  I doubled the cinnamon and apples as suggested.  The second time I made them I added 1/8 teas ground cloves.  It just added a little bit of flavor and next time I might try 1/4 teas of the cloves.  Thanks for a good recipe

PERFECT!!  These were so good, my husband ate like 4 straight from the oven!  I doubled the batch and came out with 48 mini muffins and 12 regular sized muffins.  I used 2 cups of chopped apples and added more cinnamon too.  And I added a struessel topping as suggested by another reviewer.  I didn't have apple juice on hand, so I threw in a couple of fresh apples into the juicer and I'm sure that added to they YUM factor!!  Will make these again!

Tasty!  Substituted apple sauce for vegetable oil and Splenda for the sugar to make it lower fat.

Extra cinnamon and chunkier apples make this a delicious treat.   My apples were cut too small, and didn't create a strong apple flavor in the muffin.   The muffins were very moist...need to find a way to dry them out a bit.

These were delicious! I ended up having to leave out the cinnamon, as I made these as a last minute "Oh, my goodness, I am out of lemon extract!" while making other muffins. I subbed in a teaspoon of ginger for the cinnamon, and while certainly a different flavor than the recipe, it was still fantastic. A nice spicy kick to the muffins, but wonderful.

Wow! I made this on a whim this morning for my husband and I and we've eaten nearly every muffin. Perfect sweet factor, not too sugary but not bland. Excellent texture from the apples (I used Gala) and very moist. I will definitely be baking these again soon.

I made these as written and they were ok.  I then followed other suggestions like adding 1/2 c brown sugar, double the cinnamon, more apples with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on the grated apples.  I threw in raisins and topped with cinnamon and brown sugar.  The added sugar and extra ingredients combined to make these a great breakfast muffin.

These were very delicious and moist! I had some leftover apples and wanted to use them before they went bad. I used more apple than suggested and i rolled them in cinnamon before adding them to the mix.  But my family loved them thanks!

The recipe is quick and easy. I doubled the measurement for the apples and cinnamon.  I also sprinkled a Tblsppon of sugar and cinnamon on the apples after I chopped them for even more flavor.  I also added in walnuts with the apples.  I got RAVE REVIEWS!!!!!

Great recipe. Nice and moist but I did increase the apples.  Also added an extra tsp of cinnamon because I love it! We will make these again.

Nice, strong apple flavor, especially since the sliced apple bits melt into a tasty goo. I added 2 cups of apples instead of one, and I sprinkled almost 1/4 of brown sugar, four teaspoons white sugar, and a dash of cinnamon on top. It made a nice crusty top. I had one problem with this though, once cooked, they can out sort of limp. But that probably was because i forgot to grease the pan! (hey im learning!) i enjoyed this recipe, and so did my mother and my boyfriend. Four stars :)

So pleased!  I rarely make a good moist muffin and these were tasty.  They were so easy to make even my 2 year old enjoyed helping (and eating)! I did add vanilla and brown sugar crumbs on the top. Next time I would add more apples and try apple sauce instead of oil.

I would probably rate these a three and a half. I was really excited about making these until I tasted them. Even though it took me only about 5 min. to mix, the end result wasn't very good. I doubled the amount of apples and cinnamon, which helped, but probably will double or triple the sugar next time! I'll most likely use a different recipe next time. I sprinkled the tops with brown sugar, which was good, but then the bottom lacked flavor. I will say this though - they're good IF you don't like sugar!

These are very tasty and very easy to make.  I ended up adding a bit more apple juice than was called for as the dry ingredients didn't mix well and it still turned out well.  I doubled the apples and doubled the cinnamon.  I also used baking soda and cream of tartar instead of baking powder (because I didn't have any on hand or at least so I thought until I found some putting everything back in my pantry) and it still turned out fabulously.

Will definitely make these again!

These are awesome! I did follow the others suggestions to double the cinnamon and I almost tripled the apples.  I also had to add a little extra apple juice because it was a little dry before I added the apples.  I added a topping made of brown sugar and cinnamon.  They are yummy, moist and just perfect...not to mention they aren't so bad for ya.  I will be making them often!

I yielded 23 "mini" muffins because I was afraid of overflows on the pan. turns out it didn't rise well, and I ended up with small cakes that looked like scones.

i doubled the apples and cinnamon, and added the cinnamon-brown sugar topping as someone suggested.

it turned out great. I realized the size I made was suitable for an afternoon coffee break. :)

Great delicious muffins. Very moist and light. I wonder why should we use 3 tp of baking powder. Can we decrease a little bit the quantity?
